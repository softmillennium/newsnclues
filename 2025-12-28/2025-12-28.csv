            Clashes broke out on Syria's coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counterdemonstrators on Sunday, killing at least three people and injuring dozens of others, health officials said.
    


            The clashes came two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers.
    


            Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere. Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven't publicly identified a suspect yet in Friday's bombing. Funerals for the dead were held on Saturday.
    


            A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.
    


            Sunday's demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora.
    


            An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side. Security forces tried to break up the two sides and fired into the air in an attempt to disperse them. Demonstrators were injured in the scuffles, but it wasn't immediately clear how many.
    


            Syria's state-run television reported that two members of the security forces were wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station, and cars belonging to security forces were set on fire in Latakia.
    


            Later, state-run news agency SANA reported that a member of the security forces was killed by gunfire. Local health officials said that three people were killed and 60 others wounded.
    


            The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia.
    


            In March, an ambush carried out by Assad's supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad's fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges.
    


            During the rein of the Assad dynasty, Alawites were overrepresented in government jobs and in the army and security forces.
    


            Government officials condemned Friday's attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but haven't yet announced any arrests.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","My miscarriage was an isolating experience until I saw I didn't have to go through it alone","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/28/health/miscarriage-essay-wellness","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:00:58 GMT","


            There is no way to prepare.
    


            For nearly two years, I couldn't go inside one room in my house. If you had come over and cracked the door, you'd be met with stale air, a changing table and a tiny, crib-size mattress still ensconced in its brown cardboard shipping package.
    


            I was 18 weeks' pregnant nearly four years ago when I learned of my miscarriage during a routine ultrasound. I saw the image of my baby boy on the screen floating inside me, with no telltale flicker of a heartbeat.
    


            As soon as I got home from the doctor's office, still numb with shock, I gathered up the parenting books strewn about the house. I fished the handful of gifted onesies and baby blankets from their places nestled in colorful tissue paper and celebratory gift bags. I retrieved the sonogram images of my baby from my top dresser drawer.
    


            I shoved all that evidence of our baby and the life we were planning into one of those gift bags, before my brain had time to fully register the pain radiating through my body. I knew I had to do this while I was still in a state of disbelief, before the wave of grief drowned me.
    


            I pushed past the feeling that my body was collapsing, sweeping up all these items and depositing them into the would-be nursery, alongside the changing table and crib mattress. I closed the door and didn't go back in that room for months.
    


Being pregnant is hard work — even metabolically, study shows



            Between 10% and 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage, but the vast majority — 80%, according to the Cleveland Clinic — occur in the first 13 weeks. After we made it past the first trimester mark, I thought I had nothing to worry about. But my baby died anyway.
    


            I learned of the miscarriage in the morning. By that afternoon, I was scheduled for surgery to remove the fetal tissue the next day. It was too much — the shock of the loss, the immediate surgery. I felt I didn't have time to process any of the information. Tomorrow? But I just lost my baby today.
    


            I knew he was gone, but I still wanted more time with him. I felt so deeply connected to the tiny body growing within me. Not having him as a part of me anymore felt unfathomable. I cried, not speaking, for 45 minutes after scheduling the surgery. My husband held my hand and cried, too. He also had nothing to say.
    


            As I got into bed that night, an overwhelming sense of dread gripped me. I had the realization that my dead child was inside of me. I didn't sleep that night, not at all. I lay in bed, staring at the clock, waiting for the morning to come.
    


1 in 10 women will have a miscarriage. They shouldn't be told to ‘just try again,' new research says



            I can't remember much about that winter.
    


            I do know there were many days when it felt impossible to get out of bed. But I did, often getting dressed and putting on makeup, hoping that would make me feel some sense of normalcy. Many days, I crawled back in bed in the afternoon. Every pillowcase I had at the time was streaked with mascara stains from my tears that winter. It took months to get the stains out.
    


            Part of my pain came from the blame around pregnancy loss.
    


            Although 15% of respondents in one 2015 study reported that “they or their partner suffered at least one miscarriage,” most of those surveyed said they thought miscarriage happened in just 5% or fewer pregnancies.
    


            Not only did respondents underestimate the frequency of miscarriage — 22% blamed the mother for the loss. “Commonly believed causes of miscarriage included a stressful event (76%), lifting a heavy object (64%), previous use of an intrauterine device (28%), or oral contraceptives (22%),” according to the study.
    


            It's no surprise that I felt guilty, a feeling widely shared by loss parents. My job as a mom was to keep my child safe. How had I failed so miserably so early? And that perception that it was my fault made it worse.
    


            I also questioned the validity of my own pain. Without the physical evidence of a living, breathing baby to lose, many well-meaning people who had not experienced loss brushed off the impact of miscarriage with comments such as “you can try again” or “trying is the fun part” or the cliché “everything happens for a reason.”
    


What to say to women going through miscarriage and baby loss



            Yet studies have found more than half of women report exhibiting symptoms of depression following a miscarriage. I found myself falling into that category but felt at times that my grief was unearned, leading to feelings of shame and isolation.
    


            After a couple of weeks, all I could think about was getting pregnant again. My body was still healing, but I was anxious for it to hurry up. I began going on daily walks, envisioning myself sitting in the nursery, rocking a baby in my arms. Surely those who espouse the benefits of manifesting had to be onto something.
    


            Sure enough, the first month we were cleared to try again, the pregnancy test turned positive. That pregnancy lasted just five weeks. Within a week of the positive test, I was bleeding, and with the blood went the first ounce of hope and happiness I had felt in months. As someone who always looks for the silver lining, it was an especially trying time. I often had trouble believing one existed.
    


How men hurt and grieve over miscarriage, too



            But if there was a silver lining to be found, it was the support my husband and I eventually discovered. The pregnancy loss community is a hellish club to join, but the most loving and supportive group I have ever been a part of.
    


            Once people learned of my miscarriage, I began hearing from family members, friends and even acquaintances who had had miscarriages I had never known about. I had tearful conversations with so many women about miscarriage and pregnancy loss and infertility that, while heartbreaking, filled me up and gave me the fuel to keep going. I had close friends who had been through it before guiding me through the darkness.
    


            I am forever grateful for these women, the love they showed me and the strength they displayed, convincing me I could find my strength, too. That's the only reason I'm writing this for you now, really. Because if one person can feel seen, if one person can feel validated in their experience, it is worth it. Pregnancy loss is an isolating experience, but for better or worse, none of us have to go through it alone.
    


            My husband and I were lucky. I ended up undergoing in vitro fertilization, or IVF, in December, and it worked in April of the following year. The pregnancy was safe and healthy, and I now have a toddler I love more than I ever thought possible. But when I was pregnant with him, I was terrified I would lose him the entire nine months.
    


A couple tried for 18 years to get pregnant. AI made it happen



            But while we're playing on the playground or reading stories before bedtime, the pain of losing my first baby never goes away. I still miss the son I never got to meet out in the world. I still think about him every day.
    


            I recently found a miscarriage journal I bought shortly after the loss. One prompt suggested writing a letter to your child. In part, I had written, “I'm so sorry I couldn't keep you safe. I'm sorry I didn't get to be your mom.”
    


            So how can anyone deal with pregnancy loss? For me, what happened became part of me. Uncertainty became part of me. With the support of my loved ones and this new community, I learned to find grace there, and maybe an unsettled peace. Sometimes it's hard to breathe, but I did, and I do.
    


            I think I found a secret reserve of strength my body's been saving or borrowed some from another loss mama who has been there before. But on we go, with tears and love for my first and second sons, and all the silver linings I can find.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","It's time for Republicans to start thinking about 2028 and the post-Trump era","https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/28/politics/2028-presidential-election-republicans-vance-rubio-analysis","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:00:59 GMT","


            The next presidential election is several eternities away from now in terms of politics. Only a fool would try to predict the form of the political conversation in three years, much less a few months in the unpredictable Trump era.
    


            But we do know the next election will offer Americans new choices on the right and the left. There won't be a Trump, a Clinton or a Bush anywhere near the ballot.
    


            About half of Americans said in a new CNN Poll that the 2028 presidential election has been on their mind at least somewhat. At Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest conference in Arizona last weekend, the conservative group's leader Erika Kirk all but endorsed Vice President JD Vance, even though he has not launched a campaign.
    


            Assuming he does run, Vance will have to hold together President Donald Trump's fragile voter coalition — cracks were on display at Turning Point — and fend off other Republicans who want their shot at the White House.
    


            I talked to CNN's Eric Bradner, who covers Republicans, about the current state of play, who we expect to launch a 2020 presidential campaign and where the party will head in the looming post Trump era.
    


            Our conversation, conducted by phone and edited for clarity, is below.
    


            And for a look at the Democratic field, check out this conversation with CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere.
    


WOLF: Democrats will have a wide-open field with no clear leader in 2028. What will Republicans have?



BRADNER: Republicans have a sitting vice president in JD Vance, and in recent months, it has become increasingly clear that he holds the 2028 starting gun in his hand. He has said he doesn't plan to do anything until after the midterm elections next year, and then he plans to sit down with President Trump and talk about 2028. So the timeline for Vance to become an active candidate, if that's what he chooses to do — and I think just about everyone expects that he will — is probably at least a year away. But it seems increasingly clear that a lot of Republicans are going to be waiting on him, and some big names are going to defer to him.
    


WOLF: Trump likes to make jokes about Vance and Rubio running together. Vance made a joke recently about the idea that Rubio could run. Could two Trump officials challenge each other or come out with a unified ticket? 



BRADNER: I'm not sure President Trump is actually joking. One of the many newsy tidbits in the Vanity Fair profile of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles was Marco Rubio saying that if JD Vance runs for president, Vance will be the Republican nominee, and he will support him.
    


            Rubio is obviously someone who is in President Trump's good graces; who has run for president before, knows how to do it, and would be a viable candidate in any race he entered. But he does not seem to have an appetite to take on JD Vance, at least at this early stage of the Trump presidency.
    


            Now, Vance is the vice president. He is attached to President Trump for all four years. Marco Rubio, like many Cabinet officials, could leave at some point. He could leave after the midterms. But as of right now, President Trump keeps floating this idea of a joint Vance-Rubio ticket, and Rubio says he's not going to take on Vance. It certainly shouldn't be ignored when two of the key players in all of this don't seem to be pouring any cold water on it.
    


            It's worth remembering, Marco Rubio — despite running for president more than eight years ago — is still only 54 years old. He could be a vice presidential nominee and still run for president again one day.
    


WOLF: Vance is ascendant in taking up Trump's mantle. It's actually pretty rare for a vice president to be elected president straight out of the vice presidency. The last person to do it was George H.W. Bush. Before that, you have to go back more than 100 years. It's almost a curse. How would Vance deal with it?



BRADNER: It's tricky, because Vance would have to own everything the Trump administration does. There's no way for him to separate himself from it, unlike some other names who could be 2028 contenders.
    


            For example, (Texas Sen.) Ted Cruz on Capitol Hill this week went hard after Trump's TV regulator. (Gov.) Ron DeSantis in Florida is saying that state has the right to move forward on artificial intelligence regulations, despite President Trump wanting to institute a single national policy. Other Republicans in other positions have the ability to break with the president and get some separation on unpopular policies or policies where they see the political ground shifting.
    


            JD Vance isn't going to have that ability. When Vance becomes a candidate, there will probably be conversations between him and the president over whether and how he can split with President Trump on some issues without incurring the president's wrath.
    


WOLF: It might behoove Vance to distance himself from Trump on some things, but that's almost impossible to do and stay inside of Trump's inner circle, where everything is about Trump.



BRADNER: He might need to look for ways to demonstrate that he is his own man, a different kind of political figure than Trump, without necessarily disagreeing with the president publicly on policy issues.
    


WOLF: Vance is someone whose politics and allegiances have shifted multiple times in his relatively short political career. So you could see him evolving pretty easily yet again.



BRADNER: When he ran for Senate, he very quickly rejected a number of positions he'd taken in the past, and that's a history that Republican rivals in that Senate primary certainly used against him, and I would not be surprised to see revisited ahead of 2028.
    


WOLF: Let's talk a little bit about some of the Republicans that are that are showing some of their independence. You mentioned DeSantis and Ted Cruz. There was an interesting story about the White House being a little frustrated about an anti-abortion group backed by Sen. Josh Hawley (Missouri). Who do you think Republicans view as the most likely non-White-House Republican that could make a run against somebody like Vance?



BRADNER: Having run for president before would be an advantage for some potential candidates, like Ron DeSantis and Ted Cruz, not just because they have already made their introductions in the early states, but because they've had to figure out answers to some of these questions. DeSantis is interesting; 2024 was a colossal failure for him. He probably got into the race too late, burned a ton of money and didn't have much to show for it at the end of that race. But he has not clashed publicly with President Trump in the same way that some of these other figures on Capitol Hill, like Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and (Kentucky Sen.) Rand Paul have. DeSantis also has a chance to deliver a big win for Republicans in the spring if Florida joins the nationwide redistricting arms race.
    


WOLF: You said it can be a benefit to have run before. I've always thought it must be a net negative to appear like you're a loser. Do you need a trial run to get good as a candidate?



BRADNER: There's been a split between the parties on this. With 2020 as an obvious exception, Democrats have tended to favor a fresh face, and Republicans have nominated people who have run before and failed. Ronald Reagan is a great example of this. George H.W. Bush is a great example of it.
    


WOLF: Donald Trump, arguably, who won, lost and then won again.



BRADNER: Throughout modern American history, I think you'll find Republicans much more willing to seriously consider and nominate someone who has run before and failed.
    


WOLF: People have talked about Hawley as a potential presidential candidate for his entire career. Does he seem to be somebody that is destined to run for president?



BRADNER: There's been an expectation around him essentially since he was elected to the Senate, that one day he will run for higher office. The anti-abortion-rights group that he started is obviously frustrating the White House. They view this issue as a drag on Republicans in the midterms, whereas Hawley views it as a foundational position for the party, and it's also one that is his position. Hawley's position is extremely popular with Christian conservatives in Iowa, for example, a state that has long been the first to weigh in in the presidential nominating process. Whether he's doing this with an eye on 2028 specifically or is just keeping his options open, it's tough to tell at this point.
    


WOLF: You mentioned Rand Paul. His father ran a couple of times as a Republican and a libertarian. Paul is out of the Republican mainstream, but an interesting political character because he's so true to his ideology. What would be the path for somebody like that? Would a Rand Paul presidential campaign just be to drag the party toward the libertarian cause, or would it be a serious campaign? 



BRADNER: He would like it to be a serious campaign. What's worth keeping in mind about Rand Paul is that he was one of the earliest and most vocal Republican critics of President Trump on tariffs and on the spending levels in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. The state of the economy would be key to his chances of getting much of a hearing from Republican voters.
    


            Right now, the political environment is such that a lot of Republicans, including early-state voters I've talked to, are turned off by seeing him criticizing the president on some of these issues. However, three years is an eternity. Two years is an eternity in politics, and by the time the 2028 race is really shaping up and people are preparing to head to the polls, the state of the economy could be much different.
    


            Republicans could go conservative or MAGA; nobody is talking about moderates
    


WOLF: Democrats have this debate over whether the party is going to go in a progressive or a moderate direction. You don't really hear that among Republicans whether it's going to go in a conservative or moderate direction. It seems like it's just going to go in a in a conservative or a MAGA direction. Are there any moderate Republicans who could run for president?



BRADNER: A lot of these differences are being kept in-house, in part because the party is in power, and a lot of 2028 potential contenders are in the Trump administration. But in terms of moderates, I think it'll be interesting to see how some Trump loyalists position themselves.
    


            There are also some people on the periphery of 2028 who could be interesting factors. For example, (Georgia Rep.) Marjorie Taylor Greene is not someone anyone would ever describe as moderate, but she has had an enormous falling-out with President Trump, and has taken a moderate position on health care spending, at least.
    


            Nikki Haley is still involved in politics. She's working at the Hudson Institute, occasionally publishing commentary on foreign policy, national security, antisemitism. She's still active on social media. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is someone who has obviously run for president as an independent before. His wife recently told NewsNation that he won't run in 2028, but he is an interesting person to watch. he No. 1 predictor that someone is going to run for president is that they have run for president before, and that he has.
    


            So I don't know that there will be a moderate versus conservative framework to the 2028 election. I think it could be more about emphasis and personalities. Ted Cruz, for example, is very conservative, but he has been jabbing at Tucker Carlson, who's certainly a JD Vance ally. Those kinds of divides over personality, over issues of importance … could be where we see bigger and more public divides early on, at least.
    


WOLF: That list of people you went through is a remarkably loose political coalition. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has his MAHA movement. Marjorie Taylor Greene has been a conspiracy theorist and is flirting with being a more mainstream person. There's Rand Paul, who is all but libertarian. There's Josh Hawley, who's this kind of evolving plains populist. I feel like Republicans used to stand for limited government and lower spending, but the breadth of ideas in that list is vast. What is the next Republican ideology?



BRADNER: Republicans are going to have to decide what kind of party they want to be once President Trump is no longer the dominant figure within it. I'm not sure how much they're going to be able to sort that out in 2028 because he will loom large as the sitting president and the Republican with the biggest megaphone in the country. But it's the right question to ask, and it's going to be one that Republicans are sorting through over these next few years.
    


            There was a party before Trump, and there's the modern Republican Party in which Trump has thrown off so many of these dogmas that what we traditionally thought the Republican Party had. What it looks like moving forward is a huge unanswered question.
    


WOLF: What are the signs you're looking for from potential candidates?



BRADNER: The first thing I'm going to be watching is when some of these cabinet officials depart the Trump administration. Most of the time, in most administrations, there is a shake up after the midterms that could potentially free some of them to work toward their own political ambitions. Book deals are always worth watching when they're announced, because most politicians don't just write a book for no reason. And then I think political moves that are designed to allow potential presidential candidates to stake out some of their own ground, the way (California Gov.) Gavin Newsom did among Democrats on redistricting, right? It's much easier for Democrats to do that right now, but I do think that some Republicans will be looking for their own ways to establish territory they can claim as their own. That's why I think DeSantis is worth watching on redistricting; Ted Cruz on issues like free speech and taking on Tucker Carlson.
    


WOLF: Trump is so unique because he has this committed following of supporters. I can't think of a Democrat or a Republican — maybe RFK Jr.? — that has any kind of committed following, people who like them and are committed specifically to them? Am I missing something?



BRADNER: What makes this 2028 race so fascinating is that it's wide open, right? There seem to be plenty of Republicans who assume that JD Vance will inherit the MAGA movement. Erica Kirk essentially endorsed Vance, which could clearly be a sign of the role Turning Point USA, an important advocacy group, could play. But other than RFK Jr., who built that movement running as an independent, no one really brings that kind of devoted following to the table. That's why any polls that you see right now … are of extremely limited value, because whether anyone can build that kind of movement and the issues that would allow them to put it together or maybe be seen.

The chipmaker's sprawling partnerships are driving extraordinary growth but also bank its future on the AI boom paying off quickly

Nvidia is, in crucial ways, nothing like Enron – the Houston energy giant that imploded through multibillion-dollar accounting fraud in 2001. Nor is it similar to companies such as Lucent or Worldcom that folded during the dotcom bubble.

But the fact that it needs to reiterate this to its investors is less than ideal.

Now worth more than $4tn (£3tn), Nvidia makes the specialised technology that powers the world's AI surge: silicon chips and software packages that train and host systems such as ChatGPT. Its products fill datacentres from Norway to New Jersey.

This year has been an exceptional one for the company: it has struck at least $125bn in deals, ranging from a $5bn investment into Intel – to facilitate its access to the PC market – to $100bn invested in OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT.

But even as those deals have fuelled surging stock prices and paved the way for chief executive Jensen Huang's energetic world tour, doubts have emerged about how Nvidia does business, especially as it has become increasingly central to the health of the global economy.

The start of these concerns has been the circular nature of many of its deals. These arrangements resemble vendor financing: Nvidia lending money to customers so they can buy its products.

The largest of these is its deal with OpenAI, which involves Nvidia investing $10bn into the company each year for the next 10 years – most of which will go to buying Nvidia's chips. Another is its arrangement with CoreWeave, a company that provides on-demand computing capacity to big AI firms, essentially leasing out Nvidia's chips.

The circularity of these deals has drawn comparisons with Lucent Technologies, a telecoms company that also aggressively lent money to its customers, only to overextend itself and unravel in the early 2000s. Nvidia has aggressively rebutted suggestions of any similarity, saying in a leaked recent memo that it “does not rely on vendor financing arrangements to grow revenue”.

James Anderson, a renowned tech investor, describes himself as a “huge admirer” of Nvidia, but said this year that the OpenAI deal presented “more reason to be concerned there than before”.

He added: “I have to say the words ‘vendor financing' do not carry nice reflections to somebody of my age. It's not quite like what many of the telecom suppliers were up to in 1999-2000, but it has certain rhymes to it. I don't think it makes me feel entirely comfortable from that point of view.”

Other high-profile recent deals include the tech firm Oracle spending $300bn on datacentres for OpenAI in the US – with the ChatGPT developer then paying back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres. In October, OpenAI and the chipmaker AMD signed a multibillion-dollar chip deal that also gave OpenAI the option to buy a stake in the Nvidia rival.

There is also a deal with CoreWeave where, along with a commitment to buying $22bn of data centre capacity from the cloud provider, OpenAI is receiving $350m in CoreWeave stock. Asked this month about circularity in the AI industry, the chief executive of CoreWeave, Michael Intrator, said: “Companies are trying to address a violent change in supply and demand. You do that by working together.”

All these moves form part of OpenAI's $1.4tn bet on computing capacity to build and operate models that, it argues, will transform economies – and make back that expenditure. OpenAI argues that, while the Nvidia and AMD deals have an investment component, it only kicks in once the chips have been bought and deployed, while the investments themselves create aligned incentives to build out AI infrastructure at huge scale.

Nvidia has also used structures called special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in financing deals. The best-known example is the SPV linked to Elon Musk's xAI: an entity into which Nvidia invested $2bn, money that will be used to buy Nvidia's chips.

This drew comparisons with Enron, which used SPVs to keep debts and toxic assets off its balance sheets, convincing investors and creditors that it was stable while concealing ballooning liabilities.

Nvidia has also strongly denied that it is like Enron: in the same leaked memo where it discussed Lucent, it said its reporting was “complete and transparent” and “unlike Enron” it “does not use special-purpose entities to hide debt and inflate revenue”.

The journalist Ed Zitron, a noted sceptic of the AI boom, agrees that Nvidia is not like either company. Unlike Lucent, it does not appear to be taking on a great deal of debt to finance its circular deals, he says, and most of the customers it is supporting are not as obviously risky as Lucent's dotcom bubble partners. And it isn't like Enron, Zitron argues, because it's being fairly transparent about its own complex, off-balance sheet deals.

So what could warrant a comparison? Nvidia “is not hiding debt, but it is leaning heavily on vendor-financed demand, which creates exposure if AI growth slows,” says Charlie Dai, an analyst at the research firm Forrester. “The concern is about sustainability, not legality.”

Essentially, whether Nvidia is able to stick the landing depends on whether AI really takes off, generating billions for its corporate users and putting companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and CoreWeave – Nvidia's customers – firmly in the black, and able to keep buying its systems. That possibility alone is debatable. If this does not happen, says Dai, Nvidia “could face write-downs on equity stakes and unpaid receivables”: meaning, it could lose a lot of money and its stock price could then tank.

Approached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson referred the Guardian to remarks its chief financial officer, Colette Kress, made to investors in early December. Kress said they were not seeing an AI bubble, instead gesturing at trillions of dollars of business that lie ahead for Nvidia in the next decade.

In particular, Kress argued that Nvidia's recent – massive – deals are just the start for the company, and the real money will be made in the coming years, largely through replacing almost all the chips in existing datacentres with its products.

There is another complexity, which is that Nvidia's health – and therefore the health of the entire global economy – also depends on whether AI takes off in time for Nvidia and its customers to service the debt from their huge datacentre buildouts and significant capital expenditures.

Add to this a final category of concern: recent, big-ticket deals with countries such as South Korea and Saudi Arabia, worth multiple billions of dollars, whose terms are opaque. In October, Nvidia said that it would supply 260,000 of its Blackwell chips to South Korea's government and South Korean companies. The value of this deal was not disclosed, but is estimated to be in the billions.

Likewise with Saudi Arabia. Its government-owned AI startup, Humain, has committed to deploying up to 600,000 Nvidia chips: when that deployment will involve actual purchases, and at what price, is again undisclosed. Nvidia has a number of other strategic partnerships like this – with Italy, with the French AI champion Mistral and with Deutsche Telekom, for example – all involving thousands of chips and unknown sums.

Governments are likely to pay. There's nothing circular about a sovereign partnership with Germany. But the deals mean more – quite large – uncertainties nested within a straining web of commitments that require massive capital outlay, and rely on ambitious assumptions about the economy undergoing a revolution in the next years.

“They concentrate risk in a few big customers,” says Dai. “If execution delays occur, Nvidia's revenue recognition and cashflow could be affected.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

UKHSA warns vulnerable and elderly people may be at risk with temperatures to drop severely overnight

Amber cold health alerts have been issued for northern England, with low temperatures predicted to cause a “rise in deaths” among vulnerable and elderly people.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued two amber warnings for north-east and north-west England, which will be in place between 8pm on Sunday until midday on Monday 5 January.

The agency warned that expected low temperatures would probably result in the increased use of healthcare services by vulnerable people and could lead to a rise in the number of deaths, particularly among those aged 65 and over or those with pre-existing health conditions, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Vulnerable younger people and those sleeping rough may also be affected.

Temperatures inside buildings such as hospitals, care homes and clinics are predicted to drop and it will be challenging for people to keep indoor temperatures at the recommended level of 18C, leading to more risk to vulnerable individuals, the agency warned.

All other regions in England will be under a less serious yellow alert for this period, indicating that there is still potential for a significant impact on the health services in these regions.

The agency also warned of staffing issues owing to external factors such as travel delays and said infrastructure sectors, such as transport and energy, could be affected.

The Met Office forecast that most of England will be cloudy overnight, and there will be patches of frost and fog also, bringing “tricky travelling conditions” on Monday morning.

Temperatures are expected to fall to as low as -1C overnight in Penrith and hover around 0C in areas of the Lake District where the amber cold health alert is in place, while temperatures in northern areas of Scotland will fall further, to -6C or -7C.

There will be a “brisk northerly breeze” along the north-east coast of England.

Dr Agostinho Sousa, the head of extreme events and health protection at UKHSA, recommended checking on friends, family and neighbours as cold weather sets in.

“The forecasted temperatures can have a serious impact on the health of some people, leading to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections, particularly for individuals over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Magnus Carlsen pushed away a camera after losing to Vladislav Artemiev at the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Qatar, the latest example of the former world champion letting his vexation boil over.

Carlsen, world champion between 2013 and 2023, had a frustrating second day at the championships in Doha on Saturday, splitting a point with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave before he was beaten by Artemiev.

When a photographer followed as Carlsen stormed out of the venue, the Norwegian pushed away the camera.

Carlsen attracted attention for slamming his fist on the table after losing to world champion Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess tournament this year.

Last year, he briefly quit the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York when governing body FIDE barred him from a round for wearing jeans.

FIDE does not plan any action against Carlsen for Saturday's outburst, but would review the incident if a complaint is launched, CEO Emil Sutovsky said.

Despite his defeat, Carlsen is still in contention for the title at the championships and sits in joint second with seven points alongside Alexey Sarana, Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus and Nodirbek Abdusattorov.

Artemiev and Hans Niemann share the lead in the open category on 7.5.

Neres opened the scoring with a stunning strike from distance six minutes before halftime and found the net again in the 57th minute when Bologna were caught trying to play out of defense.
“We came here as champions of Italy, we wanted this trophy and we showed it with a great performance,” Napoli forward Matteo Politano told Mediaset. “We could have scored a few more goals, but

Weaver entered the game after Micah Alejado took a hard hit on the previous play. With the Rainbow Warriors (9-4) in range for a tying field goal, coach Timmy Chang took a shot at the end zone, and Cenacle got between two defensive backs and made the contested catch.
“How amazing is that?” Chang said. “It's a program that is built

Israeli forces on Saturday imposed a lockdown on a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank, their second day of operations there after a local resident killed two people in Israel. 

“The IDF [Israeli Defense Force] is operating forcefully against terror hubs in the village of Qabatiya... accompanied by a lockdown and a complete cordon around the locality,” Israeli Minister of Defense said in a statement published by his office on Saturday. 

“We will continue to pursue an uncompromising offensive policy against Palestinian terror,” he added.

Bilal Hunaisha, a resident of Qabatiya, south of Jenin in the northern West Bank, said the town “is being subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli occupation.” 

“As you can see, they blocked the way to my house and I am no longer able to move around,” he told said, pointing to a pile of rubble obstructing the road. 

In the attack on Friday a 34-year-old Palestinian man killed two people in northern Israel. 

The assailant, who had been working illegally in Israel, had used his employer's vehicle to ram into a 68-year-old man and then stabbed an 18-year-old girl to death, Israeli police said. 

A few hours later, the Israeli army and the Shin Bet domestic security agency began operating in Qabatiya. 

They searched the perpetrator's house and questioned suspects, the Israeli army said. 

On Saturday, Israeli Chief of the General Staff Eyal Zamir ordered the reinforcement of troops deployed in the area. 

“This period is characterized by lone attackers and individuals staying illegally in [Israel]. Enforcement against those who transport and employ them must be strengthened and improved,” he said. “At the same time, we must continue to enhance our capabilities to identify and thwart these attackers.” 

Qabatiya resident Muhannad Zakarneh said that the Israeli army arrested him at home at 6am “for no obvious reasons” and kept him handcuffed for hours. 

“When I asked what my charge was, there was no response,” he said. 

The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that besides blocking entrances, and conducting interrogations and home searches, Israeli forces also took over a school and used it as a “detention and interrogation center.” 

Since the start of the war in Gaza following Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023, at least 38 people, including two foreigners, have been killed inside Israel in attacks by Palestinians, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) tally based on official Israeli figures. 

During the same period, violence has also surged in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including many militants as well as dozens of civilians, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry. 

According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period in the West Bank.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with confirmation from the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces.

Ukrainian drones attacked the Syzran Oil Refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a number of Russian military facilities in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine overnight on Dec. 28, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said.

""Strikes from attack UAVs have been recorded hitting the territory of the plant, followed by a fire,"" the report on Telegram states.

The refinery was attacked multiple times in the night, the Exilenova-Plus Telegram channel reported, citing video footage from local residents. Locals posted videos of fire trucks heading to the refinery after explosions. 

The strike may have hit the Syzran Oil Refinery's ELOU-AVT-5 installation, a primary oil processing facility at the plant. An electrical substation in Syzran was also reportedly targeted overnight. Residents reported blackouts in the city after the drone attack, with one video purporting to show a direct hit on the substation.

Multiple explosions were heard in Syzran during the night and air defenses were active in the area, the Russian Telegram channel Shot reported. The Russian Defense Ministry later reported that 12 Ukrainian drones were shot down over Samara Oblast overnight. 

Moreover, the Ukrainian military successfully struck a storage and maintenance facility for uncrewed boats in the area of Chornomorske in Russian-occupied Crimea, a repair unit from the 1435th Motor Rifle Regiment near the settlement of Antratsyt in Luhansk Oblast, a pontoon crossing near Nikonorivka, and a storage facility for Shahed-type UAVs in Makiivka, Donetsk Oblast.

""Additionally, the results of the recent strike on the Lukoil-Volgogradneftepererabotka oil products refinery in Volgograd Oblast, Russia, have been confirmed — a pipeline and an oil production unit for manufacturing lubricants were damaged,"" the General Staff added, presumably referring to the recent strike by Ukrainian drones on Dec. 26.

The Syzran Oil Refinery lies around 700 kilometers (430 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border. Opened in 1942, the facility belongs to the Russian state oil giant Rosneft and has an annual processing capacity of 7 to 8.9 million tons of oil.

The refinery has been targeted in previous drone attacks as part of Ukraine's campaign against the Russian oil industry, which provides funding and fuel for Moscow's war effort. A recent attack reportedly forced the refinery to halt operations on Dec. 5, according to Reuters.

Ukraine's military confirmed the Dec. 5 strike, saying it carried out the operation to ""reduce the military and economic potential of the Russian aggressor.""

Kyiv has also carried out strikes against electrical substations and other infrastructure facilities in Russia and Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. The attacks come as Moscow attempts to cripple Ukraine's energy and heating systems in the fourth winter of the full-scale invasion.

 In this year-end wrap-up of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur looks back at the moments that defined 2025, the fourth year of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine — from stalled peace efforts and escalating Russian attacks to mass anti-corruption protests and political upheaval at home.

The refinery was attacked multiple times in the night, residents claimed. An electrical substation in Syzran was also hit, causing blackouts in the city. 

Ukrainian and Russian troops have been publishing conflicting claims and videos about who controls the front-line town of Myrnohrad, located just northeast of the embattled town of Pokrovsk.

A source close to the Ukrainian delegation told the Kyiv Independent that they don't know how the meeting will unfold and are ready for ""all scenarios.""

Russia has lost around 1,204,510 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Dec. 28.

Without security guarantees, Ukraine cannot take any steps towards peace or hold presidential elections, which Trump's administration has pressured Zelensky to implement.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional details. 

Ukraine's future hinges on Western security guarantees, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Dec. 27 as he was en route to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida to discuss a peace proposal. 

Security guarantees for Ukraine will be at the forefront of these talks, Zelensky said. Without them, Ukraine cannot take any steps towards peace or hold presidential elections, which Trump's administration has pressured Zelensky to implement. ""If the American side raises the issue of a referendum or elections, this absolutely cannot take place under the conditions in which we are living today — particularly regarding air attacks,"" Zelensky said, adding that he is ""politically ready"" for elections. 

""I'm not clinging to my chair,"" Zelensky said, answering journalists' questions through a WhatsApp group managed by his press service. Before meeting Trump on Dec. 28, Zelensky had a stopover in Canada to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and hold an online meeting with European and NATO leaders. Zelensky will present allies with his 20-point peace proposal, a revised version of a 28-point plan drafted in November by Trump's negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. 

Zelensky and Carney held bilateral talks, and Canada pledged an additional $1.8 billion in economic aid to Ukraine. European leaders also said after the conference called that they shared Zelensky's view on the importance of security guarantees. 

""All participants in the discussions ... agreed that security guarantees for Ukraine are crucial,"" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on social media after the call. ""These guarantees must be concrete and reliable. Such guarantees would also mean a safer Poland.""

European leaders will resume talks following the meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Tusk added.

The meeting with Trump will take place at his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago, at 1 p.m. EST, or 8 p.m. Kyiv time, on Dec. 28. Zelensky will be joined by Ukraine's secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, Rustem Umerov, Economy Minister Oleksii Sobolev,  chief of Ukraine's General Staff Andrii Hnatov, Non-Staff Advisor to the Head of the Presidential Office Oleksandr Bevz, and First Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya.

""The most important thing — if we take any steps — is that security guarantees must be strong and that we are protected,"" Zelensky said.His comments come right after another mass attack Russia launched at Ukraine on the morning of Dec. 27. The 10-hour-long attack primarily targeted Kyiv, injuring dozens and killing at least one person in the capital.Zelensky said that progress has been made between Kyiv and Washington, with the U.S. side open to discussing security guarantees. Now, both Witkoff and Kushner better understand Ukraine's situation following meetings with the Kyiv delegation, he added. But the final trigger remains with Trump, and Zelensky said it's still not clear what the American leader is prepared to give Ukraine. Zelensky noted that while Kyiv's relationship with Trump's administration has improved,  Washington's relationship with Moscow is ""complicated.""Trump recently told the New York Post that he thinks there's a good shot at reaching peace, saying he believes Russia wants to come to an agreement. But Moscow has shown little indication that it's ready to come to the table. ""We want sustainable peace. One that is safe for the entire world. If someone — the United States or Europe — is on Russia's side, that means the war will continue,"" Zelensky said.

Crucial power line repairs have begun near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant following a localalized ceasefire to allow technicians to carry out repairs, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Dec. 28.

In a statement posted on X, the agency said that during the IAEA-brokered ceasefire, repairs to the power transmission lines between the switchyards of ZNPP and the Zaporizhzhia Thermal Power Plant are being carried out under the supervision of the IAEA team and are expected to last several days.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi thanked both sides for agreeing to this new temporary “window of silence,” which is “part of ongoing efforts to prevent a nuclear accident during military conflict.”

The Zaporizhzhia plant is Europe's largest nuclear power plant. It hasn't been producing electricity for over three years since Russian troops occupied it in March 2022.

The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

Who controls the plant, remains a key sticking point of the ongoing peace negotations between Ukraine and the U.S.

Located in the occupied city of Enerhodar, the plant produced around 20% of Ukraine's electricity before Russia launched its full-scale invasion.

Under the U.S.-backed framework, the plant would be operated jointly by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, with all three parties sharing economic benefits.

Ukraine fears that a trilateral management model would effectively legitimize Russia's occupation of the facility.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to hammer out a plan ​to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and ‍provocations from Russian air attacks.

Trump ‍said ​on Sunday he ⁠had “a good and very productive” ‌phone call ‍with ‍Russian President ‌Vladimir ⁠Putin ​before his meeting Zelensky in Florida later ⁠in the ⁠day. Trump did not provide details about what was discussed. The Kremlin confirmed the call took place, according to the Interfax news agency.

Earlier, Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia's response to the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace efforts.

Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine's contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump's Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.

The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X.

Ukraine, U.S. negotiators discussed how to end war, Zelensky says

Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to ⁠other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce.

Putin said on Saturday Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday.

The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, ‌the result of weeks of negotiations, should be ‍put to a referendum.

A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may reject the plan.

Zelensky's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows ‍weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, ‌have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that the United States would ⁠support.

On Sunday, ahead of his meeting with Trump, Zelensky said he held a detailed phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Trump and Zelensky were also expected to hold a phone ​call with European leaders during their Florida meeting, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian president said on Sunday.

Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90% finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.

While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.

The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves ​the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.

It has also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where power line repairs have begun after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency said on Sunday.

Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025.

Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of ⁠Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of its territory, including about 90% of Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, ⁠and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine ‌withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members.

The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.

Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators ‌have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.

The quake struck off Taiwan's northeastern coast, and shook buildings in the capital, Taipei.

A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck off Taiwan's ⁠northeastern ‍coast late on Saturday, the island's Central Weather Administration said.

The quake, some 32 km (20 miles) off the city of Yilan, hit at 11:05 pm local time (1505 GMT/UTC) and had a depth of 73 ‍km (45 miles), it added.

Residents and local media described how the quake shook buildings in the capital, Taipei, as the government sent alerts to public mobile phones.

Local media reported that some ceilings collapsed and supermarket shelves toppled.

Rail operators temporarily slowed some train and high-speed rail services as a precaution.

Within minutes, however, the Taipei ⁠city ‍government said there were ‌no ‌immediate ⁠reports of major ‍damage.

The quake was not severe enough for officials to issue a tsunami alert, Reuters news agency cited the country's fire department as saying.

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te urged residents to ""stay vigilant."" He encouraged them to check on family and friends and warned of possible aftershocks.

However, the shaking did force evacuations at a small number of facilities owned by the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC.

""Prioritising ​personnel ​safety, we are conducting outdoor evacuations and headcounts in accordance with emergency ‍response procedures. Work safety systems at ​all facilities are operating normally,"" the company said ⁠in ​a brief statement.

Taiwan is vital to the global technology sector as it produces the most advanced semiconductors, including the cutting-edge chips no other country can currently match.

Any disruption to Taiwan's chipmakers would jolt global supply chains, crippling industries from smartphones to cars and pushing up tech prices worldwide.

Taiwan is prone to earthquakes.

In April 2024, a magnitude-7.2 quake struck the island's east, killing at least 18 people and injuring more than 1,000.

A 7.3 magnitude quake in 1999 ‌killed ‌more than 2,000 people.

The French screen legend appeared in 56 films before ending her career in 1973 and dedicating herself to animal rights activism.

French movie star and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has died at age 91, her foundation said Sunday.

""The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,"" it said in a statement sent to French news agency AFP. 

The foundation's Bruno Jacquelin told The Associated Press Bardot died at her home in southern France. He did not give a cause of death and said no immediate arrangements have been made for funeral or memorial services.

French President Emmanuel Macron praised Bardot for her excellence on and off the screen, writing on social media platform X: ""Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom.""

""French existence, universal brilliance,"" he added. ""She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.""

 

When her career began in the 1950s, she was widely regarded as a sex symbol, thanks to her figure and libertine lifestyle.

One of her most well-known films was ""And God Created Woman,"" in 1956, where she starred as an 18-year-old caught up in a love triangle, which was directed by her then-husband Roger Vadim.

Vadim once promised that Bardot would become ""the unattainable fantasy of all married men.""

A few years later, in 1963, she played a sullen, frustrated wife of a screenwriter in Jean-Luc Godard's ""Contempt,"" which featured scenes that became part of cinema folklore.

Her popularity was so great that in 1969 she became the model for “Marianne,” France's national emblem, appearing on statues, stamps, and coins.

However, by 1973 Bardot announced she had become ""sick of being beautiful every day,"" as she turned her back on acting to look after abandoned animals.

In the early 1980s, Bardot traveled to Canada and experienced a life-changing visit when she witnessed its annual seal cub culls.

The Brigitte Bardot Foundation was set up in 1986 and dedicated to animal protection. Bardot crusaded for baby seals and elephants, called for the abolition of ritual animal sacrifice, and pushed for the closure of horse abattoirs.

In a 2011 letter to conservation group WWF, she recalled witnessing the cull of seal cubs, saying: ""I will never forget these pictures, the screams of pain, they still torture me but they have given me the strength to sacrifice my whole life to defend the animal's one.""

The French animal welfare society, SPA, in paying tribute called Bardot a ""passionate advocate for the animal cause.""

""Her unwavering commitment helped change attitudes and achieve major advances in animal protection,"" it said on Sunday. 

Despite her dedication to animal rights, Bardot's outspoken views often sparked controversy.

She was repeatedly fined by French courts between 1997 and 2008 for remarks judged to constitute incitement to racial or religious hatred, including statements directed at France's Muslim community.

According to court rulings, she was convicted at least five times during that period, with her most severe penalty coming in 2008, when a Paris court fined her €15,000 (about $16,000) over a letter criticizing Muslim ritual slaughter.

Bardot married Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front, in 1992 and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen.

On Sunday, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella desribed her as a woman with ""heart, conviction, and character.""

""A passionate patriot ​and ​a lover of animals that she protected throughout her life, she alone embodied an entire era of French history, and above all a certain idea of courage and freedom,"" he said. 

In 2018, she denounced the #MeToo movement in an interview with the magazine Paris Match, claiming actresses who spoke out against sexual harassment were: ""Hypocritical and ridiculous. Lots of actresses try to play the tease with producers to get a role.""

With parliament paralysed and EU-backed loans at risk, parties face pressure to compromise as Kosovars vote again, unsure whether any result can restore governance, unlock funding and ease a deepening political crisis.

Kosovo is holding a parliamentary election for the second time in 11 months, as Prime Minister Albin Kurti's left-wing nationalist Vetevendosje (Self-Determination Movement) seeks a clear majority to break a prolonged political stalemate.

The snap election Sunday follows February's vote, in which Vetevendosje emerged as the largest party but failed to secure a governing parliamentary majority.

Months of unsuccessful coalition talks led to President Vjosa Osmani dissolving the parliament in November and calling an early election.

Since then, Kosovo's legislature has been unable to agree on its leadership, leaving the body effectively paralyzed and unable to function.

Polling stations open at 07:00 (0600 GMT) and close at 19:00, with initial results and exit polls expected on Sunday evening.

Kurti, who has governed since 2021, is hoping for a decisive result similar to his 2021 victory, when he was able to form a government largely on his own. His reform agenda has produced mixed results so far.

If Vetevendosje again falls short of a majority, uncertainty remains over whether Kosovo's main political parties will be willing to compromise to form a coalition government.

Opposition parties have repeatedly refused to govern with Kurti, criticizing his handling of relations with Western allies and his policies toward Kosovo's ethnically divided north, where a Serb minority lives.

Kurti in turn has blamed the opposition for the ongoing impasse.

Bedri Hamza, a former finance minister and new head of the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), has emerged as Kurti's strongest challenger.

Hamza blends national values with liberal economic policies championing free markets, economic growth, a stronger private sector and social protection.

Failure to form a government would prolong the crisis at a critical moment. Lawmakers must elect a new president in April and ratify around €1 billion ($1.2 billion) in loan agreements with the European Union and the World Bank, which are set to expire in the coming months.

Kosovo has also faced financial pressure following tensions with Serbia in 2023, which prompted the EU to impose sanctions.

The bloc has said it will lift the measures after ethnic Serbian mayors were elected in northern municipalities, though the sanctions are believed to have cost Kosovo hundreds of millions of euros.

During the campaign, Kurti has pledged an extra month of salary per year for public sector workers, one billion euros annually in capital investment and the creation of a new prosecution unit to combat organized crime.

Opposition parties have also focused on promises to improve living standards. Opinion polls are not published in Kosovo, leaving the outcome uncertain. Many voters say they are disillusioned.

NEW YORK (AP) — When the MetroCard replaced the New York City subway token in 1994, the swipeable plastic card infused much-needed modernity into one of the world's oldest and largest transit systems.

Now, more than three decades later, the gold-hued fare card and its notoriously finicky magnetic strip are following the token into retirement.

The last day to buy or refill a MetroCard is Dec. 31, 2025, as the transit system fully transitions to OMNY, a contactless payment system that allows riders to tap their credit card, phone or other smart device to pay fares, much like they do for other everyday purchases.

Transit officials say more than 90% of subway and bus trips are now paid using the tap-and-go system, introduced in 2019.

Major cities around the world, including London and Singapore, have long used similar contactless systems. In the U.S., San Francisco launched a pay-go system earlier this year, joining Chicago and others. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The humble MetroCard may have outlasted its useful life, but in its day it was revolutionary, says Jodi Shapiro, curator at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn, which opened an exhibit earlier this month reflecting on the MetroCard's legacy. 

Before MetroCards, bus and subway riders relied on tokens, the brass-colored coins introduced in 1953 that were purchased from station booths. When the subway opened in 1904, paper tickets cost just a nickel, or about $1.82 in today's dollars.

“There was a resistance to change from tokens to something else because tokens work,” Shapiro said on a recent visit to the museum, housed underground in a decommissioned subway station. “MetroCards introduced a whole other level of thinking for New Yorkers.” 




The Metropolitan Transportation Authority launched public campaigns to teach commuters how to swipe the originally blue-colored cards correctly, hoping to avoid the dreaded error message or lost fares. Officials even briefly toyed with the idea of an quirky mascot, the Cardvaark, before coming to their senses. 

The cards quickly became collectors items as the transit system rolled out special commemorative editions marking major events, such as the “Subway Series” between baseball's New York Mets and the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series. At the time, a fare cost $1.50.

Artists from David Bowie and Olivia Rodrigo to seminal New York hip hop acts, such as the Wu-Tang Clan, the Notorious B.I.G. and LL Cool J, have also graced the plastic card over the years, as have iconic New York shows like Seinfeld and Law & Order. 

“For me, the most special cards are cards which present New York City to the world,” said Lev Radin, a collector in the Bronx. “Not only photos of landmarks, skylines, but also about people who live and make New York special.” 

Perfecting the correct angle and velocity of the MetroCard swipe also became something of a point of pride separating real New Yorkers from those just visiting. 

During her failed 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. Senator from New York, took an excruciating five swipes at a Bronx turnstile. In fairness, her chief Democratic opponent at the time, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a native Brooklynite, didn't even appear to realize tokens had been discontinued.

Unlike the MetroCard rollout, OMNY has required little adjustment.

Riders reluctant to use a credit card or smart device can purchase an OMNY card they can reload, similar to a MetroCard. Existing MetroCards will also continue to work into 2026, allowing riders to use remaining balances.

MTA spokespersons declined to comment, pointing instead to their many public statements as the deadline approaches. 

The agency has said the changeover saves at least $20 million annually in MetroCard-related costs. 

The new system also allows unlimited free rides within a seven-day period because the fare is capped after 12 rides. It'll max out at $35 a week once the fare rises to $3 in January.

Still, new changes come with tradeoffs, with some critics raising concerns about data collection and surveillance. 

Near Times Square on a recent morning, Ronald Minor was among the dwindling group of “straphangers” still swiping MetroCards.

The 70-year-old Manhattan resident said he's sad to see them go. He has an OMNY card but found the vending machines to reload it more cumbersome. 

“It's hard for the elders,” Minor said as he caught a train to Brooklyn. “Don't push us aside and make it like we don't count. You push these machines away, you push us away.”

John Sacchetti, another MetroCard user at the Port Authority stop, said he likes being able to see his balance as he swipes through a turnstile so he knows how much he's been spending on rides.

“It's just like everything else, just something to get used to,” he said as he headed uptown. “Once I get used to it, I think it'll be okay.”

James Cameron told Fox News Digital Leonardo DiCaprio almost passed on playing Jack Dawson in ""Titanic"" because he thought the role was too easy.

Leonardo DiCaprio spent the holiday week leaning into love.

The actor was seen getting cozy with his girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti during a Los Angeles lunch and shopping date — showing rare PDA that turned heads and fueled relationship buzz.

DiCaprio, 51, and Ceretti, 27, kicked off their outing with lunch at Architecture Café, where the pair sat close, as she appeared to wrap her arm around the Hollywood actor. They looked relaxed and affectionate during their intimate outing.

The notoriously private actor seemed at ease, as the Italian model leaned in toward her beau as they chatted and shared the moment away from the spotlight.

PDA has long been a rarity for DiCaprio, who typically keeps his relationships low-key. But during the lunch stop, the couple appeared unbothered by attention, appearing comfortable together.

Following their meal, the pair strolled over to the A.P.C. store for some shopping.

Inside the boutique, DiCaprio and Ceretti were seen sharing a sweet kiss — another uncommon moment from the usually reserved Hollywood star.

The affectionate exchange offered a glimpse into the couple's growing comfort together, even in public settings.

DiCaprio kept things casual in a black sweatsuit and matching hat, while Ceretti opted for an understated look and was photographed with a Chanel bag by her side. The two appeared to be all smiles during their rare outing.

The sighting comes after the Hollywood couple were seen enjoying a sun-soaked summer yacht trip in August, where they were also seen keeping things relatively low-profile.

When asked if she believes there's a ""risk"" in being labeled DiCaprio's ""girlfriend,"" she replied, ""Yes.""

""As soon as you're in a relationship with someone who has a larger following than you, you become 'girlfriend of' – or 'boyfriend of,' for that matter. And that can be extremely annoying,"" Ceretti said in an interview with Vogue France.

""Suddenly, people are talking about you as so-and-so's girlfriend who was so-and-so's ex. So, it's not nice to think that you can't love whoever you want, because of the labels people need to stick on you.""

Ceretti revealed that the two had met in Milan but declined to share any specific details.

Burt Kearns has written a new book on the late Oscar winner, ""Marlon Brando: Hollywood Rebel.""

Johnny Carson's tenure on NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" produced many iconic moments.

In the new book, ""Love Johnny Carson,"" Carson's superfan Mark Malkoff details some of the most legendary moments on the show, including a blowup between Hollywood juggernauts, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Marlon Brando.

According to the book, Brando and Gabor appeared on the show alongside one another in May 1963, when Carson filmed episodes of the show live from Burbank, California.

""Brando walked out drunk and sat down next to Johnny's previous guest, socialite and actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, who had been promoting her new face cream,"" Malkoff wrote.

While the two started off cordial, with Brando ""calling Zsa Zsa fascinating and charming,"" the love between them quickly faded, as Gabor began interrupting Brando constantly.

Things continued to spiral downward after Brando ""told a weak knock-knock joke that garnered polite applause,"" which Gabor pointed out, saying, ""Only for Marlon Brando would they applaud for that.""

""Zsa Zsa changed the subject back to her face cream, rehashing the product's incomparable benefits. 'Are we going to have to sit here all night and listen to your crappy plugs?' Brando asked,"" according to the book.

Malkoff continues by saying that the conversation soon turned into an exchange of insults, after which ""Zsa Zsa got up and stormed off the set,"" while a still-drunk ""Brando offered a sly smile.""

Brando is often regarded as one of the best actors of all-time. Throughout his career, the actor received eight Academy Award nominations, winning in 1955 and 1973 for his roles in ""On the Waterfront"" and ""The Godfather,"" respectively.

The actor worked in Hollywood for over 50 years and had over 40 credits to his name, including both feature films and television projects.

While he continued to act, Brando's career slowed down in the 1980s and into the early 2000s, with his final on-screen performance being in the 2001 movie, ""The Score."" He died in July 2004 at the age of 80 from respiratory failure related to pulmonary fibrosis and congestive heart failure.

""Marlon Brando is one of the great men of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and we lesser mortals are obligated to cut through the s--- and proclaim it,"" Jack Nicholson told Rolling Stone in August 2004. ""This man has been my idol all of my professional life, and I don't think I'm alone in that. The impact of movies is enormous, and his impact in the movies was bigger than anybody else's – ever. Mr. Brando will be there forever – that's all there is to it. He might not like that, but he'll be there forever anyway.""

""To me, Marlon Brando was the greatest ever,"" he later added. ""That's a truth I hold to be self-evident. But it's like what Bum Phillips said once: 'If he isn't in a class by himself, it sure takes a very short time to call the roll.'""

Petty Officer Scott Ruskan speaks with Fox News' Lawrence Jones in Kerrville, Texas, to reflect on the heroic rescue mission as Central Texas continues to reel from the devastation left by the flash floods.

In a year marked by disaster and devastation, it was quiet bravery, from Coast Guard rescue swimmers to local firefighters, emergency crews and everyday citizens, that turned moments of crisis into stories of survival.

On July 4, 2025, catastrophic flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, Texas, devastated Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp that had been operating for nearly a century.

Dick Eastland, the longtime director and co-owner of Camp Mystic, died while trying to save campers as fast-rising floodwaters tore through the campgrounds before dawn. 

Eastland, who had led the camp since the 1970s, was widely remembered by former campers and staff as a father figure and selfless leader whose final moments reflected a lifetime spent protecting children in his care.

""It doesn't surprise me at all that his last act of kindness and sacrifice was working to save the lives of campers,"" said Paige Sumner, a former camper and friend of Eastland.

At the time of the flooding, more than 700 campers and counselors were at Camp Mystic. Twenty-seven girls and counselors were killed when the Guadalupe River surged through a low-lying area of the camp, rising from 14 feet to 29.5 feet in just 60 minutes. The camp did not fully evacuate before the floodwaters hit.

The destructive flooding ultimately killed at least 136 people across Central Texas, triggering widespread scrutiny of emergency preparedness and warning systems. Community leaders and lawmakers paid tribute to Eastland's bravery, calling his final actions emblematic of the quiet heroism displayed during one of the deadliest natural disasters of the year.

A United States Coast Guard rescue swimmer from New Jersey was hailed as a hero for his role in lifesaving efforts during the deadly flash floods in Central Texas.

Petty Officer 3rd Class Scott Ruskan, 26, was credited with saving 165 people as the only triage coordinator on the ground amid the chaotic flood response near Camp Mystic and surrounding areas.

""United States Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer and Petty Officer Scott Ruskin [sic], directly saved an astonishing 165 victims in the devastating flooding in central Texas. This was the first rescue mission of his career and he was the only triage coordinator at the scene. Scott Ruskin is an American hero. His selfless courage embodies the spirit and mission of the @USCG,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X.

Ruskan described spotting a large crowd of ""about 200 kids at a campsite"" and focusing rescue efforts there to get as many people to safety as possible.

A decorated former police officer and former Baltimore Orioles minor league player died while rescuing swimmers caught in a rip current off the coast of South Carolina in July, according to authorities and family members.

Chase Childers, 38, entered the water near Pawleys Island on July 13, 2025, after people were reported in distress. While others who attempted to help were able to return to shore, Childers was caught in the rip current and did not make it back, police said.

""We would like to provide additional information on Sunday's incident,"" the Pawleys Island Police Department said in a statement. ""The victim, Chase Childers, and another person entered the water to help individuals who were in distress. Sadly, Mr. Childers was caught in the rip current, as well. He died trying to save others.""

Emergency responders recovered Childers' body about 90 minutes after the initial distress call, with assistance from Midway Fire Rescue and the U.S. Coast Guard. Officials praised first responders for their efforts and offered condolences to the family.

According to a GoFundMe created in Childers' memory, he was a devoted husband and father who displayed ""extraordinary courage and selflessness"" while saving a family of five, putting their lives above his own. During his law enforcement career in Cobb County, Georgia, Childers received a lifetime achievement award for saving several lives, the page said.

On Feb. 1, 2025, an active shooter incident erupted during a band competition at Pasadena Memorial High School in Texas, when an 83-year-old man, identified as Dennis Brandl, opened fire inside the school auditorium.

One person, a 26-year-old percussion technical consultant, was shot in the shoulder and transported to a Houston-area hospital, where he remained conscious and was expected to recover.

Before police could fully respond, a group of four fathers known as the ""band dads"" — all of whom had military or law enforcement backgrounds — sprang into action. The men rushed toward the gunfire, tackled the suspect and disarmed him, preventing further injuries at the crowded event.

""As soon as everyone was screaming and yelling, gunshots fired, Joe and myself looked at each other and ran straight to the door,"" Army veteran Adam Curow told FOX 26. ""By the time we got inside, Polo and Abram were right behind us as a band-dad team.""

Pasadena ISD police officers, along with civilians and community members, helped restrain Brandl until law enforcement secured the scene. Authorities later said Brandl told police he believed he was being chased and feared that he and his wife would be killed.

The Houston Police Department praised the men involved, including HPD Sgt. Joe Sanchez, who was attending the event, for their decisive actions.

""When danger struck, HPD Sergeant Joe Sanchez didn't hesitate,"" the department wrote in a statement on X. ""While attending a band competition at a Pasadena school, Sgt. Sanchez was among those who quickly stepped up to protect lives. This month, he marks 33 years with HPD. We're grateful for his service.""

A dramatic ocean rescue unfolded aboard a Disney Dream cruise ship after a 5-year-old girl fell overboard while the vessel was sailing in international waters between the Bahamas and Port Everglades, Florida, authorities said.

The incident occurred around 11:30 a.m. on June 29, 2025, when the child lost her balance while sitting on a railing near a porthole on Deck 4 and fell backward into the ocean, according to the Broward Sheriff's Office. After the girl's mother alerted her husband, the child's 37-year-old father jumped into the water to save her.

Investigators said the father located his daughter and treaded water with her until rescue crews arrived, as the ship's ""man overboard"" alert sounded and crew members launched an emergency response. The total time from the child's fall to the rescue was about 20 minutes, authorities said.

Security video corroborated the family's account, and officials credited the ship's crew with executing a swift rescue due to their man-overboard training. 

""The crew aboard the Disney Dream swiftly rescued two guests from the water,"" a Disney Cruise Line spokesperson told Fox News Digital, praising the crew's prompt actions.

The father and daughter were evaluated by the ship's medical staff and later transported to a hospital after the ship docked. Authorities said the family, who live out of state, requested privacy, calling the outcome a blessing in what could have been a tragic incident.

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, speaking at the Israel National Security Studies conference, says President Donald Trump has been clear that Iran will not be allowed to go nuclear. (Video: Israel National Security Studies.)

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country is engaged in what he described as a ""total war"" with the U.S., Israel and Europe.

In an interview published Saturday by Iranian state media, Pezeshkian said that he believes the Western powers want to bring Iran ""to its knees,"" The Times of Israel reported.

""In my opinion, we are at total war with the United States, Israel and Europe,"" Pezeshkian said. ""They want to bring our country to its knees.""

Pezeshkian argued that the current conflict is more complex than the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, saying his country is now under pressure ""from every angle,"" according to The Times of Israel.

""If one understands it well, this war is far more complex and difficult than that war. In the war with Iraq, the situation was clear, they fired missiles, and we knew where to hit,"" Pezeshkian said, according to The Jerusalem Post. 

""Here, they are besieging us from every aspect, they are creating problems for us in terms of livelihood, culturally, politically, and security-wise.""

Despite the strain, Pezeshkian claimed Iran's military emerged stronger following its June conflict with Israel, according to The Times of Israel.

""Our beloved military forces are doing their jobs with strength and now, in terms of equipment and manpower, despite all the problems we have, they are stronger than when they attacked. So if they want to attack, they will naturally face a more decisive response,"" he said.

The interview with Pezeshkian was released ahead of a planned meeting this coming week at Mar-a-Lago between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, according to The Jerusalem Post.

Tensions remain high following a brief but intense air conflict in June that was kicked off by Israel. 

The fighting resulted in roughly 1,100 deaths in Iran, including senior military commanders and nuclear scientists, while Iranian missile attacks killed 28 people in the Jewish State.

""Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror,"" the president said. ""Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success. Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","An unnecessarily dangerous Supreme Court decision","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/4362312/dangerous-supreme-court-decision-national-guard/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

For years, liberal Supreme Court justices have decried the dangers of what is known as the “shadow docket,” but when it suits their short-term political ends, suddenly the docket is their friend.

In a short three-page decision written with little briefing and no oral argument, a 6-3 majority denied the Justice Department's request to stay a district court restraining order preventing President Donald Trump from deploying the National Guard in Chicago. The court's holding is tenuously founded, rushed, and will endanger the lives of federal law enforcement officers.

After winning the presidential election by promising thorough enforcement of federal immigration law, Trump launched Operation Midway Blitz on Sept. 6 to speed deportation in and around the Windy City. A key component of this campaign was the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in the suburb of Broadview, Illinois. Within days, the center became a focal point of Democratic Party performance protests against immigration law enforcement. Two candidates vying to replace retiring Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) filmed themselves obstructing federal officers.

After rioters threw rocks at federal law enforcement agents and tear gas was deployed to protect the officers and maintain access to the building, Trump activated the Illinois National Guard on Oct. 3, against the wishes of Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), an open borders fanatic. He opposes all cooperation with federal immigration law enforcement. Pritzker and Chicago's socialist mayor, Brandon Johnson, sued in federal court seeking a stay to prevent deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois granted a stay, and the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed it. Similar suits have been filed in the District of Columbia, California, Oregon, and Tennessee.

The Justice Department filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court on Oct. 17, the court asked for a response on Oct. 20, and opening briefs and reply briefs were due on Nov. 17. Then nothing for over a month until a three-page decision on the late afternoon of the day before Christmas Eve.

There are many problems with the majority's decision, the biggest being that the holding is based on an argument the plaintiffs did not even make in the lower courts — that the term “regular forces” in the statute authorizing the president to federalize members of the guard, refers only to the military, not federal law enforcement officers. In other words, the court held that even though past presidents have federalized the National Guard on many occasions when federal officials were overwhelmed, the majority now wants us to believe that the National Guard can be activated only after the military itself has proved unable to execute federal laws.

Considering the novelty and far-reaching consequences of such a holding, one might expect the court to have held an extensive briefing on the specific question and oral argument. But no such deliberation happened in this case.

SUBSIDIZING DEMAND WON'T SOLVE AFFORDABILITY

Perversely, the long-term consequence of the majority's rushed and ill-thought-out holding is that it's now more likely that the military will be deployed domestically. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh notes in a concurrence, “One apparent ramification of the Court's opinion is that it could cause the president to use the U.S. military more than the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property in the United States.”

It is clear from this opinion that a growing number of justices are unhappy with the manner in which Trump is enforcing federal immigration law. Disagreements over ICE's tactics, however, do not justify novel interpretations of settled law that obstruct the protection of federal officers facing potentially lethal attacks.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) has called for the British royal family to pay compensation to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, as more files associated with the disgraced financier continue to show a close relationship between him and one of its former members, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, was stripped of his royal titles and evicted from the Royal Lodge in October over the sexual assault allegations against him and his connection to Epstein. At the time, Buckingham Palace said the actions were “deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” expressing sympathy for Epstein's victims.

But Khanna, who co-sponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act that mandated a full release of the files, indicated on Saturday he wants the royal family to take more responsibility.

“The royal family should be ashamed and horrified. They should be compensating each of the working-class girls who were victims of the Epstein class,” he told British outlet the i Paper.

Khanna's comments come as a document in a new batch of Epstein files, which dropped on Tuesday, revealed federal prosecutors had evidence that Mountbatten-Windsor “engaged in sexual conduct” with one of Epstein's victims and threatened to force the then-British royal to speak with U.K. investigators. 

The document, dated April 2020, also detailed evidence that Mountbatten-Windsor “was present” for “certain” interactions between a victim, Epstein, and longtime Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Prosecutors also said there is “documentary” evidence that Andrew “had knowledge” Maxwell “recruited females to engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men.”

Still, prosecutors stressed at the time that Mountbatten-Windsor “is not presently a target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under U.S. law.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WON'T COMPLETE EPSTEIN FILES RELEASE FOR ‘A FEW MORE WEEKS'

Ezra Klein talks Zohran Mamdani and one year of his new book with Vox's Astead Herndon.

Do you remember where you were when you first heard about “abundance”?

In some circles, 2025 was the year that abundance became inescapable. The political framework — which essentially argues Democrats need to focus less on process and more on delivering for constituents — provided the title of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson's book in March. For, seemingly, the rest of the year, an endless stream of podcasts, X posts, and articles followed its publication.

The discourse has elevated Klein into something of a spiritual leader for the Democrats, a position he finds a bit uncomfortable.

“I see my job as trying to create good ideas built on an honest assessment of the world that will lead to things being better,” Klein told Today, Explained host Astead Herndon. “I would love it if that at this moment did not seem quite so partisan.”

Herndon talked to Klein about the tenets of abundance, the challenges prominent Democrats like Zohran Mamdani and Gavin Newsom face in delivering it, and what he hopes the legacy of his book will be.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Define the abundance agenda for us.

So Abundance comes out of a series of pieces that me and my coauthor Derek Thompson wrote.

We were struggling with the reality that, in places where Democrats governed, you were not seeing enough of the things people need get built or produced — in places like California and New York, Massachusetts, just not enough housing. And that's compared, by the way, to red states like Florida or Texas, which have an easier time producing it.

Under the Biden administration, we were seeing this huge push to decarbonization, but there was a lot standing in the way of building the transmission lines, electrical vehicle charger networks, the solar panels, the wind turbines.

And so this question of how can you have a liberalism that builds fast enough to achieve liberalism's goals became, certainly for me, a somewhat obsessing question. How do you have government, particularly when Democrats are running it — the party that believes in government — that when they say we're going to build high-speed rail or we're going to build the 2nd Avenue subway, they get that done on time, on budget, quickly. And so people begin to see what government can do for them.

How do you set the conditions for government, particularly Democratic governments, to follow through.

Yes.

You recently wrote a column saying, “America's housing problem is too much money chasing too few homes.” What is it you think about this issue specifically — housing costs, housing supply — that demonstrates the core argument of the abundance agenda?

So the thing where this issue I think causes particular heartache for Democrats is that there is no bigger part of a working family's budget or a middle-class family's budget than housing. And in the places where Democrats govern, housing costs have gone completely out of control. And that is honestly distinct from places where Republicans govern.

So I always say that there is this huge difference between what happens when people move to Austin or Houston and what happens when they move to San Francisco or Los Angeles. Austin and Houston build more homes for them, and, to a first approximation, SF and LA don't. And that means it is much more affordable for many people to live in these red states.

In the period where we're writing the book, you were seeing a big exodus, migration out of California, out of New York, out of Illinois, because it has become so unaffordable. So to me that is a real, on the part of Democrats, betrayal of the people they say they're standing for.

I mean, I wrote a lot of the book when I was living in San Francisco and you have these yard signs where it says “No human being is illegal” and “Kindness is everything,” and everything is zoned for single-family housing and the homes cost more than a million dollars to buy. So yeah, it's great to say no human being is illegal and kindness is everything, but if the human beings can't afford to live there, then something's gone really wrong.

And so the other thing that makes housing kind of interesting and complicated is that it's actually very hard to solve. I mean, Democrats do want to solve it. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, promised to build 3.5 million new homes over his tenure when he took office. He's nowhere near on track for that, but it's not like he hasn't been trying, he's suing local cities and he's signed dozens of housing bills.

It's actually really, really hard, when you have ended up in a government equilibrium which is about creating a lot of opportunities to say no, to then unwind that if you need to create the space to say yes to a lot of things rapidly.

Since the book has come out, we have seen some “Abundance” civic groups pop up, particularly in big cities that were mentioned in the book, places like New York City and out in California. I saw an “inclusive Abundance group” in my inbox the other week. There's college groups. Did you expect this? Was this the point, did you think this was a political platform for Democrats?

We knew that there was electricity around this set of ideas because we'd seen it in the pieces that I started writing in 2021, and Derek, who wrote the initial piece naming it. I had the much less good term “supply-side progressivism.”

That doesn't fit on the side of the book!

Yeah, you can see why “Abundance” won that one.

So we knew some of this was happening, some of the inclusive abundance groups were already there. So we knew that we were writing to a movement and a tendency that was already gaining force and prior to sort of us wrapping a series of ideas into this frame of abundance, the ideas themselves, YIMBY-ism, for instance, or that we need to build fast for decarbonization. So we are standing on the shoulders of giants of activists of policy, intellectuals and also of the past, right, like the New Deal, where they did a lot of things very, very fast.

Yeah. I also wanted to ask how you see your role. Do you see your job as helping Democrats win?

I see my job as trying to create good ideas, built on an honest assessment of the world that will lead to things being better. I would love it if that at this moment did not seem quite so partisan. There are other countries where say, thinking we should decarbonize is not a right-left issue.

Vivek Rameswamy just had a piece in the New York Times saying that he thinks abundance, if you didn't have all these left-coded aesthetics and ideas, could actually be very helpful for Republicans.

So I don't think every single idea is Democratic versus Republican.

What I will say is that I do think the Trump administration is uniquely lethal to liberal democracy. I think it is almost explicitly trying to create some kind of successor or I might say predecessor structure to it, a regime of deal-making and transaction and masked ICE agents. And so right now, I do believe that, for people who believe in not just a set of ideals that are in Abundance, but in a broader set of ideals about how we live here together and how we have a free and fair political system and country, creating movements that allow liberal democracy to deliver and be an effective counterweight to right-wing populism is part of how I see my work.

I was going to ask what you would want the legacy of Abundance to be as a book. Is it to reposition the Democratic Party, or liberal democracy, on delivering in cities?

Yeah, but it's more. What I want the legacy of it to be is the affordable homes people need, is the high-speed rail they can ride, is the clean energy they can use and that makes their energy bills cheaper and that gives us more energy in total as a society…

We were talking about repositioning the Democratic Party, and I've had something running through my mind recently, which is something Ben Wikler, the former chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, said to me, which is he said that the Democratic Party is a party that makes government work for you.

And I remember thinking like, yeah, the Democratic Party, the party that wants government to work for you, that should be what it is. And then it should be ruthless about making that true. And that doesn't just mean abundance. It means [opposing] corruption, right? I think at this point it probably means term limits and age limits, right? It means taking government working seriously, right? Not the way government works now. And this, to me, is a difficult space for the Democratic Party, which has to simultaneously be defending institutions and modernizing them. It's a much harder position than the sort of Trumpist Republican Party right now.

That leads me to candidates like Zohran Mamdani or Katie Wilson, the mayor-elect in Seattle. When you see the kind of populist embrace of some abundance lanes, do you look at those candidates and think those are abundance Democrats? Or should I be thinking more folks a little closer to the center? 

The Abundance Democrats are the Democrats who deliver abundance. So I am thrilled by the way I've seen Democrats of many different stripes and even a couple Republicans pick up some of the ideas and arguments of abundance. But the thing that is going to separate who's real in this and who is not is whether they deliver.

So I am hopeful about Mamdani, but governing New York City is famously very, very difficult and building a lot more housing is going to be harder to do than implementing a rent freeze. I'm very hopeful he can do it. But I want to be very cautious myself, having watched a lot of politicians promise on this and fail, right?

As I said, Gavin Newsom talks about abundance a lot. He's actually signed some incredible bills in my perspective in the last year or two, but he was not able to deliver the housing change he promised in California.

And abundance is in the end, not about what you say, it is about what you deliver. It is an argument that the Democratic Party should, that all government should, be judged by whether or not it is able to create — either directly or through creating the conditions for the private market to create it — the things people need.

While traversing the narrow, winding roads outside the Japanese town of Fujikawaguchiko, I stopped by a farm with a view of Mount Fuji, where a few locals were picking fruit. Most were older, and one was walking with a cane as she bent down to put berries into a bag.

At an udon shop, drivers and construction workers — some of whom looked to be in their 60s — were slurping noodles. The server said she knew people who have owned nearby restaurants and shops for decades.

After settling back at Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, I noticed that the older workers I had encountered in the city worked as crossing guards, cleaners, gift shop owners, taxi drivers, or wholesale workers. Only a handful of the older Tokyoites I observed were wearing the white-collar uniform of suits and ties.

When I visited Japan in early December, I had just finished the capstone story of my 80 Over 80 series, the most in-depth look at America's older workers that I know of in modern press or academia. In the months prior, I interviewed nearly 200 Americans working past 80 in dozens of professions. I discovered that nearly 550,000 Americans in this demographic work, according to Census data, and the number is expected to continue increasing as the US workforce ages and the cost of living rises. In interviews, dozens of American researchers said government benefits fall short for millions of older Americans each year, adding that the US could look to countries like Japan for inspiration.

Business Insider's ""80-over-80"" series draws on interviews with the growing group of Americans working past their 80th birthdays. They discussed their careers, retirement planning, living expenses, healthcare, and life lessons. If you are 80 and older and still work, fill out this form to contribute to the series.

Read our capstone story from the series and watch our video.

Japan, like many of its neighbors, has experienced rapid aging over the last few decades. Nearly 30% of Japan's population is 65 and older, the highest of any country, according to government data. About one in four in this demographic works, meaning that about one in seven Japanese workers is 65 and older.

Comparatively, this demographic comprises about 18% of the US population, and roughly one in five works. The US has not aged as rapidly as East Asia, although increased longevity and lower birth rates have propelled aging enough that by 2030, the Census Bureau projects there will be more Americans 65 and older than under 18.

Japan has adapted in many ways to its hyper-aging population. Its government has actively supported older worker employment, especially among older women. Seven researchers studying aging workforces in Japan and South Korea told Business Insider that keeping older workers employed at higher levels has helped both countries mitigate economic disaster and severe labor shortages.

The Japanese case is much different from the US, though, some researchers said. While the US will continue to experience lower growth rates, the workforce is unlikely to decline as much due to aging, assuming that comparatively higher fertility rates and immigration levels hold steady or rise. The desire to hire younger people is often stronger in the US than in Japan, though the US also has a younger population. The US also lacks a comprehensive healthcare system like Japan's, with worse general health metrics.

Researchers agreed Japan still has a long way to go in supporting its aging workers and preparing mid-career workers for a stable retirement. For the US, Japan may offer a different glimpse into what an older workforce can look like.

Japan is often the first country many think about when discussing aging. It boasts the world's highest number of centenarians per capita and advocates for active lifestyles, healthier diets, and reliable healthcare.

Many older Japanese people work in manufacturing and retail, with an increasing number in service roles, construction, and medical-related services. America's oldest workers also frequently worked in these professions, particularly construction and education, according to Business Insider's analysis of Census Bureau data.

Japan has mandated that companies provide more employment opportunities for workers aged 65 and above through its Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons. Legislation has encouraged companies to offer work opportunities until the age of 70, while former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida committed one trillion yen over five years for reskilling efforts.

Japan also has Silver Human Resource Centers, which provide part-time work and skills training for older people, as well as the government's Lifetime Employment Support Office.

The World Economic Forum notes that 80% of Japanese workers hope to continue working in some capacity after retirement. Some companies have implemented policies that enable workers to extend their retirement age and offer promotions and salary increases beyond 60. Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare provides employers with subsidies if they can convert older contract workers to permanent jobs.

Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a nonresident senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, argued in a paper from April that Japan has alleviated many potentially disastrous economic outcomes of hyper-aging. Kirkegaard told Business Insider that despite Japan's unique socioeconomic and aging circumstances, the country may be a model for its neighbors, as it raised female employment levels, expanded immigration pathways, and became more integrated with foreign economies.

""In many ways, the Japanese labor market was always much more receptive to the idea of employing workers at high ages because they tend to be healthy and motivated and do the type of service-sector jobs that you could do at a high age,"" Kirkegaard said.

Japan isn't without its challenges, though.

""Even if Japan has done better than any other country, it doesn't mean that older workers in Japan have the same labor force participation or earnings potential as does prime-age workers,"" Kirkegaard said.

Many older Japanese workers are employed in low-wage jobs, as many companies remain reluctant to hire older workers for higher-paid positions. Much like in the US, many Japanese companies assume older workers require more training and costs. Japan's hierarchical workplace structure also means it's often harder for an older worker to climb the ranks.

Population aging contributes to critical labor shortages, according to Haruki Seitani, an economist at the International Monetary Fund and coauthor of a working paper on aging and AI in Japan. His research found that as Japan's labor force ages, productivity growth at work falls.

Many older Japanese workers earn money out of necessity, said Yasuo Takao, a political scientist at Curtin University in Australia. Government survey data shows that over half of older Japanese workers were predominantly motivated by money, compared to under 16% who worked to feel fulfilled.

Japan has struggled to expand employment among its older population, he said. Many companies are incentivized to ""retire"" their older workers, then rehire them at lower pay, which Takao said discourages them from ""remaining fully engaged.""

""Japan's wage structure is harsh for older workers because it is built on an aging seniority system that inflates wages in mid-career and then resets them sharply at retirement age to control labour costs,"" Takao said.

Takao said that older Japanese work at rising rates because labor shortages sometimes force firms to retain workers. Each year, more people leave the workforce than enter, and the working-age population has declined by over 10 million since 1995. Projections put the labor shortage at upwards of 6.4 million by 2030, and many companies have opted to automate tasks or give employees more work instead of hiring older workers.

Pension reforms have also made work more imperative for some older workers. Japan has a two-tier mandatory public pension system that relies on contributions, which is ""highly sensitive to population aging,"" Takao said.

Older Japanese workers tend to put in fewer hours compared to their younger peers, although this may be partly due to cuts in pension benefits that apply if they exceed a specific threshold.

""If Japan can transition from quantity-driven senior employment to quality-driven, skill-aligned senior employment, it stands to gain a powerful long-term demographic dividend: higher productivity, lower fiscal strain, stronger innovation capacity and a healthier, more engaged older population,"" Takao said. ""In this sense, treating older workers as a source of economic strength, not a cost to be managed, may be one of Japan's most important growth strategies in the decades ahead.""

Japan's approach to managing its aging workforce — and its shortcomings — can offer some valuable insights into what the US can do.

Takao said the US can avoid the ""Japan trap"" of older workers needing to work by acting earlier to expand phased-retirement opportunities and protect older workers' earnings. Takao added that the US should invest earlier in training and job redesign so that older workers can secure jobs that match their skill sets.

About 40% of female Japanese workers of all ages hold part-time jobs, compared to about a quarter of US female workers, and this rate increases with age. The US can learn from this discrepancy by providing more assistance to women who want to hold steady employment during their parenting and caregiving years.

When it comes to AI, Japan may be a cautionary tale. Japan has a relatively low exposure to AI, as determined by usage rate, compared to the US and China. Seitani said that AI could help aging-related labor shortages in occupations like transportation services, construction, and clerical work. Long-term, this could mean older workers may be less pressured to stay on the job or may have more flexible hours.

Additionally, the research suggests limited mobility between jobs with high and low AI exposure among Japanese occupations. The US can do more to promote technological education for older workers to improve their work outcomes.

Kirkegaard said many countries may have to adjust their lower retirement ages and more robust safety nets as they age, so older residents aren't as reliant on the social safety net, which might crumble if the demand exceeds the available resources.

""Ultimately, Japan's experience shows that aging societies require more than labor-supply fixes. They demand a broader redesign of pensions, work norms, care systems and urban infrastructure,"" Takao said. ""The United States still has time to adapt, but the window for proactive reform is narrowing.""

YouTuber MrBeast is a social-media superstar, with hundreds of millions of subscribers and a business valued at around $5 billion.

He also may be one of the last creators to amass such a large fan base, according to his former talent manager Reed Duchscher.

As social-media algorithms get better at tailoring content to individual user interests, the opportunity for stars like MrBeast, Charli D'Amelio, or Khaby Lame to show up across feeds becomes much harder, Duchscher said.

""If you like travel content, if you like automotive content, if you like health and beauty content, your algorithms kind of stay in that vertical,"" he said.

Social-entertainment platforms like YouTube and TikTok benefit from diversifying their talent pools with more creators rather than becoming too reliant on megastars to drive consumption, he said.

Duchscher's talent management firm, Night, works with other large creators like Kai Cenat and Hasan Piker, but the company is thinking about finding new talent who dominate a particular content niche, even if that means they have a smaller set of loyal fans.

""It's much easier to build businesses when you have a hyper-niche, scaled audience because the product makes a lot more sense,"" Duchscher said.

A food creator could launch a cookbook, while a plant creator could sell a line of gardening tools, for example. Night operates a separate venture arm that invests in creator businesses. Duchscher ended his role as MrBeast's talent manager last year, but he continues to work with the creator on his chocolate business, Feastables.

The strategy of finding niche creators who can sell products is increasingly popular among creator economy businesses.

For example, the investment firm Slow Ventures is writing $1 million to $3 million checks for creators who are popular in a particular content category and have plans to expand beyond media.

""There's going to be a subset of creators that are very entrepreneurial, have deep trust and expertise in a specific vertical, and are builders,"" Slow's Megan Lightcap told Business Insider earlier this year. ""They're founders.""

As the AI revolution continues to disrupt white collar jobs, many of us are looking for ways to get ahead.

As part of my first-person coverage for Business Insider in 2025, I asked people with aspirational jobs their formulas for success — including how tech workers in various stages of their careers landed cutting-edge AI jobs.

These conversations covered a variety of topics, from whether you need a Ph.D. to break into the field to how to earn big as an AI contractor.

But one remarkably simple piece of advice kept coming up: gain real-world experience with AI technology to help get your foot in the door.

They didn't view AI as something that can be mastered from a textbook or in a lecture hall. Instead, play around with AI, like an infant tinkering with a new toy, or ""get your hands dirty,"" to borrow a phrase from a couple of the techies I interviewed.

But what does that look like in practice? Here's how they applied this principle in their own careers.

When Patrick Leung, who joined Google in 2007, first saw a demo for a calling assistant that used AI, which would later be called Google Duplex, he was blown away by how realistic the voice sounded.

Leung joined the Duplex team in 2017. Although he'd been exposed to machine learning and AI concepts during previous company projects, he'd never worked on building models and had to retool himself on the job.

Leveraging the expertise around him, including by having lengthy conversations with colleagues who explained how the system worked, helped him become proficient in AI.

Leung witnessed Google Duplex's public launch in 2018, before leaving Google in 2019 to join a financial sciences company. He's continued to work with AI in the later stages of his career.

At the time of his interview with Business Insider, Leung said the barrier to getting into AI was lower than ever, and encouraged people to apply LLMs to real business problems. For instance, a friend with no coding experience used AI to personalize outreach messages for recruitment purposes at her job and improved her response rate.

If there aren't opportunities to do something like this in your current job, use AI in your spare time and put it on your résumé, Leung said, adding that people who can demonstrate they can wield LLMs effectively are going to find jobs.

Read Leung's full story here.

Sophia Sun essentially put Leung's advice into action when she pitched a project that would use AI to help customers at Kajabi, the creator commerce platform she worked for as a senior product manager.

The tool Sun envisioned would help content creators generate marketing content, such as blog posts and short-form videos, for TikTok and Instagram.

She started working on the project in April 2023, alongside engineering and marketing teammates. Seeing it through to its March 2024 launch was a learning curve for Sun, who had never built an AI product before.

That July, Sun started a new job at Microsoft as a senior AI product manager, and told Business Insider she thought her end-to-end experience with building an AI product helped her land the role.

Sun's playbook for breaking into AI was to find a real user problem, design a lightweight AI solution, and turn it into proof of work. Having good grades is one thing, she said, but building a product that demonstrates your abilities is another, she said.

When OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, Mostofa Adib Shakib knew the world was going to change.

He started his career in traditional software engineering at Snap Inc. and then ZipRecruiter, but became convinced he needed to build AI skills.

Shakib spent time learning about AI from books, videos, and research papers, and he built software projects to gain proficiency with agentic AI, such as a tool to help Bangladeshi professionals optimize their résumés.

In February 2025, he started an AI contractor role with Mercor, which, around the time of his interview with Business Insider, earned him a handsome sum of $6,400 a week.

Shakib decided not to go back to a full-time traditional software engineering job. He said he thought focusing on building AI skills before the market gets crowded was the right bet for him.

While being a full-time employee at a company offers stability and benefits, it would restrict his time, meaning he could only focus on gaining agentic AI skills on weekends, he said. As a full-time AI contractor, he can spread out his hours as he pleases, he added.

Shakib advised people interested in staying relevant in the tech industry to embrace change, rather than fear it, and to focus on upskilling.

Although Devi Parikh completed a Ph.D. in computer vision in 2009, before going on to become a senior director of GenAI at Meta years later, she said not to assume you need a Ph.D. to break into AI.

As the cofounder and co-CEO of the AI company Yutori, she doesn't consider Ph.D.s much when hiring, but looks for people with relevant practical experience, such as training models, she said.

Other potential avenues into interesting AI work include spending time at startups or big labs, or trying side projects that make use of open source code and online communities.

Starting and executing projects has been instrumental to her career success, Parikh said. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, she started working on a YouTube series called ""Humans of AI,"" where she interviewed AI researchers about their daily habits. This gave her more professional visibility than her research alone could.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to forge a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face differences over major issues including territory as Russian air raids pile pressure on Kyiv.

Russia hit the capital and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelenskyy called it Russia's response to the U.S.-brokered peace efforts.

Zelenskyy has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine's contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump's Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.

The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X.

""Good evening, Florida!"" Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the U.S. president's surname on the fuselage.

Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce.

Putin said on Saturday that Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent weeks and months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday.

The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelenskyy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.

Axios said U.S. officials viewed Zelenskyy's willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote.

A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.

Kyiv residents interviewed by Reuters on Sunday expressed a mix of hope and skepticism over the talks.

""I want for this to be over - but this is what our side wishes for,"" said Stanyslav, a 44-year-old soldier who declined to provide his last name. ""We don't have any leverage in this situation.""

Zelenskyy's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.

Writing on X ahead of talks, Zelenskyy said that ""a lot can be decided before the New Year"" but that peace depended on strong support from Kyiv's partners.

Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelenskyy said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90% finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.

While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.

The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.

It has also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where power line repairs have begun after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency said on Sunday.

Zelenskyy, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025.

Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of its territory, including about 90% of Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members.

The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.

Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelenskyy along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained ""a just and lasting peace"" that preserved Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country's security and defence capabilities.

Zelenskyy said he would speak with European leaders after his meeting with Trump.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine was in no hurry for peace and if it did not want to resolve their conflict peacefully, Moscow would accomplish all its goals by force.

Putin's remarks on Saturday, carried by state news agency TASS, followed a vast Russian drone and missile attack that prompted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to say Russia was demonstrating its wish to continue the war while Kyiv wanted peace.

Zelenskiy is to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to seek a resolution to the war Putin launched nearly four years ago with a full-scale invasion of Russia's smaller neighbour.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks.

Russian commanders told Putin during an inspection visit that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Kremlin said on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's military rejected Russia's assertions about Huliaipole and Myrnohrad as false statements. The situation in both places remains ""difficult"" but ""defensive operations"" by Ukrainian troops are ongoing, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in a statement on social media.

The Southern Command of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Telegram that ""fierce fighting"" continued in Huliaipole. ""However, a substantial part of Huliaipole continues to be held by the Defence Forces of Ukraine.""

Verifying battlefield claims is difficult as access on both sides is restricted, information is tightly controlled and front lines shift quickly, with media relying on satellite and geolocated footage that can be partial or delayed.

Online retailer Coupang's founder Kim Bom apologized for the first time for a recent leak of customer data and pledged to unveil a compensation plan as soon as possible, in a statement posted on the South Korean company's website.

Coupang's U.S.-based chairman said in Korean that he ""sincerely apologizes"" for the data breach, which was first revealed in November, and also pledged investments and reforms to prevent data breaches.

Kim has faced intense criticism in South Korea for failing to attend parliamentary hearings held in Seoul earlier this month on one of the country's worst data breaches. 

On Sunday, Rep. Choi Min-hee of the ruling Democratic Party posted on Facebook a photo of a document that Kim sent to the National Assembly saying he would again be unable to attend a hearing, scheduled for this week, citing other appointments. 

""What in his schedule could be more important to him than this hacking incident?"" Choi said. ""Kim is insulting the public."" 

Kim said the company, in cooperation with the government, has restored all leaked personal information and confirmed that data from 3,000 of Coupang's 33 million customers had been saved by a suspect on his personal computer but was neither transferred nor sold to any third party.

Coupang will announce a compensation plan for South Korean customers as soon as possible, he said, without elaborating. 

South Korean lawmakers are seeking to take legal action against the company's billionaire founder, arguing the New York-listed online retailer earns most of its revenue from sales in South Korea. 

Kim said Coupang had worked closely with the South Korean government's investigation into the breach, while maintaining confidentiality.

The comment followed a complaint by the government that the firm unilaterally disclosed information that the suspect was a former employee.

The growing wealth and enhanced spending power of the over-50s is poised to accelerate a range of investment opportunities across multiple sectors in the U.K., according to investors.

Market pros say this age group — dubbed the ""Grey Pound"" or ""Silver Spenders"" — is gaining greater control over its assets. With greater wealth and more discretionary income, a larger chunk of this demographic is increasingly seen as the new ""idle rich.""

Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said that the over-50s were an increasingly influential demographic within the consumer space.

""Those still working might be well advanced in their career, paid off their mortgage, and have lots of disposable cash. They might have worked hard for decades and feel like they deserve to splash the cash,"" Coatsworth told CNBC.

""Those in retirement might be in the generation that received generous defined benefit pension schemes and collect a tidy sum to fund an extravagant lifestyle,"" he added.

Coatsworth said the group wants to protect as much of their wealth as they can from taxation, which means seeking advice on tax, investments, and general financial planning.

Alyx Wood, co-founder and chief investment officer at Kernow Asset Management, said there was a clear subset of winners and losers within this cohort.

Day-to-day life for ""a lot of"" them is still ""quite tough and normal,"" but there are others who are ""just absolutely nailing it in terms of compounding their assets,"" he said.

This latter wealthier segment is developing an appetite for luxury goods ""that they've never had before,"" as well as for ""higher-end"" wealth management and insurance services.

These customers are increasingly seeking out ""content, story, getting involved, a purpose"" that extends beyond traditional passive returns, Wood added.

He highlighted names like insurance group Hiscox and privately-owned wealth managers Evelyn Partners as potential winners as older consumers turn to certain premium wealth management and insurance products.

""The banks are trying to buy back into the wealth management industry,"" said Wood, pointing to the reported interest in Evelyn Partners from NatWest Group and Barclays as private equity owners Permira and Warburg Pincus seek to exit. ""I expect you'll see a few of those.""

Wood, a contrarian stock picker whose hedge fund specializes in U.K. equities, last month outlined a major position on Saga plc at the annual Sohn London investment conference, which he said was also partly a wager on the strength of the ""Silver Pound.""

He said people living their ""Saga years,"" a reference to the travel and insurance brand that focuses on the over-50s, will account for about 60% of all U.K. consumer spending by 2030.

Saga — which makes up about 10% of Kernow's portfolio — is a ""materially undervalued"" business, whose share price could surge over 400% in the next few years, Wood added.

Wood said that Pets At Home, the London-listed specialist retailer of pet food, toys, and accessories, was another name facing near-term pressures that could ultimately emerge as a beneficiary of the trend, as older consumers buy more for their pets and spend less on their children.

""Experiences and material goods will rank highly on their list of places to spend money – such as holidays, nice meals, fancy cars, home renovations, beauty products, wellness,"" Coatsworth said of the cohort. ""The list goes on.""

Coatsworth also said that the healthcare sector was a likely winner, as an ageing population will mean rising demand for medicine and treatment.

""Private care homes, retirement villages and property investors with medical providers as tenants are among the winners from this trend,"" Coatsworth told CNBC via email.

In this article

Heading into 2026, investor focus could shift from fixed-income instruments to attractive dividend stocks, given a lower interest rate backdrop. 

Picking the right names from a vast universe of dividend-paying companies is a challenging task. Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choices, as these experts assign their ratings after conducting a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Oil and gas giant Chevron (CVX) is this week's first dividend pick. The company returned $6 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter via $3.4 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. With a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share (annualized dividend of $6.84 per share), Chevron offers a yield of about 4.5%.

Following meetings with Chevron's management, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on CVX stock with a price target of $178. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on the energy company, with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $164.

Todd noted that while the ongoing scenario of an unfavorable crude backdrop and positive refining business has affected Chevron's performance, his meetings with the management reflected the company's solid position.

The analyst contends that Chevron's capital efficiency is underappreciated. Notably, the company's upstream capital expenditure/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) produced is 29% below the peer average. He added that given the declining capex and operating expenses, the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) that have yet to materialize, and a resource base that is better than feared, Chevron's free cash flow (FCF) annual growth outlook of 10% per year seems conservative.

Additionally, Todd argued that ""while investors may continue to worry about TCO [Tengizchevroil joint venture] contract extensions, lingering post-2030 resource depth questions are misguided."" In this matter, the analyst noted that aside from the projects included in Chevron's official plan, management is upbeat about additional opportunities presented by improved global access (especially in the Middle East), a rise in exploration activities, and expansion and technology-driven prospects.

Todd ranks No. 868 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See Chevron Ownership Structure on TipRanks. 

Restaurant company Darden Restaurants (DRI) owns a portfolio of brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on Feb. 2, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $6 per share, DRI offers a yield of 3.2%.

Following the company's mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on Darden stock with a price target of $225. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $218 with an ""outperform"" rating.

Saleh noted that Darden posted a mixed, but ""mostly positive,"" quarter, with better-than-anticipated comparable sales fueled by improved traffic at the company's major brands.

""Its strategy of under-pricing inflation, leaning on delivery, and offering a desirable menu resonated with guests, driving another quarter of sizable industry outperformance,"" said Saleh.

The five-star analyst highlighted that high beef prices continued to be a headwind and weighed on the quarter's restaurant margins and earnings per share (EPS). That said, Saleh is optimistic about Darden achieving its guidance, as beef costs appear to have peaked, labor cost pressures are easing, and management is relying slightly on price increases to offset commodity costs.

Overall, Saleh continues to be impressed by the momentum in Darden's sales, and although earnings haven't kept pace yet, they are expected to improve going forward.

Saleh ranks No. 641 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.5%. See Darden Restaurants Statistics on TipRanks. 

This week's third dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. The company announced a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2025. At an annualized dividend per share of $1.92, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.5%.

In his latest research note on business development companies (BDCs), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee called Ares Capital one of his favorite BDC names for 2026 and reaffirmed a buy rating with a price target of $23. TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned an ""outperform"" rating to ARCC stock with a price target of $24.

While Lee is less constructive on the BDC space heading into 2026 due to a potential decline in net interest income (NII) and return on equity (ROE) from lower base rates, he remains bullish on Ares Capital. In particular, he cited management's confidence in sustaining dividends at current levels despite expectations of lower base rates.

Among the key strengths, Lee noted ARCC's dominant position in the BDC market, its extensive scale, and strong originations in the Ares direct lending platform. He also highlighted Ares Capital's more than 20 years of experience.

""In our view, ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share generation plus potential net realized gains,"" said Lee to support his bullish stance.

Lee ranks No. 341 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.5%. See Ares Capital Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

About us

Copy link

Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, has issued the country's first-ever crypto-backed loan.

The bank says it issued the loan to Intelion Data, one of Russia's biggest Bitcoin miners. It did not disclose the size of the loan, nor the amount of crypto used to secure it.

“The loan was secured by digital currency mined by [Intelion Data],” Sberbank wrote in an official release. “We believe this product will be relevant not only for cryptocurrency miners, but also for companies that own cryptocurrencies.”

As Bitcoin mining continues to grow apace in Russia, banks appear keener than ever to back the industry with financing and a wider range of options for investors.

Sberbank was careful to call the loan a “pilot.” It did not reveal the type of cryptocurrency used as collateral, nor the length of the loan period.

However, Sberbank hinted that it will look to issue similar loans in the future. The bank said it used its own cryptocurrency custody solution, named Rutoken, as part of the loan process. “This guarantees the assets' safety during the loan period,” Sberbank wrote.

“The regulation of the digital currency market is still in its infancy in Russia,” said Anatoly Popov, Sberbank's deputy chair. “We are ready to work with the Central Bank to develop relevant regulatory solutions and create the infrastructure for launching similar services.”

“This pilot deal allows us to test mechanisms for working with digital security, which could form the basis for future regulation,” Popov added.

The Russian media outlet RBC quoted the Intelion Data CEO Timofey Semenov as calling the loan deal “an important practical example for the industry.”

The Intelion Data chief said it was “an indicator that the market is reaching a new level.”

“If proven effective, this [kind of financing] could be scaled up and used [widely] in the Russian mining industry,” Semenov said.

Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was testing a range of decentralised finance, or DeFi, tools.

It also said that it supports the “gradual legalisation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian legal framework.”

Sberbank rivals like VTB, meanwhile, have gone a step further, suggesting they want to accommodate their customers' desire to buy and sell “real crypto.”

In May, RBC revealed that Intelion Data made $79 million in revenue in 2024, with its data centres using almost 300 MW of power.

The firm is building a mining centre near the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant in the Tver Oblast. It is also developing its own gas power station, as well as turnkey mining data centre construction projects for industrial enterprises with idle power capacity.

The central bank, meanwhile, said this month that it is prepared to let ordinary Russians trade crypto within an annual limit of just over $3,800.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","$1,000,000,000 in Ethereum Just Staked by Fundstrat: Will It Help Price?","https://www.tradingview.com/news/u_today:8567094be094b:0-1-000-000-000-in-ethereum-just-staked-by-fundstrat-will-it-help-price/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 09:49:00 GMT","

One of the biggest coordinated inflows of the year was recently seen in Ethereum staking, and it was not from anonymous wallets engaging in gaming. As the market chops sideways, Bitmine, Tom Lee's Fundstrat-backed company, is aggressively pushing ETH into staking, thereby locking up supply at scale.

A lot staked

Bitmine has staked 342,560 ETH over the last two days or about $1 billion at current prices, according to on-chain data. Additionally, these deposits were not arbitrary. Batch deposit contracts were used to route the transfers, which were divided into clean repeated tranches of 28,320 ETH each. It is not retail noise, that is operational discipline. Bitmine staked 74,880 ETH or roughly $219.2 million in a short amount of time on Dec. 27.

BINANCE:ETHUSDT Chart by TradingView"">

About four hours prior, SharpLink Gaming went in the opposite direction, redeeming 35,627 ETH (roughly $104.4 million). As a result, staking inflows continued to predominate, supporting the larger trend of long-term positioning as opposed to short-term liquidity hunting. This is significant because staking at this level is a structural bet on Ethereum's base layer economics rather than merely a yield play. Each ETH that is locked into staking is taken out of circulation right away.

Ethereum stays trapped

When that occurs during a phase of consolidation or correction, the available supply tends to be compressed just as volatility is beginning to dry up. Ethereum's price is presently trapped below important moving averages, and the chart displays a contracting structure following a protracted decline. Volume is muted, price is coiling rather than trending, and momentum indicators are flat.

That seems dull on its own. Given the billion-dollar inflows for staking, it could be beneficial. Big organizations do not unintentionally stake themselves into vulnerability. When they anticipate that time will favor them, they stake. Ethereum as a yield-bearing infrastructure rather than merely a speculative asset is the longer-term thesis that Bitmine's operations support.

It does not really matter if the price moves sideways for another month or breaks higher the following week. What's important is that a sizable portion of ETH recently became illiquid.

Bitcoin is holding steady within a descending range, showing little directional conviction, while several altcoins are quietly building strength. As the market consolidates, these smaller assets could hint at early upside moves before BTC breaks out.

Key Resistance In Focus: $90,588 And The Descending Trendline

According to a recent update by Kamile Uray, there are no changes in the key levels being tracked on the daily chart, as the focus remains on the $90,588 level and the descending blue trendline. Unless BTC can close above these levels, the current decline may continue. Any upward moves below the blue descending trend are considered corrective rather than a trend reversal.

The first support zone to monitor during the decline is between $83,822 and $82,477. A daily close below $82,477 would signal a continuation of the downtrend and could open the door toward the $74,496–$71,237 zone, marked by the blue box. This lower zone is viewed as a strong support area where buyers may step in.

Thus, a clear reversal confirmation is key before considering any significant upward move. Once confirmed, a rally toward the blue descending trendline could follow, testing resistance levels along the way.

For the uptrend to resume decisively, BTC would need to close above $90,588 and break the descending resistance. Meanwhile, a daily close above $94,130 would confirm that the blue descending trend has been broken, potentially signaling a shift to sustained bullish momentum.

LTF Moves Show Less Impulse, But Structure Holds

Crypto analyst The Penguin noted that the lower time frame (LTF) is showing slightly less impulsive action, though the overall count remains unchanged. The recent moves on the LTF appear more like noise and do not affect the broader wave count, and confidence in a leading diagonal for wave 1 remains intact.

Putting Elliott Wave analysis aside for a moment and leaning on standard technical analysis, BTC is clearly respecting a defined range. As a result, a minor deviation toward the 0.886 level marked on the chart is being closely watched as a potential entry point.

Bullish confirmation will come if BTC manages to close and hold above $90,500, which would invalidate the current bearish scenario and signal the potential for a more sustained upward trend. Until then, the short-term fluctuations are considered normal noise, especially with the yearly open approaching.

On the altcoin side, momentum appears to be holding, suggesting potential upside. Outperformance is already visible in altcoins like XPL, indicating that while BTC consolidates, some alts are starting to push higher.

Imagine snagging one of the best altcoins to buy now at a discount while a fresh GameFi contender heats up, right as holiday liquidity floods back in. Solana trades around $124 on December 26, 2025, after a 57% drop from its $293 all-time high, yet fresh signals point to a rebound.

Enter the Tapzi presale, which has sold nearly 111 million tokens in its group stage, drawing eyes to blockchain gaming's next wave. Among the best altcoins to buy now, Tapzi stands out in Web3 gaming with its skill-to-earn model.

This moment matters for 2025 investors because GameFi projections hit $39 billion by year-end, per industry trackers, up from stagnant play-to-earn setups. Traditional models burned player time without real rewards, leaving a gap for skill-based platforms like Tapzi.

Key players like Hedera and Sui paved the way, Hedera at $0.111 with an enterprise focus, Sui scaling DeFi, but they sidestep gaming's retention woes. Tapzi fills that void, blending chess and checkers challenges with a vibrant NFT marketplace powered by TAPZI, the best gaming crypto currently in the market.

Key Takeaways: Best Altcoins to Buy Now

Solana holds firm at the $118-$120 support zone, December 26, 2025, with RSI at 41.82, neutral but climbing from oversold territory above 30. This hints at easing sell pressure over the next 24-48 hours, especially with trading volume up 94% in the last day. Analysts eye a 13% push to $140 if support sticks, fueled by Bitcoin's 1.3% daily gain and post-holiday rallies.



Spot ETFs launched in recent months add tailwinds, even with modest inflows amid risk-off moods. Grayscale and Bernstein forecast Bitcoin at $150,000 in 2026, pulling Solana along—SOL often mirrors BTC moves.

A Solana-Cardano bridge looms, promising liquidity boosts and cross-chain hype. These factors make Solana one of the best cryptos to invest in right now, trading as a top crypto under 1 cent alternative when viewed against its growth trajectory.

The Tapzi presale captures this energy, advancing through group stages with 111 million tokens sold from its 5 billion fixed supply. Developers allocate 20% to presale, 20% to liquidity, and the rest to team and rewards, creating scarcity that drives circulation and long-term token value. No gas fees let players focus on skill-to-earn matches, from strategy games to quick challenges, building a user retention loop rare in blockchain gaming.



This setup contrasts with play-to-earn pitfalls, where inflation erodes rewards. Tapzi rewards skilled play, fostering NFT demand and community stickiness. Early backers already eye 3x unrealized gains versus traditional projects that drain funds without payoff. As altcoins to watch in 2025, Tapzi's model aligns with Web3 gaming's shift to sustainable ecosystems.

Hedera thrives on low-fee enterprise apps but risks 2026 stagnation at $0.111 amid saturation. Sui pushes DeFi scalability yet contends with price slides in choppy markets. Tapzi carves a GameFi niche, prioritizing skill over speculation, players govern via decentralized models, unlocking NFT avatars and mobile upgrades by early 2026.

These features ramp up token utility, boosting presale demand. Solana's ecosystem, with its speed for DeFi and NFTs, indirectly elevates Tapzi-like projects. Together, they spotlight the best altcoins to buy now amid the crypto revolution, positioning Tapzi as the next crypto to explode for gamers and investors.

Solana's dip offers entry into one of the best altcoins to buy now, while the Tapzi presale accelerates as a top GameFi bet, with 111 million tokens gone, signaling momentum.

XRP Ledger has set the blockchain security ball rolling with quantum-resistant transactions powered by Dilithium cryptography.

The rise of quantum computing has sparked growing concern in the blockchain community, as traditional cryptographic methods face the risk of becoming obsolete. 

In a proactive move, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is pioneering quantum-resistant transactions through the implementation of Dilithium cryptography, positioning itself as a frontrunner in next-generation blockchain security.





RippleXity reports that XRP Ledger's adoption of Dilithium cryptography prioritizes long-term resilience, providing quantum-resistant security essential for today's enterprise-grade blockchain applications.

Quantum-resistant security is no longer optional. As blockchains power banks, corporations, and critical infrastructure, vulnerabilities to quantum attacks could threaten transactions, assets, and trust. By integrating quantum-safe cryptography today, XRP Ledger safeguards its network for the future, staying ahead of evolving technological risks.

Dilithium cryptography, a lattice-based algorithm built to resist quantum attacks, positions the XRP Ledger as a forward-thinking, secure blockchain. By adopting it, enterprises can trust that transactions and sensitive data remain protected, today and in the quantum future.

XRP Ledger's focus on quantum-resistant security underscores a pivotal shift in blockchain: robust protection is now essential, not optional. By proactively addressing emerging threats, it not only fortifies its network but also sets a new standard for the industry, leaving legacy-reliant projects at risk of lagging behind.

This development coincides with Ripple's latest Asian initiative, which explores XRP-based yield infrastructure and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on the XRP Ledger.

As quantum computing evolves, quantum-resistant blockchains will shape the future of secure digital infrastructure. By adopting Dilithium cryptography, XRP Ledger showcases forward-looking security, establishing itself as a trusted platform for enterprises and investors seeking long-term protection in a complex technological landscape.

By adopting Dilithium cryptography, XRP Ledger leads in quantum-resistant, enterprise-grade security, protecting assets today while setting the standard for the next era of secure, resilient digital finance.

Bitcoin's value has risen to roughly $1.1 billion.

Bitcoin's recent rebound is reshaping the conversation around digital assets and prompting some in the industry to rethink long-standing investment habits. As prices climb and interest returns, a representative from LCPC AI described responsible blockchain computation as ""a long-term requirement"" for the sector's future. 

The surge in bitcoin values has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers, highlighting how quickly digital markets can recover from downturns and why infrastructure stability is increasingly in focus. 

Bitcoin's value has risen to roughly $1.1 billion, reflecting renewed investor confidence and fresh capital flowing into the market. LCPC AI in November cited anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and rising interest in decentralized finance as key drivers of this momentum.

At the same time, cryptocurrency consultant Daniel Wong warned that ""the wave of leveraged liquidations highlights the extreme risks of traditional speculative methods."" This insight underscores why some investors are seeking more stable, infrastructure-oriented platforms.

For everyday users, this shift changes how crypto participation works. Bitcoin's volatility — often amplified by thin liquidity and speculative trading — makes short-term moves unpredictable and can lead to rapid losses for investors who rely on quick trades.

LCPC AI offers an alternative: automated contracts that execute and record activity directly on the blockchain. Users can independently verify how each contract runs and settles, making the system more transparent and less reliant on outside intermediaries.

The environmental impact of crypto continues to draw attention. While some operations remain energy-intensive, especially when powered by fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, newer systems are experimenting with lower-impact designs. LCPC AI powers its computing network with renewable energy and uses automated monitoring to optimize efficiency. 

While this doesn't eliminate the broader environmental challenges of crypto, it demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can move toward cleaner, more accountable operation, highlighting the environmental costs of mining and the potential for more sustainable designs. Such approaches not only reduce carbon impact but also make digital investments more reliable and appealing to risk-conscious participants.

LCPC AI also incorporates multiple security measures, including multisignature verification, Cloudflare protection, and McAfee certification. As the market fluctuates, the company frames consistent, verifiable processes and energy-aware computing as tools to help stabilize an industry long defined by rapid swings and speculation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Yuga Labs and Improbable: What Does This Mean for Crypto and Gaming?","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/yuga-labs-acquisition-nfts-metaverse","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 04:44:00 GMT","

What are Yuga Labs' goals with this acquisition?

This acquisition is poised to not just strengthen Yuga Labs' technical capabilities but also significantly expand its potential to merge NFTs with gaming. By acquiring Improbable's Unreal Engine platform, Yuga Labs can build an enhanced ecosystem for its products, most notably something significant for the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). With a robust integrated gaming infrastructure in place, the company looks to build advanced experiences using NFTs.

The goal isn't just for the immediate need of bolstering a gaming title. There's also a broader intent to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate real-time, decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities. 

Why would Yuga Labs need this technology?

We know that Yuga Labs is ambitious, and its plans call for complex and concurrent transactions. It also means that Yuga needs tech that can support a greater number of users without suffering performance issues. This is especially pertinent in the realm of NFTs where high volume, expensive item sales can result in a spending frenzy. 

What are the notable features of Improbable's technology?

Improbable's tech is particularly known for its high-fidelity graphics as mentioned earlier. This means the user experience in Yuga products should be top-notch. Combine that with functional game mechanics, and it becomes a platform that might keep players engaged for extended sessions, which translates to extended periods of potential transactions. There's a lot of promise here.

How does this acquisition impact the broader NFT and gaming discussions?

The need for high-performance tools for NFT projects at this scale is becoming increasingly important. As NFTs are making their way into the mainstream, it is becoming clear that video game capable of producing rich environments is a core component of this broader crypto narrative. 

The concerns about spending and transaction volume are not baseless. If Yuga Labs can marry those two components—performance and transaction volume—there may be a recipe not just for successful, continued NFT adoption but an evolution in how games and crypto work together.

Is Yuga Labs the standard for blockchain gaming?

Specifically, if Yuga Labs is able to provide an example of something done well, will everyone else follow suit? It's a conundrum. On one hand, the industry likely experiences some leaks in user experience and transactions through this effort. On the other hand, can this experience make blockchain gaming viable? 

Right now, most crypto games have a reputation for being pricey, often featuring low-quality experiences to the average user. If Yuga is able to sidestep this through Improbable's technology, what does it mean for the future of the games and the crypto industry that's slowly maturing and becoming better? 

What did Yuga Labs say about the acquisition?

When Yuga Labs publicly commented on this, they provided a slight clue. They wrote, “This acquisition gives us access to foundational technology that will make way for deeper and richer DeFi use cases in our ecosystem.” This hints that they're building something larger than the moment, as is Yuga Labs' style. 

What might we see come from this acquisition?

If we dive into what we might see, it's possible we see NFT-backed loans or financial applications for the projects themselves. But it raises important questions—a higher ceiling doesn't preclude a risk of repeated failures in execution.

There's something teasingly elusive about such a concentration of technical and market power. But Yuga is betting that that will influence things in ways that don't merely encourage repeated failures in other projects. 

Is this the future of gaming?

We are still very much in the infancy of how this might look, but as Yuga Labs champions these gaming technologies, is this the future of gaming? Will crypto entities look to build with these high-performance capabilities? 

The company is building a new frontier, and they'll need to avoid tripping over their own feet to pave the way.  

Can other NFT projects replicate this?

The intersection of crypto and gaming is likely to deepen as others watch Yuga Labs cement its gaming prowess. There's bound to be some wanting to mimic the model, those that can replicate this model will try. But how many companies have an established IP like  BAYC? Are others going to find a similar product? Or are we going to see others reach to higher standards in quality?  

Final thoughts and emerging questions

Unless they find a way to turn it into fiat for cash in the process, it's a tough slog ahead. Even we see that as a serious issue as there is potential risk of users being pushed away as NFTs make their foray into gaming. The metaverse needs its own bid to provide a way for these products to generate their own revenues. 

It's going to be interesting how this plays out over time, but there's probably miles yet to travel this year.

Key Takeaways

More than $6 million in crypto assets has been drained from hundreds of Trust Wallet addresses, according to on-chain investigators and user reports.

The attack vector remains unclear, with early evidence pointing to rapid, automated transfers following wallet interaction.

Trust Wallet has yet to release a full technical explanation, prompting users to take precautionary steps to secure funds.

Reports of a large-scale security incident involving Trust Wallet have unsettled crypto users after more than $6 million in assets were drained from hundreds of wallets. While investigators continue to trace the source of the breach, the lack of clear technical explanations has reignited concerns over the risks of self-custody tools at a time when wallet security remains a critical weak point for the industry.

Reports of inexplicable fund losses have been spreading on social media and blockchain forums in recent days. Affected customers reported that their wallets were drained within minutes, typically immediately after basic interactions like opening the wallet or signing transactions.

On-chain investigators estimate that more than $6 million worth of assets were drained. The losses span several networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. Individual wallet balances were often wiped in a single sequence of transfers.

Blockchain analyst ZachXBT was among the first to highlight the pattern. His findings showed rapid outflows from user wallets into a small cluster of recipient addresses. The speed and consistency of these transfers suggest automation rather than manual theft.

Major cryptocurrencies showed no sharp sell-off following the reports. Still, sentiment among users and developers has turned cautious. Security incidents like this often weaken confidence gradually rather than trigger immediate price reactions.

Security analyst Akinator warned everyone to refrain from using the Trust Wallet Chrome extension

Security researchers point out that the conduct does not reflect traditional phishing. Instead, it suggests a broader compromise, possibly involving wallet software or key management systems.

As reports mounted, scrutiny centered on Trust Wallet's browser extension. Several affected users said they had used a recent version shortly before funds were drained. The timing has raised concerns about a flawed update or an undisclosed vulnerability.

Trust Wallet has acknowledged a security issue linked to one browser extension release. Users of that version were advised to disable it and upgrade immediately. However, the company has not released a full technical explanation or incident report.

There is no confirmed evidence that Trust Wallet's mobile applications were affected. Still, the absence of a detailed breakdown has left many users uncertain about the scope of the breach.

On-chain analysis points to at least $4.3 million in traceable losses so far. The true figure is likely higher. Not all victims have disclosed wallet addresses, and some assets may be difficult to follow across chains. Analysts warn that limited transparency can deepen uncertainty. In self-custody systems, trust depends heavily on clear and timely communication.

The Trust Wallet event exemplifies a broader aspect of self-control. While it provides independence and autonomy, it also places the user directly in charge. As cryptocurrency popularity grows, wallets have become a prime target for attackers looking for direct access to funds.

Until a full technical explanation is released, uncertainty will remain. Even so, the episode reinforces a familiar lesson for the industry: security remains a major obstacle to wider adoption. Each incident not only affects those involved but also shapes how users assess risk and trust across the market.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","Digital euro is near: EU fast-tracks the CBDC project","https://tradersunion.com/news/editors-picks/show/1165263-digital-euro-is-near/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:35:55 GMT","

On December 19, 2025, the Council of the European Union agreed on its position regarding the digital euro, supporting the simultaneous launch of online and offline functionality. The decision removes a key uncertainty and moves the EU's central bank digital currency (CBDC) project into a phase of practical implementation — from architecture to limits and timelines.

Digital euro as a response to changes in the EU payment architecture

Against the backdrop of a declining share of cash in everyday payments and the growing role of private payment infrastructure, the EU is accelerating work on the digital euro as a form of public money in the digital environment. Formally, cash remains a universal means of payment; however, in practice, an increasing number of transactions are processed through banks, card networks, and fintech platforms, concentrating control over payments in the hands of a limited number of private players.

Within this logic, the digital euro is not positioned as a replacement for bank accounts or as an alternative to cryptocurrencies. Its core function is to complement cash and provide citizens and businesses with access to central bank money in digital form, independent of the business models of specific payment providers. This is why offline functionality became a key issue from the very beginning of the discussion: without it, the digital euro would not be able to serve as a полноценний public payment instrument.

Why did the EU choose an online + offline model?

Support for the simultaneous launch of the digital euro in both online and offline modes became a compromise between two approaches that had long competed with each other. On the one hand, there was full integration into the existing payment ecosystem via banks and payment services. On the other, the creation of a digital equivalent of cash with a higher level of autonomy and privacy.

In online mode, the digital euro envisages a distribution model through financial intermediaries that interact with users but do not control the funds themselves. This allows the new currency to be integrated into existing infrastructure without radically reshaping the market. Offline mode, in turn, is designed for direct device-to-device transactions without immediate access to the central system, minimizing data exchange and bringing the level of privacy closer to that of cash.

But we saved everything 🙂.

For the European Central Bank (ECB), such a model, on the one hand, complicates technical implementation and requires clearly defined constraints — in particular, limits on offline storage and spending. On the other hand, this architecture is precisely what prevents the digital euro from becoming just another electronic payment instrument and enables it to function as a universal means of settlement across different economic and technical conditions.

In practical terms, the decision on a simultaneous launch removes the main uncertainty surrounding the project: the EU is no longer choosing between convenience and autonomy but is instead attempting to embed both properties into the core model of the digital euro.

Where the project stands now: Technical readiness instead of concepts

The ECB completed its research phase in 2023, and in October 2025 it concluded the preparatory stage and moved into the phase of technical readiness. This does not concern the issuance of the digital euro itself, but rather the creation of conditions under which a launch would be possible without systemic risks. At this stage, work is focused on the ledger architecture, offline payment mechanisms, holding limits, and the role of financial intermediaries.

At the same time, regulators are concentrating on risks: potential deposit outflows from banks, impacts on financial stability, and the boundaries of privacy. It is in this context that the EU Council supported the introduction of limits on the amount of digital euro held in online wallets. Specific parameters will be set by the ECB, but the overall upper threshold will be reviewed at the political level at least once every two years. This is intended to prevent the digital euro from being used as a savings instrument.

What comes next: Legislation, timelines, and limits of expectations

Further progress on the project depends on the legislative process. The European Commission has already proposed a regulation, but the final decision must be taken by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. According to current estimates, approval could be completed in 2026.

If the decision is positive, pilot tests and initial transactions may take place from mid-2027, while a potential launch of the digital euro for widespread use is being considered on a 2029 horizon. Financially, the project already has clear benchmarks: the ECB estimates development costs up to the first issuance at approximately €1.3 billion, with subsequent operating costs of around €320 million per year, while the adaptation of banking systems could cost €4–5.8 billion.

In a broader context, the digital euro is part of the Single Currency Package — a set of measures aimed at strengthening the role of the euro as both a domestic and global currency. Support for a simultaneous online and offline launch indicates a strategic approach to design, but timelines remain cautious. The digital euro has ceased to be a hypothesis, yet it has not become a tool for everyday payment scenarios in the near term.

What this means for users

For users, the digital euro — if launched — will become another way to make payments in euros alongside cash and bank transfers. Unlike stablecoins issued by private companies and backed by reserves and proprietary circulation rules, the digital euro will be a form of central bank money and will operate within a unified EU regulatory framework.

Another key distinction is the planned ability to use it both online and offline, reducing dependence on a stable internet connection and on the operation of specific payment services.

Separately, the EU and the ECB are embedding parameters designed to protect financial stability and define usage rules: limits on holdings of digital euro in online wallets, enhanced privacy requirements for offline payments, and standardized conditions for access via financial intermediaries. Ultimately, this is not about replacing existing instruments, but about introducing an additional, EU-level regulated payment option with clearly defined rules of use and consumer protection.

Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, has issued the country's first-ever crypto-backed loan.

The bank says it issued the loan to Intelion Data, one of Russia's biggest Bitcoin miners. It did not disclose the size of the loan, nor the amount of crypto used to secure it.

“The loan was secured by digital currency mined by [Intelion Data],” Sberbank wrote in an official release. “We believe this product will be relevant not only for cryptocurrency miners, but also for companies that own cryptocurrencies.”

As Bitcoin mining continues to grow apace in Russia, banks appear keener than ever to back the industry with financing and a wider range of options for investors.

Sberbank was careful to call the loan a “pilot.” It did not reveal the type of cryptocurrency used as collateral, nor the length of the loan period.

However, Sberbank hinted that it will look to issue similar loans in the future. The bank said it used its own cryptocurrency custody solution, named Rutoken, as part of the loan process. “This guarantees the assets' safety during the loan period,” Sberbank wrote.

“The regulation of the digital currency market is still in its infancy in Russia,” said Anatoly Popov, Sberbank's deputy chair. “We are ready to work with the Central Bank to develop relevant regulatory solutions and create the infrastructure for launching similar services.”

“This pilot deal allows us to test mechanisms for working with digital security, which could form the basis for future regulation,” Popov added.

The Russian media outlet RBC quoted the Intelion Data CEO Timofey Semenov as calling the loan deal “an important practical example for the industry.”

The Intelion Data chief said it was “an indicator that the market is reaching a new level.”

“If proven effective, this [kind of financing] could be scaled up and used [widely] in the Russian mining industry,” Semenov said.

Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was testing a range of decentralised finance, or DeFi, tools.

It also said that it supports the “gradual legalisation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian legal framework.”

Sberbank rivals like VTB, meanwhile, have gone a step further, suggesting they want to accommodate their customers' desire to buy and sell “real crypto.”

In May, RBC revealed that Intelion Data made $79 million in revenue in 2024, with its data centres using almost 300 MW of power.

The firm is building a mining centre near the Kalinin Nuclear Power Plant in the Tver Oblast. It is also developing its own gas power station, as well as turnkey mining data centre construction projects for industrial enterprises with idle power capacity.

The central bank, meanwhile, said this month that it is prepared to let ordinary Russians trade crypto within an annual limit of just over $3,800.

Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, has taken a new step into the crypto space by issuing the country's first loan secured by cryptocurrency. The pilot loan was given to Intelion Data, one of Russia's biggest Bitcoin mining companies.

Sberbank confirmed that the loan was backed by digital currency mined by Intelion Data. However, the bank did not reveal how large the loan was, how long it will last, or how much crypto was used as collateral.

To manage the risk, Sberbank stored the crypto collateral using its own custody system called Rutoken. This system keeps the digital assets locked and protected until the borrower fully repays the loan.

According to the bank, using an in-house storage solution helped ensure the safety of the assets throughout the loan period.

Sberbank described the deal as a “pilot,” meaning it is mainly a test. The bank said the goal is to understand how crypto-backed lending could work in practice under Russian conditions.

The bank also hinted that similar loans could be offered in the future, not just to miners but also to companies that already hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets.

Intelion Data's CEO, Timofey Semenov, welcomed the move and called it an important moment for the mining industry. He said the deal shows that the market is becoming more mature and trusted.

He added that if this model works well, it could be expanded across Russia's growing mining sector.

Sberbank's deputy chairman, Anatoly Popov, said that crypto regulation in Russia is still developing. He explained that the bank is ready to work closely with the Central Bank to build clear rules and proper infrastructure for digital asset services.

Earlier this month, Sberbank said it was also experimenting with decentralised finance tools and supports a gradual approach to legalising cryptocurrencies in Russia.

At the same time, the Russian central bank has said it may allow everyday citizens to trade crypto, but only within strict yearly limits.

Cryptocurrencies and related assets, such as stablecoins, pose a threat to the financial system. Central banks worldwide think so and fear losing control over the global financial system if governments allow easy access to them. Over the past couple of months, the Reserve Bank of India has emphasised that even stablecoins, considered a bridge between crypto and the reliability of traditional currency, are a risk. In separate addresses at conferences, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra and deputy governor T Rabi Sankar spoke in detail on these issues. The government must decide whether to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies and related assets. It is a policy decision that could eventually determine our ability to access crypto assets freely. RBI is vehemently opposing it.

A fundamental problem about stablecoins is that they have yet to establish themselves as a ‘stable' alternative to owning cryptocurrencies, the Indian central bank argues. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is maintained by a private issuer through a reserve. However, RBI is questioning the credibility of private issuers to maintain stability. The promise of stablecoins to enable efficient cross-border payments, enhance financial inclusion, and serve as a bridge between the crypto ecosystem and the real economy continues to come under scrutiny.

The most significant risk of alternative currencies is that they will make the US dollar a de facto currency in the country. That means stablecoins holding US dollar reserves could become the currency. It is not a good thing for the Indian Rupee. Goods and services would be priced in different currencies, which would hurt the price stability in the economy. To understand that, you need to know that the RBI's role is primarily to maintain price stability. That means it has to control the supply of money and inflation in the economy. Any disruption caused by the excessive use of stablecoins or other crypto-assets would reduce the demand for the rupee. It would devalue the currency and increase supply, stoking inflation. The primary concern is that it is impossible to control the supply of crypto and related assets. Any price distortion means the values of all assets, as we know them, could change forever.

India has already enabled a unified payment interface (UPI) for digital payments and introduced a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC). That currently makes the domestic financial system efficient. Stablecoins are supposed to do the same for international transactions. However, India is actively working with nations to take the UPI technology global. In such a situation, it is hard to imagine the government taking any initiative to introduce or regulate stablecoins.

What it means

From a personal finance standpoint, you need to be very careful about owning unregulated assets. A primary reason for that is that you have no recourse to any remedial action if something goes wrong. There is no regulatory oversight over stablecoins, and it is not possible to do so across countries. A seamless operation of such asset classes requires a global regulator. National boundaries limit a regulator's ability to enforce its rules. You should understand the implications of investing or using stablecoins. From access to taxation, there could be hurdles at every juncture. 

Governments are unlikely to make it easy for you to convert your money into such assets and vice versa. Whenever new technology or disruption emerges, many people who support human evolution and advancement encourage immediate adoption. However, most experts have advised caution while using crypto assets and stablecoins. A primary reason for that is the threat to price stability. Any run on a currency in one country can spark economic contagion that is hard to contain.

Home - Blockchain & Digital Assets


December 28, 2025 @ 7:55 am By Omar Faridi 

The Securities and Exchange Commission recently filed charges against purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin Tech, Berge Blockchain Technology, and Cirkor, and investment clubs AI Wealth Inc., Lane Wealth, AI Investment Education Foundation, and Zenith Asset Tech Foundation alleging that they defrauded retail investors “out of more than $14 million in an elaborate investment confidence scam.”

Laura D'Allaird, Chief of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit said:

“This matter highlights an all-too-common form of investment scam that is being used to target U.S. retail investors with devastating consequences. Our complaint alleges a multi-step fraud that attracted victims with ads on social media, built victims' trust in group chats where fraudsters posed as financial professionals and promised profits from AI-generated investment tips, then convinced victims to put their money into fake crypto asset trading platforms where it was misappropriated. Fraud is fraud, and we will vigorously pursue securities fraud that harms retail investors.”

According to the complaint, from at least January 2024 to January 2025, AI Wealth, Lane Wealth, AIIEF, and Zenith “operated so-called investment clubs using WhatsApp and solicited investors to join the clubs with ads on social media.”

The clubs gained investors' confidence with supposedly “AI-generated investment tips before luring investors to open and fund accounts on purported crypto asset trading platforms Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor, which falsely claimed to have government licenses, as alleged.”

The investment clubs and platforms then allegedly offered “Security Token Offerings” that were “purportedly issued by legitimate businesses.”

In reality, no trading took place on the trading platforms, which “were fake, and the Security Token Offerings and their purported issuing companies did not exist, according to the complaint.”

When investors tried to withdraw their funds, the complaint “alleges that the defendants further defrauded victims by demanding that they pay advance fees.”

In all, the defendants misappropriated at least “$14 million from U.S.-based retail investors and funneled those funds overseas through a web of bank accounts and crypto asset wallets, as alleged.”

The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, charges the defendants “with violating the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.”

The SEC seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties “against all of the defendants, and disgorgement with prejudgment interest against Morocoin, Berge, and Cirkor.”

The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance has issued an investor alert warning investors that fraudsters may “use popular social media platforms and messaging apps to lure investors into scams, and never to rely solely on information from group chats in making investment decisions.”

The SEC noted that it encourages investors to “use Investor.gov to check the background of anyone offering or selling them an investment.”

Obesity remains one of the most serious health challenges worldwide, and weight loss is often encouraged as a way to lower the risks tied to excess weight. But growing research suggests that the effects of weight loss may change with age. During midlife, losing weight may not always produce the same health benefits seen in younger adults and in some cases, it may also influence brain health.

In a new study from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), researchers examined how diet-induced obesity and later weight loss affected young adult mice compared with mid-aged mice. In both groups, weight loss successfully restored healthy blood glucose control, showing that key metabolic improvements occur regardless of age. However, the scientists also observed an unexpected difference. In mid-aged mice, weight loss led to increased inflammation in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain involved in regulating appetite, energy use, and other essential functions.

Brain Inflammation Raises New Questions

This increase in brain inflammation was detected at the molecular level and through detailed microscopic imaging of microglia (the brain's immune cells). The inflammatory response lasted for several weeks before gradually declining. While the long-term effects of this response are still unclear and may even play a role in achieving metabolic improvements, the findings raise important concerns. Persistent or poorly regulated inflammation in the brain has been linked to memory problems and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's. As a result, the study highlights new questions about how weight loss during midlife may interact with brain health.

Researchers Urge a More Nuanced View of Midlife Weight Loss

""Our findings show that losing weight in midlife is not a simple copy-and-paste of what works in young adulthood,"" said Alon Zemer, an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate and the first author of this paper. ""Weight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity, but we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised.""

Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina added: ""Our study characterizes the body's adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions -- molecular and structural. This high-end imaging by advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enable detection of sensitive changes with potential health ramifications.""

Next Steps for Protecting Brain Health

The research team stresses the importance of additional studies to better understand why this temporary but concerning brain inflammation occurs during midlife weight loss. Future work could help scientists develop approaches that maintain the metabolic advantages of weight loss while also protecting brain health as people age.

The study, titled, ""Weight loss aggravates obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation in mid-aged mice"" was published in GeroScience and supported by an internal grant at BGU (with the Ilse Katz Institute of Nanoscale Science and Technology), and grants from theUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant no. 2021083) and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 194/24).

In horror films, the most frightening threats are often the ones you cannot see. In the deep ocean, scientists are now facing a similar kind of unease, driven by the unexplained absence of a crucial species.

That species is the zombie worm, formally known as ""the bone devourer"" Osedax. Its disappearance may signal deeper trouble ahead, including species loss and weakening ecosystems linked to long-term climate change.

A Decade-Long Deep-Sea Experiment

Fabio De Leo, a senior staff scientist with Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) and an adjunct assistant professor in the University of Victoria's (UVic) Department of Biology, co-led a long-term experiment off the coast of British Columbia (BC). The study placed humpback whale bones on the deep ocean floor and monitored them for signs of life.

After years of observation, researchers found no trace of zombie worms, despite their well-known role in breaking down whale bones and supporting deep-sea food webs.

How Zombie Worms Feed Without a Digestive System

Osedax worms are unusual creatures. They lack a mouth, anus, and digestive tract, yet they survive by drilling root-like structures into bone. Inside those roots live microbes that extract nutrients, which then nourish the worms.

Because of this unique role, Osedax is considered an ecosystem engineer, helping recycle nutrients and create conditions that allow other species to move in.

Why the Absence Is So Concerning

Over 10 years of high-resolution underwater camera footage from ONC failed to capture any zombie worm colonization. In scientific terms, this kind of outcome is known as a negative result, and it can be just as meaningful as a positive finding.

""This was a remarkable observation in such a long-term experiment,"" De Leo says. He adds that the absence may be linked to unusually low oxygen levels at the study site.

Low Oxygen Zones and Whale Falls

The whale bones were placed in Barkley Canyon, nearly a thousand meters below the Pacific Ocean surface. This area lies within a naturally low-oxygen zone and along migration routes used by humpback and grey whales.

When whales die from natural causes or human-related threats such as ship strikes or fishing net entanglements, their bodies sink to the seafloor. These events create ""whale falls,"" which normally provide a sudden surge of food that supports rich biodiversity. The lack of zombie worms at Barkley Canyon suggests that expanding oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the northeast Pacific and beyond may be disrupting these ecosystems.

Early data from ongoing whale fall research near another ONC NEPTUNE site points to similar concerns elsewhere.

Why Bone Devourers Matter

If the ""bone devourer"" is missing, the chain reaction can affect many other species. Without Osedax to break down bones and kick-start the ecological succession process, fewer organisms may be able to access nutrients stored in whale remains.

Whale falls are ""almost like islands,"" De Leo explains, calling them ""a stepping-stone habitat for this and many other whale bone specialist species.""

The Risk of Species Loss

""Basically, we're talking about potential species loss,"" De Leo says. Adult Osedax typically live on whale bones, while their larvae travel long distances through ocean currents to colonize new whale falls, sometimes hundreds of kilometers away.

If those habitats disappear or stop functioning properly, connectivity between whale fall sites breaks down. Over time, this could lead to declining diversity of Osedax species across entire regions.

Other Deep-Sea Engineers Also Affected

The research team also found signs that another ecosystem engineer may be under stress. Wood-boring Xylophaga bivalves were present on submerged wood samples at Barkley Canyon, but their colonization rates were far lower than in oxygen-rich waters.

Slower colonization could delay carbon decomposition and reduce habitat formation for the many species that typically live inside Xylophaga burrows.

""It looks like the OMZ expansion, which is a consequence of ocean warming, will be bad news for these amazing whale-fall and wood-fall ecosystems along the northeast Pacific Margin,"" said Craig Smith, professor emeritus from University of Hawaii, who co-led the experiment.

How Scientists Collected the Data

De Leo and Smith relied on ONC's NEPTUNE observatory Barkley Canyon Mid-East video camera platform, along with oceanographic sensors and high-definition video collected by remotely operated vehicles.

Additional findings are expected in the coming months from a whale fall currently being monitored at NEPTUNE's Clayoquot Slope site.

The research was supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation Major Science Initiative Fund and partly by a US National Science Foundation grant. It also aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14, life below water.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A massive scientific review put alternative autism therapies to the test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082722.htm","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 06:57:06 GMT","

The most wide ranging quantitative analysis of research on complementary and alternative treatments for autism has found no strong evidence that these approaches are effective. The review also found that safety was often overlooked, with many treatments never properly evaluated for possible risks.

The study was led by researchers from Paris Nanterre University, Paris Cité University, and the University of Southampton and published in Nature Human Behaviour. It examined 248 meta analyses, drawing on results from 200 clinical trials that together involved more than 10,000 participants.

What Treatments Were Examined

The researchers focused on complementary, alternative and integrative medicines (CAIMs) used to treat autism. In total, they evaluated 19 different types of interventions. These included animal assisted therapies, acupuncture, herbal medicine, music therapy, probiotics, and Vitamin D supplementation.

Alongside the analysis, the research team developed an online platform designed to help the public explore the scientific evidence behind different CAIMs more easily.

Why These Treatments Are Widely Used

Autistic people may experience challenges with communication, understanding others' thoughts or emotions, managing sensory overload, coping with unfamiliar environments, and engaging in repetitive behaviors. These difficulties can affect daily life and overall wellbeing.

As a result, interest in alternative treatments is widespread. Studies suggest that up to 90 percent of autistic individuals report having tried at least one CAIM at some point in their lives.

""Many parents of autistic children, as well as autistic adults, turn to complementary and alternative medicines hoping they may help without unwanted side effects,"" says Professor Richard Delorme, Head of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Robert Debré Hospital in Paris.

""However, it is necessary to carefully consider evidence from rigorous randomized trials before concluding that these treatments should be tried.""

How the Evidence Was Evaluated

To assess the full scope of existing research, the team conducted an umbrella review, a method that combines findings from multiple meta analyses to provide an overall big picture assessment.

Dr. Corentin Gosling, Associate Professor at the Paris Nanterre University and first author of the study, explains: ""Rather than looking at individual trials, we reviewed all the available meta-analyses, which are a compilation of many trials. This allowed us to evaluate the full body of evidence across different treatments.

""Importantly, we also developed a free and easy-to-use online platform, which we will continue to test. Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment.""

Weak Evidence and Limited Safety Data

Although a small number of treatments showed signs of potential benefit, most were backed by weak or low quality evidence, making the reported effects unreliable. The researchers also raised concerns about safety, noting that fewer than half of the treatments had been assessed for acceptability, tolerability, or adverse events.

Professor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co senior author, emphasized the importance of looking beyond individual studies. ""This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn't just look at one single study. It's essential to consider all the available evidence and how good that evidence is. Drawing conclusions from one low-quality study can be misleading.""

Study Details and Funding

The study Complementary, alternative and integrative medicine for autism: an umbrella review and online platform is published in Nature Human Behaviour and is available online.

The research was funded by Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR).

When Sam Altman said one year ago that OpenAI's Roman Empire is the actual Roman Empire, he wasn't kidding. In the same way that the Romans gradually amassed an empire of land spanning three continents and one-ninth of the Earth's circumference, the CEO and his cohort are now dotting the planet with their own latifundia—not agricultural estates, but AI data centers.

Read more Expired/Tired/WIRED 2025 stories here.

Tech executives like Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison are fully bought in to the idea that the future of the American (and possibly global) economy are these new warehouses stocked with IT infrastructure. But data centers, of course, aren't actually new. In the earliest days of computing there were giant power-sucking mainframes in climate-controlled rooms, with co-ax cables moving information from the mainframe to a terminal computer. Then the consumer internet boom of the late 1990s spawned a new era of infrastructure. Massive buildings began popping up in the backyard of Washington, DC, with racks and racks of computers that stored and processed data for tech companies.

A decade later, “the cloud” became the squishy infrastructure of the internet. Storage got cheaper. Some companies, like Amazon, capitalized on this. Giant data centers continued to proliferate, but instead of a tech company using some combination of on-premise servers and rented data center racks, they offloaded their computing needs to a bunch of virtualized environments. (“What is the cloud?” a perfectly intelligent family member asked me in the mid-2010s, “and why am I paying for 17 different subscriptions to it?”)

All the while tech companies were hoovering up petabytes of data, data that people willingly shared online, in enterprise workspaces, and through mobile apps. Firms began finding new ways to mine and structure this “Big Data,” and promised that it would change lives. In many ways, it did. You had to know where this was going.

Now the tech industry is in the fever-dream days of generative AI, which requires new levels of computing resources. Big Data is tired; big data centers are here, and wired—for AI. Faster, more efficient chips are needed to power AI data centers, and chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have been jumping up and down on the proverbial couch, proclaiming their love for AI. The industry has entered an unprecedented era of capital investments in AI infrastructure, tilting the US into positive GDP territory. These are massive, swirling deals that might as well be cocktail party handshakes, greased with gigawatts and exuberance, while the rest of us try to track real contracts and dollars.

OpenAI, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and SoftBank have struck some of the biggest deals. This year an earlier supercomputing project between OpenAI and Microsoft, called Stargate, became the vehicle for a massive AI infrastructure project in the US. (President Donald Trump called it the largest AI infrastructure project in history, because of course he did, but that may not have been hyperbolic.) Altman, Ellison, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son were all in on the deal, pledging $100 billion to start, with plans to invest up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years. Nvidia GPUs would be deployed. Later, in July, OpenAI and Oracle announced an additional Stargate partnership—SoftBank curiously absent—measured in gigawatts of capacity (4.5) and expected job creation (around 100,000).

Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have also shared plans for multibillion-dollar data projects. Microsoft said at the start of 2025 that it was on track to invest “approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world.”

Then, in September, Nvidia said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, provided that OpenAI made good on a deal to use up to 10 gigawatts of Nvidia's systems for OpenAI's infrastructure plans, which means essentially that OpenAI has to pay Nvidia in order to get paid by Nvidia. The following month AMD said it would give OpenAI as much as 10 percent of the chip company if OpenAI purchased and deployed up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPUs between now and 2030.

It's the circular nature of these investments that have the general public, and bearish analysts, wondering if we're headed for an AI bubble burst.



What's clear is that the near-term downstream effects of these data center build-outs are real. The energy, resource, and labor demands of AI infrastructure are enormous. By some estimates, worldwide AI energy demand is set to surpass demand from bitcoin mining by the end of this year, WIRED has reported. The processors in data centers run hot and need to be cooled, so big tech companies are pulling from municipal water supplies to make that happen—and aren't always disclosing how much water they're using. Local wells are running dry or seem unsafe to drink from. Residents who live near data center construction sites are noting that traffic delays, and in some cases car crashes, are increasing. One corner of Richland Parish, Louisiana, home of Meta's $27 billion Hyperion data center, has seen a 600 percent spike in vehicle crashes this year.

Major proponents of AI seem to suggest that all of this will be worth it. Few top tech executives will publicly entertain the notion that this might be an overshoot, either ecologically or economically. “Emphatically … no,” Lisa Su, the chief executive of AMD, said earlier this month when asked if the AI froth has runneth over. Su, like other execs, cited overwhelming demand for AI as justification for these enormous capital expenditures.

Demand from whom? Harder to pin down. In their mind, it's everyone. All of us. The 800 million people who use ChatGPT on a weekly basis. The evolution from those 1990s data centers to the 2000s era of cloud computing to new AI data centers wasn't just one continuum. The world has concurrently moved from the tiny internet to the big internet to the AI internet, and realistically speaking, there's no going back. Generative AI is out of the bottle. The Sams and Jensens and Larrys and Lisas of the world aren't wrong about this.

It doesn't mean they aren't wrong about the math, though. About their economic predictions. Or their ideas about AI-powered productivity and the labor market. Or the availability of natural and material resources for these data centers. Or who will come once they build them. Or the timing of it all. Even Rome eventually collapsed.

When you've worked in the sleep industry long enough, you're going to hear one question resurface time and time again: “How much melatonin should I take?” The answer will vary from person to person, and the best person to deliver it is your doctor.

To be clear, I'm not a doctor (although my family really wishes I were), but I am a certified sleep science coach and professional mattress tester of five years and some change. Over the years, I've conversed with and attended lectures by many medical professionals on sleep aids and supplements. I also asked David Kuhlmann of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine to give insight into best practices when it comes to melatonin (and sleep supplements, for that matter).

First of all, let's back up. What is melatonin? It's the hormone your brain produces naturally as part of its circadian rhythm, or the internal clock your body has to keep you on a natural, daily sleep schedule. Your pineal gland is in charge of making it, and sunlight signals it to slow down production so you can wake up and go about your day. Though your brain is already producing melatonin, the idea of taking a supplement is that it jump-starts your sleep cycle.

If you've taken melatonin before and felt it didn't work for you, or are considering starting it, this is where you should consult your doctor. And do it before starting any supplement, melatonin included. You may be on medications that won't let it work as well, giving you the impression that you need more. Or you could experience side effects from mixing melatonin and medications. Let's avoid the late-night WebMD doomscrolls and check off that box first.

Another reason to talk to a licensed health care provider ahead of jumping on the melatonin train is that they can give you a tailored recommendation on how to go about getting melatonin, either in supplement or even nutritional form. Or, as Kuhlmann recommends to me, bypassing it altogether, for many reasons—one of which is possible unforeseen side effects, like GI upset. More on that in a minute.

The reality is, supplements are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. The University of Pennsylvania's Regulatory Review has reported that the FDA evaluates supplements on a dietary basis, pretty much like what is done for food or medication. According to Pieter Cohen in an interview for the American Medical Association, the FDA actually evaluates supplements as a “subcategory of food” and not medication. Kuhlmann corroborated this for me, emphasizing that “increased access” and the fact that brands are not as “tightly regulated” in the market have led to dangerous outcomes. He described the uptick in melatonin poisoning cases that medical professionals have seen over the past decade, primarily in kids under the age of 5.

There's a whole lot of gray area for what's OK and what's not before a product hits the market, and even after it's sold to customers. So if an extra (and questionable) ingredient weasels its way into the formula, and the supplement hits the market, there's not much the FDA can do besides send companies a warning letter to recall the supplement. It's the equivalent of shrugging, saying “Whoopsie, your fault,” and putting responsibility on a brand to make it right—which, as The Regulatory Review also points out, they don't always do.

“There's this misperception that because we can buy it over the counter, it means it's safe,” says Kuhlmann. He describes it as a toss-up on how much melatonin you are actually ingesting versus what the product is actually advertising, not to mention any other additives being used and how that will react with your body chemistry. And the crowd is now … worried.

Kuhlmann also expressed to me that he personally “wishes that melatonin would be available as a prescription, not to limit access, but it could help with the quality of melatonin people are able to get.” This is yet another reason why it's much better to get a doctor involved than to throw caution to the wind and get a product that might not be effective or could even be counterfeit. Brands may try to sell you their “secret sauce” with all sorts of claims, and that's not just for melatonin, but for all supplements. Be oh so careful about this.

Two things I always watch for with supplements, even with guidance from my doctor: Does it have a CGMP certification, and is there any data to back up the marketing claims? CGMP stands for “Current Good Manufacturing Process,” which are FDA guidelines put in place for a product's safety. This includes where and how it was made, as well as what it was made of. But even with this kind of baseline, it's hard to tell what additives are used in a supplement and how that can counteract its effects or react with your body chemistry.

I tell you these things out of an abundance of caution. If your doctor gives you the go-ahead to use melatonin, follow their advice. Kuhlmann says he advises his patients to start at 3 milligrams but to never take more than 10 milligrams. For kids, he also urges speaking to a pediatrician and/or a sleep medical professional.

Melatonin also can't do all the heavy lifting, and timing is crucial. As part of maintaining good bedtime habits, he also emphasizes the importance of taking it on time, at the same time, nightly. This will help establish the wind-down routine your brain follows via its circadian rhythm; as we established earlier, melatonin is supposed to lead this process.

If you're keen on keeping melatonin in your bedtime routine, WIRED reviewer Molly Higgins tested and recommends Onnit's Instant Melatonin Spray, which comes in two flavors: mint and lavender. (She tested the latter.) The standard serving size—six oral sprays—equals 3 milligrams of melatonin, which she found immediately made her sleepy. She did find she needed to increase her dosage over time to attain the same result, but, as we established above, it's best to stay within the 10 milligram threshold.

For those of you who are just researching options, consider these alternatives. Diet and exercise, as tired as you may be of hearing that, really are essential to getting good, quality sleep. Case in point: You took a CrossFit class for the first time and are ready to conk out right after you manage to get dinner and a shower. Something else to consider: Perhaps relying on melatonin or a sleep supplement is treating a symptom you're dealing with, as opposed to the actual issue impacting your sleep.

It's hard to overstate the importance of sleep hygiene and bedtime routine habits—a sleep supplement won't be the end-all and be-all. Also, no caffeine after a certain time of day—you know your body best, but I'd say early afternoon at the very latest. Also, I'm sorry to my fellow readers and late-night scrollers, but devices need to be put away an hour or more before bedtime. Blue light that radiates from devices' screens mimics that of sunlight, and your brain can't discern the difference. All it knows is there's still “daylight” that you need to be awake for, and that prolongs the falling-asleep process.

Other alternatives to supplements in the pursuit of better sleep can include sound machines (my favorite is above), where various frequencies of noise lull you to sleep. We've also tested sleep gadgets pretty extensively to not only get us to sleep, but also maintain deep sleep.

And maybe melatonin is a different sort of band-aid over the reality of your sleep situation, meaning that your mattress may need to be replaced. We have plenty of mattresses we've tested for every kind of sleeper, along with the best sheets and pillows. Supplements may not be the answer, after all, but more of a sleep space upgrade—all things to consider!

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Standing in the middle of a field, we can easily forget that we live on a round planet. We're so small in comparison to the Earth that from our point of view, it looks flat.

The world is full of such shapes—ones that look flat to an ant living on them, even though they might have a more complicated global structure. Mathematicians call these shapes manifolds. Introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the mid-19th century, manifolds transformed how mathematicians think about space. It was no longer just a physical setting for other mathematical objects, but rather an abstract, well-defined object worth studying in its own right.

This new perspective allowed mathematicians to rigorously explore higher-dimensional spaces—leading to the birth of modern topology, a field dedicated to the study of mathematical spaces like manifolds. Manifolds have also come to occupy a central role in fields such as geometry, dynamical systems, data analysis, and physics.

Today, they give mathematicians a common vocabulary for solving all sorts of problems. They're as fundamental to mathematics as the alphabet is to language. “If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian?” said Fabrizio Bianchi, a mathematician at the University of Pisa in Italy. “No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”

So what are manifolds, and what kind of vocabulary do they provide?

For millennia, geometry meant the study of objects in Euclidean space, the flat space we see around us. “Until the 1800s, ‘space' meant ‘physical space,'” said José Ferreirós, a philosopher of science at the University of Seville in Spain—the analogue of a line in one dimension, or a flat plane in two dimensions.

In Euclidean space, things behave as expected: The shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. A triangle's angles add up to 180 degrees. The tools of calculus are reliable and well defined.

But by the early 19th century, some mathematicians had started exploring other kinds of geometric spaces—ones that aren't flat but rather curved like a sphere or saddle. In these spaces, parallel lines might eventually intersect. A triangle's angles might add up to more or less than 180 degrees. And doing calculus can become a lot less straightforward.

The mathematical community struggled to accept (or even understand) this shift in geometric thinking.

But some mathematicians wanted to push these ideas even further. One of them was Bernhard Riemann, a shy young man who had originally planned to study theology—his father was a pastor—before being drawn to mathematics. In 1849, he decided to pursue his doctorate under the tutelage of Carl Friedrich Gauss, who had been studying the intrinsic properties of curves and surfaces, independent of the space surrounding them.

Bernhard Riemann is widely considered one of the greatest mathematicians in history. His work revolutionized geometry, topology, number theory, and more.

In 1854, Riemann was required to deliver a lecture to secure a teaching position at the University of Göttingen. His assigned topic: the foundations of geometry. On June 10, despite a fear of public speaking, he described a new theory in which he generalized Gauss' ideas about the geometry of surfaces to an arbitrary number of dimensions (and even to infinite dimensions).

Gauss was immediately impressed with the lecture, which involved not just math but also philosophy and physics. But most mathematicians found Riemann's ideas too vague and abstract to be of much use. “Many scientists and philosophers were saying, ‘This is nonsense,'” Ferreirós said. And so, for decades, the work was largely ignored. Riemann's lecture didn't appear in print until 1868, two years after his death.

But by the end of the 19th century, mathematical greats like Henri Poincaré had recognized the importance of Riemann's ideas. And in 1915, Albert Einstein used them in his general theory of relativity, bringing them out of the realm of philosophical abstraction and into the real world. By the middle of the 20th century, they had become a mathematical staple.

Riemann had introduced a concept that could encompass all possible geometries, in any number of dimensions. A concept that would change how mathematicians view space.

A manifold.

The term “manifold” comes from Riemann's Mannigfaltigkeit, which is German for “variety” or “multiplicity.”

A manifold is a space that looks Euclidean when you zoom in on any one of its points. For instance, a circle is a one-dimensional manifold. Zoom in anywhere on it, and it will look like a straight line. An ant living on the circle will never know that it's actually round. But zoom in on a figure eight, right at the point where it crosses itself, and it will never look like a straight line. The ant will realize at that intersection point that it's not in a Euclidean space. A figure eight is therefore not a manifold.

Similarly, in two dimensions, the surface of the Earth is a manifold; zoom in far enough anywhere on it, and it'll look like a flat 2D plane. But the surface of a double cone — a shape consisting of two cones connected at their tips — is not a manifold.

Manifolds address a problem that mathematicians would otherwise have to deal with: A shape's properties can change depending on the nature and dimension of the space it lives in (and how it sits in that space). For instance, lay a piece of string on a table and connect its ends without lifting it. You'll get a simple loop. Now hold the string in the air and tie its ends together. By considering the string in three dimensions, you can pass it over and under itself before you connect the ends, creating all sorts of knots beyond the simple loop. They all represent the same one-dimensional manifold—the looped string—but they have different properties when considered in two versus three dimensions.

Mathematicians avoid such ambiguities by focusing on the manifold's intrinsic properties. The defining property of manifolds—that at any point, they look Euclidean—is immensely helpful on that front. Because it's possible to think about any small patch of the manifold in terms of Euclidean space, mathematicians can use traditional calculus techniques to, say, compute its area or volume, or describe movement on it.

“If I know Cyrillic, do I know Russian? No. But try to learn Russian without learning Cyrillic.”

To do this, mathematicians divide a given manifold into several overlapping patches and represent each with a “chart”—a set of some number of coordinates (equal to the manifold's dimension) that tell you where you are on the manifold. Crucially, you also need to write down rules that describe how the coordinates of overlapping charts relate to one another. The collection of all these charts is called an atlas.

You can then use this atlas—whose charts translate smaller regions of your potentially complicated manifold into familiar Euclidean space—to measure and explore the manifold one patch at a time. If you want to understand how a function behaves on a manifold, or get a sense of its global structure, you can break the problem up into pieces, solve each piece on a different chart, in Euclidean space, and then stitch together the results from all the charts in the atlas to get the full answer you're seeking.

Today, this approach is ubiquitous throughout math and physics.

Manifolds are crucial to our understanding of the universe, for one. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein described space-time as a four-dimensional manifold, and gravity as that manifold's curvature. And the three-dimensional space we see around us is also a manifold — one that, as manifolds do, appears Euclidean to those of us living within it, even though we're still trying to figure out its global shape.

Even in cases where manifolds don't seem to be present, mathematicians and physicists try to rewrite their problems in the language of manifolds to make use of their helpful properties. “So much of physics comes down to understanding geometry,” said Jonathan Sorce, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University. “And often in surprising ways.”

Consider a double pendulum, which consists of one pendulum hanging from the end of another. Small changes in the double pendulum's initial conditions lead it to carve out very different trajectories through space, making its behavior hard to predict and understand. But if you represent the configuration of the pendulum with just two angles (one describing the position of each of its arms), then the space of all possible configurations looks like a doughnut, or torus—a manifold. Each point on this torus represents one possible state of the pendulum; paths on the torus represent the trajectories the pendulum might follow through space. This allows researchers to translate their physical questions about the pendulum into geometric ones, making them more intuitive and easier to solve. This is also how they study the movements of fluids, robots, quantum particles, and more.

Similarly, mathematicians often view the solutions to complicated algebraic equations as a manifold to better understand their properties. And they analyze high-dimensional datasets—such as those recording the activity of thousands of neurons in the brain—by looking at how those data points might sit on a lower-dimensional manifold.

Asking how scientists use manifolds is akin to asking how they use numbers, Sorce said. “They are at the foundation of everything.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Dollar Is Facing an End to Its Dominance","https://www.wired.com/story/the-dollar-is-facing-an-end-to-its-dominance/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

2026 will be the year when US dollar dilution—the quiet erosion of its global dominance as countries trade and pay in alternatives—starts to build momentum. The more Washington uses the dollar as a weapon, the more the world builds ways to circumvent it.

America's share of global trade has fallen from one-third in 2000 to just one-quarter today. As emerging economies trade more with each other, the dollar is less central to the flow of goods. Indian and Russian trade now settles in rupees, dirhams, and yuan. More than half of China's trade now moves through CIPS, China's own cross-border payment system, instead of SWIFT—the global messaging network long dominated by Western banks. Other trading partnerships like Brazil-Argentina, UAE-India, and Indonesia-Malaysia are also piloting local currency settlements.

At the same time, central banks around the world are starting to accumulate currencies other than the dollar as reserves. The dollar made up 72 percent of global reserves in 1999. Today, it's down to 58 percent—and falling. A currency is safe only if it's perceived to be safe. But perceptions are shifting.

This story is from the WIRED World in 2026, our annual trends briefing.

Ballooning US fiscal deficits—projected at $1.9 trillion in 2025—together with a widening current-account gap, estimated at 6 percent of GDP, are adding pressure to the dollar. On top of this is the overuse of the “printing press,” meaning the creation of large amounts of new money to finance spending. Once cushioned by the dollar's “exorbitant privilege” as the world's dominant reserve currency, these trends now raise questions about global confidence in the greenback.

Even the US Treasury market, once assumed to be infinitely liquid and universally acceptable as pristine collateral, has lost its luster. As of now, there is over $27 trillion in US Treasury bonds—loans from investors to the government, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States—circulating in the global financial system. That means more bonds to trade, more to settle, more to repo, and more to absorb on dealer balance sheets. But large financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citi, and Goldman that have been primary dealers providing liquidity, haven't scaled accordingly. Currently, if everyone wants to sell, there are not enough balance sheets to absorb the selling—unless the Fed steps in. This has been the case since the March 2020 Treasury market meltdown, which marked a historic failure of the world's most liquid and trusted market—US Treasuries—to function in a moment of stress without central bank intervention.

In 2026, the real threat to the dollar may not come from a single rival currency. Instead, it will come from alternative payment and settlement systems built to bypass dollar-based channels—especially in emerging markets that never fully enjoyed the security of dollar liquidity or reliable access to dollar networks.

The race to design alternatives is taking off. One such alternative is mBridge—a project where central banks in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates are working with the Bank for International Settlements to build a system that lets countries pay each other instantly using their own digital versions of national currencies. Another is BRICS pay, which would allow BRICS+ countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and their new members—to send money to each other for trade and investment directly in their own currencies. These are meant to make trade faster, cheaper, and less dependent on the dollar.

Perhaps the most promising competition to the dollar's plumbing comes from stablecoins. These digital tokens enable 24/7, low-cost cross-border payments without relying on legacy banking networks. Today, most are pegged to the US dollar, which extends rather than weakens its role. But if multicurrency or non-dollar stablecoins gain traction, they could become “neutral” settlement rails—allowing trade to clear in any currency and reducing global finance's dependence on US dollar systems.

China, for instance, won't confront the dollar head-on, but expect to see a surge in RMB-linked stablecoins, deployed through Hong Kong, the Gulf, and Southeast Asia. These new stablecoins—some pegged to offshore RMB (CNH), others backed by a basket of commodities like gold or oil—could soon be used to settle real-world transactions: paying for port construction in Kenya, oil shipments from the Gulf, or infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia. Instead of relying on dollars and US banks, countries may increasingly trade and finance deals using these programmable, borderless alternatives, especially in regions where dollar access is expensive, politicized, or slow.

It usually takes a hundred years for one currency to overtake another. But history may no longer move at that pace. With rising technology, the spread of economic opportunity, and the diffusion of digital finance, that timeline is compressing. While the dollar is still king, the cracks are widening. In 2026, the chance of slipping has never been higher.

Sarah Sajedi was visiting Phi Phi Island, Thailand, when she was dazzled by the beautiful scenery of the Andaman Sea. However, when she looked down at her feet, she saw that the white sandy beach was covered with plastic debris, most of which was from plastic bottles.

After many years in the business world as the cofounder of an environmental software company, the experience inspired Sajedi to become a researcher. She had always had a passion for waste reduction, but she realized that the problem was consumption itself.

Thus, as a doctoral student at Concordia University in Canada, Sajedi reviewed over 140 scientific papers to determine the effects of plastic bottles on the human body. She found that people ingest an average of 39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles per year from food and drinking water, and those who use bottled water on a daily basis ingest nearly 90,000 more microplastic particles into their bodies.

“Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency, but it is not something that should be used in daily life,” Sajedi explains. “Even if there are no immediate effects on the human body, we need to understand the potential for chronic harm.”

Microplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 1 micrometer (1/1,000 of a millimeter) to 5 mm. Nanoplastics are even smaller, less than one micrometer. These particles are invisible to the naked eye, but are constantly being generated during the manufacturing, storage, transportation, and decomposition of bottles.

Low-quality plastics, in particular, are prone to release microscopic debris due to sunlight, temperature changes, and physical manipulation. Unlike other plastic particles that enter the body through the food chain, those derived from plastic bottles are of concern because they are ingested directly with drinking water.

Once in the body, microscopic plastics can enter the bloodstream and reach vital organs. This triggers a chronic inflammatory response and exposes cells to oxidative stress, which can lead to hormone system disturbances, impaired reproductive function, and damage to the nervous system. It has also been linked to various types of cancer. On the other hand, the long-term effects on health remain unclear, due to the lack of extensive testing and standardized measurement methods.

Several analytical methods exist for detecting micro- and nanoplastics, but each has its own advantages and weaknesses. Some methods can detect extremely small particles but cannot determine their chemical composition, while others can analyze composition but miss the smallest particles.

Moreover, the most accurate and reliable instruments are extremely expensive and not available to all institutions. Sajedi and his team point out that this technical limitation is a hindrance to uniform research on a global scale.

Governments around the world are working on legislation to limit plastic waste. However, regulations are currently limited mainly to items such as plastic bags, straws, and packaging materials.

In contrast, there is little regulation of plastic bottles, which are feared to have a direct impact on health. While some regions in the US and Canada have begun to take positive steps, a global regulatory framework is still in its infancy.

Plastic pollution is not only an environmental issue, but also a public health challenge. Access to safe drinking water for everyone is one of the basic human rights, but in the long run, a sustainable water supply that does not depend on plastic bottles is needed.

Sajedi's research, which began with a scene she saw on the sandy beaches of Phi Phi Island, may be a step toward visualizing the reality of pollution that is invisible—and at the same time, a step toward changing the consciousness of society as a whole.

OpenAI is looking to hire a new executive responsible for studying emerging AI-related risks in areas ranging from computer security to mental health.

In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that AI models are “starting to present some real challenges,” including the “potential impact of models on mental health,” as well as models that are “so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.”

“If you want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm, ideally by making all systems more secure, and similarly for how we release biological capabilities and even gain confidence in the safety of running systems that can self-improve, please consider applying,” Altman wrote.

OpenAI's listing for the Head of Preparedness role describes the job as one that's responsible for executing the company's preparedness framework, “our framework explaining OpenAI's approach to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.”

The company first announced the creation of a preparedness team in 2023, saying it would be responsible for studying potential “catastrophic risks,” whether they were more immediate, like phishing attacks, or more speculative, such as nuclear threats.

Less than a year later, OpenAI reassigned Head of Preparedness Aleksander Madry to a job focused on AI reasoning. Other safety executives at OpenAI have also left the company or taken on new roles outside of preparedness and safety.

The company also recently updated its Preparedness Framework, stating that it might “adjust” its safety requirements if a competing AI lab releases a “high-risk” model without similar protections.

As Altman alluded to in his post, generative AI chatbots have faced growing scrutiny around their impact on mental health. Recent lawsuits allege that OpenAI's ChatGPT reinforced users' delusions, increased their social isolation, and even led some to suicide. (The company said it continues working to improve ChatGPT's ability to recognize signs of emotional distress and to connect users to real-world support.)

For the last few years, I wore either an analog watch or Xiaomi Band 6 for basic step tracking and time. I didn't opt for an Apple Watch because I wasn't constantly active, I didn't feel the need to check my notifications, and I didn't want to think about charging the watch every day.

This year, I got a chance to test the new Google Pixel Watch 4, which made me feel like I might start wearing smartwatches again. 

I have always had a soft spot for circular watches. One of the first smartwatches I owned was the Moto 360, and I loved its rounded design.

The Pixel Watch 4 has a curved domed Actua 360 display with thinner bezels as compared to last year's watch. I have the 41 mm watch as the test unit, but I would personally opt for the 45mm size for battery and a bigger display. The display is also brighter with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and that makes it easier to use in daylight.

The battery life is great on the Pixel Watch 4, even with the smaller size. I have managed to get more than a day's use out of the watch on those days when I have lighter activities.

Though the Pixel Watch 4 has a proprietary charger where you can place the watch on the cradle like a puck, the charging speed makes up for it. 

Google advertises that you can charge this watch from 0% to 50% in 15 minutes and from 0% to 100% in 45 minutes. While the real-life timing doesn't exactly match these numbers, I saw charging times that came close to these figures. The advantage of this rapid charging is that you can always put your watch to charge when you are making a coffee or doing a quick chore within the house, and get enough juice to last you throughout the day.

I largely used the Google Pixel Watch 4 to track my pickleball sessions and walking. Apart from calorie burns, there were no particular insights into sports-related movement. For the last 15 days, I started going to a gym, and apart from the treadmill and elliptical mode, there aren't any specialized modes for particular gym equipment. Instead, you have to select from options for things like core training, weights, or a general workout mode, based on the workout you are doing.

The watch does have more features for someone who runs — but that's not possible in Delhi weather with terrible AQI right now. It also detects cardio workouts after 15 minutes of continuous activities, but while walking, these have been hit or miss for me. Another measure that has been off for me has been floor count. On days, I've walked to a cafe, I've seen a very high count for that, and on days I have gone up to my terrace multiple times, the number of floors climbed is incorrect.

I am not someone who used to wear my watch or band to sleep. With the Pixel Watch 4, I had to mentally train myself to keep the watch on so I could get a better understanding of sleep and readiness scores. After a few weeks of usage, I regularly wore my watch to sleep. However, you don't get additional or actionable insights related to sleep or readiness score on the watch in the daily summary. You do get suggestions on the Fitbit app related to readiness, but that's about it. With fitness apps adding more AI to their apps, Google needs to step up its game.

Google's new Material UI design for the watch is refreshing and matches the theme on my Pixel Fold. The weather app is very nice to look at for both hourly and day forecasts. My one gripe is that I wish the exercise app allowed for more than three kinds of workouts to be available through quick start. I could raise my watch to talk to Gemini, which is neat, but beyond starting timers, asking for occasional sports updates, and starting a workout, I have not needed Gemini to be ever-present for me.

I have been a fan of the recent Pixel Watch 4 update that lets me use the pinch gesture to dismiss notifications, play or pause videos or music, or even move my wrist to dismiss calls.

The gripes I had about the watch didn't bother me in daily usage. The display is fantastic, the software and fitness experience overall are great, and the display, along with the new design, is an upgrade from the last generation. However, the thing that drew me the most to the watch and made me stick to it is the combo of battery life and fast charging. 

All in all, the Pixel Watch 4 is one of the best Android smartwatches around.

On Macbooks with fans, I started tuning my fan curve with iStat Menus (https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus7/fans/#custom-fan-curve) because I noticed the default curve was lagging behind and thermal throttling kicked in before the fan even reach max speed.For Apple Silicon specifically, I recently discovered that there is a ""high power mode"" (https://support.apple.com/en-us/101613) that allows the fans to run at higher speed. So I don't use the custom fan curves anymore, it helped me a lot (but it does get quite noisy on a 14"" M4 Max)For a Macbook Air, not much you can do besides closing stuff, or elevating the macbook and pointing a fan at it or things like that... but yeah it's a bit desperate!

Environment: I am currently playing with a pid control function for my gpu fan, that is instead of saying ""map temp x to fanspeed y""(fan curve) say ""set fan to speed needed for temp z""(pid control)Question: is there a reason pid type control is never a thermal option? Or put another way, is there something about the desired thermal characteristics of a computer that make pid control undesirable?As a final thought, I have halfway convinced myself that in a predictable thermal system a map would match a set of pid parameters anyway.

For most people a fan curve is more obvious to work with and it's largely good enough without the irritating behaviors insufficiently tuned control loops can exhibit.

reply

Why though? I generally don't care about the specific temperatures of my CPU and GPU, just that they don't get too warm, so for the CPU (AIO) I basically have ""0% up until 45C, then increment up to 100% when it hits 90C"" and the same for the GPU except it's always at 10%.I guess I could figure out target temperatures, and do it the other way, but I'm not sure what the added complexity is for? The end results (I need at least) remains the same, cool down the hardware when it gets hotter, and for me, the simpler the better.I also have two ambient temperature sensors in the chassi itself, right at the intake and the outtake. The intake one is just for monitoring if my room gets too warm so the computer won't be effective at cooling (as the summers here get really warm) and the outtake one is to check overall temperature and control the intake fans. In reality, I don't think I need to do even this, just the CPU+GPU temperature + set fan speed based on that feels simple enough to solve 99% of the things you'd like to be able to do here.

And now am about halfway through building pid fan control software and a janky gpu temp simulator so I can get some intuition on tuning the pid parameters before I set it on my actual gpu. you know, the fun part of computing. But now I am worried that perhaps there is a real reason nobody does it this way.

reply

I think no one is doing it that way, because there is simply no need for it. Sure, when I'm 3D printing some material it sometimes need the heatbed to be exactly 45C or whatever, but why would I care about the specific temperature of my GPU? As long as it's not throttled when GPU utilization is at 100%, I'm good to go.KISS :)

KISS :)

reply

Again though I could be totally off. I just remember that being spread around as “conventional wisdom.”

reply

Yeah, I'd understand not wanting to go between 0C and 90C over and over. But my GPU idles at around 35C, maxes out at 85C or something, and going back and fourth will surely be preferable than staying with a single temperature but voltage clock the card. Especially considering performance.But again, I'm using my card for ML, number-crunching, simulations and VFX, you might be right that the use case of cryptocurrency mining prefers a different thermal profile.

I limit power consumption profiles and clock speeds unless higher power is required, and combine that with an oversized cooling system - keeps regular temps consistent.

I sometimes face thermal throttling because a process has gone wacko, and all I have to do is kill it. But first I have to notice it.I rarely notice until half my battery is gone!

Depends on the environment, back when I had a MacBook, they still had fans, but the new ones are all passive, I think. So then the surface (or lack of it) below it would matter the most. If you keep it in your lap, on top of a hairy blanket, it'll be a lot effective at getting rid of the heat compared to if you have it sitting on a stone table, as just one example.Edit: Seemingly the split of Air/Pro being passively/actively cooled seems to still apply today, so then checking fans, their performance and intakes/outtakes for chaff tends to be the best way, if you have a Pro.

1. Have you considered adding historical tracking/graphing? Being able to see throttling patterns over time would be super valuable for understanding workload impacts and diagnosing thermal issues.2. What metrics are you pulling to detect throttling? CPU frequency scaling, temperature sensors via IOKit, or something else? Would be interested in the technical details.3. Integration with menu bar apps like iStat Menus or Stats could be useful - or even just exporting metrics to a format they can consume.4. For M-series chips, have you noticed different throttling behavior compared to Intel Macs? The efficiency/performance core split makes this more complex.5. Any plans to add alerts/notifications when throttling occurs? Or maybe even automated actions (like pausing backup processes when thermal throttling is detected)?One use case: this would be great for developers running heavy builds or ML training. Knowing when your machine is throttling helps decide whether to optimize code, get better cooling, or just wait it out.

However, this article also seems to imply that frequent cold exposure that converts your own white fat cells into beige fat cells could be effective at both treating and preventing cancer.They state without explanation that cold therapy cannot be done by cancer patients, but I don't see why not. I take an ice bath every morning as it helps with my mental health, and its really not that shocking or difficult when you're used to it as the very adaptation they're talking about here eventually makes it easy to tolerate cold- your body adapts to be able to keep you warm. I can and do still do it when I'm sick, fatigued, or slept poorly.Moreover, before modern climate controlled environments and low cost warm clothing humans naturally experienced cold a lot more often and were probably already cold adapted, even in warm climates. Could modern heating systems be predisposing us to cancer by making our metabolism work abnormally?

Anecdotally, my first 72-hour fast was revealing. Around the 48-hour mark my body aggressively signaled hunger, esp. for sugary foods. By the third day, however, hunger largely subsided, and at break I wasn't hungry at all. For the following week the usual sugary suspects in my life went untouched. Subsequent 72-hour fasts were far more manageable, suggesting at least some component of adaptation.My understanding is that this ability to adapt exists because intermittent hunger and cold were regular aspects of human life for much of our history, particularly in environments without reliable food access (pre-agrarian) or thermal protection.

More generally, it seems inconsistent to assume someone can voluntarily tolerate significant cold discomfort while being unable to manage similar degrees of hunger discomfort.

If it does negate the benefit than that would suggest that the entire benefit from the beige fat is from putting the body in a calorie deficit, and you would then expect the exact same effectiveness from calorie restriction. A quick search shows that there does seem to be an anti cancer therapeutic benefit from calorie restriction, so this seems at least plausible.So this raises the research question of if increasing calorie intake to keep weight stable completely negates the anti-cancer benefits of increased beige fat or not. I'm curious if that has been investigated yet.

I was only raising questions this research and discussion made me curious about, not making any concrete claims.Although the idea of calorie restriction as a cancer treatment is something still actively debated and researched, I personally doubt it is very useful, or likely to be the main mechanism here in the connection between beige fat and cancer, but it is a possibility to at least be ruled out experimentally in the context of the comment I replied to, which is why I mentioned it anyways. One major concern with calorie restriction in humans but not rodents is that it shuts down your metabolism by limiting t3 thyroid hormone production whereas cold exposure ramps up metabolism by uncoupling mitochondria to produce heat. You are correct that the body can shut down processes and systems that might be important for fighting cancer, in response to calorie restriction.I am a researcher that studies metabolism, and actually think the prominent focus on fasting and calorie restriction as a potential medical cure-all has been mostly a dead end, that people were mistakenly led down largely as a result of these fundamental differences between rodent and human metabolism.

“This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote on X in his announcement of the “head of preparedness” job at OpenAI on Saturday. In exchange for $555,000 per year, according to OpenAI's job ad, the head of preparedness is supposed to “expand, strengthen, and guide,” the existing preparedness program within OpenAI's safety systems department. This side of OpenAI builds the safeguards that, in theory, make OpenAI's models “behave as intended in real-world settings.”But hey, wait a minute, are they saying OpenAI's models behave as intended in real-world settings now? In 2025, ChatGPT continued to hallucinate in legal filings, attracted hundreds of FTC complaints, including complaints that it was triggering mental health crises in users, and evidently turned pictures of clothed women into bikini deepfakes. Sora had to have its ability to make videos of figures like Martin Luther King, Jr. revoked because users were abusing the privilege to make revered historical figures say basically anything.When cases related to problems with OpenAI products reach the courts—as with the wrongful death suit filed by the family of Adam Raine, who, it is alleged, received advice and encouragement from ChatGPT that led to his death—there's a legal argument to be made that users were abusing OpenAI's products. In November, a filing from OpenAI's lawyers cited rule violations as a potential cause of Raine's death.Whether you buy the abuse argument or not, it's clearly a big part of the way OpenAI makes sense of what its products are doing in society. Altman acknowledges in his X post about the head of preparedness job that the company's models can impact people's mental health, and can find security vulnerabilities. We are, he says, “entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.”

After all, if the goal were purely to not ever cause any harm, the quickest way to make sure of that would be to just remove ChatGPT and Sora from the market altogether.

The head of preparedness at OpenAI, then, is someone who will thread this needle, and “[o]wn OpenAI's preparedness strategy end-to-end,” figuring out how to evaluate the models for unwanted abilities, and design ways to mitigate them. The ad says this person will have to ”evolve the preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.” This can only mean figuring out new potential ways OpenAI products might be able to harm people or society, and come up with the rubric for allowing the products to exist, while demonstrating, presumably, that the risks have been dulled enough that OpenAI isn't legally liable for the seemingly inevitable future “downsides.” It would be bad enough having to do all this for a company that's treading water, but OpenAI has to take drastic steps to bring in revenue and release cutting edge products in a hurry. In an interview last month, Altman strongly implied that he would take the company's revenue from where it is now—apparently somewhere north of $13 billion per year—to $100 billion in less than two years. Altman said his company's “consumer device business will be a significant and important thing,” and that “AI that can automate science will create huge value.” So if you would like to oversee “mitigation design” across new versions of OpenAI's existing products, along with new physical gadgets, and platforms that don't exist yet, but are supposed to do things like “automate science,” all while the CEO is breathing down your neck about needing to make approximately the same amount of annual revenue as Walt Disney the year after next, enjoy being the head of preparedness at OpenAI. Try not to fuck up the entire world at your new job.

As first reported by Bloomberg, China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission issued a document Saturday that outlines proposed rules for anthropomorphic AI systems. The proposal includes a solicitation of comments from the public by January 25, 2026. The rules are written in general terms, not legalese. They're clearly meant to encompass chatbots, though that's not a term the document uses, and the document also seems more expansive in its scope than just rules for chatbots. It covers behaviors and overall values for AI products that engage with people emotionally using simulations of human personalities delivered via “text, image, audio, or video.”The products in question should be aligned with “core socialist values,” the document says. Gizmodo translated the document to English with Google Gemini. Gemini and Bloomberg both translated the phrase “社会主义核心价值观” as “core socialist values.” Under these rules, such systems would have to clearly identify themselves as AI, and users must be able to delete their history. People's data would not be used to train models without consent. The document proposes prohibiting AI personalities from:

Providers would not be allowed to make intentionally addictive chatbots, or systems intended to replace human relationships. Elsewhere, the proposed rules say there must be a pop-up at the two hour mark reminding users to take a break in the event of marathon usage. These products also have to be designed to pick up on intense emotional states and hand the conversation over to a human if the user threatens self-harm or suicide.

In 2024, DC Comics launched the Absolute Universe, which offered interesting new spins on A-listers like Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, and Flash. The entire line just completed its first full year, and the publisher used the opportunity to brag about how good it's doing. And spoiler: it's doing really good.

Per the Hollywood Reporter, the entire line has sold 8.2 million copies up, as of November 2025. The big earner is Absolute Batman, Scott Snyder and Nick Dragotta's very viral ongoing that sees a blue collar (and pretty big) Bruce Wayne fight crime and reinvented versions of his classic enemies in Gotham. That book accounts for 35% of the Absolute book's success—so around 3 million copies overall—and its first issue is now on its 10th printing. Its five-bestselling books of 2025 include the recent Absolute Batman #15, Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's Batman #158, Matt Fraction and Jorge Jimenez's Batman #1, the publisher's Batman/Deadpool crossover, and Snyder and Javier Fernandez's DC K.O. #1.

Anne DePies, DC's general manager, credited the decision to keep the universe in its own continuity as a big win, ditto its “fresh look that inverted the fundamentals of our characters, and it's an update that surprised our fans. It's not so overwhelming that we are changing everything at once. That made a big difference. We knew it was going to do well, but we didn't know it would do this well.”

Even beyond Batman, the majority of Absolute books are reportedly doing better than 2011's New 52 and 2016's Rebirth relaunches. Those five specific books weren't listed by THR, which is the only outlet to see those retail numbers, but it did note that Absolute Martian Manunter from Deniz Camp and Javier Rodriguez has gotten orders in the six figures, something remarkable considering Manhunter's not high-tier like his fellow headliners.

That book will be ending soon, but the Absolute books will continue for apparently as long as its various creative teams want, so if a particular book's caught your eye, go ahead and jump in.

Rainbow Six Siege goes completely offline as unknown attackers wreak havoc inside the game by giving away billions in credits and more.

Ubisoft has been forced to take all Rainbow Six Siege servers offline after the game was hacked by unknown entities. The company confirmed on X at around 9:10 AM EST on Saturday, December 27, that there was an incident with the title, with its Service Status page reporting an Unplanned Outage across all platforms as of the time of writing. While the company is yet to acknowledge what caused the disruption, there have been numerous reports of players receiving 2 billion R6 credits and Renown, as well as developer-only skins and Glaciers — one of the rarest weapon skins in the game. There have also been claims of random bans and unbans, affecting everyone from ordinary players to high-profile and streamer accounts.

Because of the ongoing chaos, players have been advised to stay offline, especially as it seems that this is more than just a simple hack. Instead, it looks like it's a massive breach with Ubisoft losing total control of the game's backend. The company has yet to explain what is happening, especially as it's likely still trying to figure out what's going on and how it can regain control of the game, but this silence has led to frustration among players. Still, it's likely fighting one fire after another, so we don't expect it to make any announcements anytime soon.

 




While we don't know the extent of the damage yet, it's advisable for anyone with a Ubisoft account, especially one tied to Rainbow Six Siege, to change and update their passwords as a precaution. In the meantime, there's nothing we can do except wait. While there have been larger, more damaging hacks in the past, this is one of the first instances in recent history where an apparent breach has taken down an entire game.

The last big game hacks we remember were in 2011, when the bad actors attacked the PSN and made off with data from 77 million accounts. Online services for the PS3 and PSP were taken down, and it took Sony over a week to explain what happened. Steam was also a victim of a cyberattack in the same year, with hackers potentially stealing information from over 35 million users. However, those attacks weren't as brazen as the ones we've seen today, with the people behind them giving away billions of credits and skins, as well as trolling the ban service as if they're taunting Ubisoft with the amount of control they have.

It just keeps getting better.

If it was becoming too easy for you to navigate the ongoing DRAM shortage, there's another entry on the leaderboards for the most expensive memory you can buy. Nemix, an American company, has just listed a whopping 2 TB of DDR5 ECC RAM on Amazon for $38,999, while you can also find the same sticks in a 4 TB configuration for $76,999.99 on Nemix's website.

Spec-wise, you're looking at four kits of 2 x 256 GB sticks for two terabytes — 512 GB per box, eight sticks total — and eight kits of 2 x 256 GB sticks for four terabytes, running at 6400 MT/s with a CAS latency of 52 across both configs.

Nemix offers a lifetime warranty on these, but a quick Google search shows mixed online reviews, which should weigh on a customer's decision if they're spending this amount on memory. Regardless, the prices are still the main highlight here.

You don't need us to tell you that's car money for server RAM. You can get a Ford Mustang in lieu of that 2 TB setup, or a Tesla Model S instead of the 4 TB option. Even before the current component crisis, server memory has always been more expensive than standard desktop memory because it's registered and error-correcting (ECC), which makes it RDIMM rather than UDIMM.

See, in normal DDR5 RAM that we use in our gaming computers, bit flips occur rarely, but they're mostly harmless beyond a crash. Servers can't afford that; they need the utmost stability, so they choose ECC memory that can actively correct single-bit errors on the fly. The sticks also have an extra buffer chip sitting between the memory and the CPU which helps reduce the load on the latter, and allow for higher capacities.

Therefore, server memory is fundamentally still DDR5, still using the same modules, but it's different enough to warrant the added cost. You've been able to purchase high-capacity DDR4 server RAM for some time. We found Nemix's own 2 TB kit for $13,468.89 on Amazon, which was only hiked by around $6,000 in the past few months. Relatively generous, if you consider the rest of the market.

The DDR5 RAM we're highlighting is new, though, as it landed on Amazon just 29 days ago, when it was $32,997 at the start, then $34,012, and finally $38,999 today, when it was spotted by @FanlessTech. Over the past month, even this kit has experienced a similar ~$6,000 increase.

We should point out that you can build a Mac Studio cluster with 2 TB of RAM for around $50,000, so this might actually not be a great deal depending on who you are. However, if you're running a server and need this kind of pool, you're already past being shocked at these prices. The world moves differently up there.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","Modders are slapping 32GB of VRAM on Nvidia's RTX 5080 GPUs, but that isn't good for gamers — modded variants designed for AI workstations and servers","https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/modders-have-figured-out-how-to-slap-32gb-of-vram-on-the-rtx-5080-as-memory-shortage-intensifies","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

We have seen these types of mods on multiple generations of Nvidia cards; it was only inevitable that the RTX 5080 would get the same treatment.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A report has surfaced overseas confirming that modders have figured out a way to double the RTX 5080's VRAM capacity from 16GB of GDDR7 memory to 32GB. This allows gaming GPUs to be used in workstations and servers, which could ultimately increase their use for AI workloads, potentially creating supply issues. Discovered by Uniko's Hardware (h/t VideoCardz), a Chinese GPU repair technician claims modders are ""successfully"" modifying RTX 5080s with 32GB of memory, and deploying these mods specifically on RTX 5080 cards boasting blower-style cooler designs that are optimized for workstations and servers.

The modder did not explain how the modification process is being done. Likely, modders are adding eight additional 2GB memory chips to the RTX 5080's PCB to achieve 32GB of capacity. This is something Nvidia does on existing models, such as the RTX Pro 6000 and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB, to reach their respective memory capacities using a clamshell approach.

This mod will significantly improve the RTX 5080's capabilities in AI-focused workloads. Depending on how many GPUs a system can house, a workstation equipped with up to four 32GB RTX 5080s can have up to 128GB of VRAM. AI model quality and performance depend heavily on memory capacity, so having more memory enables higher-quality and more complex models to be run.

a gpu repair technician in china claimed 5080 32g has already been a thing.""""目前5080呢已經是可以成功改32G了改32G渦輪所以後期的拆芯片改渦輪呢應該是還是會很多的所以我感覺5080的價格有可能會起飛""""bilibili 智强显卡工作室https://t.co/X9ygzxd523 pic.twitter.com/Y6TGUbbsvoDecember 26, 2025

If this mod becomes popular, RTX 5080 supply could dwindle quickly as AI-minded buyers sweep up existing inventory, as happened with RTX 5090 sales. With the 32GB mod applied, the RTX 5080 can technically run the same AI models as the 32GB RTX 5090 (albeit with longer processing times), at just half to a third of the price (based on the constantly fluctuating prices of RTX 5090 SKUs).

However, the popularity of this mod could be hamstrung by the availability of GDDR7 video memory ICs. The outgoing DRAM memory shortage has created exponential price increases and availability shortages across the entire industry. In 2025 alone, memory prices increased by 246%, and they're expected to keep rising well into 2026.

Graphics cards have thankfully been hit the least among the major products that use memory, but ripple effects from the aforementioned availability issues are still affecting GPUs. For instance, in Japan, shops are rationing GPUs with 16GB or more of video memory. RTX 5080s modded with 32GB of VRAM will likely be made mainly from GDDR7 chips salvaged from damaged RTX 50-series graphics cards that repair technicians have on site.

Regardless, it's cool to see this mod on the RTX 5080, even if it will inevitably be used almost entirely by AI-focused customers. That said, we will likely see some gamers with deep pockets have their RTX 5080s upgraded to 32GB of GDDR7, especially with the rumored RTX 50 Super refresh likely delayed by the ongoing DRAM shortage. If true, this 32GB mod will be the only way to upgrade the RTX 5080's memory until the RTX 5080 Super arrives with its rumored 24GB of GDDR7.

And it will continue to do so.

In 2023, reports of dead Navi 21 GPUs began to surface, raising questions about the cause of the surge. While this was essentially a contained, isolated event that has since been put to bed, we've now received an update to the story more than a year later. Zephyr, a GPU brand from China, has just revealed that it has replaced numerous high-end RDNA 2 GPUs under warranty to date, all of which had dead cores. The company also displayed GPU dies that had died due to cracking, bulging, or shorting, saying there was ""a 1% chance of it exploding every year"" in reference to the odds of this occurring to users.

zephyr西风, a gpu brand in china, showed a tray of dead rdna2 (6800/6900xt) gpu dies, to prove that zephyr is willing to handle rma regardless of whether the gpu die is shorted / cracked / has the substrate blistered.afaik, this is the first time a gpu brand confirmed these… pic.twitter.com/YjgAz1h1JfDecember 27, 2025

The company posted pictures of a tray of these seemingly dead GPUs, all from the RX 6000 family, that it has RMA'd so far. It stated that while other vendors often deny warranty coverage under these circumstances, Zephyr has always honored it and will continue to do so. The post was quite earnest, admitting the brand has taken missteps in customer service while highlighting the good it has done.

There were also two videos showing these cores up close, with various deformities. Most are short-circuited; some are visibly bulging (""growing muscles,"" as titled on Bilibili); and some have cracked dies. All these dead GPUs sit in Zephyr's offices as a reminder of the customers they've helped, regardless of the severity of the damage.

 




At the time when the terminal RX 6000 series fiasco was unfolding, a German retailer had already attributed their death to a combo of the crypto boom and high-humidity storage. However, no manufacturer had come forward to make a statement, as this wasn't a large-scale issue that ever took precedent. Therefore, it's interesting to see a vendor-side corroboration so many years later.

We can argue that the primary goal of Zephyr's post was to flex its muscles as the only brand that will take on warranty claims for dead GPU cores. However, we finally learn that AIBs may have received various fatal Navi 21 cards at the time, making this incident more widespread than previously imagined. Many people still rock RDNA 2 GPUs for their incredible value proposition, so don't let this turn you away from them.

Can your GPU even keep up?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We've seen a lot of brands launch high refresh rate monitors this year, pushing ever closer to that 1,000 Hz barrier, a feat that HKC has now also achieved. Previously, we saw the company tease a 1,000 Hz monitor a few months ago, and now it has been unveiled as the AntGamer ANT275PQ MAX. It's a Fast TN panel with a native 1440p resolution that can boost to 1,080 Hz at 720p thanks to dual mode.

Pushing over 1,000 FPS at 1080p would be challenging for most GPUs, and most game engines don't yet support those levels. So, if 1,080 Hz seems too much in a situation, you can always switch to the monitor's native 1440p resolution that will still offer you 540 Hz, plenty for cutting-edge esports gaming. To support that, the monitor is said to feature DisplayPort 2.1 UHBR20 connectivity.

 




We don't know anything apart from those specs, but we can speculate that it's a 27-inch monitor given the ""275"" naming convention. As a TN panel, we can only expect so much in terms of color accuracy and contrast levels, and we doubt there will be any local dimming on a model focused solely on gamers. Black frame insertion can help; however, it's not really useful at such high refresh rates.

For further context, AntGamer is HKC's sub-brand, while HKC itself is a prominent display manufacturer based in China. They control roughly 10% of the global monitor market and are well-regarded in the Asian region. At the time this monitor was first teased, its price in China was close to $1,000, putting it above several high-end OLED and Mini-LED options.

Speaking of, HKC is also developing the M10 Ultra, in many ways the antidote to the 1,080 Hz Fast TN monitor, since the firm claims it will be the world's first RGB Mini-LED panel. Instead of a white backlight, it will have separate red, green, and blue mini-LEDs making up the 4,788 dimming zones, offering unparalleled color performance. Both the M10 Ultra and the AntGamer ANT275PQ Max will be at CES 2026.

That makes the ""world's first"" moniker a bit cloudy because many vendors are supposed to show off their 1,000 Hz gaming monitors at CES, including Samsung, which just announced the Odyssey G6 that can achieve 1,040 Hz at 1080p, and that's an IPS panel at that. Before this, TCL CSOT has demo'd a 4K 1,000 Hz panel as well, followed up by an 8K 1,000 Hz option, albeit those were not production models.

Christian Pulisic finished the year on a high note on Sunday, something that many U.S. soccer fans hope that he will duplicate at next year's World Cup.

The U.S. men's national team standout tallied the opening score for A.C. Milan in its 3-0 triumph over Hellas Verona in Italian Serie A.

That boosted his total to 10 goals in only 15 matches across competitions in 2025. He also has two assists.

Pulisic has been hampered by injuries, limiting his time for club and country. He is tied with Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez, whose team hosted Atalanta later in the day.

His club moved into first place in the league, a point ahead of Napoli, 2-0 winners at Cremonese and two ahead of archrival Inter.

Right place, right time for Captain America 🔥That's now 10 goals in only 15 matches in all competitions this season for Christian Pulisic 💪🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/mmAwPhwlXQ

Pulisic volleyed home from close range at the far left post a minute into first-half stoppage time. Luka Modric started the sequence that Adrien Rabiot headed to the U.S. forward.

Milan head coach Massimo Allegri told DAZN that Pulisic is far from his best due to his injuries, including a healing hamstring.

“He's doing well, even though he's not yet in peak physical condition because of this minor issue with his hamstring,” Allegri said. “In fact, he makes a few wrong passing choices and is a bit slow in his play.”

During the 2024-25 Serie A campaign, Pulisic recorded 17 goals and 12 assists in 50 matches.

Barcelona President Joan Laporta is currently in Dubai, attending the prestigious Globe Soccer Awards. 

Amidst the glitz and glamour of the event, where the Blaugrana are well-represented, the club chief took time to address the media (h/t FCB World) regarding the most pressing topics surrounding the Catalan giants.

One of the most frequent questions asked by Barcelona fans revolves around the club's transfer strategy. 

When asked if the club will continue to rely solely on the academy or look for heavy-calibre names in the future, Laporta was firm in his defence of the club's identity but left the door open for transfers.

“We are working on producing players from La Masia, and we have many talents capable of reaching the first team, and we are proud of the philosophy we work according to,” Laporta began.

“In fact, there are players from La Masia who reach the first team, and at the same time, we also want to sign other players and integrate them together, and we are proud of this work.”

The president was keen to highlight that this philosophy extends beyond just the men's first team, pointing to the immense success of the women's section as proof of the model's viability.

“We also have other teams, not just the men's football team; we also have the women's football team. And I am very happy about that, as there is a player here representing women's football, and she is also a graduate of La Masia,” he explained.

“All the football sections we work on are witnessing noticeable development, and they are being worked on well and according to a clear philosophy.”

Laporta emphasised that the specific DNA of a La Masia graduate is a competitive advantage that cannot be bought, though he reiterated that external signings remain part of the plan.

“Each team has its own work, and we have many players, and in La Masia, there is great competition. And every player who graduates from La Masia knows the playing style of the first team, and this is very important to us,” he said.

“Yes, we want to add other players; there are players we want to sign to be in the first team, alongside players who come from La Masia.“

When bluntly asked if Barcelona would be the league champion this year, Laporta kept his answer brief but hopeful, stating, “Insha'Allah.”

He also talked about the FIFA Club World Cup, which Barcelona missed out on due to their UEFA coefficient standing from previous seasons.

When asked if he was sad about missing the tournament financially, Laporta laughed off the suggestion that finance was the primary hurt.

“No, no, it's not a matter of money, but a matter of prestige and dignity,” Laporta clarified.

He acknowledged the sporting dip in recent years that led to this exclusion but vowed that the club would return to where it belongs.

“Unfortunately, we didn't participate because in the previous years we weren't in good standing, but we want to participate next time and always, that's our goal.”

Looking ahead, Laporta outlined the team's mindset for the remainder of the season. The objective remains not just to win, but to do so with the style that defines FC Barcelona.

“We are in every competition we play.. Our goal is to play well and try to win. We will see what happens, and we are also always confident in the players to give their best, especially those who performed well last year,” he stated.

“We proceed step by step, respecting the opponent and playing beautiful football. This is the primary goal, then we focus on winning,” he added.

Finally, touching on the event itself, Laporta expressed his delight at being in Dubai and seeing Barcelona players recognised on the global stage.

“A fantastic celebration,” he said of the event. “Proud to have 3 Barcelona players among the nominees for the Globe Soccer Awards.”

Exclusive Interview

Mbokazi compared to France, Brazil legends

Former PSL coach Wedson Nyirenda has likened Bafana Bafana defender Mbekezeli Mbokazi to FIFA World Cup winners Lillian Thuram of France and Roberto Carlos from Brazil.

The 20-year-old stalwart has been a revelation for club and country since making his professional debut for Orlando Pirates back in March.

Since cutting his professional teeth, Mbokazi has established himself as an important figure in the heart of defense, and is set to join Major League Soccer (MLS) outfit Chicago Fire from the Buccaneers after AFCON.

The Hluhluwe-born center-back recently put in an eye-catching defensive masterclass against global superstars in Mohamed Salah and Omar Marmoush, among others, when Bafana narrowly lost to the Pharaohs on Friday.

As a result, Nyirenda, who won the Telkom Knockout trophy with Baroka FC at the expense of Pirates in 2018, says Mbokazi reminds him of former world champions Thuram and Carlos, in addition to David Nyathi, who won the AFCON with Bafana in 1996.

“I have not seen a good defense player like Mbokazi in a long time. I remember the likes of David Nyathi, [Lillian] Thuram of France, Roberto Carlos of Brazil, just to mention a few he reminds me of,” the Zambian tactician said in an exclusive interview with Foot Africa.

What's more, the former Kaizer Chiefs striker believes the player has all the attributes required to succeed in the famed English and Spanish topflight divisions.

“I was believing that he would fit in the English Premier League or Spanish La Liga easily, but all things being equal it is well with him where he has gone,” Nyirenda added.

Having put pen to paper on a deal that runs until 2029, with a club option for the 2029/30 campaign, it remains to be seen whether ‘TLB', as the player is fondly known, will see out his contract with the MLS club.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Amid never-ending criticism over the price of World Cup tickets next summer, FIFA was quick to point to a “more affordable” option when it rolled out tickets at $60 for loyal fans of individual nations. In reality, however, the new “Supporter Entry Tier” barely scratches the surface, leaving the vast majority of loyal supporters shut out from securing any affordable options. 

Soccer's governing body has come under intense scrutiny over the cost of World Cup tickets, primarily due to criticisms surrounding dynamic pricing, which has led to ticket prices surging to unprecedented heights, as described by Football Supporters Europe (FSE) as a “monumental betrayal” of fans. 

The Croatian Football Association (CFA), for example, estimated that it would cost over $4,200 to attend the World Cup Final at MetLife Stadium, while FSE estimated that it would cost over $8,000 for an individual support to follow their country all the way to the World Cup Final — and that is if they were lucky enough to secure the cheapest tickets available in every round through the participant member association (PMA) allocation. 

FIFA allocates 8% of match tickets to individual associations as part of the PMA allocation, but initially made no Category 4 tickets available, leading FSE to estimate that it would be five times more expensive for a fan to follow their country all the way to the World Cup Final than it was in Qatar in 2022. 

Meanwhile, the vast majority of tickets – sold to fans regardless of their national affiliations – can be resold on FIFA's official resale platform, which places no limit on the price that a ticket might reach, leading to some ticket prices ballooning to even greater heights as fans essentially began trading them as stock options. 

Criticisms of FIFA's ticketing policy appeared to force soccer's governing body to relent by introducing Supporter Entry tickets priced at $60 for all 104 matches at the World Cup. But that move does not go nearly far enough to address the affordability issues facing this tournament. 

The low-price tickets represent just 1.6% of tickets at each game, amounting to 0.8% per nation in any given match. For a game at the 82,500-seater MetLife Stadium, for example, that represents just 660 tickets per individual fanbase. 

Those tickets, available to a nation's “top cappers,” do not go far enough to cover all supporters who have loyally followed their team throughout the qualifying process. FIFA has also declined to increase allocations to individual associations, with the new low-cost tickets instead eating into the existing 8% allocation. 

A further 40% of a nation's PMA allocation will be designated Supporter Value Tier tickets, which are more affordable than some market-rate tickets but still rise well above $200. England's Supporter Value Tier tickets, for example, start at $220 for a group-stage game, roughly double the cost of a ticket to watch England against Spain in the Euro 2024 final. 

As a result, a significant number of match-going supporters will be shut out from the affordable tier and forced to pay potentially astronomical sums of money to follow their country next summer. 

FSE issued a statement last week welcoming FIFA's climbdown and stated that the move amounted to a recognition by FIFA of the “damage” its ticketing policies had caused. However, the organization added that the measure did “not go far enough” to address affordability issues at the competition. 

“Based on the allocations publicly available, this would mean that at best a few hundred fans per match and team would be lucky enough to take advantage of the $60 prices, while the vast majority would still have to pay extortionate prices, way higher than at any tournament before,” FSE said in a statement. 

Billy Grant, a member of England's Football Supporters Association who has followed the English national team to every World Cup since 1986, said FIFA's ticketing policy was “not justifiable,” adding that it has created “a lot of bad feeling” among match-going fans. 

Grant added that FIFA's climbdown was “not good enough” because it still prevents a number of loyal England supporters from securing affordable tickets allocated to the Football Association. 

“FIFA has, in effect, turned its nose up at fans who have made the game what it is, made the World Cup what it is,” Grant told amNewYork. 
FIFA, in response, pointed to unprecedented demand, with the governing body already receiving 20 million ticket requests for the tournament next summer. FIFA stated that the tournament's pricing model reflects “existing market practice” for major entertainment and sporting events in North America, also citing North America's established secondary ticket market.
“This is also a reflection of the treatment of the secondary market for tickets, which has a distinct legal treatment than in many other parts of the world. We are focused on ensuring fair access to our game for existing but also prospective fans. FIFA resale fees are aligned with North American industry trends across various sports and entertainment sectors,” FIFA said in a statement. 
 
FIFA, however, did not adjust its pricing models to reflect market trends during previous World Cups held by host nations with a lower cost of living than the United States, including in South Africa in 2010, when tickets averaged $139 per game. FIFA did include a special discounted category of tickets for South African residents starting at $20, a practice it has discarded for 2026. 
Some commentary from US social media has defended the controversial pricing policy, with some accounts almost wearing high ticket prices as a badge of honor that reflects the economic strength of the United States. 






But throughout the rest of the world, soccer has its roots in working-class communities, and the idea of paying the equivalent of a month's rent on a single match ticket is not just unfathomable but opposed to everything the game stands for. 
In Europe, for example, supporters could avail of “Fans First” tickets at Euro 2024, which priced group stage tickets at $32 and tickets for the final at $103. UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, made 14% of all Euro 2024 tickets available through the Fan First tier and provided 37% of all tickets to individual associations, dwarfing similar categories at the upcoming World Cup. 
The result was a festival of soccer across Germany, with iconic scenes of orange-clad Dutch fans dancing in the streets behind a double-decker bus in Dortmund going viral across social media. Some estimates, meanwhile, placed 100,000 Scottish fans in Stuttgart ahead of their clash with Hungary at the tournament.

Grant is concerned that similar scenes will not be repeated at the 2026 World Cup if genuine supporters cannot afford or get their hands on match tickets. Soccer tourists, who do not support a particular nation but may pay an extortionate rate to experience going to a World Cup game, might wear the right colors and make noise at the games they attend, but the atmosphere could be inauthentic, Grant said. 
“You will have a stadium that's full, and people will make noise… but they don't know the songs, and they don't know the actions,” Grant said. 
He also expressed concerns about fan congregations before and after games at the tournament, stating that supporters who picked up tickets to a game involving nations they are not affiliated with will not create the same kind of scenes that genuine Dutch and Scottish fans created in Germany. 
“It's about everything else around it (the World Cup). That's the worry I have.” 
It goes without saying that the Euros do not hold the same prestige as the World Cup, but it is the second-biggest international soccer event by almost every metric. The most recent iteration of the tournament saw 50 million applications for roughly 2.3 million tickets, a figure that would have also seen ticket prices spike enormously if UEFA had deployed dynamic pricing measures. 
The World Cup will almost certainly dwarf that number of applicants, but the issue goes far beyond supply and demand. There appears to be some belief, among a cohort of American social media users at least, that World Cup tickets should go to the highest bidder and fans prepared to pay exorbitant sums of money. 
But FIFA, as a self-described non-profit organization, should recognize that a much larger proportion of tickets should be distributed at an affordable rate on merit to fans who have followed their teams around the world, not based on how deep their pockets are.

Lionel Messi's Argentina has managed to remain one of the best national teams in the world against all odds. Rather than dropping in level, they arrive at the 2026 World Cup in top form, having qualified as leaders of the CONMEBOL qualifiers. Despite this strong performance, Toni Kroos opted to exclude them from his four candidates to win the tournament, instead backing a surprising national team.

After announcing his retirement from professional soccer, Toni Kroos has remained quite active in the world of soccer. In a recent appearance on Romario's YouTube channel, making clear his four favorite national teams to win the 2026 World Cup: “Spain, Portugal, France, and there may be a surprise, I would say Morocco… Germany are always there. I don't see them among the top five favorites, but just like Brazil, if they surprise me, that's great.”

Choosing Spain, Portugal, and France stirs little controversy, as these national teams consistently dominate on the global stage. However, Toni Kroos surprised many fans by selecting Morocco as a top contender. Despite being in top form, considering the African side as major contenders for the title seems bold, given they have yet to reach their first final in the tournament's history, but their promising roster may hint towards a historic victory.

Not only did Toni Kroos's choice of The Atlas Lions surprise, but also the omission of Argentina from the candidates for the 2026 World Cup. Unlike the previous world champions, Lionel Messi's national team has managed to stay relevant, making a gradual renewal of its roster. In addition, it has been shining with a series of victories and a dominant style of play that could lead it to become two-time champions of the tournament.

Toni Kroos of Germany celebrates the 2014 FIFA World Cup victory.

Since the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo as a global superstar in Portugal, they have established themselves as one of the most important national teams. After winning their first three titles in history, coach Roberto Martinez now has a roster where the blend of experience and youth points to dominance in the tournament. For this reason, the veteran star stands out as a clear favorite to win the title for the first time in his career.

Led by Vitinha and Joao Mendes, Portugal have managed to consolidate a very appealing sporting project. With strong offensive play and control of the midfield, they have positioned themselves as favorites to win the tournament for the first time in many years, as the roster no longer depends on Cristiano Ronaldo, who has become the differential player for a team that shines collectively.

Although Toni Kroos does not consider Argentina a contender for the 2026 World Cup, Lionel Messi's team has shown that they are among the best national teams in the world. By keeping players like Dibu Martinez, Nicolas Otamendi, Rodrigo de Paul, and others, it aims to become two-time world champions—something that hasn't happened in 64 years, with Brazil being the last to achieve it after winning the 1958 and 1962 editions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'That didn't help!'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/ruben-amorim-slammed-christian-eriksen-man-utd-comments-midfielder-reveals-squad-feelings-manager/blta03297b2aad75f4d","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 08:34:39 GMT","

Former Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen believes some of Ruben Amorim's public comments about the club's dire state ""didn't help at all"". The Denmark international spent three years at Old Trafford before leaving for Wolfsburg over the summer, and now he is reflecting on his stint with the Red Devils. While the 33-year-old has many fond memories there, he wasn't all that complimentary about Amorim.

During Amorim's 13 months in charge at Old Trafford, he has been very critical of his players, himself, and the club as a whole. The Portuguese recently condemned the ""feeling of entitlement"" at the Premier League giants and said his charges should use criticism and tough moments to prove him wrong. 

He said on the matter earlier this month: ""There is a feeling of entitlement we have in our club. Sometimes, difficult moments is not a bad thing for the kids. We don't always need accolades in everything. We are not helping. Nowadays, they [players] speak and go against the club because they feel entitled. Then, we have legends of the club saying 'if you don't play, leave, because everyone is wrong'. No. Let's stay. Let's fight. Let's overcome. The door to my office is open. That is the way we can solve things [but] nobody is coming to talk to me.""

However, former Red Devils star Eriksen believes Amorim went too far with one set of comments last January.

When United were 13th in the Premier League after losing a fourth home match in their last five league games, Amorim tore into his team. 

""In [the past] 10 games in Premier League, we won two,"" said Amorim. ""Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you [media] want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.""

Nearly a year on from that headline-grabbing remark, former Tottenham man Eriksen, who is now enjoying life in the Bundesliga, has laid into Amorim.

He told The Times: ""That didn't help. Yeah, that didn't help at all. I mean, that was not… I don't think that helped the players at all. Some stuff you can say inside and it's not too clever to say outside, to put extra pressure and put an extra label on the players who were already trying to do their best. I don't think that helped at all, no. Then if he's right or wrong, whatever, but I think for us it was a bit of like, ‘Oh, here we go again. Another headline'.""

Former Inter man Eriksen, who played 107 times and scored eight goals between 2022 and 2025 for United, gave a diplomatic response when asked about his thoughts on Amorim and his managerial approach. 

""Yeah, he came in with his ideas. He tried to change things as you still see, tried to get it his way,"" he said. ""Certain players for certain positions, for a certain style of play, that's how he sees success. He has to change a lot because the players were not used to that system. Also, historically, United always liked a different system. And yeah, he's been very honest and also, yeah, honest with me from the beginning. Very, very, very honest, I would say.""

And despite all the negative press and bad results that United have chalked up in recent years, Eriksen stressed that there was a good atmosphere in the United dressing room.

He added, ""It [the noise] wasn't inside. Around the training ground and stuff, we were pretty protected, trying to feel as a family, and I think we did. But on the outside, there's a lot of pundits, former United players, who have an opinion and also with the fans. So obviously the noise outside - that puts a lot of pressure on you. From the inside, it was more just if you could shut up everything else, I think you would be able to succeed.""

While Eriksen was repeatedly a derided figure at United, he still helped them win the Carabao Cup and FA Cup during his time there. Despite all the ups and downs, it seems the ex-Ajax man was grateful to have been given that opportunity. 

""It was very special for me, I had a very, very good time at United,"" he said. ""It was a big win to be able to come back, to prove myself at Brentford after what happened at the Euros, and then to get the chance to play at United was amazing and something I'm definitely proud of, to play as much as I did.""

But he did admit that it was ""tough mentally"" during parts of his United spell, especially for younger players.

Eriksen added, ""The main thing at United is just the perception of how you have to play and how you have to be as a player, because everything you do is compared to who was there before. So any position, you'll be like, ‘Oh yeah, now we have Casemiro but you have to compare him to Roy Keane,' or, ‘We had [Robin] van Persie here, so this striker now has to be able to do this.' So everything at United is like straight away when you wear the logo, you bring all that history with you, you have to follow up what was there before and change that or make it better, which, of course, is almost impossible when you win [the title] eight out of 11 years in the Premier League. So that puts a lot of pressure on the players and then, obviously, when you get into a situation where you change a lot of managers, a lot of structures, then yeah, it's tough as a player to really succeed.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly wants to put aside his long-running rivalry with Lionel Messi and play out his career with him at Inter Miami. The two sporting icons are among the greatest footballers to ever play the game but they have often been pitted against one another this century. But as the 40-year-old contemplates life after Al-Nassr, speculation is mounting that he may want to be Messi's team-mate in Major League Soccer in one last hurrah.

Both Ronaldo and Messi are in the final stages of their illustrious careers, with few predicting that they would have stuck around for so long when they burst onto the scene in the 2000s. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star has repeatedly spoken about bringing down the curtain on his time in football in the not-so-distant future, while Messi, 38, has been a bit more coy.

Ronaldo said in November when asked about when he may retire: ""Soon. But I think I will be prepared. It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I'm (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes. But Piers [Morgan], I prepare my future since (the age of) 25, 26, 27 years old, I prepare (for) my future. So I think I will be capable to support that pressure.""

Two months prior, Messi suggested he may not play in the 2026 World Cup as Argentina try and defend their title.

""I said it at the time. I don't think I'll play in another World Cup. Due to my age, it's logical that I won't make it, but we're there and I'm excited. I'm taking it day by day, feeling the sensations. And what's clear is that today was the last game here,"" he said.

However, the veteran signed a new deal with Miami until the end of the 2028 season, so it seems he doesn't want to retire for a while yet.

Messi and Ronaldo have battled one another for the biggest prizes, both for their respective teams and individually. They had a duopoly on the Ballon d'Or award, with 11 wins between them, and despite being intense rivals, there has always been a strong current of respect for one another.

Previously, Messi said on Ronaldo: ""We try to achieve the best every year for our team, and what is said outside of that I don't think is very important. He is a phenomenal player with a lot of quality. All the world knows, and that is why he is one of the best of the world.""

And in return, the Portuguese once admitted, ""Of course I have affection for Leo Messi. We've been on stage together for 15 years. I remember translating English for him at the Galas because he didn't speak English well. He always treated me well and respected me.""

In an article from Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo, Ronaldo has 'given orders to his agents to offer him to Inter Miami', putting aside a lengthy rivalry with the Argentina international. He is said to be open to a much lower salary than the one he commands at Al-Nassr, which is said to be in excess of £3 million a week. The publication lays out five reasons why Ronaldo, whose current deal runs until 2027, wants to scratch that itch of never playing alongside Messi.

The first reported reason is that the ex-Juventus man is 'tired' of playing in Saudi Arabia, with the forward 'insulted' that more spectators watch camel races than his Al-Nassr games. The second is said to be that 'internationally renowned' dermatologist, Dr. Rosado, assured him that the Saudi sun is not the best for his 'delicate' skin but the Miami climate, for example, would be more suitable. Thirdly, the Portugal international is 'obsessed' with his physical condition, with Ronaldo well aware that if he 'walks his six pack on the warm sands of South Beach (Miami), his number of fans will rise like foam'.

Moreover, the former Sporting CP ace is said to be keen on dedicating himself to cinema, and there are rumours he could feature in the latest instalment of the Terminator franchise. And finally, Ronaldo, who is determined to break more footballing records, knows that Messi is the only player who can snatch more personal milestones away from him. Therefore, if he plays with him at Miami, he can 'covertly take away' free-kicks and penalties from the former Barcelona man, while taking advantage of his 'magical assists'. Plus, he has a good relationship with Miami co-owner David Beckham.

If you're finding this hard to believe, then it's for good reason. December 28 is the equivalent of April Fool's Day in Spain, tricking readers abroad but not domestically. Ergo, this is not going to happen. One clue is that the author of the article is Ricardo Tubbs, a fictional character from the Miami Vice TV show. So, it seems Ronaldo and Messi won't play together after all.

Incidentally, while Messi is enjoying his off-season break after guiding Miami to their first-ever MLS Cup, Ronaldo is likely to be focusing on ending the year on a high when his table-topping Al-Nassr side travel to Al-Ittifaq on Tuesday evening in the Saudi league.

Marcus Rashford has passed a Barcelona referendum as members voted in favour of signing the England forward permanently. Rashford move to the reigning La Liga champions on loan from Manchester United over the summer having been outcast by head coach Ruben Amorim. And the 28-year-old has made an impressive impact for the Blaugrana, who may be prepared to extend his stay in Spain.

Rashford has been instrumental in Barcelona's fine start to the season having provided six assists and scored an additional two goals for Hansi Flick's side. After a minor blip, Barcelona capitalised upon Real Madrid's downturn in form to head into La Liga's winter break top of the table.

A 2-0 victory at Villarreal last weekend extended Barcelona's winning run to eight matches as they maintained their lead at the top of the table to four points. And as Barcelona continue to shine domestically, members have voted in favour of making Rashford's move permanent.

In a poll from Catalan outlet Mundo Deportivo put to Barca club members, 54.6% of those surveyed support his permanent signing, while 35.6% oppose retaining Rashford's services. A further 6.3% believe it is best to wait until the end of the season before deciding the striker's future at Spotify Camp Nou.

The vote will come as a boost for Rashford, who admitted earlier this month that he wants to stay at Barcelona.

Speaking with Spanish publication SPORT, Rashford said: ""What I want is to stay at Barca. It's the ultimate goal, but it's not the reason I'm training hard and giving my all. The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.""

Asked about his early impressions of the city and how he has settled in at the club, Rashford replied: ""I'm settling in really well at the club and in the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt very welcomed.

""For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies; last season was fantastic, but life moves very fast, things change, and the goal is to repeat those successes. I'm totally focused on that. Everything has been fantastic with the staff and my teammates; I have no complaints.""

And Rashford stated that he is in the ""perfect place"" to continue his career: ""I'm in the perfect place and environment to continue my journey as a footballer, so I'm just trying to give my best every day and help the team win. We'll see what happens next summer.""

Barcelona boss Flick has also previously spoken highly of Rashford, as the German insisted that the on-loan forward had the ""right mindset"" to succeed with the Spanish giants. ""When I talk to the players, I explain why they didn't play,"" Flick said recently. ""When I tried to explain to Rashford why he wasn't a starter, he said: 'You don't need to explain to me.' The important thing is that the team wins and we get the three points. Nothing else matters. This is the right mindset and I'm glad it's with us.""

However, while the members' poll was favourable for Rashford, the same couldn't be said for teammate Robert Lewandowski. The Poland international's current deal expires at the end of the season, though Barcelona have an option to extend his deal by a further year.

59.3% of members surveyed answered 'no' to extending Lewandowski's stay at the club, while just 31.6% voted to retain the 37-year-old's services. 5.3% did not express an opinion on Lewandowski's future and 3.6% claimed they would decide based on terms of the striker's new contract.

The members vote comes after Lewandowski confirmed a story that Barcelona had asked the former Bayern Munich hitman to not score goals in a money-saving measure at the end of the 2022-23 La Liga season. With the title already sewn up, and Lewandowski on 23 league goals, the experienced striker was requested to refrain from hitting the back of the net in the final weeks of the season. Two more goals would have triggered an additional €2.5m to former club Bayern with Barcelona enduring financial difficulties, senior figures were keen to avoid extra outgoing costs.

During an interview with Polish journalist Bogdan Rymanowski, Lewandowski admitted that the report was correct, acknowledging the request and the broader context behind the ask. ""There are things I don't want to talk about. I respect Barcelona and the people who work there a lot. I was aware of the club's situation. There were many other situations that needed to be resolved for the good of the club,"" Lewandowski said.

The striker addressed the logic directly, confirming the motivation was monetary rather than tactical, adding: ""In short, it was a bonus, and it is known that at that time Barcelona looked to save every euro. It was no small thing, and for me, nothing changed either.

Lewandowski, though, added the request left a lasting impression, stating: ""I have no problem with that, but it stuck in my head and I wondered whether to score a goal or not.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Christian Eriksen has backed striker Harry Kane to one day return to Tottenham. Kane left Spurs for Bayern Munich in 2023 and has become a revelation with the Bundesliga giants, earning his first piece of silverware of his career last season. And the Danish creator, who spent six-and-a-half years in north London, is hoping to see the England captain back in a Spurs shirt.

Kane has been heavily linked with a move back to Tottenham next year despite his Bayern contract running until 2027. The 32-year-old, who has scored 19 league goals this season, has previously stated how happy he is in Germany, describing the move to Bayern as ""one of the best decisions in my life"".

""The move has been one of the best decisions in my life. I've loved every moment of it,"" Kane said ahead of Bayern's Champions League meeting with Arsenal last month. ""To experience a new league, to experience a team like Bayern Munich and to have these European nights, have the the atmosphere in the German league and to surround myself in different cultures with different players - I think has been a great step in my career.""

""I think it has helped me evolve and improve as a player. I think you're seeing that version of me right now.""

The striker has admitted he is open to extending his stay with the Bavarian powerhouse, stating: ""I'm quite open to staying longer. With the way we are right now and the way we're playing, I feel like we're one of the best teams in Europe. So I don't look at any other team and feel I want to go there to improve. 

""I've got 18 months left on my contract, and I'm sure there'll be some discussions over the next couple of months on the future and on what Bayern want to do. I'm really happy here though, and I can't see anything changing in the near future.""

Eriksen, who now plies his trade for Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg, remains hopeful that Kane's career will one day come full circle and he'll return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the future. The 33-year-old believes it would be a ""special reunion"" for both player and club should Kane secure a switch back to Spurs.

""I would love to see him back at Spurs,"" Eriksen told The Times. ""From the outside, I would love to see that because it would be a special reunion both for him and the club. It's his decision, right or wrong, but as a fan it would be fun to watch.""

Both former Spurs stars will reunite after the Bundesliga's traditional 'Winterpause' when Bayern host Wolfsburg next month. Vincent Kompany's Bayern side currently lead Germany's top tier having won 13 of their opening 15 league matches, and are nine points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund.

The Wolves, meanwhile, are enduring a sub-par season and they sit just three points above the Bundesliga's relegation playoff spot, though won two of their three games before the domestic break.

Many felt Eriksen would never play football again when he collapsed during a Euro 2020 meeting between Denmark and Finland. The midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and ""died for five minutes"" as he went to receive a throw-in in the 42nd minute, though fortunately UEFA and the Danish FA confirmed that the creative star had been stabilised and awake an hour after the incident. 

And while some may be affected by playing with an ICD device, Eriksen insists it's just another piece of kit now. ""Honestly, I don't think about it,"" Eriksen said. ""In the game, or training, I don't know why, but I just don't think about it any more. There's nothing negative in that way at all. It's just part of me.""

The Danish dynamo added how regularly he needs to have the batteries changed in the device, stating: ""I have to change them every 15 years I think. So yeah, ten years to go. ""They check it in the hospital on a computer, then you see how long before the battery changes and then you go again. It's always there. I have to have it, and I want to. Fortunately, you don't feel the batteries running out.""

After having his ICD fitted, Eriksen had his contract at Inter terminated by mutual consent as Italian laws forbid him from playing with such a device fitted. He joined Brentford on a free transfer under his former Danish youth coach Thomas Frank on a six-month deal. At the end of that contract, Eriksen then signed for Manchester United, and though he was linked with a return to Tottenham, such a move never materialised.

""I didn't hear anything from Tottenham. I was thinking there was more a media interest than a club interest,"" he said. ""To be honest, I would have loved to go back, but it didn't happen, so it was OK.""

Eriksen also threw his support behind Frank, who is under fire as Spurs boss following his appointment last June. ""First of all, he definitely has the capabilities to manage a big club,"" he added. ""To build Brentford up and to keep that going for a long time, progressing every season, shows his ability. I've seen all the Spurs stuff now, turning on him and seeing the results, which is normal, you are in the [big] six, you have to win every game. But I'm sure he's going to change it into his own way and make it something very positive because you have everything you need at Spurs, it's just about getting it to click. I'm sure Thomas is the right man for it.

""The fans want to be entertained in a football way as well, which puts extra pressure on. It's about winning games, but also how you go into the games. Thomas will read it and see where it goes. Often it's the more defensive teams that win more trophies, let's say that, but at the same time, that's not how you go forward at Spurs. You need a bit of flair.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United youngster Ayden Heaven has taken a major step toward defining his international future after deciding against a switch to Ghana, despite World Cup eligibility. The 19-year-old defender is instead focused on representing England at the senior level, a stance that reflects his growing confidence after an impressive run of performances at Old Trafford.

Heaven has opted to commit his international future to England, ruling out a potential switch to Ghana ahead of next summer's World Cup, per the BBC. Born in London, Heaven qualifies to play for Ghana through a grandparent, and officials from the Ghana FA have been tracking his progress closely over the past year.

The timing of the decision carried added intrigue given the tournament draw. Ghana have been placed in the same World Cup group as England, alongside Croatia and Panama, meaning Heaven could theoretically have faced the Three Lions had he chosen to change allegiance. However, the report indicates the teenager is determined to pursue his long-term ambition of breaking into England's senior setup.

Heaven has represented England consistently at the youth level and remains firmly in that pathway. His decision comes amid a period of rapid development at club level, with the defender establishing himself in Manchester United's first-team picture following his February move from Arsenal.

Ruben Amorim has been vocal in his praise of Heaven's progress, highlighting why the teenager feels confident enough to set his sights high on the international stage. Speaking after recent performances, Amorim said: ""I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game.""

The United boss pointed to Heaven's composure and learning curve as key traits behind his rise. ""He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game,"" Amorim explained, underlining the defender's ability to adapt even within matches.

Amorim also hinted at how quickly Heaven has gone from squad option to serious contender. ""He trained really well and, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place,"" he added, a statement that reinforces why Heaven now sees England, rather than Ghana, as the ultimate destination for his international career.

Heaven's ascent has not been entirely smooth. Earlier this season, he suffered an ankle injury while playing for England's Under-20 side against Switzerland in October, forcing him off at half-time and ruling him out of November's fixture against Japan. That setback briefly stalled his momentum but did not derail his long-term trajectory.

At club level, his early Premier League involvement came in the form of substitute appearances, before being handed a start against West Ham on December 4 as part of a three-man defence. That outing was a learning experience, as he was booked early and withdrawn at half-time, but it proved a turning point rather than a setback.

Since then, Heaven has started four consecutive matches, improving with each performance. He impressed in defeat against Aston Villa on December 21 and then delivered a standout display in the 1-0 victory over Newcastle, earning man-of-the-match honours as United recorded only their second clean sheet of the season.

Heaven's decision to remain in the England setup places the focus firmly on sustaining his club form. Continued starts under Amorim will strengthen his case for higher recognition, particularly as United look to stabilise their season and push back toward European contention.

Internationally, his immediate future lies with England's youth sides, but the pathway to senior consideration is now clearer. Strong Premier League performances over the coming months could place him on the radar ahead of future international windows.

Christopher Nkunku pulled off his trademark celebration after finally scoring his first goal in Serie A. The France international left Chelsea for AC Milan over the summer, penning a five-year contract in a deal worth £36m having failed to make an impact in west London. And while Nkunku has taken time to find his groove in Italy, celebrated his first league goal in style on Sunday.

AC Milan hosted Verona in Serie A on Sunday afternoon as they sought to maintain their title pursuit. The Rossoneri made light work of Sunday's opponents, however, as they eased to a 3-0 victory at San Siro.

Christian Pulisic scored his eighth league goal of the season to put Max Allegri's side ahead on the stroke of half time. Nkunku then doubled AC Milan's advantage shortly after the restart with his first Serie A goal since moving to the Italian giants to prompt his trademark balloon celebration 

And they say goals are like buses, as Nkunku scored his second and AC Milan's third in the 53rd minute as the Milan giants eased to a home victory to extend their unbeaten run to 15 matches.

The official Serie A account posted a video of the celebration with the caption: ""Out comes the balloon: Nkunku bags his first Serie A goal!""

AC Milan needed to claim all the spoils at Verona's expense in an incredibly tight Serie A title race. Allegri's side are one point clear of second-placed Napoli, who claimed a 2-0 win at Cremonense on Sunday courtesy of a Rasmus Hojlund brace.

Milan rivals Inter are in action on Sunday evening when they take on Atalanta at the New Balance Arena as they seek to go top of the table in their Scudetto pursuit. The Nerazzurri have won their last three league outings, and have won their last eight games against La Dea, including their last three trips to Bergamo.

Juventus have also shown a much-improved run of form and are currently three points behind AC Milan, though they have played a game more than the Rossoneri.

AC Milan will be out to kick off 2026 in style when they take on Cagliari in the New Year and maintain their push for a first Scudetto success since 2022.

Title rivals Napoli take on Lazio next weekend, while Inter face Bologna to round off the weekend's action.

Juventus, meanwhile, face Lecce as they look to maintain their upturn in performances under Luciano Spalletti.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Morocco head coach Walid Regragui has thanked Paris Saint-Germain and president Nasser Al-Khelaifi for their role in helping Achraf Hakimi return to fitness, as the Atlas Lions captain nears a return for his national side at AFCON after the best part of two months on the sidelines. Hakimi is expected to feature in hosts Morocco's final group game against Zambia on Monday, and Regragui praised 'gentleman' Al-Khelaifi for allowing Hakimi to join up with his national side early to aid his recovery.

Hakimi has not featured for club or country since spraining his ankle in the first half of PSG's Champions League defeat at home to Bayern Munich on November 4, missing a total of seven matches for PSG and four for Morocco during his recovery from the injury.

But his selection for AFCON by head coach Regragui indicated hope that his return to full fitness was not too far away, though he has been made to wait thus far in the group stage. Morocco have picked up four points in their two matches on home soil, beating Comoros 2-0 in the tournament's opening game and drawing 1-1 with Mali on Friday.

Morocco know that a victory over Zambia at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat on Monday would secure their passage to the knock-out stages as group winners, and so to have their captain back amongst the side would be a massive boost to Regragui. He made sure to credit PSG for their role in his recovery.

Regragui said on Sunday: “Let me say thanks to Paris Saint-Germain. If Hakimi is back today, it's thanks to them”. 

“There's not even one single club in the world that was gonna let us have Hakimi 15 days before the AFCON. Nasser Al Khelaifi is a gentleman”.

Despite a challenging run of fixtures which has seen European champions PSG drop points in the Champions League and fall below Lens in the Ligue 1 table, Regragui's words indicate that PSG made no attempt to prevent club captain Hakimi from focusing on returning to fitness in time for AFCON, allowing him to focus on representing his country as the Atlas Lions aim to win the competition for the first time since 1976.

The importance of this was not lost on Regragui. Hakimi was arguably the face of the Morocco outfit and certainly the leader of the side which reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in Qatar, where they were knocked out by runners-up France after a historical campaign which saw them become the first-ever African side to reach the last four.

Hakimi has only seen his career reach new heights since then, winning the Champions League as PSG captain in 2024/25 and ranking in 6th place in the Ballon d'Or before winning the 2025 African Player of the Year.

Regragui told Brut Afrique ahead of AFCON of Hakimi's prospects of taking part in the tournament: ""We're very positive about Achraf's participation. 

“In any case... which match and when? He'll definitely play in the AFCON with us, that's for sure. We have some information, but we're going to keep it to ourselves.""

Should Morocco advance as Group A winners, they will face one of the third-placed sides of Group C, D or E in what they will hope is a favourable pathway to the latter stages. The runners-up of Group A will face the runners-up of Group C, which contains the likes of Nigeria and Tunisia.

The last 16 begins on January 3 and the showpiece final will take place 15 days later on Sunday, January 18 in Rabat. Morocco will hope to play a part that day, and Hakimi looks set to have an important role in their advancement throughout the remainder of the competition.

As stated by Regragui, the 50-year-old will have PSG to thank if his captain does return to action and play an important role in Morocco going deep into AFCON, which they will have set their sights on winning in front of their own supporters.

Aston Villa continue their impressive winning run, grabbing their 11th consecutive victory by beating Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge. Ollie Watkins was the hero for Villa as he came off the bench to grab two goals that helped turn things around for the visiting team.

The Villas have been putting on a run of excellent results ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge, winning 10 straight games across all competitions. However, they were facing a Chelsea side that are keen on getting back into the title challenge.

It was the Blues that had a brighter start as they went 1-0 up after 37 minutes through Joao Pedro's effort, which lasted until the half-time break. The away side improved their performance in the second half, and Watkins' substitution was key to their comeback.

The England international sparked Villa's offense as he snatched the equalizing goal in the 63rd minute before completing his side's comeback by scoring his second goal in the 84th minute. Despite their desperate attempt, Chelsea can't get back into the tie and has to accept a disappointing result in front of their home crowd.

That result keeps Villa's title shot alive and well, as they are still just three points behind league leader Arsenal. As for the Blues, that result now puts them slipping in the standings, down to joint fifth with Manchester United as both sides collected 29 points.

Premier League Weekend Results:

Man United 1-0 Newcastle United; Nottm Forest 1-2 Man City; West Ham 0-1 Fulham; Brentford 4-1 Bornemouth; Liverpool 2-1 Wolves; Arsenal 2-1 Brighton; Burnley 0-0 Everton; Chelsea 1-2 Aston Villa.

The F1 grid does Secret Santa for 2025

F1 Animated! The funny side of the 2025 season

With 2025 almost at an end, it's time to look back on some of the weird and wonderful moments of the year with our alternative awards.

It's nearly time to wave goodbye to 2025 – a season that gave us a new World Champion, some epic comebacks and shock podiums.

While the championship battle between the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, as well as Red Bull's Max Verstappen, had us captivated throughout the season, there was also plenty of entertainment to be found elsewhere on and off the track.

Once again we present our 2025 ‘alternative awards' – an invented celebration where we can appreciate the weird and the wonderful moments of the year gone by just for fun. Here are our 2025 award ‘winners'…

As Fernando Alonso crossed the line 11th in Imola he declared on the team radio that, “we are so unlucky, everything is wrong for us this year.”

It's hard to argue with that. The two-time World Champion had to wait until the ninth round in Barcelona to score his first points of the season with a DNF in Australia, a brake failure in China, and a PU issue in Monaco all contributing to that streak of misfortune.

What prompted that exclamation in Imola was the unfortunate timing of a VSC, allowing Alonso's rivals a cheap pit stop, and he had a similar issue with the timing of a Safety Car in Zandvoort. There was also his suspension failure in Monza, which was caused – of all things – by a bit of gravel that had been thrown up by Norris ahead.

Still, Alonso was never going to give up without a fight this year and managed to still make it back into the top 10 of the Drivers' Championship – 16 points scored in the final two weekends certainly helped with that.

The Miami Grand Prix drivers' parade came with a twist this year as the grid were given the chance to get behind the wheel of fully drivable LEGO big build cars.

Each team had a bespoke car in their own colours, which had been created by a skilled team of 26 designers, engineers and LEGO builders, over 22,000 hours. Every car was made up of nearly 400,000 LEGO bricks and was capable of reaching speeds of 20kph.

Did the drivers take care of them around the Miami International Autodrome? Absolutely not.
Given the competitive nature of our drivers, the parade turned into a race very, very quickly with some hilarious consequences. Have you ever seen a happier group?

We've had some stunning exchanges on the airwaves in 2025 – from Lewis Hamilton's “have a tea break while you're at it” to Charles Leclerc's “thank you Bryan”, and let's not forget Verstappen remarking that his shifts felt like “Monaco Grand Prix 1972”.

But the winner of best radio message this season was an absolute all-timer courtesy of Leclerc.
“I have the seat full of water!” the Monegasque told his race engineer Bryan Bozzi during the Australian Grand Prix, as his drinks bottle leaked. “Must be the water,” replied Bozzi before Leclerc responded: “Let's add that to the words of wisdom.”

Leclerc would of course go on to clarify that it was an inside joke between the pair, but that moment still gave us a radio message that will be included in every ‘best of' compilation from here on.

We've had plenty of contenders for this category in 2025 as well, with Ferrari's retro effort at Monza – which celebrated the 50th anniversary of Niki Lauda's first world title – a close runner-up.

But here we are crowning Red Bull's effort for the Japanese Grand Prix as the best special livery of 2025. Not only did the design honour the final year of their partnership with Honda but, well, look at it! A thing of beauty.

1 / 3

Red Bull's livery in Japan honoured their partnership with Honda

Given we had just as many special helmet designs as liveries this year – if not more – then we had to dish out an award here too. For that we give it to Hamilton for his Las Vegas special lid.

After all, it sparkled! You get automatic bonus points for a helmet that sparkles.

Aside from our championship battle in 2025, Nico Hulkenberg's podium at the British Grand Prix was comfortably one of our favourite stories of the year. The German used all his experience to navigate the difficult weather conditions that day, rising from 19th on the grid to an astonishing third.

And, on what was his 239th start, he finally put to bed the stat that had followed him as the driver with the longest F1 career to never score a top-three finish. The stat above makes for far better reading.

That result was also Sauber's first podium finish since Japan 2012, with Kamui Kobayashi, and Hulkenberg was the oldest first-time podium finisher (37 years old) since George Follmer (39 years old) at the 1973 Spanish Grand Prix.

Sticking with surprise, feel-good podiums we now come to Isack Hadjar, who took a well-deserved third in Zandvoort in his rookie season in the sport.

While his on-track exploits were flawless, his handling of the trophy was… less so. As Racing Bulls posed for their celebration photos in the pit lane, the French driver placed his trophy on the ground before accidentally snapping the neck.

Thankfully Prince Bernhard of Orange got involved to replace the broken trophy, with Hadjar presented with the replacement ahead of the Italian Grand Prix.

Hadjar gets not one, but two, alternative award wins this year, with his efforts in Japan comfortably earning him the best example of perseverance.

To say the French rookie had a rollercoaster Qualifying hour in Suzuka is an understatement as it emerged his seatbelts had been fastened in an uncomfortably tight manner. When we say uncomfortable, we mean uncomfortable…

Unsurprisingly that impacted his focus and ability to put a strong lap together in Q1, and his radio messages were pained to say the least. But the rookie ground through all the discomfort and scraped into Q2, where the issue could then be sorted in the gap. He went on to qualify an impressive seventh.

The Japanese Grand Prix also gave us the best demonstration of multitasking as Norris and Verstappen battled for track position coming out of the pit exit. In the key flash point of the race, Norris ended up on the grass as Verstappen held his position out front.

“Quite an expensive lawnmower,” said Verstappen in the cooldown room afterwards to his McLaren rival.

That theme continued as Verstappen joked in the press conference after: “I think the grass was not really well cut on the right-hand side. Lando saw that as well and he made sure that it was nicely cut.”

“I wasn't even trying to race Max, I was just trying to cut the grass like he says,” Norris added.

To say George Russell was left frustrated in the Monaco Grand Prix is perhaps one of the understatements of the year.

After a loss of power in Qualifying left him 14th on the grid, the Mercedes driver ended up stuck in traffic as Williams played a tactical game ahead with drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz. The pair would take it in turns to back the pack up to create space for a free pit stop – this happening four times in succession as both drivers completed their two mandatory stops.

Russell eventually became so frustrated by being unable to overtake that he skipped over the Nouvelle Chicane to pass Albon and refused to give the position back, which saw him handed a drive-through penalty by the stewards.

After the race, both Williams drivers apologised for the tactical play, while Russell joked that Albon owed him dinner as compensation. As it transpired that dinner date did happen after the race.

“He ordered the most expensive thing on the menu,” Albon said afterwards when asked how the dinner was. “He did, actually. It was the lobster pasta.”

In another drivers' parade with a twist, the Sao Paulo Grand Prix offered up soapboxes for the drivers to enjoy this time around. Predictably things turned chaotic once again.

However, after a breakdown, Russell was left without a car to travel in – step forward the Red Bull duo of Yuki Tsunoda and Verstappen and you have one of the photos of the year. We'll let the image below do the talking.

The provocative actress starred in 'And God Created Woman,' 'The Truth' and 'Contempt,' stirring audiences around the world.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



Brigitte Bardot, the enchanting French starlet with the marvelous pout who became a carefree icon of sexuality in the 1950s and '60s after her liberated performance in the scandalous And God Created Woman, has died. She was 91.


	Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to a representative from animal protection charity Foundation Brigitte Bardot, who confirmed her death to the Associated Press. No cause or time of death was specified. She was reportedly hospitalized in November.




	French president Emmanuel Macron was among the immediate mourners, calling her “a legend of the century.” He said on social media: “Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.”

	Bardot was one of the most famous French actresses of her time, celebrated for her beauty and fiery performances in such films as Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Truth (1960) and Jean-Luc Godard‘s Contempt (1963).


	With an 18-inch waist and long, tousled hair, Bardot was one of the first movie stars to appear au naturel. She popularized the bikini in an era of one-piece modesty and made a habit of bedazzling photographers at the Cannes Film Festival. 

	











	And on Playboy‘s list of the “100 Sexiest Stars of the Century,” published in 1999, she placed fourth, trailing only Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Raquel Welch.


	Bardot also recorded three breathy solo albums in the '60s, singing “as if she was on the verge of bursting out into knowing giggles,” one reviewer wrote.


	At the time of its release in staid 1956, And God Created Woman, directed by Roger Vadim — the first of her four husbands — pushed the boundaries of sex on the big screen. It was banned by the Vatican, and French censors insisted on cuts before allowing it to be shown in theaters at home.


	The film begins with Bardot, then 22 and playing a restless orphan living in Saint-Tropez, lying unclothed on her stomach. Three men fall under her spell during the film, which also includes scenes of her undressing and a scorching sequence that has her dancing barefoot and drunk to calypso music.


And God Created Woman had a major impact on the liberated screen romances of the next decade, including those made by the French New Wave. Wrote Francois Truffaut: “I thank Vadim for having made this young woman repeat, in front of the lens, everyday gestures — trivial gestures like playing with her sandal, or less trivial ones like, yes indeed, making love in broad daylight.”


And God Created Woman was pilloried by French critics but gathered support in the U.S. and Great Britain, where it became a sensation. Bardot became the face (and body) of cinema in her country, and Time magazine called her the “Countess of Come-Hither.”

	











	Known by the acronym “B.B.” in her homeland, Bardot had her every movement tracked by paparazzi and her every liaison emblazoned on the covers of tabloids. When she tried to commit suicide in 1960 after her torrid affair with actor Sami Frey was discovered by her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier, scores of photographers flocked to the scene, blocking the road as an ambulance rushed a dying Bardot — who had slit her wrists — to a hospital in Nice.


	“I can understand hunted animals because of the way I was treated,” Bardot once said. “What happened to me was inhuman.”


	While shooting the 1973 sex comedy The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot, directed by Nina Companeez, she decided to give up acting. “Everything felt ridiculous, superfluous, absurd and useless,” she recalled in her 1996 autobiography, Initiales B.B.


	Speaking to a journalist while on location, she announced: “I'm done with movies. It's over — this film is the last one. I'm sick of it.” In her memoirs, she wrote, “It felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.” She was 39.


	Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born in Paris on Sept. 28, 1934. The daughter of an engineer, she was raised in a cultured bourgeois household in the affluent 16th arrondissement and studied ballet at the Conservatoire de Paris. She was scouted by a family friend to model for Elle magazine, whose cover she graced in 1950 at age 15.


	Director Marc Allegret, who had discovered actress Simone Simon, recruited her for the movies, and she made her film debut in 1952's Le trou normand (Crazy for Love), helmed by Jean Boyer. She also starred as a lighthouse keeper's daughter in Willy Rozier's Pacific-set romance The Girl in the Bikini and wed Allegret's assistant, Vadim, that year.

	











	Bardot appeared with Kirk Douglas in Act of Love (1953), in Concert of Intrigue (1954) and in Robert Wise's Helen of Troy (1956) before her career breakthrough in And God Created Woman, Vadim's directorial debut. 


	During the making of the film, Bardot began an affair with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant, and she and Vadim divorced in 1957. (Vadim would go on to marry Jane Fonda in 1965.)


	Bardot's turn as a woman on trial for murdering her lover (Frey) in The Truth — nominated for the Oscar for best foreign-language film in 1961 — remains one of her most memorable roles. The shoot with infamously difficult French auteur Clouzot, however, proved to be one of her most trying.


	The director abused his star at every turn, slapping her across the face on several occasions (she once slapped him back) and stomping on her bare feet to solicit a reaction. For one scene, he gave Bardot sleeping pills while promising her they were only aspirin — resulting in a perfectly woozy performance that would knock the actress out for the next 48 hours.


	Bardot would deliver another prized showing as Camille Javal, a capricious bathing beauty, in Godard's masterpiece Contempt, largely based on the filmmaker's life and breakup with actress Anna Karina. Also starring Jack Palance and Fritz Lang, the behind-the-scenes drama about the making of a movie begins with Bardot lying nude on a bed as her husband (Michel Piccoli) caresses and praises her body.

	











	But Contempt is far from an exploitation film, and Bardot's portrayal of a woman fleeing a tumultuous relationship with a screenwriter, only to land in the arms of an evil Hollywood producer, is one of the best in her career — this despite the fact she was neither Godard's first nor second choice for the role.


	“I don't know what conditions the movie was made under, nor if Bardot and Godard even got along,” French critic Jean-Louis Bory wrote. “But the result is clear: There has rarely been such a profound understanding between an actress and a director.”


	Although Contempt did reasonably well in theaters, the fact that Bardot — 28 at the time — was one of the highest-paid actors in France meant the film did not turn a major profit, even if it is now considered to be a New Wave classic and, arguably, Bardot's best movie.


	The actress was busy throughout the rest of the 1960s, headlining such diverse films as Please, Not Now! (1961) and Love on a Pillow (1962), both directed by ex-husband Vadim; A Very Private Affair (1962), the action comedy Viva Maria! (1965) and the segment “William Wilson” from the omnibus movie Spirits of the Dead (1968), all helmed by Louis Malle; and Edward Dmytryk's forgotten Western, Shalako (1968), where she played a countess opposite Sean Connery.


	In 1965, she appeared in the 20th Century Fox comedy Dear Brigitte, starring Jimmy Stewart. 


	As a singer, Bardot's most significant vocal work was for the French crooner Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she performed duets on “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Je t'aime … moi non plus.”

	











	While the former became a major hit, the latter was shelved when Bardot's third husband, German playboy Gunther Sachs, heard its sexually explosive lyrics on the radio and threatened to sue. (Bardot and Gainsbourg were allegedly having an affair). The song was rerecorded with Jane Birkin and released to much fanfare, while Bardot's version did not come out until 1986. 


	Bardot met Charrier on the set of Christian-Jacque's Babette Goes to War (1959) and was married to the actor from 1959-62. She wed Sachs in Las Vegas in 1966 (to declare his love for her, he apparently had 10,000 roses dropped from a helicopter onto her Saint-Tropez estate), but they divorced in 1969.


	Bardot's fourth and final husband was French businessman and National Front adviser Bernard d'Ormale, whom she wed in 1992.


	After making nearly 50 features, she dedicated her life to defending animal rights. Through her Fondation Brigitte Bardot, created in 1986, she took on such issues as seal hunting, poaching, the fur trade, bullfighting, the captivity of wild animals in zoos and circuses, conditions in slaughterhouses and the farming of horse meat.


	“I gave my beauty and my youth to men,” she said. “I am going to give my wisdom and experience, the best of me, to animals.” 


	Bardot supported National Front candidates including Catherine Megret and Marine Le Pen and spoke out against the “Islamisation” of France. A 1996 interview in Le Figaro had her condemned for inciting racial hatred, while a paragraph in her book comparing homosexuals and pedophiles was widely criticized.

	











	And in 2018, she denounced the #MeToo movement. “I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass,” she said.


	Survivors include her son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, born in 1960 and raised predominantly by his father. Bardot never had any other children and described her pregnancy as “a tumor that was eating away at me, that I was carrying in my tumefied flesh, awaiting the sacred moment when they would finally get rid of it.”


	Her son would sue her in court for such propos, claiming they violated his “intrauterine intimacy.”


	Emancipated from family ties and sexual mores, Bardot was never one to be held down by constraints, whether those of the film industry she fled or the many lovers she left behind. When asked in 2014 by the French tabloid Gala why she had always been so fiercely independent, she answered with a laugh, “I'm the man of my life!”

In an unexpected coincidence, Ridley stars opposite 'Solo: A Star Wars Story' lead Alden Ehrenreich in the upcoming rom-com 'The Last Resort' 10 years after they became pals.


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


	This is your biannual reminder that the independent offerings of Daisy Ridley deserve your attention. While she patiently awaits Disney and Lucasfilm's next move with regard to Star Wars, Ridley has been releasing a couple well-received indies per year, save for Disney's highly acclaimed sports biopic, Young Woman and the Sea (2024). On Jan. 2, Ridley kicks off the new year with another well-regarded film in We Bury the Dead. 


	Zak Hilditch's contemplative zombie thriller, which premiered at 2025's South by Southwest, chronicles Ava Newman (Ridley) as she journeys from America to Tasmania in hopes of finding her husband alive. The U.S. military botched a nearby weapons test that obliterated the population of Tasmania, creating either a pile of dead bodies or zombies that gradually become more aggressive. Ava's husband, Mitch, had the misfortune of being on a work retreat there at the same time.

	Ava's marriage was already on the rocks. Her and her husband's struggle to conceive a child slowly chipped away at their union, so she is simply looking for closure in whatever form it takes. Ridley ultimately channeled people in her life who were going through similar fertility challenges as her character.


	“I knew a couple people that were going through IVF at the time. It can take a toll emotionally and physically on women, but also on their relationships while they're going through it. So that actually felt really [palpable] at the time [of We Bury the Dead],” Ridley tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I understood that feeling of wanting something so much, and how difficult that can be, in a way that I never had before.”

	











	In May of 2025, Ridley wrapped her first romantic comedy opposite none other than Solo: A Star Wars Story star Alden Ehrenreich. She nearly worked with the embryonic Han Solo toward the beginning of their Star Wars careers a decade ago, so the Phillipines-set The Last Resort is a long time coming for the Lucasfilm stablemates. 


	“I signed onto [The Last Resort] before I knew Alden was doing it. Alden and I were supposed to do a movie together ten years ago. It ended up not happening, but we became buddies, so I was really thrilled when he came on,” Ridley says.


	Ridley and Ehrenreich's promotion of The Last Resort will undoubtedly lead to some awkward Star Wars questions, but Ridley's husband, Tom Bateman, has them both beat. In August, he wrapped his own romcom called The Love Hypothesis, which is based on Ali Hazelwood's novel of the same name. The twist is that the book was born out of fan fiction that centered on his wife's Star Wars character, Rey, and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. Bateman's character is even named Adam after Driver.


	“To be clear, Tom didn't know that [The Love Hypothesis] was fan fiction, and I didn't remember that it was fan fiction. So he had a number of auditions, and then he was told when he got the part that it was fan fiction, which was news to him,” Ridley shares. “I guess he told me, but I don't think I put two and two together. It wasn't until we got to Montreal [for filming] that someone again said that it was fan fiction, and I was like, ‘Huh.' So I'm really looking forward to seeing the film. Sources say that it's very good.”

	











	Below, during a recent conversation with THR, Ridley also discusses the next collaboration between her and Bateman following 2024's Magpie, as well as her favorite film of 2025.


***


Ava is an American who's doing volunteer dead body retrieval in Tasmania, and she's singled out at times for being a “Yank.” With the majority of We Bury the Dead's cast and crew being Australian, did you also feel like a fish out of water?


	You know what? I've never felt more a part of things. Actually, no, I have felt this a part of things before, but this was still a really, really wonderful experience. So I felt so much in the fabric of everything, and I didn't feel like a fish out of water. It was really lovely. 


After playing mothers in The Marsh King's Daughter and Magpie, do you think that context was helpful for this woman who'd desperately been trying to get to that position?


	I knew a couple people that were going through IVF at the time. It was something that I had [previously] read about and heard about, but I didn't know people [until then] that were really having that experience. It can take a toll emotionally and physically on women, but also on their relationships while they're going through it. So that actually felt really [palpable] at the time. I understood that feeling of wanting something so much, and how difficult that can be, in a way that I never had before, and that was really what I was holding onto in playing her. 

	











The most unsettling scene is not with a zombie; it's with a soldier (Mark Coles Smith's Riley). You're used to playing other people, but not like that. Did any of those disturbing circumstances creep into your psyche at all? Or does your work generally not follow you home? 


	I generally don't take my work home with me, but there were things that weren't scripted that ended up happening during that sequence. At the beginning of all of that, Ava is really listening to Riley, and she's really understanding in many ways where he's coming from. There's a desperation to his grief that feels more apparent than Ava's, but they're also mirroring each other in some ways. It then takes that very strange, creepy turn. So, in the running out, I had to slam the door, and then I screamed a couple things that were not scripted because the feeling was high. But then you cut, and it's great, and you move on. But that sequence certainly felt properly frightening in the moment.


In my mind, one of the defining images of you is your emotional audition video for Star Wars: The Force Awakens over a decade ago. When you have to cry on screen now, something you do several times in We Bury the Dead, is it similar to a light switch? Can you just turn it on and off? 


	No, not at all. For me, crying isn't always the way we show sadness. So when it came to We Bury the Dead, I didn't know what some of these scenes would end up being. I tend to ignore stage directions anyway because you just don't know until you're there. But I certainly didn't know how some of the scenes in this film were going to go, and that's really a testament to [writer-director] Zak [Hilditch] and the amazing cast and crew. We felt very safe and very open to see what happened in the moment.

	











I can always tell that you have a spidey sense for when the Star Wars questions are about to start, and you're always a good sport about it. That being said, when you were weighing your upcoming Philippines-set movie (The Last Resort) with Alden Ehrenreich, how much did the inevitable Star Wars questions affect your decision?


	(Laughs.) Hilarious. Well, I signed onto that before I knew Alden was doing it. Alden and I were supposed to do a movie together ten years ago. It ended up not happening, but we became buddies, so I was really thrilled when he came on. 


That should be a fun press cycle. 


	(Laughs.) Yeah.


Alden's fictional son, Ben Solo, made headlines recently. The Hunt for Ben Solo was both news and old news to you at the same time? 


	Yeah, I hear things. I've got my ear to the ground. 


You said that Adam Driver volunteering that information was the biggest surprise of the year, and you're right, he's usually very reluctant to talk about Star Wars.


	(Laughs.) Yeah.  


Was the second biggest surprise of the year when the writer of Magpie (Ridley's husband, Tom Bateman) said he was going to be acting in a movie that began as fan fiction about Rey and Kylo Ren? 


	(Laughs.) To be clear, Tom didn't know that [The Love Hypothesis] was fan fiction, and I didn't remember that it was fan fiction. So he had a number of auditions, and then he was told when he got the part that it was fan fiction, which was news to him. I guess he told me, but I don't think I put two and two together. It wasn't until we got to Montreal [for filming] that someone again said that it was fan fiction, and I was like, “Huh.” So I'm really looking forward to seeing the film. Sources say that it's very good, and I think it will be really charming and really fun. 

	











As far as a Magpie follow-up, whatever that may be, has Tom been delivering pages to you fairly often? 


	Oh yeah. We have something that we are currently out to for someone to direct, which is fantastic. He has two or three other scripts that are ready to go. I also read the first draft of something that he just did, which is amazing. So he's currently working on that now.


There's a pattern in your work that began with Rey ten years ago, and it continues all the way through Ava in We Bury the Dead. You often play characters who are either lonely or alone for prolonged stretches. What do you make of that trend?


	I don't know. I guess there can be a lot of drama in that. But I have never had a plan of what I want to do next. I'm just drawn to what I'm drawn to, and the films that I've been drawn to, I've absolutely loved working on them. The Last Resort, which I made with Alden, really does buck that [loneliness] trend. I got to be around people. I mean, there is an element of loneliness to the person I play in that, but she really finds so much joy in the people around her. So it was really fun to do that. 


It's the end of the year, and people are releasing their lists of favorites. What film grabbed you the most this year?


	The movie of the year for me is Train Dreams. But I will say that I have not seen Hamnet, which I can't wait for. I've not seen Sentimental Value, which I can't wait for. So I've seen screenings of a lot of movies lately, and while I've loved a lot of stuff, Train Dreams is really the one that got me. Ugh, it's just a wonderful, wonderful movie.

Asghar Farhadi remembered the filmmaker and playwright, who died due to complications from cancer, as his ""great teacher.""


							By 

	Hilary Lewis


Deputy Editor, East Coast


	Prominent Iranian film and theater writer-director Bahram Beyzaie died in the U.S. on Friday due to complications from cancer, according to independent journalist Mansour Jahani. Beyzaie was 87 and died on his birthday.


	Beyzaie's 1985 film, Bashu, the Little Stranger was screened at the 2025 Venice Film Festival and received the Venice Classics award for best restored film.




	Fellow Iranian director Asghar Farhadi called Beyzaie his “great teacher” in a tribute message.


	“Bahram Beyzaie, my great teacher, whose works, words, and above all, his love for the culture of this land I have followed with all my heart, has now left this world in exile,” Farhadi wrote. “I have truly never known a more Iranian person than Bahram Beyzaie in this day and age, and how bitter it is that this most Iranian of Iranians, thousands of miles away from Iran, turns a blind eye to the world.” Bahram Beyzaie was born in Tehran on Dec. 26, 1938, and grew up in a family of poets and literary scholars. In addition to directing 10 features, four short films and 14 staged plays, Beyzaie wrote more than 70 books, monographs, plays and screenplays.

	Considered one of the leaders of Iranian New Wave cinema, Beyzaie's award-winning films, screened at festivals around the world, in addition to Bashu, include Downpour (1972) and Killing Rabids (2001).

	











	His work was inspired by Indo-Iranian mythology and history and drew on the study of ancient Iranian literature and languages. He reconstructed indigenous forms of Iranian theater in his own film and stage projects.


	His first play, Arash, written when he was 19, was a response to Siavash Kasraei's Arash the Archer. He wrote scholarly works that examined the origins of One Thousand and One Nights and its connection with other significant works in Persian literature. And his monographs and essays explore Indian, Chinese and Japanese performing art traditions.


	His 1965 book Theatre in Iran provided a comprehensive study of the historical roots of Iranian theatrical genres like Naqali (Iranian storytelling), Kheimeh Shab Bazi (Iranian puppetry), Ta'zieh (passion plays) and Ruhowzi (comic folk drama).


	Beyzaie was a founding member of the Center for Progressive Filmmakers in Iran, the Iranian Writers Association and The Society of Dramatic Authors and Composers, serving as the University of Tehran's chair of the dramatic arts department. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, he was forced to resign from Tehran University, and his work was censored or banned by the government. He left Iran in 2010 and joined Stanford as a lecturer in Iranian studies, where he staged several plays and conducted workshops on Iranian mythology.


	Beyzaie was a member of the Film Academy and had been invited to join the Oscars voting body in 2024.

	In the video, Cole invites West onto the stage and introduces him to the audience as “a good friend,” thanking the rapper for attending the show. After confirming that he enjoyed the set, West laughs as Cole pokes fun at his famously restrained reactions.


	“You weren't giving me no sympathy laughs, right?” Cole asks in the clip, drawing a grin from West as the crowd reacts.

	West responds without elaboration: “New album,” prompting loud cheers from the room.


	Cole follows up with a joking request to appear on an interlude on the forthcoming project, then asks whether West could send him a care package of clothes — which West agrees to — before exiting the stage.


	Back in November, Ye also popped up during Travis Scott's Circus Maximus show in Japan last for an unannounced set at the Belluna Dome in Tokorozawa on Nov. 8.In fan-shot footage circulating online, West — who had his face covered — pulled off his mask mid-show to roaring applause before launching into his 2007 anthem “Can't Tell Me Nothing.”

	











	Scott remained onstage as a hype man and support act throughout Ye's mini-set, which included hits like “Runaway,” “Heartless,” “Flashing Lights,” “Stronger,” and “All of the Lights.” The duo performed together in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as part of Scott's two-night Japan stopover.


	Ye will also return to Italy to headline the brand new Hellwatt Festival, which will take place at the RCF Arena over three weekends, from July 4-18, and will be officially presented in late January or early February 2026. The news of Ye's concert in Italy comes nearly two years after the lengthy back-and-forth over the live presentation of Vultures, his Billboard 200-topping joint album with Ty Dolla $ign, which concluded without a concert but with a listening party held at the Unipol Forum in Milan and the Unipol Arena in Bologna in February 2024.

	After 30 years, Eddie Murphy has moved on from his beef with Saturday Night Live and David Spade over the flop of 1995's Vampire in Brooklyn.


	Spade recently clarified that he and Murphy are “all good” after reuniting at last year's SNL50: The 50th Anniversary Special, noting that he previously made the Oscar nominee “hate me overnight” after a joke at his movie's expense.


	“It was weird going from being a super fan to having him hate me overnight, and to try to win him back for the last 25 years,” he explained on his and Dana Carvey's Fly on the Wall podcast. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We had some bumps in the road along the way, early on. I was on ‘Weekend Update', on SNL, new to the show, making fun of all the celebrities and I made fun of him and it didn't go well. And he called me and we had it out.”

	











	Spade added, “Actually, he had it out. I didn't really fight back. Because I did feel a little guilty about it. And he did make some sense, I just didn't like that because he was a hero.”


	During his ‘Spade in America' segment on the Dec. 9, 1995 episode of SNL, Spade went after several celebs of the time, including Murphy and Vampire in Brooklyn. “Look, children, it's a falling star. Make a wish. Yes, that's right. You make a Hollywood Minute omelet, you break some eggs,” he said at the time.


	Noting he's seen Murphy “once or twice” since the joke, having been on good terms at the NBC sketch comedy show's 25th anniversary special in February. 

	











	Last year, Murphy called the joke “a cheap shot” and “racist,” adding that “it was personal.”


	“In the long run, it's all good. Worked out great,” he added. “I'm cool with David Spade. Cool with Lorne Michaels. I went back to SNL. I'm cool with everybody. It's all love.”


	Following his own legendary 1980-'84 stint as an SNL cast member, Murphy officially buried the hatchet with his alma mater when he returned to host in 2019, earning him his first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

SPOILERS: This post contains details about The Copenhagen Test, Season 1


	As The Copenhagen Test hits Peacock, viewers will undoubtedly develop some trust issues towards Melissa Barrera‘s spy character Michelle.


	With Season 1 now available on the streamer, the actress told Deadline that was one of her favorite aspects of the femme fatale role in Thomas Brandon's sci-fi thriller, which also stars Simu Liu as intelligence agent Alexander Hale, whose mind is hacked by a mysterious enemy using the intel to bring down his agency.


	“It was an interesting challenge, and unlike anything else that I've ever done, where I'm having to give in a little bit and trust that the prep that I'm doing and the levels of these versions of the character that I'm portraying will pan out, even though I don't know where they're going,” explained Barrera.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Barrera's Michelle plays a thrilling game of manipulation with Alexander, infiltrating his life to gauge whether or not he's a threat. The pair then keeps up the façade of a blossoming romance, with both seemingly developing real feelings, despite neither fully trusting the other.


	As Michelle, Barrera was left nearly as in the dark as the audience about the character's mysterious backstory, which is never quite revealed amid multiple layers of lies and deceit.


	“So, for me, I'm a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor,” she added. “I kind of had to let go and be like, ‘You know what? I'm not going to know, because they're still writing and I don't know where they're going to take her.' And that was exciting in a way and anxiety-inducing in another way. But I think in the end, it helped with the mystery of it all.”


	Starring opposite Liu, Barrera had “the most fun” during their fight scene, which she describes as having “very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes.” Meanwhile, the Shang-Chi star praised her as “a spectacular action star in the making.”

	











	Two years after Barrera was unceremoniously fired from the Scream franchise, the actress is grateful for the fans who continue to support her work and “in their way, kind of lift me up,” following a recent Scream 7 boycott in her honor.


	Read on about Melissa Barrera's complex The Copenhagen Test character, her hopes for Season 2 and her reaction to the Scream 7 boycott.


DEADLINE: One thing I love about Copenhagen Test is there's kind of a rom-com element within the spy thriller. Was that a fun line to walk?


MELISSA BARRERA: I am always drawn to romance. That is my favorite thing. No matter the genre, I always kind of look for the love story. And so, I thought that it was so cool that there was that element in this show, particularly, and that I got to be a part of it, because I would have gotten FOMO if it wasn't my character involved. But I do love the performance within the performance within the performance of that dynamic and that you don't really know how much of that connection is real and how much of that is performance on either side. And so, I think as an audience member, those that are drawn to the relationship will always be kind of rooting for them, for that to be real. But you won't really know what the thing is because that's the thing of the show, every episode you kind of get a new piece of information and it takes the rug out from under you. 


DEADLINE: Yeah, I definitely gasped a few times while watching it. 


BARRERA: Love that. Love to hear. 


DEADLINE: And what was it like playing Michelle, who obviously has such a complicated past? It's just so fun to watch her seem so sincere in one moment and then, the next—


BARRERA: I mean, I'm an actor, right, so it felt like a big part of her job. And that's why I love that beat where we go back to the first episode and you get to see it from her perspective, where she's preparing to go out and pretend to be this damsel in distress. And she's asking questions about who is she, who's her scene partner, basically, because she is basically an actor in a different setting. She has to prep in the same way that us doing movies and TV would, and really commit to a character for a lot longer than someone that is just acting on set would have to. But I found it kind of easy to think about it in that way. So, I wasn't stressing out about all the information that I didn't have, because we started shooting the show, and I didn't have all the scripts, so I didn't know where they were going to take her. And it was an interesting challenge, and unlike anything else that I've ever done, where I'm having to give in a little bit and trust that the prep that I'm doing and the levels of these versions of the character that I'm portraying will pan out, even though I don't know where they're going. So, for me, I'm a very controlling, planning kind of person as an actor. I kind of had to let go and be like, “You know what? I'm not going to know, because they're still writing and I don't know where they're going to take her.” And that was exciting in a way and anxiety-inducing in another way. But I think in the end, it helped with the mystery of it all. And sometimes, I was like, “I'm going to play this a few different ways and you guys are going to use the take that you feel will be best for whatever comes next because I don't know where you're taking me.” So, it was kind of like an interesting experiment. 

	











DEADLINE: And I really appreciated how you never really discover what happened in Michelle's past, and then at the end, Parker burns the file. So, I'm wondering if you and Thomas discussed her backstory, or is it something you kind of filled in in your head. 


BARRERA: I filled it in in my head. I had an idea of what I needed it to be for me to be able to play that moment of relief, and what she's running away from, because for her to accept this mission where she knows that if she becomes visible and recognizable by the enemy, that means that she can't work anymore. The enemy will know who she is, and she decides to take on the mission anyway. So, I'm like, what could make a person take on that mission? What happened? And so I had to fill in that storyline, but I hope that I get a Season 2, so that we can learn more about her and see more of what her life is and what she ran towards or ran away from. It's an exciting character for me in a very different way than other characters have been. Like when I was doing Vida, I was excited to return to a character because I loved playing with her and I had fun, but here I'm excited to return to Michelle when we get a Season 2 because I was always surprised by where they took her, and so, it's exciting to play something like that. 


DEADLINE: Well, I definitely hope there's a Season 2, especially after that little teaser at the end of her being a “loose end,” but I also love the dynamic between Michelle and Parker. I felt like they're just girls bonding over gaslighting boys, and it's my favorite. 


BARRERA: Yes, there's a level of innocence and unexpectedness to that friendship. And I love that pairing because it feels very high school. It feels like, even though they're in such a high-stakes situation, girls are girls, women are women, and like the existential crises that we go through are kind of always the same since we're teenagers. And I think that it's really sweet that Michelle becomes Parker's friend. The way that I played those scenes with Parker, I tried to keep it always in truth, obviously, but keep it ambiguous enough to where you could believe that she's being honest and that she's letting herself be vulnerable and let Parker in, like it's actually a genuine relationship. But if tomorrow, the writers decide that in Season 2, it was all fake and she actually never—it wouldn't surprise me if she was also playing Parker. That could also work. So, it was finding that fine line in the performance of, it could go either way. And if you watch it back with new information later, you'll believe it. That was the challenge.


DEADLINE: There are quite a few fight scenes in here, and I just have to say you're such a badass, watching you. What was your favorite fight scene to film, or do you have a most memorable fight moment? 


BARRERA: The most fun that I had on set was doing the physical fights. I think I was very much looking forward to that final fight with Simu, just us in his apartment, because it was very Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibes, and I would have loved if it was like five times as long. I could have just kept going, 'cause he's such a fun scene partner to have, not only in acting scenes, but in physical scenes. He's so good. Obviously, he's an action star, right? So, he's got it down, and I had to do a lot of training and a lot of practicing, a lot of rehearsals to get to the point where I didn't have to think about the fighting and think about what comes next, and I could focus on the storytelling. And we had an incredible stunt team that was very patient with me. I asked for a million extra sessions on my days off, and they would always be available to me. I just wanted Michelle to really look like she's been in this life for a while, and she knows what she's doing, and there's a reason that she keeps getting paired on these important missions where she is trusted to protect this person or take him down, and I love physical stuff. I loved it. And so, that was a fun day on set, because we got to move through the whole apartment. I would have loved it if we like destroyed the whole thing, but you know, I think we still had scenes to shoot in different order, so we couldn't really do that. I proposed it, but maybe next season. 

	











DEADLINE: Separately, the trailer for Scream 7 came out recently and a lot of people have even started a boycott. How does it feel to have these loyal fans after the last two years? 


BARRERA: Obviously, having support always feels great, and I'm so grateful for the love that I've been shown, and for the support and the new people that have come into my life, and that are now supporting the other things that I'm doing and that are trying to, I think in their way, kind of lift me up. So, that honestly feels really nice.

The boycott will mean absolutely nothing in the end.She was only one cog in a much larger series. Sorry she won't be back but it changes nothing for me and many others.🤷

The way that Spyglass treated Melissa in the whole Scream affair is messed up and I will be joining the Scream 7 boycott.

Im sure your boycott will be every bit as successful as the Stranger Things 5 boycott was.

Here here 😂

Sorry, English is a second language to me, but isn't it supposed to be “Hear, hear!”

On every single Scream related article that allows comments, I see people talking about Melissa and very little about the film itself. There is probably a significant number of people who would have seen the movie that won't.

The point of a boycott isn't necessarily to make the film lose money but to decrease the amount of profit. You are naive if you don't think that production companies care about decreased profits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Amy Poehler's Boston roots came out in wild plane fight in front of baby","https://pagesix.com/2025/12/27/celebrity-news/amy-poehler-recalls-fight-on-a-plane-for-being-too-loud/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:37:00 GMT","

Amy Poehler hilariously recalled her Boston roots emerging during an argument on a plane. 

“I remember being on a plane with you,” Poehler's “Saturday Night Live” co-star Ana Gasteyer recalled during an episode of Poehler's “Good Hang” podcast earlier this week. 

“You got into a fight with a guy,” Gastyer continued, noting that her baby Frances — who is now 23 years old — “was on the plane with us.” 

“She was on the flight and I still got in a fight with the baby around?” an incredulous Poehler repeated. 

“The guy got mad that you were swearing in front of the baby,” Gasteyer confirmed. 

“It's a long story, but what happened was a first-class guy, which we were in first class too, was like, ‘Excuse me, I'm trying to — you're being too loud in first class,'” Poehler explained. 

“My Boston came out, let's just say that.” A bemused Gasteyer called the mid-air clash “the best thing I've ever seen.” 

Poehler went on to marry “Arrested Development” alum Will Arnett in 2003 before finalizing her divorce from him in 2016. They share sons Archie, 17, and Abel, 15. 

Gasteyer married husband Charlie McKittrick, in 1996, and along with Frances, the longtime couple share son Ulysses.

Gasteyer, 58, and the “Park and Recreation” star, 54, famously appeared together on “Saturday Night Live” from 2001 to 2002. 

They also co-starred in Tina Fey's iconic 2004 comedy “Mean Girls,” with Poehler memorably playing “cool mom” to Rachel McAdam's popular Regina George character.

Gasteyer, meanwhile, played the mother of Lindsay Lohan's character, Cady Heron.

In 2019, the comedic icons teamed up for “Wine Country,” which also starred Fey, Rachel Dratch, Emily Spivey, Maya Rudolph, and Paula Pell. 

While looking back on their time together on “Saturday Night Live,” Poehler and Gasteyer both admitted to being “obsessed” with lifestyle maven Martha Stewart — whom Gasteyer is famous for flawlessly imitating. 

“Martha, I'm not going to invite you on the show because I'm too scared, but please listen and know that you're something else,” Poehler quipped.

Leonardo DiCaprio and his much-younger girlfriend were caught kissing in rare PDA photos. 

The “Titanic” actor, 51, and model, 27, were pictured enjoying some casual post-holiday shopping on Melrose Place in Los Angeles on Friday. 

In one photo, the couple — both dressed in lowkey head-to-toe black — leaned in for an affectionate kiss.

They also paused for lunch at a nearby cafe, where Ceretti checked her phone as the “One Battle After Another” star looked on adoringly.

DiCaprio kept a particularly low profile in a black puffer coat layered over a hoodie, which he pulled over his head on top of a black ball cap. He finished the look with black pants and white sneakers. 

Ceretti — clad in a black trench coat and matching sunglasses — was seen taking a call, and the pair intermittently enjoyed PDA in the Los Angeles rain while browsing.

The “Wolf of Wall Street” actor and Ceretti are rarely seen out together, though the bikini-clad model was spotted spanking the Oscar winner as they spent time aboard a yacht  off the coast of Formentera Island in August after attending Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's June nuptials in Venice.

Earlier this month, the “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” star revealed why he prefers to keep a low profile in public.

“It's been a balance I've been managing my whole adult life and still I'm not an expert,” the actor told Time magazine for a cover interview. 

“I think my simple philosophy is only get out there and do something when you have something to say, or you have something to show for it,” he continued. “Otherwise, just disappear as much as you possibly can.”

DiCaprio also divulged that he began considering how he could “have a long career” without people getting tired of him. 

“Because I love what I do, and I feel like the best way to have a long career is to get out of people's face[s],” he explained. 

Page Six revealed back in September 2023 that DiCaprio and Ceretti were an item after the duo was caught in a steamy make out session in an Ibiza nightclub.

Though they've kept largely out of the public eye, they reached a relationship milestone in May — DiCaprio  attempted to make an under-the-radar debut at the Met Gala alongside Ceretti.

However, he was caught at the event in a black and white shot later shared by Vogue, in which the actor attempted to cover his face. 

DiCaprio has a history of dating much-younger professional models — including Gigi Hadid, now 30, and Camila Morrone, now 28.

Brigitte Bardot, the French actress who was named the original “sex kitten,” has died, according to her foundation. She was 91.

“The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,” the foundation, which fights to protect animals, announced on its website Sunday.

“The Brigitte Bardot Foundation wishes to honor the memory of an exceptional woman who gave everything for a world more respectful of animals,” it added. 

“We extend our sincere condolences to her family, loved ones, the municipality of Saint-Tropez and its residents, and all those who share this cause. The Foundation will continue, more than ever, to champion the work of Brigitte Bardot.”

The foundation's Bruno Jacquelin told the Associated Press that Bardot had been hospitalized last month and that she passed away in her home in Southern France. No funeral or memorial service arrangements have been made.

Bardot's cause of death was not disclosed.

French President Emmanuel Macron took to X to share a touching tribute to Bardot.

“Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,” Macron tweeted Sunday. 

“French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century,” he added.

Bardot was launched as an international sex symbol in 1956 when she starred as a sexualized teen bride in the movie “And God Created Woman.” 

The film, which was directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, featured scenes of Bardot dancing on tables naked, marking a groundbreaking portrayal of female sexuality during a conservative time.

After starring in nearly 30 films, Bardot retired from acting in 1973.

A decade later, she reemerged as an animal rights lobbyist and started her animal rights foundation after selling movie memorabilia and jewelry.

Bardot is survived by her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, her estranged son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, and her sister.

The festive season is a time to slow down and be thankful for your loved ones and the good things in your life, but it's not a joyous time for everyone. HGTV's Jasmine Roth has reflected on her childhood and the traumas she endured in a vulnerable, emotional post. 

The HGTV “Hidden Potential” and “HELP! I Wrecked My House” star posted a video on Instagram on December 23 showing herself, her husband, Brett Roth, and their two children, Hazel Lynn Roth and Darla Rose Roth. They are seated on the sofa, eating popcorn in front of their Christmas tree. They look so happy. In the text overlay on the video, Roth wrote, “I wish I'd known as a child, you can grow up in a house filled with chaos and unnecessary drama and still one day create a home without it. This is ours.” 

In the caption, she shared her thoughts. “I waited a LONG time to have kids, and one of the main reasons was that I didn't know if I would be able to create a chaos-free home,” she began. “Chaos and drama was what I knew and it took me most of my adult life to learn how to set boundaries and prioritize healthy relationships. To step away from the chaos and be ok with it.”

She continued, “If you had a tumultuous childhood, chances are you're in this same boat. Just know that your past doesn't define your future. You can learn, you can change, and you can grow far behind what others may think possible. And while it will probably be the hardest decision you've ever made, and will continue to be on a daily basis, you can build the home you always wished for.”

Roth's fans flooded the comment section of her post with supportive messages about how she has broken the cycle. “If you didn't come from a healthy family, make sure one comes from you. We can overcome,” a fan wrote.

“Thank you for always showing your human side, your vulnerability, your feelings, your expectations, your struggle!” another fan shared. “Being that genuine and honest just makes me emotional and proud! Merry Christmas to you and your entire family!”

Other reactions include, “I, too, broke the generational curse. We are blessed,” “This is such honesty. Thank you. I'm sure this post will help others. Merry Christmas!,” and “Beautiful message! Love watching your shows because you are so positive! I'd watch your tv shows when I had my first girl and it was so edifying for me.”

Roth has shared a glimpse of her Christmas celebrations this year, posting photos from their holiday card, offering a look into her home, and accurately portraying what the festive season looks like with two small children. 

Jasmine, you are BEAUTIFUL  inside and out!!! You have a WONDERFUL family 💖❤️💖❤️ So happy for you🥰🥰🥰

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Miley Cyrus' Sister Is Engaged","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/miley-cyrus-sister-is-engaged/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 13:33:47 GMT","

Brandi Cyrus, the 38-year-old sister of Miley Cyrus, announced the day after Christmas that she got engaged. The singer, actress, and DJ joyfully captioned a set of Instagram snaps, “It's been the craziest, biggest year of my life and I get to close it out saying YES to forever with my dream man.” She then tagged her fiancé, Mountain Choppers bike shop owner Matt South. 

Brandi went on, “I'm so thankful everyday that my flight got cancelled and I walked into this coffee shop one afternoon and found you. You're my very best friend and everything I've spent my whole life looking for. I love you forever!”

South also shared his perspective of the proposal in a post he shared on December 27, romantically revealing that he proposed with a family heirloom. The bike enthusiast wrote, “A couple summers ago, I walked into a little coffee shop in Tennessee with @outlawpicker and asked to pet a pretty girl's dog. Couple weeks back, I threw that girl on the bike, pretended to break down out front of that same shop after hours and pulled my grandmother's ring out of the tool roll.”

He went on to shower with Brandi with praise, saying, “I've never met a sweeter woman. She's selfless, hardworking, driven, truly dedicated to giving her animals the best life she can and a real partner in every sense. She's my best friend and more than I could ever ask for.”

South added, “Last weekend we got to celebrate all this with some family and my best buds here in the US, it was a great night. I've always had a little luck on my side but it took more than I deserve to land this woman.”

Brandi replied to the sweet post by commenting, “LOVE YOU FOREVER!”

The news of Brandi's engagement comes just a few weeks after her sister Miley revealed her own engagement on December 2, 2025 by rocking a ring to the “Avatar: Fire and Ash” premiere. People reported the same day the red carpet photos hit social media that they confirmed the 33-year-old former Disney star is engaged to 27-year-old Maxx Morando via a source. “Francesca Simons, a rep for jewelry designer Jacquie Aiche, confirmed to PEOPLE that Aiche made the ‘bespoke' ring, which features a cushion-cut stone set on a thick, 14-karat yellow gold ban,” says the report.

Miley and Morando have been linked since 2021.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","PHOTOS: ‘Sleepless in Seattle' Cast Then & Now","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/sleepless-in-seattle-cast-then-now-photos/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 02:56:41 GMT","

Is there a movie as iconic as “Sleepless in Seattle”? The 1993 romantic classic also helped cement Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as two of the most reliable romantic leads of their era, setting the stage for their later reunion in “You've Got Mail.”

Released in 1993 and directed by Nora Ephron, the film centers on widowed father Sam Baldwin and his young son Jonah as they attempt to rebuild their lives after moving to Seattle.

Still mourning the loss of his mother, Jonah calls into a late-night radio show in hopes of finding his father's love again. Listeners across the country are drawn to Sam's vulnerability, including reporter Annie Reed. Though engaged, Annie feels an unexpected connection and writes Sam a letter asking him to meet her atop the Empire State Building in New York City on Valentine's Day. 

She ultimately leaves dinner with her fiancé and heads to the rooftop, where Jonah and Sam are waiting.

The final scene, inspired by “An Affair to Remember,” has since become one of the most iconic moments in romantic-comedy history. The film treats Sam's grief with care, captures Jonah's hopeful determination, and follows Annie's longing for something more than her predictable life in Baltimore.

Curious where Sam, Annie, and the rest of the cast ended up? Here's what the stars of “Sleepless in Seattle” have been doing since 1993.

The Oscar-winning actor starred as widower Sam Baldwin, a performance that further established Tom Hanks as one of Hollywood's most dependable leading men.

 In the years following “Sleepless in Seattle,” he anchored an extraordinary run of films, including “Forrest Gump,” “Apollo 13,” “You've Got Mail,” “Cast Away,” “Bridge of Spies,” “Sully,” “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” and “News of the World.”

 He also became the voice of Woody in the “Toy Story” franchise beginning in 1995, a role he continues to reprise. 

Beyond acting, Hanks built a prolific career behind the scenes, narrating the HBO miniseries “The Pacific” and amassing more than 50 producer credits across film and television, including “Big Love,” “The Sixties,” “The Movies,” “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,” and “In the Garden of Beasts.” 

Although he had already gained recognition through projects such as “Bosom Buddies,” “Big,” and “A League of Their Own,” Hanks' career reached new heights shortly after “Sleepless in Seattle,” when he won back-to-back Academy Awards for Best Actor for “Philadelphia” and “Forrest Gump.” 

He has since earned seven Emmys, four Golden Globes, including the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and two SAG Awards, among numerous other honors. 

Offscreen, Hanks was married to Samantha Lewes from 1978 to 1987 and shares two children with her, Colin Hanks and Elizabeth Hanks. 

He has been married to Rita Wilson, who also appeared in “Sleepless in Seattle,” since 1988, and the couple shares two sons, Chet Hanks and Truman Hanks.

Ryan portrayed reporter Annie Reed, whose unexpected connection to Sam begins after hearing him and his young son on a late-night radio show. By the time she took on the role, Ryan was already establishing herself as one of the defining romantic leads of the late 1980s and early 1990s, following breakout performances in “When Harry Met Sally” and “Joe Versus the Volcano,” the latter of which also paired her opposite Hanks.

After “Sleepless in Seattle,” Ryan continued her run in romantic dramas and comedies, starring in films such as “When a Man Loves a Woman,” “City of Angels,” “You've Got Mail,” “Kate & Leopold,” and “In the Land of Women.” 

She later expanded her career behind the camera, directing and starring in “Ithaca” and returning to the screen with “What Happens Later.” 

Ryan also voiced the title character in the animated film “Anastasia” and began producing films in the mid-1990s, with credits including “The Wedding Planner,” “Desert Saints,” and “Picture Paris.”

Ryan has earned three Golden Globe nominations, including one for “Sleepless in Seattle.” 

Offscreen, she was married to actor Dennis Quaid from 1991 to 2001, and they share a son, Jack Quaid. She adopted her daughter, Daisy True, in 2006. Ryan was later in an on-and-off relationship with musician John Mellencamp, with the couple calling off their engagement in 2019.

Malinger played Jonah Baldwin, Sam's thoughtful and big-hearted son whose late-night radio call sets the film's love story in motion. 

Just 8 years old when “Sleepless in Seattle” was released, Malinger stood out as a gifted child actor, earning attention for a performance defined by sincerity and emotional awareness well beyond his age.

Following the film's success, Malinger continued acting through the 1990s and early 2000s. His television credits include “Good Advice,” “Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher,” “Party of Five,” “Touched by an Angel,” and “Seinfeld.” He also voiced Theodore J. “T.J.” Detweiler on the animated series “Recess,” becoming a familiar presence in family-friendly television of the era.

Malinger stepped away from acting after appearing in a 2006 episode of “Without a Trace” and has largely remained out of the public spotlight since. 

Pullman played Walter, Annie Reed's reliable but unexciting fiancé, whose presence quietly highlights her growing sense that something is missing. 

Though his role in “Sleepless in Seattle” was a supporting one, Pullman's subtle performance helped ground the film's emotional tension.

After the film, Pullman built a versatile career across movies, television, and theater. His film credits include “Wyatt Earp,” “Casper,” “Independence Day,” “Battle of the Sexes,” and “Dark Waters.” On television, he appeared in series such as “Torchwood,” “1600 Penn,” and the acclaimed drama “The Sinner.” 

He also made his directing debut with “The Virginian” and has continued working on stage, including in productions such as “All My Sons.”

Pullman has been married to dancer Tamara Hurwitz since 1987, and the couple shares three children. 

O'Donnell played Becky, Annie Reed's quick-witted best friend and trusted confidante, bringing humor and heart to the film's quieter moments. Her performance helped balance the romance with grounded friendship. After “Sleepless in Seattle,” O'Donnell built a diverse career across film, television, and comedy.

She appeared in movies including “Now and Then,” “Harriet the Spy,” and “Tarzan.” At the same time, her television work includes roles on “The Fosters,” “SMILF,” “I Know This Much Is True,” and “The L Word: Generation Q.” 

She later returned to familiar territory with a role in the “A League of Their Own” television series, decades after playing Doris Murphy in the 1992 film. O'Donnell also hosted “The Rosie O'Donnell Show” for seven seasons and went on to produce projects such as “The Big Gay Sketch Show” and “The Specials.” 

She served as a cohost on “The View” from 2006 to 2007 and again from 2014 to 2015.

Away from the screen, O'Donnell is a mother of five. She adopted her son, Parker, in 1995, and later adopted Chelsea and Blake with her former partner, Kelli Carpenter. She welcomed her daughter, Vivienne, via artificial insemination.

O'Donnell married Michelle Rounds in 2012, and the pair adopted a daughter, Dakota, before separating in 2014. She later dated Aimee Hauer, whose relationship ended in 2022.

Wilson portrayed Suzy, Sam Baldwin's steady and compassionate sister, bringing warmth and grounding to the film's emotional world. 

After “Sleepless in Seattle,” she carved out a versatile career across film, television, theater, and music. 

Her screen credits include “Jingle All the Way,” “Now and Then,” “Runaway Bride,” “Gloria Bell,” “A Simple Wedding,” and “Boy Genius,” along with television appearances on series such as “The Good Wife,” “Full Circle,” and Lena Dunham's iconic HBO series—“Girls.”

Behind the scenes, Wilson has made a lasting impact as a producer. Her work includes the “My Big Fat Greek Wedding” franchise, the “Mamma Mia!” films, and “A Man Called Ove.” She also returned to the stage in a major way, stepping into the role of Roxie Hart during the 2006 Broadway run of “Chicago.”

In music, Wilson launched a solo career with her debut album, “AM/FM,” in 2012 and has since released three additional records.

Offscreen, Wilson has been married to Tom Hanks since 1988. The couple shares two sons, Truman and Chet, and she is also stepmother to Colin and Elizabeth, whom Hanks shares with his late former wife, Samantha Lewes. A breast cancer survivor, Wilson was declared cancer-free in 2015.

Garber portrayed Greg, Suzy's husband, offering a calm and supportive presence in “Sleepless in Seattle.” Following the film, he built an acclaimed career across television, film, and theater, becoming one of the most recognizable character actors of his generation.

On television, Garber found major success with roles on series including “Alias,” “Justice,” “Eli Stone,” “Deception,” “Web Therapy,” “The Flash,” “The Orville,” “Power,” “DC's Legends of Tomorrow,” and “Family Law,” which premiered in 2021. His film work spans titles such as “The First Wives Club,” “Titanic,” “Legally Blonde,” “Argo,” and “Happiest Season.”

He was recently seen in “And Just Like That”— the sequel to the hit HBO series “Sex & the City”. 

A classically trained performer, Garber has also maintained a strong presence on stage. His Broadway credits include “Damn Yankees,” “Arcadia,” “Present Laughter,” and “Hello, Dolly!” The Canadian-born actor married artist Rainer Andreesen in 2015 after five years together. 

Reiner played Jay, Sam Baldwin's close friend and dating adviser, bringing humor and perspective to “Sleepless in Seattle.” 

Long before the film, Reiner became a household name as Mike Stivic on the groundbreaking Norman Lear sitcom “All in the Family,” a role that launched his career in television and film.

Behind the camera, Reiner emerged as one of Hollywood's most influential directors. His work includes “This Is Spinal Tap,” “Stand by Me,” “The Princess Bride,” “When Harry Met Sally…,” “Misery” and “A Few Good Men,” films that helped define modern American storytelling. 

He also appeared in projects such as “The Story of Us,” “The Wolf of Wall Street,” “Shock and Aw,e” and television's “New Girl.” In addition, Reiner accumulated more than 50 writing credits, including work on the 2001 and 2013 Emmy Awards and the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors.

Born in the Bronx in 1947, Reiner was the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner and actress and singer Estelle Lebost. He was married to Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981 and adopted her daughter, Tracy Reiner. He later married photographer Michele Singer in 1989, whom he met while directing “When Harry Met Sally….” The couple shared three children, Jake, Nick, and Romy.

The BBC reported that Reiner and Singer were found dead in their Los Angeles home on December 14. Their son Nick has since been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with their deaths, a tragedy that sent shockwaves through Hollywood and marked a devastating end to the life of an iconic filmmaker and a complete family man.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Brigitte Bardot Dies at 91","https://pitchfork.com/news/brigitte-bardot-dies-at-91/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:17:49 GMT","

Brigitte Bardot, the French icon who glamorously embodied the postwar pop zeitgeist, has died. Her animal rights foundation announced the news in a statement sent to Agence France-Presse. No cause or date of death were given. Bardot was 91 years old.

Bardot was born into a wealthy Parisian family in 1934 and trained as a ballerina before landing the modeling jobs that launched her whirlwind career. She posed for the cover of Elle at 15 and made her acting debut two years later, in the comedy Le Trou Normand. Throughout the '50s, her appearance in risqué French films, some directed by then-husband Roger Vadim, endeared her to future giants of the nouvelle vague. Among them were Jean-Luc Godard, who cast her in his 1963 film Contempt, and new-wave godfather Louis Malle, whose Viva Maria! starred Bardot alongside Jeanne Moreau.

Bardot started releasing music in the '60s, collaborating with Bob Zagury, Sacha Distel, and, most sensationally, Serge Gainsbourg. Late in the decade, amid a scandalous affair conducted during her third marriage, Bardot and Gainsbourg released the classic duets “Comic Strip” and “Bonnie and Clyde.” A 1968 album, Bonnie and Clyde, compiled her recordings of various Gainsbourg numbers.

In 1973, Bardot announced her retirement from the entertainment industry, after which she became a prominent animal rights activist. In 1986, she founded the Fondation Brigitte Bardot to support global animal welfare. By the turn of the century, she had received the first of several fines for Islamophobic remarks, which often used discussion of halal meat practice to springboard into aggressively nationalist rhetoric about perceived “savages,” immigration, and racial purity. By 2021, she had been fined six times for inciting racial hatred .

Bardot is survived by her husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former aide to the French fascist Jean-Marie Le Pen, whose successor, Marine Le Pen, Bardot endorsed in recent elections.

Brigitte Bardot, one of cinema's most iconic sex symbols who quit the business to focus on activism, has died at age 91.


	“The Brigitte Bardot Foundation announces with immense sadness the death of its founder and president, Madame Brigitte Bardot, a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to abandon her prestigious career to dedicate her life and energy to animal welfare and her foundation,” the foundation announced on Sunday. A cause of death and date was not immediately available.


	“Her films, her voice, her dazzling glory, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne, Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. “French existence, universal brilliance. She touched us. We mourn a legend of the century.”


	Although only acting for about 20 years from the 1950s to the 1970s, the French performer left an indelible mark, embodying the sexual revolution that swept across society at the time. Becoming a global celebrity thanks to 1956's And God Created Woman, in which she played a liberated, unapologetically libidinous teenager, Bardot broke barriers in the depiction of eroticism on screen. As a result, her film career was littered with movies in which she was the object of desire, enrapturing the other characters and the audience simultaneously. Bardot walked away from acting in 1973 to crusade for animal rights, starting the Brigitte Bardot Foundation in 1986. But although she remained the platonic ideal of female beauty onscreen even after she retired, Bardot insisted she didn't see herself that way.

	











	“To tell you the truth, I don't feel all that exceptional,” she said in a 2014 interview. “That's how it always has been, and that hasn't changed.”

	











	Born in Paris on September 28, 1934, Bardot grew up in a well-to-do, conservative Catholic family. She bristled at her strict parents, exacerbated by the fact that she came of age during the Nazi occupation of France, but she found an escape dancing to records at home. That interest led to a stint in ballet, and later modeling. Her appearance on the cover of magazines such as Elle caught the eye of director Marc Allégret, who was interested in possibly casting her in his next film. The project never ended up happening, but it was how Bardot met aspiring filmmaker Roger Vadim, whom she married in 1952. (Her parents made her wait until she was 18 to wed.)

	Bardot appeared in a series of mostly unremarkable pictures — including her English-language debut in the 1955 hit comedy Doctor at Sea — before And God Created Woman. But it was that 1956 romantic drama, Vadim's directorial debut, that launched her. Playing Juliette, an 18-year-old orphan tempting every man in Saint-Tropez, Bardot oozed playful sex appeal. In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther aptly (and somewhat crudely) summed up the movie's appeal: “This round and voluptuous little French miss is put on spectacular display and is rather brazenly ogled from every allowable point of view. She is looked at in slacks and sweaters, in shorts and bikini bathing suits. She wears a bedsheet on two or three occasions, and, once, she shows behind a thin screen in the nude. What's more, she moves herself in a fashion that fully accentuates her charms. She is undeniably a creation of superlative craftsmanship.”


	The movie made Bardot a superstar — not just in France but overseas, where demand for more of her films quickly skyrocketed. Although male film critics were more taken by her looks than her movies' artistic merits, Bardot wasn't concerned. Asked around the time of And God Created Woman whether she wanted to be thought of as a serious actress, she responded, “I will be a serious actress when I'm older.”


	Labeled a “sex kitten” in the press, Bardot continued to portray characters who flaunted their sexuality, including in the 1958 crime-thriller In Case of Adversity, which saw her play a murder suspect who seduces Jean Gabin's married attorney. She had several commercial successes with Vadim, who had written or co-written her other 1956 smashes Naughty Girl and Plucking the Daisy. But after their divorce a year later, she was determined to prove that her stardom wasn't simply because of him, even though they continued to occasionally collaborate in later years. As Bardot once put it, “To be fair, if Vadim discovered and manufactured me, I created Vadim.”

	If anything, her celebrity only grew in the 1960s, with box-office smashes like the 1959 comedy Babette Goes to War paving the way for director Henri-Georges Clouzot's highly-anticipated 1960 courtroom drama The Truth, which starred Bardot as a womanmon trial for the murder of her boyfriend. Earning a Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar nomination and proving to be another commercial triumph, The Truth contains arguably Bardot's finest performance — indisputable evidence that she could be a “serious actress,” but on her own terms and on her own timetable. Plus, it was impossible not to think about her character's dilemma — a free-spirited young woman trying to escape a repressive upbringing — and not connect it to the similar break Bardot had orchestrated from her family. 


	Perhaps tellingly, she later said The Truth was one of the films she was proudest of, stating that she hoped the movie “would turn me into a tragic actress, a recognized actress; it would be the crowning glory of my career.” The David di Donatello Awards — the Italian equivalent of the Oscars — agreed, voting her Best Foreign Actress for the film.


	Bardot continued to enjoy a string of hits — including the 1962 romantic drama A Very Private Affair, which took inspiration from her life story — while expanding her list of acclaimed directors with whom she collaborated. Louis Malle, who had helmed A Very Private Affair, guided her to a BAFTA nomination for 1965's Viva Maria!, and she teamed up with Jean-Luc Godard for Contempt, a blistering portrait of a marriage in disarray. But although by that point Bardot had long established her bona fides as a legitimate actress — she shined in Contempt as a chilly, brittle wife being used as a professional bargaining tool by her husband (Michel Piccoli), a floundering screenwriter — Godard's producers reportedly forced him to include shots of her nude to help bolster the box office.


	Not content to simply be a movie star, she also pursued a singing career, recording several albums in the 1960s. Working with, among others, her future lover Serge Gainsbourg, she released Brigitte Bardot Sings and B.B., finding her greatest success with their 1968 collaborative album Bonnie and Clyde, which featured their dreamy, effortlessly cool duet on the title track. Naysayers dismissed her musical aspirations, accusing her of trading on her beauty and stardom. Bardot was defiant. Looking back at her life, she declared in 2012, “I've always done what I liked. … I know that I have more balls than many men. They could learn a lesson from me.”

	











	Although she was quite fond of her romantic comedy The Bear and the Doll, in which she plays a woman trying to woo Jean-Pierre Cassel's musician, as the 1970s beckoned, her stardom began to fade. After starring in 1973's The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot, she quit acting. She had never had an easy relationship with celebrity: “Nobody can imagine how terrible it is,” she told Vogue Hommes. “It's an ordeal. I could not live like this anymore.”


	Instead, she started speaking out about the mistreatment of animals. Becoming a vegetarian, Bardot used her wealth to help bankroll her own foundation dedicated to animal rights. In a 2014 interview, she reflected on her long struggle to stop everything from the wearing of fur to the slaughter of dolphins: “It is a battle. A fight against cruelty, stupidity, and the indifference of humans,” she declared. “It's animals against man, a furious fight meant to better the conditions of animals in the world, to open people's eyes, to fight their selfishness, and to protect the weakest from the most destructive forces.”


	But her passion for animals was sometimes eclipsed by her controversial comments on other topics. In her 2003 memoir A Cry in the Silence, Bardot disparaged members of the LGBTQ+ community, using a homophobic epithet and referring to them as “circus freaks.” She also railed against what she perceived as “the Islamization of French society.” Accused of inciting racial hatred, Bardot was fined 5,000 Euros, which was not the first time she had been accused of such crimes. (Later, in 2007, she publicly blasted the Muslim practice of killing sheep as part of Eid al-Adha: “I am fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its acts,” she wrote at the time.)


	Bardot further angered fans in 2018 by expressing no sympathy for her fellow performers who called out predatory men in the wake of #MeToo. Dismissing them as “hypocritical,” she told a reporter from Paris Match, “Many actresses flirt with producers to get a role. Then when they tell the story afterwards, they say they have been harassed … in actual fact, rather than benefit them, it only harms them.” Bardot claimed she had never experienced such harassment, asserting, “I thought it was nice to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a pretty little ass. This kind of compliment is nice.”

	She made good on her promise to never return to acting, but nonetheless remained forever etched in the culture's mind as a great film beauty challenging taboos in the depiction of sexuality on screen — forever the picture of youthful exuberance and endless possibility. Not that Bardot noticed as she devoted herself to animals rights and closely guarded her privacy. She granted journalists few interviews — a rare exception was in 2012 for Vanity Fair. “I don't feel old or used up,” she said, “and I don't have time to waste thinking about aging, because I live only for my cause.

Depending on Who You Ask — and What You're Willing to Believe — Aliens Are Real. And They've Visited Vandenberg Space Force Base in Lompoc More Than Once

Today, Vandenberg is best known for the booming SpaceX launches that send satellites into orbit. But once upon a time, it was a hotbed for UFO sightings, quietly logged by the military.

This year, those sightings resurfaced. Details of extraterrestrial encounters on the Central Coast were discussed in government hearings and explored in the newly released documentary The Age of Disclosure (2025). The film features government insiders who claim the feds have spent 80 years trying to cover up the existence of non-human life. 

Among the suits, there is a shared belief: We are not alone in the universe. 

Historically dismissed as fodder for conspiracy theorists, these accounts began to be taken seriously in 2017, when the U.S. government acknowledged briefings on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). 

In the years following, high-ranking military officials — many tied to nuclear weapons programs — started sharing the startling details of their strange encounters. 

Pentagon reports were released. Long-secret government programs meant to track and investigate UAP encounters were exposed. Some whistleblowers have even alleged the retrieval of UAP crash sites and non-human “biologics.” And a new NASA task force was recently created to investigate UAP. 

In The Age of Disclosure, former military leaders, quantum physicists, professors, and directors of these covert programs recount their experiences and swear it's all true. 

The most damning photo and video evidence remains classified, they say, but the proof is “indisputable.” Based on what they claim to have seen, the former admirals, lieutenants, and colonels were convinced that UAPs are real and they are definitely not human. 

The idea may not be so far-fetched. There are, of course, trillions of galaxies out there. Or maybe, there's an ancient civilization hidden at the bottom of the ocean — more foreign to humanity than the surface of the moon. 

Whatever they are, they're a national security threat, emphasizes Luis Elizondo in the film. Elizondo, the film's main narrator, is the former director of the once-secret Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). He argues the globe is in a secret war to reverse-engineer alien technologies. Anomalous phenomena is happening everywhere, with greater frequency, he warns, but it is often met with stigma and treated as taboo — something he blames on government disinformation campaigns. 

But the more UAP stories are shared, the more people are open to listening — and the closer they hit to home. 

ET Phone Lompoc

Witness testimonies recount highly unusual experiences at Vandenberg, such as a gigantic red, glowing square object that allegedly hovered over the base in 2003. 

In total, five incidents involving UAPs occurred at Vandenberg between 2003 and 2005, according to Jeffrey Nuccetelli, a former military police officer with 16 years of active service under his belt. 

“I'm here today because the American people have both the right and responsibility to know the truth about unidentified aerial phenomena,” he said during a House Oversight Committee hearing in September. He was dead serious, sitting stiffly in a gray suit behind a wooden desk. 

He relays it all in detail:Aa red, glowing square the size of a football field, erratic lights dancing over the ocean or blinking in and out of the skyline, a huge sphere of light floating over his own home, and the intimidation of witnesses to keep their mouths shut. 

Vandenberg — home to the National Missile Defense Project — was “repeatedly visited by UAP,” back when personnel were completing “historic launches,” Nuccetelli said. Each incident was witnessed and documented by multiple personnel, and reported up the chain of command, he adds. 

The most striking incidents occurred on October 14, 2003. Three Boeing contractors reported seeing a “massive glowing red square silently hovering over two missile defense sites,” Nuccetelli said. It lingered for several minutes before vanishing over the hills. 

Later that same night, security guards at a launch site reported a bright, fast-moving object darting over the ocean. Nuccetelli describes the “chaos” over the radio as the object moved toward the officers. “I heard my friends screaming, ‘It's coming right at us; it's coming right for us!'” he recalled in a flat tone. Moments later, it shot off and was gone. Five shaken witnesses reported to Nuccetelli that they saw a massive rectangular craft larger than a football field, which hovered silently for 45 seconds before shooting away at an impossible speed. 

A week later, there was another light over the ocean “behaving erratically,” Nuccetelli said. Witnesses truly believed their eyes, thinking it was an enemy aircraft, and declared an emergency. But the craft eventually took off, again at an “impossible speed.” These witnesses were allegedly intimidated by their superiors and told to keep quiet, Nuccetelli said. 

Things did go quiet until 2005, when another giant rectangle made an appearance. It was larger than a C-130, a huge military aircraft, according to the report. Again, it silently floated over the base until it disappeared into the night. 

Nuccetelli personally witnessed something, too. While off duty, he and two other police officers saw a pulsing, moving light over the ocean that he said was acting too strange to be a satellite. They watched it blink around the sky, vanishing and reappearing in different directions, until it appeared 200 feet above his house. 

“It was a 30-foot diameter sphere of light,” he said. “My friends and I watched it for a moment and then it gently  accelerated, and traveled up and disappeared into the stars.” 

These events profoundly changed his life, Nuccetelli testified. 

At Vandenberg and Beyond

In The Age of Disclosure, directed and produced by Dan Farah, multiple U.S. Air Force veterans describe incredible encounters with seemingly impossible details. Mario Woods, a retired air force security forces officer from South Dakota, says he saw a bright object — a “mini sun sitting in the air” — the size of a “Super Walmart” — not just a Walmart, a Super Walmart — floating above a nuclear missile site before his very eyes. Another describes seeing a matte-black diamond in the sky. The objects do a lot of “shooting off into the horizon” at instant acceleration — among other feats human-made aircraft could not possibly even dream of, the witnesses say.  

These stories go hand-in-hand with the criteria of most UAPs, or “observables,” as they're described in the film: hyper-sonic velocity; instantaneous acceleration; no visible signatures, such as propulsion or exhaust; transmedium travel through space, air, and water without compromising the craft's performance or disturbing the environment; anti-gravity; and biological effects on the people who interact with UAPs. 

The film then shows a map of the United States and zooms in on California's Central Coast. “VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE” — its former title — appears onscreen in all-capital letters, segueing into an account from Lieutenant Bob Jacobs. Jacobs describes photographing a missile carrying a dummy nuclear warhead as part of an experiment. As it was flying along, he said, “something else entered the frame.” He makes a whooshing sound effect, and describes this unknown craft shooting beams of light at the warhead from multiple directions. 

“All the while, everything in our frame was moving along at 8,000 to 9,000 miles an hour,” he says. “There's nothing of ours that could've done that. What could have done that?” 

Nuccetelli appears in the film, as well, telling producers what he told the Oversight Committee. He is joined by Chaz King, one of the security officers on watch the night of the red square and bright light incidents in 2003. The giant, nighttime object had no propulsion, no windows, and it was matte black. “It shot off, a thousand miles an hour, up the coast.” It was seen by more than a dozen direct witnesses. Nuccetelli says all the witnesses, despite different vantage points, all saw the same thing and told the same story.

“The UAP activity, surrounding nuclear weapons, is not a historic issue. It's an ongoing issue,” says Jay Stratton, former director of a government UAP task force, following the Vandenberg testimonies. 

What could do this? Extraterrestrials? A secret civilization? Foreign adversary technology somehow hidden from the U.S. government? There are theories, but no one knows. 

In the time since these encounters, no recent UAP sightings at Vandenberg have been reported. Whether they have occurred and just been kept under wraps is speculative. But legislation has been authored in recent years to protect whistleblowers and encourage disclosure. One such bill was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2022. Another one, with expanded, historic elements — the UAP Disclosure Act — was proposed again by senators this year. But legislators on the ET-side of history face pushback. 

Santa Barbara Congressmember Salud Carbajal would not comment directly on whether he believes in aliens. He has not signed onto any UAP-related legislation, either. 

Nevertheless, he said, “I've long been supportive of efforts to improve government transparency and accountability, including safeguarding whistleblowers. I believe it's important to defend servicemembers' constitutional right to speak to Congress without fear of retaliation. 

He added, “Any credible reports from our servicemembers, whether related to national security issues or unexplained phenomena, deserve to be heard.”

The long-standing mystery of whether we are alone in the universe is increasingly being answered with a “no” by the American public. According to recent polling highlighted by Wired, nearly half of all Americans now believe that extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth. This shift represents a significant move in the national consciousness, as the number of people who previously identified as “unsure” has plummeted by two-thirds, suggesting that citizens are moving off the fence and toward a definitive belief in alien presence.

The data reveals a fascinating partisan and demographic divide in these beliefs. While the idea was once relegated to the fringes of science fiction or conspiracy circles, it has now entered the mainstream. According to the report, 51 percent of Democrats and 49 percent of Independents believe aliens have visited our planet, compared to 42 percent of Republicans. Despite these variations, the overall trend points toward a society that is becoming more comfortable with the idea of non-human intelligence interacting with our world.

Experts cited by Wired suggest that the reasons behind this growing conviction are “complicated.” The surge in belief coincides with a period of unprecedented transparency—and subsequent speculation—regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). While some attribute the shift to a “literal mountain of evidence” in the form of declassified government documents, others argue that the rise in belief may be linked to a broader decline in trust toward traditional institutions. This environment has allowed narratives of secret military cover-ups and reverse-engineered technology to flourish.

The implications of this shift extend beyond mere curiosity. As reported by Wired, the increasing popularity of visitation narratives is beginning to impact political discourse and even scientific communication. Some researchers worry that the “noise” generated by UFOlogy could overshadow the legitimate work of astrobiologists searching for microbial life. Furthermore, there is a concern that these beliefs can fuel conspiracy theories that undermine democratic institutions.

Despite the lack of “smoking gun” scientific evidence, the conviction that “they are here” is stronger than ever. Whether this trend is driven by a genuine increase in unexplained sightings or a cultural need for answers in an uncertain age, the American perspective on the cosmos has fundamentally changed. As more people trade skepticism for belief, the search for life beyond Earth is no longer just a scientific endeavor—it is a cornerstone of modern American identity.

Open inquiry depends on the ability to ask uncomfortable questions and follow evidence wherever it leads. Eric Kaufmann argues that this norm is now under strain.

Drawing on history, survey data, and political theory, Kaufmann outlines how certain identity categories came to be treated as morally sacred—and how that shift has reshaped debates about equality, free speech, and academic inquiry. The conversation examines the long roots of today's culture conflicts, the move from equal opportunity to equal outcomes, and why disagreement is increasingly interpreted as moral transgression rather than intellectual difference.

At stake is what happens to liberal societies when some questions can no longer be asked, nd whether open inquiry can still be defended without abandoning concern for fairness and dignity

Eric Kaufmann is a professor of politics and Director of the Centre for Heterodox Social Science at the University of Buckingham. He has written for The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Times of London, Newsweek, National Review, New Statesman, Financial Times, and other outlets. His new book is The Third Awokening.

Sue Chilton was home alone last year when a group of four migrants with sinister face tattoos appeared on her doorstep.

Recognising the markings, the diminutive 83-year-old refused to let them into the house but put together a picnic for them to eat outside. “Sue hosted MS-13 for lunch,” howled Jim, her husband, referring to the brutal Salvadorian gang.

The Chiltons are fifth-generation ranchers who have farmed cattle on the Tucson sector of the Arizona border for nearly four decades. But their 50,000 acre ranch fell prey to the Mexican cartels, who exploited the undulating scrubland and a five-mile gap in the border wall that Mrs Chilton refers to as “the door”, to traffic migrants and drugs into the country.

During the first four months of 2024, the remote Tucson sector became the number one hotspot in the US for migrant crossings, with the border patrol apprehending more than 250,000 people.

Throughout last year, 2,000 people came across the Chiltons' land – sometimes hundreds a day – many of them wearing camouflage, carpet-shoes to hide their footprints and large backpacks stuffed with methamphetamine, fentanyl and cocaine.

But since Donald Trump returned to the White House and pledged to close the border, encounters are down 90 per cent while just 155 have been caught on the Chiltons' ranch, all of whom were sent back to Mexico.

“Thank you President Trump,” Mr Chilton enthused. “We're no longer worried about riding through this country. We're no longer worried about running into a group with an AK-47.

“That's the kind of people you see here coming across the border.”

Life on the frontier can be hard, and the Chiltons are well aware of the dangers. Entering their Thunderbird lair of a house which presides over the rugged terrain, a taxidermied mountain lion, shot by Mr Chilton himself, crouches menacingly in the entranceway. A few feet away, his Ruger Mini-14 ranch rifle leans against the wall.

But illegal migration has forced them to contend with a whole new set of risks. Last year, a group apprehended by border patrol while crossing their land was caught with an assault rifle and 100lb of cocaine. One of Mr Chilton's cowboys was riding along 18 months ago when he discovered a decapitated body with its head lying around 10ft away.

That's not to mention the economic impact. From employing an extra cowboy to check for migrants and repairing damaged water pipes and fences through which cattle escape, to cows dying from eating plastic left behind by those crossing the ranch, Mr Chilton estimates illegal crossings cost him around $100k a year.

“I don't want to sell my ranch, but if it were located 100 miles north, it would be worth twice as much as it is now,” he said. “Who wants to buy into this border issue?”

Brandishing a series of poster boards, Mr Chilton claimed Joe Biden's “outrageous” decision to scrap Mr Trump's border wall the day he entered office led to cartels bringing in groups of people around the end of the wall through their land.

Those in civilian clothes headed west, looking to hand themselves in to the authorities and claim asylum, he said. Using them as decoys to distract the border force, drug cartels then crept north, trekking through rocky ravines in the gruelling heat to smuggle their deadly cargo into the US undetected.

“Druggers bringing goods into the United States through my ranch were killing people in DC, New York, Detroit and Minnesota,” Mr Chilton said. “I find it very outrageous.”

Critics have accused the Biden administration of operating an “open border” policy that allowed more than eight million migrants into the country.

In Mr Chilton's view, the former president “developed policies which rewarded people coming in and avoiding the law”. “I really praise President Trump for taking existing law and shutting the border down,” he said.

While the Chiltons wish to see the border wall completed, they are sympathetic to those travelling to the US for a better life, employing Mexican cowboys on their ranch and filling 24 wells to provide relief to migrants suffering from heat exhaustion.

“Immigrants are wonderful, but they need to come in legally,” said Mr Chilton.

Sixty miles away outside Nogales, the border force has beefed up security. The small city is one of the largest points of entry into the US, with almost 50 per cent of the nation's fresh produce passing through its gateways each year.

Under the Biden administration, it became a bottleneck for migrants waiting for appointments via the CBP One mobile app to find out if they are eligible for asylum.

Now, agents in SUVs perch on hilltops for miles around, surveying the 30ft-border wall: a double-layered sheath of rust-brown metal reinforced with concertina wire that stretches as far as the eye can see.

The station, one of nine in the Tucson sector, has dramatically reduced crossings over the past year by implementing a “layered approach”, deploying drones and cameras, as well as more agents travelling by quad bike, mountain bike, helicopter and horseback.

“The bottom line is, if you sneak in and we don't catch you right here, we're going to be pursuing you,” said agent Ben Braker.

The local force has benefited from the administration's recruitment drive to hire 3,000 new border patrol agents, while front-line staff have been reassigned from processing migrants to making arrests.

But agents say the most important factor has been Mr Trump's decision to implement tough consequences for migrants, who now face being permanently barred if they cross into the country illegally.

“When you implement consequences, you change behaviour, and that's the baseline of why we've had such a reduction,” said agent Teresa Fast.

Since returning to office, Mr Trump has declared an “invasion” on the southern border, halted all asylum claim decisions apart from for white Afrikaners, imposed travel bans on 19 countries, ramped up deportations, deployed the military to the southern border and resumed construction of the border wall.

Mr Braker added: “If you're detected crossing the border illegally, you will be arrested. We will prosecute you under immigration statutes, and it will end up in deportation.”

So often the main talking point of Mr Trump's first campaign, discussion of the border wall has drifted out of focus in recent times.

A 27-mile stretch of new wall is under construction to the east of the town, while gaps near the Sasabe crossing point to the West have been plugged.

But a 30-mile stretch of the border remains unfenced, which ranchers and immigration hawks would like to see blocked off.

In the sun-scorched hills near Arivaca, Tim Foley has just finished fixing the fence to his plot of land after it had been cut by migrants travelling across.

With his leathery brown skin, sparkling white veneers and a handgun strapped to his leg, Mr Foley leads a team of volunteers called Arizona Border Recon, a vigilante group of mostly military veterans who have made it their business to stop people coming into the country.

Despite efforts to close off the border by the authorities, Mr Foley said “there's people getting through”.

Marching along the border in November, he stumbled across a migrant stopping point littered with hundreds of square yards of trash from mobile phones to passports “from every freaking country you can think of”. He has also discovered a 20kg pack of cocaine.

Although things are “much better” under this administration, Mr Foley said he wants to see more physical presence on the border around the clock and for the remaining gaps in the wall to be filled in.

“What they've done is created a big f---ing funnel there for 26 and a half miles” he said. “That's hanging wide f---ing open.

“Things are changing, but there's always going to be people crossing.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Germany faces unemployment crisis","https://www.rt.com/news/630096-germany-faces-unemployment-crisis-official/","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 00:12:00 GMT","

Prospects for finding a job in Germany have fallen to their lowest level on record, according to the head of the Federal Employment Agency, Andrea Nahles.



Speaking to DW News on Friday, Nahles said the job placement indicator, which normally stands at around seven points, has fallen to 5.7, calling it “the lowest ever.”



She described the labor market as having been “like a plank for months,” with “no momentum coming in.” Nahles added that prospects are particularly weak for new job market entrants, adding that even well-qualified workers are no longer fully shielded from job losses.



“We have placed as few young people into apprenticeships as at any time in the past 25 years,” the official said.



Her remarks come amid the economic downturn that followed Berlin's decision to halt imports of low-cost Russian energy, which had been vital for German industry. European gas prices surged after Russian pipeline deliveries largely stopped and the Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged.

Business bankruptcies rose to an 11-year high during the first three quarters of the year, contributing to rising job losses. The Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH) estimates that around 170,000 positions have been affected in 2025, up from fewer than 100,000 before the COVID-19 pandemic.



Unemployment surpassed the three million mark in August, and more than 100,000 more people entered the job market in November than in the same period last year.



According to the German Economic Institute (IW), the economy has entered a state of “shock” due to weak foreign demand, high interest rates, and a prolonged energy crisis. After an initial forecast of contraction, GDP is now expected to post modest growth of just 0.2%, with only 0.9% predicted for 2026.



In mid-December, the government approved reforms to unemployment benefits, replacing the existing system after three years with a new basic income framework. The changes introduce stricter requirements and tougher sanctions for recipients, with the stated aim of accelerating job placement.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera joins ‘America Reports' to report on the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.

A Honduran national had an ""unlucky"" encounter with Border Patrol enforcement on Friday.

The woman allegedly ran a red light in Slidell, Louisiana, and rammed into an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) vehicle, U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino wrote on X.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hidden heat beneath Greenland could change sea level forecasts","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251227082724.htm","Sun, 28 Dec 2025 08:48:45 GMT","

A research team led by scientists at the University of Ottawa has produced a new set of detailed 3D models that map temperatures deep beneath Greenland and northeastern Canada. These models shed light on how the region formed over millions of years and help explain how Greenland's massive ice sheet has responded, and may continue to respond, to climate change.

Mapping Hidden Heat Beneath Greenland

The project was carried out at the University of Ottawa in partnership with researchers from the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). To build their models, the team combined satellite observations with data collected on the ground. They then ran hundreds of thousands of computer simulations using high-performance systems, including resources from the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.

The results reveal that heat deep inside the Earth is not evenly distributed beneath Greenland. According to the study's lead author, these variations are closely tied to Greenland's geological journey across a powerful volcanic region in the past.

""Our new regional temperature models reveal significant lateral variations in the Earth's thermal structure beneath Greenland, which provide important information on the island's passage over the Iceland hotspot,"" explains uOttawa's PhD graduate Parviz Ajourlou, the study's first author. ""These variations help us better interpret Greenland's tectonic history and the influence of this history on the geophysical properties of the underlying rocks.""

Why Underground Heat Matters for Ice and Land

The temperature of the rocks beneath the ice plays a major role in how the ice sheet behaves today. Warmer conditions at the base can affect how ice slides, how the ground beneath it moves, and how scientists interpret satellite measurements of Earth's surface.

Glenn Milne, Chair and Full Professor within the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at uOttawa and the study's principal investigator, highlighted the broader importance of these findings.

""This research advances our understanding of the Earth's internal structure beneath Greenland. Temperature variations directly influence the interaction between the ice sheet and the bedrock, which must be quantified to interpret observations of land motion and gravity changes. These observations tell us how the ice sheet is responding to recent climate warming.""

Improving Predictions of Future Sea Level Rise

To create their 3D temperature model, the researchers analyzed a wide range of geophysical data, including seismic velocities, gravity anomalies, and heat flow. This comprehensive approach not only provides new insight into Greenland's geological past but also strengthens scientists' ability to model how the ice sheet may change in the future.

By better accounting for how heat inside the Earth interacts with ice above it, researchers can improve simulations of ice loss and refine estimates of Greenland's contribution to global sea level rise.

""This work is a good illustration of how our knowledge of the solid Earth enhances our ability to understand the climate system,"" says Ajourlou. ""By improving how we model ice-earth interactions, we can better forecast future sea level rise and plan accordingly.""

The mania around data centers has a lot of companies looking to become “picks and shovels” providers, by building profitable businesses that are ancillary to the gold rush gigs of selling server access or training leading AI models.

MayimFlow, the Built World stage winner at this year's TechCrunch Disrupt, is a good example. The startup is focused on essentially one task: preventing damaging water leaks.

Data centers use a lot of water, and that water can present a big risk, even if a leak is small. Founder John Khazraee told TechCrunch that many data centers only have reactive solutions for water leaks. That can saddle companies with downtime and set them back millions of dollars if one occurs.

Khazraee would know. He spent more than 15 years building infrastructure for IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. With MayimFlow, he's developed a combination of IoT sensors and edge-deployed machine learning models that can detect signs of impending leaks.

“I've noticed these issues in data centers, and the only solution they had was: ‘when the leak happens, we find out,'” he said in an interview. “Now you have to spend a lot of money to go remediate the situation. Now you got to turn off the servers. Now the data is being disrupted. So I decided to do something about it.”

Khazraee assembled a small team with plenty of experience to take on this challenge. Jim Wong, MayimFlow's chief strategy officer, has spent decades working with data centers. Chief technology officer Ray Lok has carved out a career in water management and IoT infrastructure. 

Beyond the scariest consequences of unnoticed water leaks, there's an element of frugality to what Khazraee is trying to do with MayimFlow, which he said comes from his childhood.

“I grew up in a very, you know, I don't want to say the word ‘poor' family, but we weren't the most well-off family,” he said. “And my dad would always, when I was taking a shower, tell me, ‘Hey, you're in the shower too long. Are you singing in there?'”

As he grew up, Khazraee said he found himself always thinking about how to make things more efficient — especially as he studied to become an engineer. In college, he worked at a facility that collected frying oil from restaurants and converted it to biodiesel. It was a “messy job,” he said, but he liked the end result. 

Khazraee is now trying to mix this penchant for frugality with the experience of his team. He believes they can give data center operators 24 to 48 hours of advanced warning that repairs will be needed. 

MayimFlow has collected a glut of sample data from various industrial water systems that allow them to make these kinds of predictions, he said. The company can provide sensors that can help monitor a water system or plug its machine learning models into existing ones if companies already have similar hardware.

Khazraee said he wants to bring this solution beyond data centers to commercial buildings, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and possibly even utilities. In his eyes, any company that wants to spot leaks early, or optimize water usage, could be a customer.

Khazraee thinks it's such a big opportunity he's turned down roles at multiple big tech companies while building MayimFlow over the last two years.

“I really believe in the vision. I believe in the impact that we're making,” he said. “Water is becoming one of those big issues in our world.”

Nalden, who co-founded the file transfer service WeTransfer in 2009 along with Rinke Visser and Bas Beerens, is not pleased with the company's direction after the service was acquired by Bending Spoon last year — and he doesn't mince his words about it.

“Bending Spoons doesn't really care about people, and even though I get that it is their private equity strategy, I notice that since I left [WeTransfer] in 2019, there were a lot of updates that were basically killing the product, in my point of view,” he told TechCrunch.

Post-acquisition, WeTransfer made a confusing move related to transfer link experiences and laid off 75% of its staff. This year, the company was caught in a controversy around using its users' content to train AI models and had to backtrack on changes to its terms.

Around this time, Nalden had creatives reaching out to share their frustration with WeTransfer. He realized that he wanted to build an alternative to WeTransfer with the original ethos of the service around simplicity. The service is called Boomerang, and you can use it to transfer files without logging in.

“Why do tech companies always make things so complicated? I've always struggled with this, and I just wanted to offer another tool that is just, it's all about user experience, it's ease of use, it's the simplicity of sharing something quickly, and that just saves time. You don't need to sign up, you don't need to verify via email,” Nalden told TechCrunch about the ethos of the service.

For casual users, the non-login experience would be sufficient, but it has its limits. You can have 1GB of total space, and upload files of up to 1GB in size with a seven-day expiration. If you want a bit more, you can choose to create a free account. That will get you 3GB of total space with a file upload limit of 3GB per file. You'll asl get access to your upload history, the ability to add and delete files anytime, and the ability to customize emojis on the page while sending the file.

If you want even more, there is a €6.99 per month paid tier, which will give you 200GB per space (folders) and 500GB total storage with a file upload limit of 5GB per file. Plus, you'll get custom covers for spaces, password protection for files, up to 90 days of expiry, and the ability to invite unlimited users to access files in a space.

Nalden is clear that with this new service, he doesn't want to offer advertising to users and keep a simple structure for payment. He feels that there is a lot of complexity in the advertising business, and with Boomerang, he wants to get the least amount of data he can from users. 

“I just want to offer a tool that works for users. It's like buying a hammer. You possibly don't want to buy a fancy hammer, but a hammer that just works,” he noted.

Boomerang's site and interface are barebones, and that is by design. Nalden noted that a lot of design is to please investors, and he feels that stripping down the experience is a refreshing change. While companies are looking to add more and more AI features, Nalden said that he is largely using AI to build the product, but he doesn't want to use it around user-facing features.

Boomerang is available on the web, but the company said it is planning to release a dedicated Mac app soon.

Get ready for a potentially busy time at theaters next year: both Dune: Part 3 and Avengers: Doomsday are coming December 18, 2026.

While the dates for these two films aren't new, what is is that Dune, at least, is currently sticking to this date. According to reporter Jeff Sneider on a recent “Hot Mic” episode, Warner Bros. currently has no intention of delaying the film, and reporter Matt Belloni separately mentioned recently on his own podcast “The Town” that “neither of them” are budging on the date. Now that Doomsday has put out one of its four teasers for the general public, it's looking like we'll be getting another Barbenheimer-type phenomenon in “Dunesday“, as Marvel actor Simu Liu recently declared.

Avoiding whether Dunesday is another Barbenheimer in the making—it's not, they're two sides of the same coin where Barbie and Oppenheimer were on different ends of the blockbuster spectrum—the big question is whether the two films will keep the same date or if one of them will budge. Admittedly, WB was the first studio to pin down a date for Dune: Part 3, and it's certainly a gutsy move to put its young sci-fi franchise against the more established MCU. But as Sneider noted, first dibs on the release calendar may as well not matter in the court of public opinion—Avengers: Doomsday has teasers to hype up its incoming release, complete with a countdown timer, and Dune doesn't even have a poster or anything to tease.

On the other hand, Disney's had no problems moving around release dates for several Marvel movies, Doomsday included. Back when it was still subtitled Kang Dynasty, it was meant to come out this past May, and even after the retitling, it was kicked back to May 2026 before being pushed again to the current December slot. So it wouldn't be a surprise if it had to be moved around once more, even if it's weeks before Dune to steal some of its thunder. There's a good chance either could move up, actually: aside from Spider-Man: No Way Home, MCU movies tend to stop at early November, while the Dune films have landed (or tried to) in September or October of their respective years.

At time of writing, Dune: Part 3 and Avengers: Doomsday will hit theaters on December 18, 2026. Let us know which one you plan to see, if not both, or whichever one you think will get out of the other's way.

Researchers tout potential medical and microscale manufacturing applications.

Fully programmable, autonomous robots “smaller than a grain of salt” have been developed in a collaborative effort between research teams from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan. Claimed to be the world's smallest of their kind, these nanoscale robots are expected to find applications in medicine, microscale manufacturing, and other areas. Remarkably, the researchers contend that these robots will cost only one penny each to manufacture.

Penn Engineering was responsible for the physical structure and features of these microscopic robots, while Michigan scientists gave the robots their ‘brains.' The Michigan lab involved in this collaboration also holds the record for creating the world's smallest computer.

Let's look at Penn Engineering's work first. Scientists there designed the physical aspects of the tiny robots, each measuring about 200 x 300 x 50 micrometers. This is similar to the scales of many microorganisms, and as such, they face different physical challenges than the robots with which we are most familiar.

With the challenges of drag and viscosity that such tiny robots will face, it was decided to make them ‘swimmers.' However, to keep them small, the scientists designed an entirely new propulsion system so that moving parts (such as limbs) wouldn't be needed for locomotion.

Interestingly, these robots generate an electric field that “nudges ions in the surrounding solution,” allowing them to “swim.” Adjusting this ion field can help robots move in complex and/or coordinated patterns. Having no moving parts also makes them highly durable; for example, they can be picked up with a micropipette without being damaged.

Another challenge of their tiny size was the power supply. The design that was adopted uses solar power, with the solar cells making up the majority mass of the robot body. Even though solar was maximized, it yields only 75 nanowatts of power, underscoring the importance of efficiency.

 




To be fully programmable, autonomous robots, these tiny machines need on-board processing, and this is where the expertise of the University of Michigan was applied.

According to the source blog, the robot's physical components get their smarts courtesy of a highly efficient processor, memory, and sensors. To program the robots, pulses of light are used – thus the solar panels do double duty. Meanwhile, to retrieve data from the robots and their sensors, they have been programmed to perform a honeybee-like waggle dance using their propulsion systems.

These robots can be deployed in their hundreds to get their tasks completed. Their autonomous operational life is measured in months, thanks to solar power and their level of efficiency. The first test sample carried a temperature sensor, which is good for all kinds of analytical tasks. However, it would not be challenging to switch the sensor.

Despite all this advanced technology at play, the researchers say that these fully programmable, autonomous robots “can be fabricated cheaply at scale,” costing only a penny each to produce. What we are seeing now is “just the first chapter” of micro-robots, promise the researchers.

Whether it was underdog heroics in World Cup qualifying, England winning Euro 2025, or United States President Donald Trump and FIFA president Gianni Infantino becoming best buds, international football played a big role in 2025 — and a men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico is just 165 days away.

In the club game, there were some honest truths from managers, incredible free kicks, the rise of long throws, and shock wins.

But away from the pitch, we could not look back on 2025 without touching on a more serious and tragic note — the death of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva.

Here, Nick Miller, Caoimhe O'Neill, Megan Feringa, Stuart James and Carl Anka review the year.

James: Wimbledon, 1988. You can't snap opponents like Vinnie Jones did, but this long-throw obsession is wild.

Anka: Twelve months of “Absolute Cinema” as the top level of the sport further transforms it into a content delivery machine, overshadowing everything else.

O'Neill: Let it all work out. Let it all work out. Ousmane Ballon d'Or. More in than out. More out than in. Let the dolls play.

Feringa: Blissfully chaotic at its best, pining for something lost at its worst. Also trigger alert: long throws.

Miller: I don't think I'll remember much actual football, but I do remember being quite tired and my brain being hammered for most of the year.

Miller: This choice is significantly influenced by the fact that I was there to see it happen, but Cape Verde qualifying for the World Cup. At the time, only Iceland had done it with a smaller population (Curacao have superseded them), but the unfiltered and uncomplicated joy in the stadium that day is something I'll never forget.

O'Neill: Sunderland making it back to the Premier League through the play-offs in the most majestic, last-gasp way. And then actually being a really good top-tier side. It was a long eight years out of the top flight, which included four weary seasons in League One. But Sunderland have bounced all the way back and then some.

Feringa: All of us making it through the 2026 World Cup draw in one piece and with most of our sanity intact.

James: Crystal Palace beating Manchester City to win the FA Cup (the first major trophy in their 164-year history) was pretty special — huge credit to their manager Oliver Glasner and the players. But the most magical thing about that day by far was the reaction of the Palace supporters at the final whistle. People, young and old, sobbing in a mixture of disbelief and joy. It was genuinely heart-warming — football touching the soul.

Anka: The Lionesses winning their second European Championship title. England entered the tournament in a transitional state, battled through tricky turbulence in three of their five matches, but still emerged victorious. In the 21st century, the tournament has been won either by Germany or a team managed by Sarina Wiegman. The Dutchwoman is a brilliant manager who is constantly asking us to reassess what we mean by “Good leadership”. She has excellent taste in music, too.

Miller: Scott McTominay. One of football's great glow-ups — from being a solid, arguably slightly boring, taken for granted 7/10 Manchester United midfielder, to title-winning, hard-partying, cigar-smoking, Pope-meeting, bicycle-kick-scoring, Serie A MVP.

O'Neill: It is always Marta. This year, next year, forever. Oh, and Troy Parrott.

Feringa: Any hero on the pitch is someone else's villain. But Michelle Agyemang really wore that cape in Switzerland: 138 minutes, two goals, twice seizing England from the clutches of “reigning champions dumped out” headlines. To accomplish it while being just 19 years old and at her first major tournament with England was sensational, not to mention against a backdrop of racist abuse aimed at her team-mate Jess Carter.

James: Stephen Crean, the 61-year-old Nottingham Forest fan who courageously intervened during a mass stabbing on a train from Doncaster to London last month. Crean had been making his way home from Forest's 2-2 draw against Manchester United at the City Ground when he was caught up in the train attack in Huntingdon, which led to a man being charged with 11 counts of attempted murder.

Forest fans gave Crean a rapturous ovation when he returned to the City Ground for their home game against Leeds United. “It meant the world to me. I could see people clapping, applauding and I just thank them so much,” he said. “I would have been happy with a few quid to go down the pub. I didn't expect anything.”

Anka: The two biggest games of McTominay's 2025 saw him score bicycle kicks — one to help Napoli win a league title, the other to help secure Scotland's qualification for the 2026 World Cup.

I undervalued his talent at Manchester United, and I have spent the year happily eating humble pie while applauding his success.

Also, a quick word on Calvin Bassey — because I don't think there's a centre-back on the planet who is having more fun in the men's game. The Fulham and Nigeria defender had good moments in 2025 as well as bad ones, but he's always found a way to crack a smile, cheer up his team-mates and remind us all that football is meant to be a laugh.

“That ball has gone to AFCON before us!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/emg89MR4nz

— Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) December 15, 2025



Miller: It won't do to overcomplicate these things, so it's a toss-up between two.

Either Gianni Infantino, who has seemingly spent the year sleeping in a little bed in the Oval Office, like a particularly dutiful dog, hopping up now and then to hand Donald Trump something shiny.

Or Jim Ratcliffe, for… well, claiming to understand the needs of the fans while jacking up ticket prices, making hundreds redundant while squandering millions himself, his undisguised contempt for Manchester United Women — take your pick really.

O'Neill: Vecna.

Feringa: A toss-up between whoever signed off on Sky Sports' Halo and Joey Barton.

James: Infantino. Where to start? The farce of the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize. Where to end? The absolute scandal of ticket prices at the 2026 World Cup. And there's plenty in between, too.

Anka: If a series of ghosts had visited Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the cold Christmas nights, it would do us all the world of good.

Miller: Troy Parrott's miracle hat-trick against Hungary. For not one minute did I think that the Republic of Ireland were going to come back and win that game, but when they did, my word: I can't remember the last time I so enjoyed a moment for a team with whom I have no emotional connection.

O'Neill: The fallout after Mary Earps released her book or Arsenal Women winning the Champions League. And not forgetting Burna Boy and Sarina Wiegman linking up on stage at England's Euro 2025 victory parade. That was iconic.

Feringa: Gotham's victory in the NWSL Championship. Winning it two seasons ago as the No 6 seed — a league-record low — was one thing. But lifting the trophy again two years on? This time as the No 8 seed? That's silly script stuff that no one believes in until it happens.

James: Well, I certainly didn't expect Chelsea to turn over Paris-Saint Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July. The way Liverpool's 2025-26 season has unravelled, including Mohamed Salah's outburst, was another big surprise. And who could have predicted that Sunderland would not just return to the Premier League but make a real splash. From a personal perspective, Snoop Dogg coming on board at Swansea City as a minority owner was a surreal moment. If only he could play right-back.

Anka: Ajax letting the 2024-25 Dutch league title slip through their fingers. They were nine points clear of PSV in mid-April before a four-game winless run allowed their rivals to snatch the Eredivisie trophy on the last day of the season.

Advertisement

Miller: Chloe Kelly scoring the winning penalty for England at Euro 2025. Even though she had missed a penalty a few days earlier (before tucking in the rebound), there was absolutely no chance she was missing that one. She seems to enjoy those moments of crushing pressure: she is, in the nicest possible way, a freak.

O'Neill: Robbie Williams singing a duet with Nicole Scherzinger at the World Cup draw. Pretty sure I predicted that a year ago…

Feringa: England winning Euro 2025. I really don't know why everyone kept panicking. You don't come back from the dead that many times and not win the whole lot. Also, Chloe Kelly is kind of inevitable at this point.

James: Ange Postecoglou and Nottingham Forest being a brief and unhappy marriage. It was, quite simply, never going to work at the City Ground, which makes you wonder why on earth Evangelos Marinakis, Forest's owner, and Postecoglou signed up for the 39-day eight-game farce that followed.

Anka: Chelsea winning the Conference League, and I mean that as a compliment. Chelsea are at their most compelling when they turn up and snatch the footballing dreams away from others (ask Bayern Munich fans about 2012), and they did so brilliantly in 2025.

Miller:  Cristiano Ronaldo being let off his three-game suspension for a red card, thus opening the door for him to play in the first two games of the World Cup.

O'Neill: Not letting Robbie Williams sing Angels at the World Cup draw.

Feringa: The decision to simultaneously broadcast most of the Women's Super League matches for the 2025-26 season at 12pm local time (and then 11.55am).

James: Steve Parish would like to answer this question. Back in July, the Crystal Palace chairman said that UEFA's decision to remove his Premier League team from the Europa League, for breaching multi-club ownership rules, is “the biggest injustice in the history of football”.

Advertisement

UEFA's judgement was harsh but I wouldn't go that far.

Anyway, with my football pyramid hat on, I'll always struggle with the idea that being runners-up in the National League, which is the gateway to the Football League, gets you nothing other than a play-off spot. Last season, York City finished 23 points above Oldham after 46 matches. But it was Oldham who won promotion.

Yeah, I know — everyone knows the rules at the start of the season. But still.

Anka: The Women's Africa Cup of Nations final in July saw Nigeria battle from a 2-0 deficit to defeat Morocco 3-2. However, they scored their first goal after the VAR decided Moroccan defender Nouhaila Benzina handled the ball inside the box, and before the VAR later overturned a penalty that was awarded to Morocco after they believed a possible handball from Nigeria's Oluwatosin Demehin was accidental. The Confederation of African Football would later receive a formal complaint from Morocco's federation, calling the match decisions “refereeing injustices”.

Miller: Not the best from a technical point of view, but by a distance my moment of the year was James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equaliser in the final men's Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, followed as it was by some fabulously undignified scenes from the Liverpool contingent and then a glorious, life-affirming singalong to I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues by the Everton fans that simply did not want to leave.

O'Neill: I wasn't there to watch it live but it has to be the final Liverpool goal from the late, great and dearly missed Diogo Jota.

It came against Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield in April and proved to be the winner. It was so Jota. Off the bench and on to come up with the goods for Liverpool just when they needed him to. A weaving move and a wonderful finish at the Kop end.

Feringa: I was in the Spanish end for their Euro 2025 semi-final against Germany when Aitana Bonmati scored the winning goal in the dying moments of extra time. The celebrations were visceral.

Close second: Jack Grealish's first for Everton against Crystal Palace. It was pretty grubby. But the limbs. I was convinced I'd be tumbling down the Hill Dickinson Stadium stands and taking at least four with me.

James: Paris Saint-Germain's third goal in the Champions League final against Inter was glorious and felt almost symbolic in terms of how it represented their team, their way of playing, and their coach, Luis Enrique. Vitinha was effortlessly weaving beautiful patterns inside his own half before driving forward with the ball, Ousmane Dembele's backheel was exquisite and then Desire Doue applied the coup de grace. Magnificent.

The results are in for the best play of the year!

The winner is… @PSG_inside, with a stunning goal by Désiré Doué in the @UEFA @ChampionsLeague final!

Josh Tymon's volley, for Snoop's Swansea against Oxford United, deserves a mention too. Postage stamp.

Anka: I prefer my Goal of the Month contenders to be long-range pingers rather than well-coordinated team goals so…

In real life? Amad's edge-of-the-box volley to rescue a 2-2 draw for Manchester United against Nottingham Forest at the start of November. Bonus points for how Matthijs de Ligt dips his neck as it flies past him, as he rightfully understands the strike would have taken his head off.

Outrageous technique from Amad 😱 pic.twitter.com/gmZaBTkG37

Watching live on the telly? Declan Rice's perfect free kick against Real Madrid. His continual growth and improvement since the 2019-20 season are remarkable.

Miller: “To be really honest, every time we have a defeat like that, I'm going to be like that. I'm going to say sometimes I hate my players and sometimes I love my players. Sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years.”

It's hard not to love Ruben Amorim, speaking here after Manchester United lost to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup… while at the same time desperately wanting to give him a hug and tell him to just stop being so honest.

O'Neill: I joined Goal Diggers FC on their march to Wembley in May after the Football Association announced a ban on transgender women from women's football. One of the people I met was Sammy Rees.

“I spent some time playing men's football. But it really wasn't my bag. I felt very uncomfortable and it was not the nicest environment. Then I joined Goal Diggers and I've never looked back. It's changed my life completely. These people have such open hearts. Since coming out, football has been my escape. We (trans people) wake up every day to more disgusting news about us: people vilifying us, people questioning our identity and our existence. 

“Football means that for two or three hours a week, I can switch my brain off. I can have a moment where I don't care about the news. It's my escape, and the fact that it's trying to be taken away from us is not fair.”

Feringa: “Sometimes they kill off the main character.”

Ange Postecoglou doled out some dimes during his Tottenham Hotspur tenure, but this, after overseeing the Europa League final triumph against Manchester United, was very prescient.

James: “It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus.”

Surely Salah's post-match bombshell at Leeds has to go straight in at No 1 in this category? Elite players just don't say things like that.

As for No 2, I'll go for Amorim's assessment of his Manchester United team back in January.

“We are the worst team, maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you (reporters) want headlines but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that. Here you go: your headlines.”

If only more managers showed that level of consideration to journalists.

Anka: Celtic manager Wilfried Nancy had a bumpy start to life in Scotland.

“People might think I'm an idealist as a person but not at all. I know exactly who I am and exactly where I want to go. And I know at this moment, yeah, my a** is burning! But stay strong and do what you need to do to be better.”

Miller: Manchester United are going to be actively good — not just “good in comparison to the dreck they've served up before”. Actively good. I can feel it.

O'Neill: Liverpool do not reclaim their Premier League title but win the Champions League instead. The Republic of Ireland qualify for the World Cup and win their opening match. Tranmere Rovers somehow make the League Two play-offs and are promoted to League One. What do you mean, ‘It's just me and John Aldridge manifesting all this'?

Feringa: Craig Bellamy will get Wales to the World Cup. Less prediction, more a burning prayer.

James: Donald Trump will lift the World Cup before the winning captain/Harry Kane* has the chance to do the same at MetLife Stadium on July 19.

*wishful thinking.

Anka: Noni Madueke will finally receive his Club World Cup winners' medal.","{'href': 'https://www.nytimes.com', 'title': 'The New York Times'}","soccer"

A trio of top players are a single Slam away from a boxed set of trophies—can any (or all) or them make it happen in 2026?ByTENNIS.comPublished Dec 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Dec 28, 2025

As we make our way toward the 2026 season—which begins Friday, January 2 on Tennis Channel with the United Cup—our Tennis Channel analysts and editors tackle the most important questions of the new year.Next up: Will we see a Career Grand Slam achieved in 2026?

DAVID KANE: Point of order, if we're going to see a Career Grand Slam happen next season, it will most likely come from a combination of Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner (although shoutout Stan Wawrinka, who is ostensibly a Wimbledon win away from the same achievement). Swiatek and Alcaraz are both missing the Australian Open, while Sinner fell just short of the boxed set last spring at Roland Garros. Melbourne has historically been a tough tournament for Alcaraz, who will be playing his first major without Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Sinner is still much more confident on quicker surfaces than clay. Therefore it stands to reason that Swiatek may be most likely to complete the career set Down Under, though she will face formidable opposition from the likes of Aryna Sabalenka, Amanda Anisimova, and Elena Rybakina.VICTORIA DUVAL: No. On the men's side, Jannik Sinner was so solid at last year's Australian Open and Carlos Alcaraz was equally so at Roland Garros and US Open. I foresee them splitting slams once again next year. On the women's side, there are several solid candidates who can make slam title pushes that might keep Iga Swiatek from winning the Australian Open.

COCO VANDEWEGHE: Yes, I don't see why Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner can't both do it this year! It would be interesting to see the two rivals flip the scripts at the Australian Open and Roland Garros next year the way they did at Wimbledon and the US Open this year.BRETT HABER: Even though Jannik Sinner was one point away at Roland Garros, I think Carlos Alcaraz has the best chance in Melbourne. Sinner and Iga Swiatek both squandered match points this year late in the major they need to complete the career slam—Sinner in Paris, Swiatek at the Australian Open. If they get close again, does scar tissue become a concern?PAUL ANNACONE: Yes. I believe Iga Swiatek will get there next year and win the Australian Open. When it comes to the guys, nothing would shock me, but it's tough to see both Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner making it happen in 2026. Maybe one or the other.

The Psychic Spider Ball is a main suit upgrade in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but it can be a bit tricky to find. This guide will show where to obtain the Psychic Spider Ball and provide details about what the upgrade is used for.


This suit upgrade requires a bit of backtracking once you gain access to the Thunder Shot, so don't worry about finding the Psychic Spider Ball until then.




The Psychic Spider Ball is located inside a hidden Lamorn temple in Ice Belt. Use the Thunder Shot to open the Thunder Blocker lock on the door in the Lobby on the Surface of Ice Belt, then use it again to activate the VUE-995 robot inside Equipment Storage.


VUE-995 will help you enter the path that leads to the Ancient Temple, which is where the Psychic Spider Ball upgrade is located.


Once you're in the Ancient Temple, use the Fire Shot to unfreeze the Lamorn statues around the perimeter of the room. Then, grab the two motes that appear and slot them into the statue in the center of the room to make the upgrade appear.




The Psychic Spider Ball allows you to magnetize and attach yourself to Spider Ball Tracks and Psychic Ball Tracks, or hang from Tether Nodes. Hold ZL to magnetize yourself to specifically marked magnetic tracks or nodes.


You can explore several new areas with this suit upgrade, and you can also use Morph Ball bombs to jump from track to track while magnetized.

      I'm doing research on the Travis Walton case and I didn't know how much animosity existed between the witnesses and Travis.
    


      I listened to an interview with Mike Rodgers, one of the first hand witnesses (boss of the lumber crew) and he REALLY dislikes Travis.
    


      he agreed to pay Rodgers about 30% of book sales but never did
    


      Travis married and then cheated on his sister (I think, I'll have to double check that part)
    


      they still talk but are still bickering
    


However, he still says he saw the event happen as it happened. There was a strange object and Travis was hit by a beam of light and did go missing.



      But he says he is skeptical of anything after that. He doesn't trust Travis about what he allegedly saw (grays, nordics) because Travis is generally an impulsive ego drive person.
    


      What do you guys think?
    


NOTE: I think this ""drama"" is evidence for it being a real UFO/NHI encounter. Mike would have said it was a hoax by now if it was.

Sunday marks the initial phase of Myanmar's first general election in five years, held under the supervision of its military government while a civil war rages throughout much of the country.

YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — Voters went to the polls Sunday for the initial phase of Myanmar's first general election in five years, held under the supervision of its military government while a civil war rages throughout much of the country.

Final results won't be known until after two more rounds of voting are completed later in January. It's widely expected that Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who has governed Myanmar since an army takeover in 2021, will then assume the presidency.

The military government has presented the vote as a return to democracy, but its bid for legitimacy is marred by the absence of formerly popular opposition parties and reports that soldiers used threats to force voters' participation.

While more than 4,800 candidates from 57 parties are competing for seats in national and regional legislatures, only six are competing nationwide with the possibility to gain political clout in parliament. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is by far the strongest contender.

Voting is taking place in three phases, with Sunday's first round being held in 102 of Myanmar's 330 townships. Subsequent phases will take place on Jan. 11 and Jan. 25, but 65 townships won't participate in the election because of ongoing armed conflicts.

Final results are expected to be announced by February. It wasn't clear if or when the authorities would release aggregate figures of Sunday's voting, although counts were publicly announced at local polling stations.

Critics of the current system say that the election is designed to add a facade of legitimacy to the status quo. Military rule began when soldiers ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It blocked her National League for Democracy party from serving a second term despite winning a landslide victory in the 2020 election.

They argue that the results will lack legitimacy because of the exclusion of major parties and government repression.

The expected victory of the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party makes the nominal transition to civilian rule a chimera, say opponents of military rule and independent analysts.

“An election organized by a junta that continues to bomb civilians, jail political leaders, and criminalize all forms of dissent is not an election — it is a theater of the absurd performed at gunpoint,” Tom Andrews, the U.N.-appointed human rights expert for Myanmar, posted on X.

However, the election may provide an excuse for neighbors like China, India and Thailand to say that the vote represents progress toward stability. Western nations have maintained sanctions against Myanmar's ruling generals because of the military's anti-democratic actions and the brutal war against opponents.

According to a count carried out at one polling station in Yangon after the polls closed, only 524 of 1,431 registered voters — just under 37% — cast their ballots. 

Of those, 311 voted for the pro-military Union Solidarity and Development Party, suggesting that opposition calls for a voter boycott may have been heeded.

Khin Marlar, 51, who cast her ballot in Yangon's Kyauktada township, said that she felt that she should vote, because she hoped that peace would follow afterward. She explained that she had fled her village in the town of Thaungta in the central Mandalay region because of the fighting.

“I am voting with the feeling that I will go back to my village when it is peaceful,” she told The Associated Press.

A resident of southern Mon state, who asked to be identified only by her first name, Khin, for fear of arrest by the military, told the AP that she felt compelled to go to a polling station because of pressure from local authorities.

“I have to go and vote even though I don't want to, because soldiers showed up with guns to our village to pressure us yesterday,” Khin said, echoing reports from independent media and rights groups.

Suu Kyi, Myanmar's 80-year-old former leader, and her party aren't participating in the polls. She is serving a 27-year prison term on charges widely viewed as spurious and politically motivated. Her party, the National League for Democracy, was dissolved in 2023 after refusing to register under new military rules.

Other parties also refused to register or declined to run under conditions they deem unfair, and opposition groups have called for a voter boycott.

Amael Vier, an analyst for the Asian Network for Free Elections, noted a lack of genuine choice, pointing out that 73% of voters in 2020 cast ballots for parties that no longer exist.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, more than 22,000 people are currently detained for political offenses, and more than 7,600 civilians have been killed by security forces since 2021.

Armed resistance arose after the army used lethal force to crush nonviolent protests against its 2021 takeover. The ensuing civil war has left more than 3.6 million people displaced, according to the U.N.

A new Election Protection Law imposes harsh penalties and restrictions for virtually all public criticism of the polls.

There were no reports of major interference with the polls, though opposition organizations and armed resistance groups had vowed to disrupt the electoral process.

Both the military and its opponents believe power is likely to remain with Min Aung Hlaing, who led the 2021 seizure of power.

“I am the commander in chief. I am a civil servant. I cannot say that I want to serve as a president. I am not the leader of a political party,” he told journalists after casting his vote. “There is a process for electing a president from parliament only when it is convened. I think it is appropriate to speak about it only then.”

Will Carlos Alcaraz claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the third time next season? 

The World No. 1 is fresh off a season in which he won a career-high eighth titles and earned 71 match wins according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The Spaniard has been working hard in the leadup to the 2026 ATP Tour season. Clive Brunskill of Getty Images photographed a day of the 22-year-old's training in Murcia on 24 December to provide fans a look into Alcaraz's efforts on and off the court.



Nearly two weeks ago the news broke that Alcaraz had split with longtime coach Juan Carlos Ferrero. The 22-year-old has been training under the watchful eye of Samuel Lopez, who formally joined his team ahead of last season. 



Alcaraz is an Australian Open triumph from completing the Career Grand Slam. The six-time major champion has emerged victorious twice at each of the other three Slam tournaments: Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open. He is also an eight-time ATP Masters 1000 titlist.



Alcaraz is next scheduled to compete in Melbourne at the Australian Open. Earlier this year, he made the quarter-finals at the event before falling to 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic.
