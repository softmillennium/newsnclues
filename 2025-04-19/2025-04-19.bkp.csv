            For hundreds of thousands of people every year who dream of studying or researching in the United States, a student visa is the golden ticket.
    


            Now, for hundreds of people already at US colleges and universities, it is turning into a one-way ticket back to their home countries as President Donald Trump's administration continues an aggressive effort to revoke visas and push academics out of the country – whether voluntarily or in handcuffs.
    


Visa programs in the US are complicated, with many requirements and conditions, and the State Department says it has broad powers to terminate them.
    


            Coming to the United States for anything but tourism usually means wading through an alphabet soup of visa types – more than two dozen for people who do not intend to become permanent residents of the US.
    


            But only three apply to people from other countries who plan to study in the United States. An F-1 visa is used by students attending an academic institution like a high school or college. The much less common M-1 visa applies to students in a vocational program.

DHS threatens to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host foreign students amid battle over universities' autonomy



            To accept students with those visas, an educational institution first must be certified by the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit, or ICE, through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, known as SEVP.
    


            In its disputes with Harvard University, the Trump administration has threatened to decertify the university from SEVP unless it agrees to give the Department of Homeland Security detailed disciplinary records on its international students – part of a broader White House effort to bring elite US colleges into lockstep with its political ideology. If Harvard is dropped from the program, it would not be able to accept students on an F-1 visa, with existing F-1 students traditionally allowed to seek a transfer to another US school.



            Additionally, many people with educational plans come to the US on a J-1 “exchange visitor” visa. This path includes not just academic study but also a “cultural component” supervised by a US organization approved by the State Department, a list that includes thousands of educational institutions. Professors, researchers and physicians typically come to the US on a J-1 visa.
    


            Although it comes with more strings attached than the F-1 visa, some students prefer the J-1 because it allows their spouses to work in the US, said Lisa Murray, exchange program director with the non-profit American Immigration Council.

            “Many prestigious scholarships, fellowships or grants are specifically tied to J-1 sponsorship,” Murray told CNN.
    


            All three types of educational visas use a government online database called SEVIS – the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System – to allow colleges and universities to provide legally required information to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security about international students at their institutions. That information includes the student's address and confirmation of their academic work.
    


            “US higher education institutions take the responsibility of enrolling international students and complying with SEVP requirements very seriously and understand the consequences of not doing so,” Fanta Aw, CEO of the non-profit Association of International Educators, said in a statement.
    


            “Institutions have codes of conduct and disciplinary measures in place to address student conduct which may result in terminating a student's SEVIS record as outlined by SEVP, just as there are established grounds for the government or the institution to withdraw its certification.”
    


            While a person's legal status – their ability to remain in the United States – is determined by US Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, visas are issued by the State Department and can be revoked for a number of reasons, including violating laws and providing false information on an application. The State Department's Foreign Affairs Manual makes clear a visa holder does not have to be formally charged with any crime before a visa can be terminated.

            “The Department may revoke a visa when it receives derogatory information directly from another US Government agency, including a member of the intelligence or law enforcement community,” the manual says.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio has terminated hundreds of visas under a rarely used provision that allows for revocation if a person's presence in the US “would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
    


            In the move's wake seems to be a two-tiered system to get affected students to quickly leave the country. First, the State Department revokes a visa, then ICE tells the student to leave immediately or, in at least one case, finds and detains them.
    


            Tufts University doctoral candidate Rümeysa Öztürk was confronted last month by federal agents on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts, and handcuffed as she shrieked in fear and confusion, as seen in surveillance video viewed around the world. Though Öztürk's F-1 visa had been revoked four days earlier, she hadn't gotten notice of it before her arrest, says a petition filed by her lawyers in federal court in Boston challenging the legality of her detention.
    


            Öztürk was “engaged in activities in support of Hamas,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson has said, without specifying the alleged activities. Her lawyers say she is unfairly being punished for speaking out in favor of Palestinian rights.
    


            Many foreign students now targeted for deportation say they have done nothing criminal or controversial in the US other than publicly support the Palestinian cause in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.
    


            And removal orders for students have not just affected visa holders. Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Madawi – pro-Palestinian activists at Columbia University – are now fighting deportation after the State Department ordered revocation of their permanent legal resident status, commonly known as a “green card,” and arrested them in March and April.
    


            More than 100 international students who have had their visas revoked claim the government is “stripping them of their ability to pursue their studies and maintain employment in the United States and risking their arrest, detention, and deportation,” a lawsuit filed on their behalf in federal court in Georgia states.
    


            Some of the students targeted never were protesters and or charged with a crime, plaintiff's attorney Dustin Baxter said.

            “Not only would they revoke the person's student visa – even if there was no conviction, if there was just an arrest, and sometimes there wasn't even an arrest, there was just an encounter and maybe a ticket – they would revoke the student visa,” Baxter said.
    


            Some foreign students say the first notice they received about their visa revocation was not from ICE but their school. Meanwhile, many universities got no formal notice of their students' visa revocations and found out only by seeing a student's name in government records, school officials say.
    


            After four students and two recent graduates of Stanford University in California had their student visas rescinded, the “University learned of the revocations during a routine check of the SEVIS database,” it said in a statement on April 4.
    


            That marks a major change from the way that system historically has been used, an immigration attorney told CNN.
    


            “Up until Trump took office, it was really up to the designated school officers to initiate that revocation in SEVIS,” said Jeff Joseph, president-elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “What we're seeing now is that ICE is doing it themselves.”
    


            Since Trump's second term began, the administration has put out warnings that the government has its eyes on people living in the US on visas.
    


            “US visa screening does not stop after a visa is issued,” the State Department said in March in a Facebook post. “We continuously check visa holders to ensure they follow all US laws and immigration rules – and we will revoke their visas and deport them if they don't.”

            Traditionally, the expiration of an exchange visitor visa does not mean a person is immediately considered to be in the country illegally. In fact, the State Department's website advises J-1 visa holders, “If your visa has expired and you do not plan to travel outside of the US, you do not need to renew the visa.” ICE tells F-1 visa holders, “You can stay in the United States on an expired F-1 visa as long as you maintain your student status.”
    


            But a number of students who have been told via email by the Department of Homeland Security their visas were revoked are getting the message they must “self-deport” within seven days if they want to avoid being arrested.
    


            “Do not attempt to remain in the United States. The federal government will find you,” one such email says, according to Boston immigration attorney Nicole Micheroni, who said she received the message apparently intended for a client.
    


            While Rubio has publicly touted efforts to revoke student visas, the State Department has been tight-lipped about individual decisions.
    


            “Due to privacy considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on Department actions with respect to specific cases,” an agency spokesperson told CNN in response to questions about several cases.
    


            Before a person in ICE custody can be deported, several steps can be taken, including exercising the right in many cases to petition the Board of Immigration Appeals. But the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2024 that visa revocations are almost never appealable.
    


            “Congress granted the Secretary (of State) broad authority to revoke an approved visa petition ‘at any time, for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,'” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote.
    


            A student visa holder “who violates a term or condition” of their legal status cannot apply for another visa until being out of the country for at least five years, according to State Department guidelines.
    


            Hundreds of thousands of new student visas are approved every year, according to the State Department, many of them for people extending existing visas or changing to a different type of visa as their educational status changes.
    


            Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a nephrology specialist and an associate professor at Brown University, was deported in March after ICE said she returned to the US from a trip to her native Iran, where she attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
    


            Alawieh originally came to the US on a J-1 visa to study at three American universities over six years but changed to an H-1B visa for skilled workers when she took the position at Brown, according to a court filing by her lawyers.
    


            The total number of student visas issued peaked in 2015, when nearly 1 million visas were approved. The approvals for F-1 visas dropped 27% the following year, according to State Department figures, then barely cleared six figures in 2020, when Covid travel restrictions and a temporary suspension of processing at embassies and consulates sent the numbers plummeting.
    


            Student visa approvals have returned to pre-Covid levels, but 2024 figures were still less than three-quarters of the 2015 record. Hundreds of institutions of higher education cited “social and political environment” in the US, as well as “feeling unwelcome,” as factors in declining international student enrollment during the first Trump administration, the non-profit Institute of International Education found.
    


            Trump's tone on international students has changed dramatically since the earliest days of his presidential ambitions.
    


            “When foreigners attend our great colleges & want to stay in the US, they should not be thrown out of our country,” Trump tweeted in August 2015, two months after launching his first campaign with a famous escalator ride at Trump Tower.
    


            A decade later, his administration has canceled more than 1,000 scholars' visas – and counting.

            In Flushing, Queens, fresh produce, soy sauces and seaweed-flavored snacks line the aisles at Chang Jiang Supermarket. Chang Jiang sits amid a row of stores in this majority-Asian community, where colorful storefronts feature signs in Chinese and fresh fruit is sold in boxes on the sidewalk.
    


            Local grocers are often the lifelines of the communities they serve. Indian grocers offer cake rusk biscuits to accompany chai tea, and Chinese grocers reliably keep red jars of Lao Gan Ma chili oil and dried plums in stock.

Here's which grocery store items will get more expensive because of tariffs



            But Chang Jiang Supermarket — like other Asian American grocery stores — is caught in President Donald Trump's trade war. Most imported goods face a 10% tariff even after the Trump administration suspended reciprocal tariffs against a laundry list of countries. But his biggest target, by far, is China. Last month, it began with Trump raising US tariffs on Chinese goods by 20% before tit-for-tat escalation rose levies to a whopping 145%. With no negotiations in sight for the two nations, that's putting community ties under growing strain — especially for Chinese grocers like Chang Jiang.
    


            “With the way things are now, if the tariff doesn't come down, after two months, there won't be any more inventory (from China) in the market,” said Wu, the Queens supermarket's manager, who spoke to CNN on the condition that only his last name is used.
    


            Across the US, shoppers can expect to see prices rise on seafood, coffee, fruit, cheese, nuts, candy bars and other imported foods due to Trump's across-the-board 10% tariffs. The anticipated price hikes will hit low-income shoppers the hardest, because they spend a greater share of their incomes on essentials like groceries. And for those who depend on produce and other items from China, the astronomical tariffs on Chinese goods will have an even greater impact.
    


            “Companies in China still depend on us consumers. However much they increase, it all impacts us consumers,” he said.
    


            During a phone interview in Mandarin, Wu said the suppliers he buys from are raising prices on all products. While manufacturers have not increased prices for the goods they currently have on hand, new inventory could see significant hikes of 30%, 40% or even 50%.
    


            It's often not even the cost of items that's an issue right now, Wu said. Some manufacturers have stopped shipping goods to the US entirely due to the tariffs, he said, leading to limits on sales and possible shortages in the short term.
    


            “The price hasn't increased very much (for what suppliers currently have on hand),” he said. But instead of selling him the 50 or 100 items he needs, “they'll say, ‘I'll just give you five or 10 items, and that's it.'”
    


            The supermarket hasn't raised prices for its customers just yet. But in two months, when his inventory from China will run out, Wu says he'll be forced to turn to suppliers in other countries — perhaps Taiwan or somewhere in Southeast Asia — to make up for the loss.
    


            “We hope that (the trade war between the US and China) is solved as soon as possible,” he said. “If it keeps on getting delayed for two months, the consequences will be unimaginable.”
    


            But it's not just this New York community — a similar pain is felt across the coast at Wing Hop Fung in Arcadia, California. The family business imports teas, Chinese herbs and other Asian products in this majority-Asian community near Los Angeles.
    


            “Our biggest trading partner is China, so when we hear that these tariffs are going up, we definitely feel it's a threat to small minority family businesses like ours,” Lan Ong, whose parents started Wing Hop Fung in 1985 and who now runs the business, told CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS earlier this month.
    


            She said containers were arriving from China with six-figures worth of products, and she isn't sure how the business will absorb tariffs that will more than double the costs.
    


            Ong has been trying to work with her suppliers and vendors, she added, but “as soon as that import, that container, arrives to our warehouse, that tariff has to be paid right away.”
    


            The demand for specialty and ethnic grocery ingredients has only been rising over the past decade, Phil Lempert, editor of trade publication Supermarket Guru, told CNN.
    


            The market for these specialty ingredients is expected to reach $153.2 billion worldwide in 2032, up from 2023's $81.6 billion market, according to estimates from Fortune Business Insights. That's largely because of broadening American tastes for Asian, Hispanic and Middle Eastern dishes, among others.
    


            “The internet has exposed us to foods from all over the world,” Lempert said. “You have a whole bunch of people going to the stores to be able to find foods they can't find in their traditional supermarket.”
    


            That interest had led to a transformation of the supermarket industry in the United States. H Mart, a Korean grocery store with a dedicated online fanbase, has grown to nearly 100 locations across the nation since its founding in Woodside, Queens, in 1982. Patel Bros, founded in Chicago in the 1970s, says it is now the largest Indian grocery chain in the United States. Asian supermarket chain 99 Ranch also has locations in multiple states from California to New Jersey.
    


            The H Marts of the world have the resources to prepare and fortify their supply chain, Lempert said. But for small, locally owned grocery stores, there isn't much they can do.
    


            In Honolulu, the uncertainty of Trump's tariffs has rattled small businesses in Chinatown. Chu Lan Shubert-Kwock, who founded the local Chinatown Business & Community Association, said that the trade war “will set us back.”
    


            “(Businesses are) not going to stock up until they sell their stuff,” she told CNN affiliate KHNL/KGMB last week. “You are not going to buy until you're sure how much your goods are going to be, and how much you can sell them for.”
    


            She added: “Nobody wins in this trade war.”
    


            In time, shoppers at these stores might see less product in the store. They'll also see higher prices, Lempert said.
    


            At Chang Jiang, Wu had a warning for customers who are worried about their favorite products going away or getting more expensive.
    


            “I'm calling for everyone to stock up during this short period of time when goods are still at their current prices,” he said, “because prices will definitely skyrocket later.”

Follow:


            An American citizen says he and his wife were detained for hours by US border agents when they returned to the United States after a short trip to Canada.
    


            Bachir Atallah told CNN he and his wife, Jessica, were driving back into the US Sunday evening after visiting family in Canada for the weekend when U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents stopped them for a secondary inspection at the Highgate Springs checkpoint in Vermont.
    


            Atallah, who is originally from Lebanon, said he was told to park his Range Rover and hand over his keys. When he asked the officer why, the officer placed his hand on his gun and told him to exit his vehicle, Atallah said. He said he was then handcuffed and led into a cell, where his belongings were confiscated. He said his wife was put into a cell across from his.
    


            “Seeing my wife's mascara running because she was crying, it was heartbreaking,” Atallah said. “It wasn't humane.”
    


            While detained, Atallah said he gave CBP agents the passcode to his phone after they asked for it. Despite his pleadings, agents never told him why he and his wife were being detained, he said. He said he was never read his rights.
    


            “The traveler's accusations are blatantly false and sensationalized,” CBP officials said in a statement to CNN affiliate WMUR. “CBP officers acted in accordance with established protocols. Upon arrival at the port of entry, the traveler was appropriately referred to secondary inspection – a routine, lawful process that occurs daily and can apply for any traveler.”
    


            A mass deportation campaign by the White House has sparked fear as it aims to slow arrivals at the border and remove undocumented immigrants. President Donald Trump has also threatened to send certain US citizens to offshore prisons, a notion experts say has no legal basis.
    


            “I feared for my life,” Atallah said.
    


            Without answers as to what was going on, Atallah said he started to have chest pains and felt dizzy, and told CBP to call an ambulance. A record reviewed by CNN shows Emergency Medical Services evaluated Atallah around 8 p.m. Sunday night.

            Atallah said he was told by CBP if he went to the emergency room, an officer would accompany him and then return him to the cell to start the entire process from the beginning. He said he chose to stay, to not to leave his wife.
    


            Atallah said after he was first handcuffed, he told officers to call his lawyer, his sister Celine Atallah, who works as an immigration attorney.
    


            A person identifying himself as an officer at US Customs and Border Patrol left a voicemail message on Celine's phone close to 9 p.m., informing her Atallah and his wife were at Highgate Springs CBP, they were “safe” and they would “be here for a little while,” the message said.
    


            “He wanted my help, not to know that he's fine,” Celine Atallah said in an interview.
    


            Bachir and Jessica left around 11 p.m. Sunday, he said.
    


            “Thank God we're safe,” they said in Arabic once they got into their car to drive home.
    


            When reached by phone on Friday, Atallah said he was in Lebanon visiting family. He told CNN after his and wife's treatment last week, he's worried about returning to the US.
    


            “I hope they don't retaliate because I'm speaking out,” Atallah said.

WASHINGTON, April 19. /TASS/. The current US option for a settlement in Ukraine ‘would be hard for Vladimir Zelensky to swallow,' The Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote.

""The current [US presidential special envoy Steve] Witkoff package would be hard for <…> Vladimir Zelensky to swallow. But the dealbreaker might be that it doesn't seem to include US-backed security guarantees. Instead, Ukraine would apparently be left to fend for itself with assistance from European nations, but probably without the US ‘backstop',"" the article said.

""European officials have told me that without American help, their military and intelligence support won't be sufficient to protect Ukraine after a peace agreement. The Europeans don't have enough troops or modern weapons to deter an all-out Russian attack. They lack the command-and-control systems needed to monitor a ceasefire and coordinate a response,"" Ignatius pointed out.

According to him, the toughest problem for Europe is insufficient intelligence capabilities. ""Kiev last month managed to survive a six-day cutoff in US intelligence support, intended to squeeze concessions from Zelensky. But if it had gone on another week, Ukrainian officials are said to believe the consequences would have been disastrous,"" the article emphasized.

Earlier, Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that the US authorities are ready to recognize Crimea as Russian territory as part of the peace agreement between Moscow and Kiev. According to the agency, such a move shows US President Donald Trump's desire to achieve a ceasefire and settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. The final decision has not been made yet.

The news agency also emphasized that on Thursday, Washington presented its allies in Paris with proposals for a Ukrainian settlement. Among them are the easing of sanctions against Russia and the refusal to discuss Kiev's membership in NATO. In addition, the US draft implies that all territories liberated by Russia will remain under Russian control. Discussion of these plans will continue next week in London.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

NEW YORK, April 19. /TASS/. The natural resources deal that Washington is planning to conclude with Kiev is not related to the settlement of the Ukraine conflict, Spokeswoman for the US Department of State Tammy Bruce said.

""This is something that is separate. This is not a part of the ceasefire talks. It is not an element within the agreement to stop this catastrophe,"" she told Fox News.

Bruce added that US President Donald Trump ""would expect that to be signed toward the end of next week.""

On April 17, Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Sviridenko announced the signing of a memorandum on the minerals deal, describing it as a sign of productive cooperation and a shared aim to finalize a full agreement. The sides are working toward setting up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction, which, once formalized, will need to be ratified by both nations' parliaments, she added. However, she did not disclose any specifics regarding the deal's provisions.

The signing was halted on February 28 following a disagreement between Vladimir Zelensky and Trump during a White House meeting. On March 27, Kiev reported receiving a revised draft from Washington, which was significantly more stringent than the original. The new version requires Kiev to repay over 120 billion dollars in aid. Additionally, the US would oversee the investment fund dedicated to Ukraine's reconstruction, which would be financed through Kiev's income from licensing fees and extraction leases. Since then, Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stated they are still finalizing their stance on the deal, while Zelensky criticized Washington for shifting the agreed terms.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Appraisal of international public affairs leaders warned companies against aligning with ‘polarizing' Trump ally

Associating with the Donald Trump administration's multibillionaire adviser Elon Musk and misusing artificial intelligence are among the most surefire ways for companies to damage their brands, a new survey of more than 100 international public affairs leaders found.

Those findings stem from an appraisal conducted by the Global Risk Advisory Council, which was chaired by the head of the US Small Business Administration during Joe Biden's presidency, Isabel Guzman.

In a statement, Brett Bruen of the Global Situation Room, the Washington DC-based public affairs firm that commissioned the survey, said the council's “reputation risk index” contains an “unambiguous warning” for chief executive officers. “If you squander stakeholder and consumer goodwill on these issues, it won't be coming back anytime soon,” said Bruen, before calling on companies to “slow down” and “make a distinction between transitory and tectonic transitions”.

Nearly 30% of a 117-member group hailing from 17 different countries and 58 industries – among them former heads of state and US officials – indicated that aligning oneself with Musk, or being targeted by him, generated the strongest likelihood possible of being thrust under heightened scrutiny.

The world's richest person – whose holdings include the aerospace company SpaceX, the electrical vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the social media platform X – donated part of his wealth to Trump's successful run for a second presidency in November. After Trump returned to the Oval Office in January, Musk has overseen brutal federal budget and staffing cuts overseen by the president's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), giving him what Guzman has described as a “controversial omnipresence in the media landscape”.

That observation falls in line with some public opinion polling that has suggested strong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump. A Quinnipiac University survey released in March which showed 60% of voters look down on the way that the businessman and Doge “are dealing with workers employed by the federal government”. Stock in Tesla slumped amid the backlash. And there were subsequently reports that Musk would gradually shift away from his prominent place within the Trump administration.

“The impact of association with influential figures in today's heavily divided environment cannot be understated, especially with a deeply polarizing leader like … Musk,” Guzman wrote in a summary of the index's findings.

Yet an even greater threat to brands were earning stories that feature “creating deepfakes, misinformation, biased decision-making or unethical applications that cause harm or manipulate public perception”, the survey said. Attracting that kind of coverage was reportedly viewed “as the most likely to gain negative online news attention”, the survey added.

An unnamed council member reportedly said: “AI, if not understood or managed in companies, can have an incredible trickle-down effect that may not be reversible.” One of the group's experts noted that organizations these days need to regard AI policies as equally standard to those that account for more mundane aspects of their operations.

Rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives aiming “to ensure fair treatment and full participation for all individuals” was labeled brands' third top risk. The Trump administration has aggressively moved to eliminate such measures within the government, military and beyond, including at Harvard, where the White House recently axed more than $2bn in federal research funding after the university refused to end DEI programs, one of several demands from the president.

Anticompetitive practices and facing allegations of defamation round out the top five reputational risks flagged by the first edition of a survey planned for quarterly publication.

“This data is not just numbers; it indicates the complex communications challenges facing organizations constantly,” wrote Guzman, adding the committee's members suspect that reputational threats are bound to only escalate in the short term.

Other members of the council that produced the survey include Iceland's former foreign affairs minister Thórdís Kolbrún Reykfjord Gylfadóttir; Bank of Ireland public affairs head Paul O'Brien; DoorDash's global head of public affairs Taylor Bennett; American Association of Exporters and Importers president Eugene Laney; and Maria Toler, the founder of SteelSky Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on women's healthcare.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Price of cocoa – chocolate's key ingredient – has climbed over past year and tariffs on imports will keep prices high

For many Americans celebrating Easter, the holiday is incomplete without chocolate: chocolate bunnies and eggs, bars tucked into Easter baskets, candy hidden in plastic eggs for Easter egg hunts.

But the rocketing cocoa costs will mean higher prices for chocolate candy this year, and Donald Trump's tariffs on all imports will likely keep prices high for the foreseeable future.

Every year, Americans spend billions of dollars on sweets during what the National Confectioners Association calls “the big four candy seasons”: Valentine's Day, Easter, Halloween and the holidays. Last year, Americans spent $5.4bn in Easter candy, according to the association.

But the price of chocolate candy specifically has been rising over the last year, largely because of the soaring cost of cocoa, the key ingredient for chocolate. In 2023, farmers in west Africa – where 70% of the world's cocoa is harvested – started to struggle with climate-related crises, including drought and plant disease, that decimated their cocoa production.

Estimates put the cocoa deficit at over 400,000, significantly inflating the price of cocoa over the last few years. Cocoa has cost around $2,000 a ton over the last few decades. In 2024, it peaked at over $12,000.

This has led to chocolate prices soaring across the world. Hershey, the biggest chocolate producer in the United States, raised the prices of its chocolates last year, and ultimately struggled to maintain consumer demand. The company had its worst profit in seven years in 2024.

Chocolate is particularly sensitive to price increases because it's an item in the grocery store that doesn't really have any substitutes, said Joseph Balagtas, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. This is why the price of eggs has risen so much, and why painting potatoes instead doesn't quite work.

“If you know you're going to grill this weekend and chicken prices are high, maybe you're more likely to make hamburgers or pork chops rather than chicken breast,” Balagtas said. “But chocolate-chip cookies without chocolate chips are a little tough.”

And now, with Trump's new tariffs in place, the price of chocolate is expected to rise even more. While economists don't know exactly what the effects of tariffs will look like, the Yale Budget Lab estimates that tariffs could cost consumers $4,900 a year, with an average price increase of 3% across all goods.

Chocolate prices will be no exception. When Trump introduced his latest slate of tariffs in early April, he had a direct message for American companies. “If you want your tariff rate to be zero,” he said, “then you build your product right here in America.”

For many businesses deeply tied to the global supply chain, shifting manufacturing to the US is complicated and costly. For chocolate manufacturers, it's impossible.

The cacao plant, which produces cocoa, can only be grown in tropical climates, of which there are only two in the US: Hawaii and Puerto Rico. This means the vast majority of cocoa consumed in the US are imported.

“The United States produces, I'm going to generously say, 100 tons of cocoa a year,” said Greg D'Alesandre, co-owner and chocolate “sourcerer” for Dandelion Chocolate in San Francisco. “We use about 120 tons of cocoa a year, and Dandelion is considered a very, very small chocolate maker. There's no chance that [the US] can make all the cocoa that we actually need.”

This means that chocolate makers big and small are affected by universal tariffs. Not only do chocolate producers have to worry about the high price of cocoa, but also inflation in other parts of their manufacturing process.

“I'm more concerned about packaging prices,” said Oliver Holecek, owner of Primo Chocolate based in Troy, New York. “Most paper manufacturing happens in China, and there's just really not a lot of great resources in the US yet.”

Shipping prices could also be impacted by the tariffs, as congestion builds up at American ports as companies grapple with the new tariffs.

It all adds up to an unstable environment, particularly for smaller chocolate businesses that don't have the leverage and resources as bigger manufacturers.

While Dandelion had to increase prices last year amid the rise in cocoa prices, D'Alesandre said it's unclear how the company's customer base will respond to further increases.

“I've known three chocolate makers that have gone out of business over the last three years because there's too much turmoil in pricing,” D'Alesandre said. “It's very difficult to make a plan for it … we're doing our best to make plans, but a lot of it is wait and see.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Peer-reviewed study's findings raises fresh question on the toxic substances'  impact on fertility

Microplastics have been found for the first time in human ovary follicular fluid, raising a new round of questions about the ubiquitous and toxic substances' potential impact on women's fertility.

The new peer-reviewed research published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety checked for microplastics in the follicular fluid of 18 women undergoing assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Salerno, Italy, and detected them in 14.

Follicular fluid provides essential nutrients and biochemical signals for developing eggs. Contaminating that process with bits of plastic quite likely has implications for fertility, hormonal balance and overall reproductive health, the authors wrote.

The findings represent a major step toward figuring out how and why microplastics impact women's reproductive health, but are also “very alarming”, Luigi Montano, a researcher at the University of Rome and study lead author, said.

“This discovery should serve as an important warning signal about the invasiveness of these emerging contaminants in the female reproductive system,” the study states.

From the top of Mt Everest to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, microplastics and smaller nanoplastics have been detected throughout the environment. Food is thought to be a main exposure route: recent studies found them in all meat and produce products tested.

Microplastics are particularly dangerous because they can contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals. That includes highly toxic compounds like PFAS, bisphenol and phthalates that are linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, hormone disruption or developmental toxicity.

Microplastics have been found throughout the human body and can cross the brain and placental barriers.

Montano's latest paper is part of a larger project he's leading for which he has also detected microplastics in human urine and semen, and examines the impacts on fertility. He said he suspects microplastics are among chemicals driving plummeting sperm counts and a drop in overall sperm quality.

“We have proven this decline, especially in areas where pollution is bad,” Montano said.

Though men are more susceptible to the substance's toxic effects, he added, women are also possibly impacted. Animal research has linked the presence of microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. Another study on mice showed alterations to ovarian tissue.

The paper notes a “possible presence of correlation between the concentration of microplastics” and reproductive health in the women who participated in the new study.

Montano added that the bisphenol, phthalates, PFAS and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are “very dangerous”. The chemicals are already well-known for disrupting hormones and harming women's reproductive health.

The follicular fluid paper offers a “very important finding”, said Xiaozhong Yu, a University of New Mexico microplastics researcher, but he added that more work is needed to determine the dose and level of exposure at which adverse effects start to happen.

“This is the work in the next phase – we need to quantify,” Yu said. His team is also attempting to answer some of those questions with broader epidemiological research.

Montano's team is doing similar work, and he's spearheading research that is trying to determine how much reducing the use of plastic in the kitchen and eating an organic diet, will reduce the level of microplastics in the body.

The substances' ubiquity makes it difficult to avoid, but reducing the amount of plastic used in the kitchen – from packaging to storage to utensils – can likely reduce exposures. Pesticides can contain microplastics, or in some cases are a form of microplastics, so eating organic may help.

Experts also advise that people avoid heating plastic, or putting hot food and liquid in plastic.

Single-use paper coffee cups, for example, can shed trillions of bits of plastic when hot liquid is added. Similarly, tea bags can release billions of particles, and microwavable plastic is also a problem. Plastic utensils that briefly come into contact with hot pans can also leach chemicals, and wood and stainless steel alternatives are better.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will resume talks in Rome on Saturday

Iran's top negotiator believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the US is possible as long as Washington is realistic, as the two sides prepare to resume talks in Rome on Saturday.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and the US Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will begin indirect negotiations through mediators from Oman, after their first round in Muscat, which both sides described as constructive.

“If they demonstrate seriousness of intent and do not make unrealistic demands, reaching agreements is possible,” Araqchi told a news conference in Moscow on Friday after talks with Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov.

Tehran has, however, sought to tamp down expectations of a quick deal. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was “neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic”.

The talks take place under the shadow of Donald Trump's threat to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the US over its nuclear programme.

The US president told reporters on Friday: “I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can't have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”

Trump, who ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers during his first term in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran, has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran since returning to the White House in January.

Washington wants Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb.

Tehran, which has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful, says it is willing to negotiate some curbs in return for the lifting of sanctions, but wants watertight guarantees that Washington will not renege again as Trump did in 2018.

Araghchi said Iran's right to enrich uranium was “non-negotiable”, after Witkoff called for its complete halt.

Since 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal's limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the west says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.

In an interview published on Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, said Iran was “not far” from possessing a nuclear bomb.

Grossi, who held talks with Iranian officials during a visit to Tehran this week, said the US and Iran were “at a very crucial stage” in the talks and “don't have much time” to secure a deal.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

In the recent meeting held at the White House between economic revitalization minister Ryosei Akazawa and U.S. President Donald Trump over U.S. tariff measures, it became clear that Trump considers the current situation surrounding car exports and defense burden-sharing with Japan to be problematic.

Meanwhile, a subsequent meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other officials showed their interest in the topic of rice exports to Japan.

The government intends to consider measures to address these concerns in order to conclude the negotiations on the new U.S. tariffs.

When Akazawa entered the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, he found himself being ushered into the chair right in front of Trump's desk for a face-to-face meeting with the U.S. president. His original negotiating partners, namely Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, intently watched the conversation between Akazawa and Trump on the sidelines.

Trump spouted off, saying that the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is as high as $120 billion (about ¥17 trillion) and that not a single U.S. car is running on Japan's roads. He went on to complain that the United States is defending Japan, but Japan is not bearing any of the burden.

The U.S. trade deficit with Japan is actually $68.5 billion as of 2024.

Understanding that Trump tends to exaggerate everything while not paying attention to the facts and tries to negotiate to his advantage, Akazawa tried his best to speak with a cool head.

Akazawa stressed that Japanese companies have been contributing greatly to job creation in the United States through investment and that Japan does not discriminate against U.S. cars.

He also explained that Japan's share of the cost of hosting U.S. troops in the country, in what is dubbed the “sympathy budget,” is over ¥1 trillion for the period from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2026.

At a ministerial-level meeting held afterward at a different location, Bessent, Greer, and Lutnick said that U.S. motor vehicle safety standards were not being treated as at the same level as Japan's. They were also critical of Japan's system of importation and distribution of rice for being highly regulated and nontransparent and called for the country to import more meat, seafood and potatoes.

As these topics had already been touched on in the USTR report on foreign trade barriers, the Japanese side were already aware of them.

However, Bessent and other officials did not specify in advance what they would prioritize in the talks and refrained from evaluating the Japanese proposal to increase its imports of agricultural products. Akazawa has reportedly asked them to clarify what issues they are prioritizing.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba intends to soften the U.S. position with more specific proposals, with increases to the imports of U.S. rice and soybeans being considered as one bargaining chip.

China was the destination of 54% of U.S. soybean exports in 2023. With the imposition of high retaliatory tariffs between the two countries, Japan intends to partially make up for the drop in China's imports of them.

In the area of automobiles, the government intends to find ways to ease the certification system for vehicles of overseas makers.

Bessent and the other U.S. negotiators did not make reference to Japan's share of the defense burden during the meeting. Therefore, the issue is not expected to be a major topic of the tariff negotiations. However, the prevailing view within the Japanese government is that: “Now that Trump has mentioned it, we have no option but to include some measures.”

Ishiba is considering a visit to the United States in order to reach an agreement with Trump before the House of Councillors elections in the summer.

The Japan-U.S. tariff negotiations are among the first bilateral talks related to the tariff measures and are thus other countries are paying close attention to them. Both sides are expected to put their cards on the table in the second round of the talks, which could be conducted before the end of the month.

Reuters

11:47 JST, April 19, 2025

PARIS, April 18 (Reuters) – French President Emmanuel Macron invited scientists from all over the world to come work in France or Europe, as U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration has started slashing funding for universities and research bodies.

Macron did not mention the U.S., where hundreds of scientists have been dismissed in cutbacks to research that come amid a broader clash between Trump and Ivy League universities.

“Here in France, research is a priority, innovation a culture, science a limitless horizon. Researchers from all over the world, choose France, choose Europe!” Macron said in a post on X.

Trump administration officials point to the wave of pro-Palestinian protests on campuses last year as a rationale for its demands of the universities. However, critics among faculty and student groups say the measures are designed to chill speech and that campuses should be a place for freedom of expression and academic thought.

The threat to academics' livelihoods at U.S. universities has given Europe's political leaders hope they could reap an intellectual windfall.

France on Friday launched the “Choose France for Science” platform, operated by the French National Research Agency (ANR), which enables universities, schools, and research organizations to apply for co-funding from the government to host researchers.

“France is committed to standing up to attacks on academic freedom across the globe,” ANR said in a statement.

It added that “the international context” was creating the conditions for an unprecedented wave of mobility among researchers worldwide, and that France intends to position itself as a welcoming place for those wishing to pursue their work in Europe.

ANR said the platform would allow universities to submit projects to host international researchers, especially in areas including health research, climate and biodiversity, artificial intelligence, space studies, agriculture, low-carbon energy and digital systems.

U.S. Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, a pro-Ukraine Republican representing Pennsylvania, visited Ukrainian troops near the front line on April 18, following his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.

""These are amazing soldiers, the men and women of the Ukrainian military, much like the men and women of the U.S. military, have this amazing fighting spirit. They're fighting for their democracy, they're fighting for the freedom – all of us in America need to stand behind them,"" Fitzpatrick said in a video address filmed on the front line, published on his Facebook account.

""I always have and always will have their back. I encourage all my colleagues in Congress to come here."" 

Fitzpatrick's visit comes as Washington signaled that it was ready to cease its mediation efforts to end Russia's war against Ukraine if one of the sides ""makes it difficult.""

In a post shared on Facebook, Fitzpatrick published another video, showing him signing an artillery shell with a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

“It was my profound honor to deliver a very ‘personal' message to Vladimir Putin today, from the front lines of the war near the Russian border, on behalf of our PA-1 community,” Fitzpatrick wrote. 

He said he had spent several days on the ground, visiting artillery units of the National Guard and the drone operators from the Third Assault Brigade, who he praised for ""completely changing warfare - not just here but across the globe."" 

Fitzpatrick said that during the visit, the group was shelled near the Russian border, tracked by Russian drones, and forced to carry out an emergency evacuation from the area. 

According to Fitzpatrick, the territories previously occupied by Russian forces were ""completely burned down."" 

“That's what they do. They overwhelm you with bodies, overwhelm you with artillery with not a lot of thought behind it,” he said.

Earlier on April 17, Fitzpatrick met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which the two discussed U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, the proposed full and unconditional ceasefire, and broader efforts to achieve what Zelensky described as “a dignified and lasting peace.”

Zelensky praised Fitzpatrick's commitment, particularly his decision to meet with Ukrainian soldiers near the front. “This is very valuable. Thank you for your support!” Zelensky said.

Fitzpatrick serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment, and Cyber. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Revoked visas, deportations and political uncertainty are forcing Indian students to reconsider studying in the US.

At least 1,024 international students at US colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to a review of university statements and correspondence with school officials by The Associated Press.

The administration of US President Donald Trump said it should be allowed to deport noncitizens over involvement in pro-Palestinian activism. But in the vast majority of visa revocations, colleges have said there is no indication affected students had a role in protests.

The United States issues the bulk of its foreign skilled worker visas (H-1B) to students from India, many of whom are drawn to the US because of OPT (Optional Practical Training) programs in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). OPTs allow graduates to remain in the US for an additional two years after completing their studies.

One Indian student on a STEM OPT, who was recently approved for an H-1B visa, told DW he was arrested ""while helping out an injured friend because he could not drive.""

He explained that he was charged with driving under the influence in January, but pointed out that he was not convicted. After searching for a job for more than two years, he finally received an offer letter, but lost it because his visa had been revoked.

""I took out a massive loan to study in the US which I still have to repay. I worked hard for four years and I am at a stage of settling down. If I lose all of this over a mistake, then what is the point?"" he said. ""What am I supposed to tell my aging parents back home?""

The visa crackdown, widely seen as part of Trump's immigration agenda, is fueling anxiety among Indian students hoping to study in the US.

The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the US.

The US Department of Homeland Security has terminated the visas of 22 international students at the University of Michigan, according to a statement issued earlier this month.

The university has ""reached out to affected individuals who ... are required to leave the country immediately. We are working closely with offices, colleges and schools from across the university, to ensure the impacted individuals understand their options and have access to resources,"" the statement said.

""For the last two weeks, we are tirelessly working to help the students,"" said Ravi Lothumalla, a US-based education consultant who is also counseling Indian students on their student visa revocations and helping them connect with lawyers.

Chand Parvathaneni, a Texas-based immigration attorney, whose firm has consulted nearly 40 students facing visa revocations, noted that ""most of these cases are of minor violation charges.""

He said many charges don't warrant deportation and don't imply guilt, noting that, ""the government has not given the students a chance to respond back so now students are needing the intervention of the court.""

Most Indian students in the US take out big loans for a US education. Along with mental stress, the students are now also having to deal with the hefty cost of legal fees, Parvathaneni said.

For Indian students, the wave of mass visa revocations of international students comes on the heels of two high-profile cases of deportation of Indian students — Badar Khan Suri and Ranjani Srinivasan.

Indian postdoctoral fellow Badar Khan Suri of Georgetown University was detained in the US over alleged ties to the Palestinian militant group Hamas, his lawyer said. A court has put his deportation on hold.

Ranjani Srinivasan, a Fulbright scholar at Columbia University, self-deported to Canada last month after her visa was revoked following accusations of pro-Hamas advocacy.

An Indian PhD scholar studying at a university in Atlanta told DW on the condition of anonymity that: ""My university has unofficially advised us to remove any posts that are seemingly controversial.""

""After two years, I was planning to go back home and meet my parents but in the present circumstances, I fear I might be denied entry to the US on my return.""

The changed political environment and aggressive targeting of international students under Trump has forced many Indian students to look at the US as a study destination with skepticism.

For 26-year-old Bhavika Kohli, who wants to pursue a STEM-designated master's degree, the US had long been a top choice.

""Right now my decision-making has completely changed,"" she told DW, adding that even if she graduates in two years, she might not be able to get a decent job as an international student ""in this kind of political environment.""

Kohli said she is weighing her options now. ""The incumbent government in the US has even compelled me to consider doing post-graduation from India"" — an option, she said, she never considered until now.

A growing number of students from India share concerns with Kohli who see the current political environment as hostile toward international students.

""Compared to last year, we are anticipating a 20%-25% fall in the number of Indian students going to the US this year,"" Sushil Sukhwani, founding director of Edwise International, an India-based study abroad consultancy, told DW.

More than anything, the students' apprehensions are rooted in the uncertainty that comes with Trump's sudden and sweeping policy decisions.

Madhavan, who didn't want to give DW his real name, has quit his job in Delhi as he is slated to join a master's journalism program at a US university in August. However, he is anxious for his future as an international student under the Trump administration.

""There is an institutional level of change ongoing in the US. And considering that, as an Indian student, I feel extremely powerless and uncertain. If I am going there, I don't know what is going to happen,"" Madhavan said, adding that he should be planning his move to the US, but instead he is wondering if he would even be allowed to go.

""It's extremely uncertain and it is going to be challenging, since you don't know what you can or can't do.""

US President Donald Trump said the clock was ticking on closing a Ukraine peace deal. Meanwhile, the US will reduce the number of troops based in Syria to fewer than 1,000 in the coming months. DW has the latest.

Here are the latest developments concerning the Trump administration on Saturday 19 April, 2025:

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, are reported to be negotiating indirectly in Rome through an Omani official who will shuttle messages between the two sides.

The two interacted briefly at the end of the first round of talks last week, but direct negotiations have not taken place since 2015.

Ahead of the talks, Araqchi met with his Italian counterpart, Antonio Tajani, and called for all parties to ""seize the opportunity to reach a reasonable and logical nuclear deal.""

However, the Islamic Republic's utmost authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was ""neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic"" about the outcome of the negotiations.

US President Donald Trump has threatened military action against Tehran if diplomacy fails, telling reporters on Friday: ""I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can't have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.""

Washington wants Tehran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb.

The United States is prepared to recognize Russian control of Ukraine's Crimea region as part of a broader peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, Bloomberg News reported.

Citing people familiar with the matter,  Bloomberg said a final decision on the US position had not yet been taken.

The concession would suggest that Washington is keen to finalize a ceasefire plan after US President Donald Trump on Friday expressed his frustration with the progress of negotiations.

Kyiv has repeatedly said it would not cede territory to Russia.

The Kremlin seized and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and continues to fully control the region.

Russia has declared the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya part of its territory, but does not fully control those areas.

Under a proposed peace deal presented by the US to allies in Paris on Thursday, the frontline in the three-year conflict would be frozen and most other Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia would remain under Moscow's control, Bloomberg reported.

Ukraine would also have to forgo its ambition of joining NATO, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the talks.

US Vice President JD Vance has arrived at the Vatican for talks with senior Catholic Church officials, the first in-person talks of Donald Trump's second presidency.

Vance, who is a Catholic, was due to meet Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, and deputies.

However, he is unlikely to meet Pope Francis, who is recovering after a long stay in hospital when he was treated for double pneumonia.

The Trump administration and the church are at odds over the US president's crackdown on illegal immigration.

Pope Francis has called the mass deportation of undocumented migrants from the United States a ""disgrace.""

The vice president has cited medieval-era Catholic teaching to justify the crackdown.

The pope has also criticized Trump's widespread cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programmes.

The Catholic Church's worldwide charity arm, Caritas, has called the Trump administration's aid cuts ""catastrophic"" in terms of its impact on the developing world.

The US Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelan men held at an immigration center in northern Texas.

The court directed the Trump administration to keep holding the men at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, located 24 miles north of the city of Abilene, for now.

""The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,"" the Supreme Court justices said in a brief, unsigned order issued early Saturday.

The ruling ensures that the detainees will have the opportunity to challenge their deportation in court.

Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito publicly dissented from the decision.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took legal action to block the deportations of dozens of Venezuelan men under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA).

US President Donald Trump is using the legislation to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, whom he accuses of staging ""irregular warfare"" against the US. 

The ACLU said in a court filing that some of the men had already been loaded onto a bus and were told they were to be deported.

Lower US courts have previously barred the removal of detainees under the AEA until due process has been followed. But no such order has been issued for northern Texas.

The ACLU said it went to the Supreme Court after lower courts in the area failed to act swiftly.

An Iranian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Italy ahead of nuclear talks with the United States, Iran's state television reported.

Araghchi was shown disembarking from an Islamic Republic airplane in Rome.

After the first round of indirect talks was described as productive, Araghchi is due to hold a second round later Saturday with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.

The negotiations are being mediated by Oman.

The United States and Iran are to hold a new round of talks on Saturday in Rome about Iran's nuclear program. 

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will negotiate indirectly through mediators from Oman. 

These come after a first round of talks in Oman that both sides described as constructive.

US President Donald Trump on Friday repeated his aim for Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which many believe is aimed at building an atomic bomb. 

""They can't have a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said on Friday ahead of the talks. ""I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.""

The White House has unveiled a revamped COVID-19 website which promotes the contentious theory that the virus came from a Chinese laboratory. 

The CIA said in January in an assessment of the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak that it was ""more likely"" to have leaked from a Chinese lab than to have come from animals.

But the CIA said it had ""low confidence"" in its judgement, suggesting the evidence was deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.

The new COVID-19 website contends that the pandemic's ""true origins"" was a human-made pathogen that leaked from an infectious disease laboratory in Wuhan, China. 

The World Health Organization remains open to all theories, including that the pandemic started with infected animals sold at a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan.

The failure of China to allow independent scientists access to Wuhan and various data sets means that the debate around the pandemic's origins is likely to remain unresolved.

However, the lab leak theory has recently gained mainstream traction in the US.

The revamped website is critical of US government steps taken during the pandemic like social distancing, and mask mandates.

A multitude of studies have shown that wearing a mask indoors can help stop spread of COVID-19 infections.

It also singles out individual government officials for criticism. 

The site previously focused on promoting vaccine and testing information.

More than 1 million people died of Covid-19 and related illnesses in the US.

The Trump administration's policy of refusing to issue passports to transgender and nonbinary Americans that reflect their gender identities is likely unconstitutional, a judge ruled on Friday. 

District Judge Julia Kobick temporarily blocked the enforcement of the new passport rule for six transgender people who sued to challenge it.

In January, Trump signed an executive order directing the government to recognize only two biologically distinct sexes, male and female.

The State Department soon after changed its passport policy to only recognize a person's biological sex at birth — that is, people can only use the sex that is on their birth certificates rather than the sex they identify as.

The policy also only allowed passport applicants to list as male or female.

This meant people could no longer self-select their sex on their passport or chose the neutral ""X"" sex marker, often used by nonbinary people.

Kobick said the executive order and the passport policy are based on irrational prejudice toward transgender Americans.

They therefore went against the constitution's commitment to equal protection for all Americans. 

Friday's ruling only applies to six people. The ruling doesn't bar the government for using the new policy for other passport applicants. 

Transgender people in the US were first allowed to change their sex marker on their passports more than 30 years ago.

The United States will roughly halve the number of troops it has deployed in Syria in the coming months, the Pentagon confirmed on Friday.

The US has had troops in Syria for years as part of efforts against the so-called ""Islamic State.""

A Pentagon spokesperson said less than 1,000 US forces would be left in Syria in the coming months, down from about 2,000 troops spread across a number of bases. 

The US started withdrawing the first of its troops on Thursday, according to the New York Times.

The move is a reflection of the changed security situation in the Middle Eastern country. 

In December, a rebel coalition ousted Bashar Assad, bringing an end to much of the fighting that had mired Syria in civil war for more than 14 years. 

Despite IS having suffered major territorial losses and military defeats in Syria, analysts warn that the Islamic terrorist group still poses a ""persistent danger.""

US Senator Chris Van Hollen said that he met Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, at a hotel.

The Democratic senator spoke to reporters just after landing back in the United States following his three-day trip to El Salvador to press for Abrego Garcia's release.

Van Hollen said the case ""is not only about one man,"" but also about President Donald Trump's disregard of the American judicial system.

Van Hollen said Abrego Garcia was brought to his hotel after the senator attempted to visit the man, who has been imprisoned in El Salvador since he was sent there on March 16. 

Van Hollen accused El Salvador of trying to stage the meeting and glorify its treatment of Albrego Garcia to ""deceive people about what's going on.""

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Van Hollen said government officials put cocktail glasses on the table to make it look like the two men had been drinking. He also criticized initial plans to set up the meeting by a hotel pool.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele posted a photo on X on Thursday, showing the US senator and Abrego Garcia sitting together. 

Abrego Garcia is ""sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!"" the post said. 

According to Van Hollen, Abrego Garcia is ""traumatized"" by having been at CECOT, the notorious mega-prison designed to hold El Salvador's most dangerous gang members. 

The Trump administration has refused to adhere to a Supreme Court order to return Abrego Garcia to the United States. 

Abrego Garcia told the senator that he had been moved from CECOT to a different prison with better conditions.

The number of Republicans who say Russia is an enemy of the United States has fallen significantly over the past year.

Republicans are also less likely to say the US has a responsibility to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia.

That's according to a newly released study by the Pew Research Center, a Washington-based think tank.

Only 40% of Republicans now see Russia as an enemy, a considerable fall from 58% in 2024. 



Many more Democrats, some 62%, say Russia is an enemy.

Overall, half of Americans now call Russia an enemy, down from 61% in 2024.

Republicans and Democrats also differ widely in their view of the NATO defense alliance. 

Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to rate NATO positively, with 77% having a favorable opinion of NATO. 

Only 45% of Republicans see NATO favorably. 

Though views on NATO have shifted little over the past year among both Republicans and Democrats, the study found.

Russia said on Friday that contacts with the United States were rather complicated over Ukraine peace talks. 

""Contacts are quite complicated, because, naturally, the topic is not an easy one,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

He said that Russia had made ""some progress,"" referring to a temporary truce agreed by Russia and Ukraine against strikes on energy infrastructure. But the truce has ended, Peskov added.

Russia's comment came after President Donald Trump said that the US would ""pass"" on helping bring an end to the war in Ukraine if no easy solution can be found.  

Trump insisted on Friday that both sides had to make progress. 

""Now, if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'You're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people' — and we're going to just take a pass,"" Trump said.

President Donald Trump said the United States will ""take a pass"" on trying for peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine if ""parties make it difficult.""

Meanwhile, Russia responded, saying that contacts with the United States were rather complicated over Ukraine peace talks. 

And the number of Republicans who see Russia as an enemy of the United States has fallen by nearly a third since last year.

            Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Friday detailed his recent meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador described being “traumatized” by his time at the country's notorious CECOT prison and has since been moved.
    


            “He said he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters at Dulles Airport near Washington, DC, after landing back in the US.
    


            The US senator said Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, told him he had been moved from the maximum-security prison to another detention center nine days ago.
    


            “He's no longer at CECOT,” Van Hollen said. “He's at a different prison which is pretty far outside of San Salvador.” The senator shared that the new facility is in Santa Ana where “conditions are better” but did not provide additional details.
    


            Van Hollen also claimed the Trump administration has committed to paying El Salvador $15 million to detain prisoners, including Abrego Garcia. He claimed that $4 million has been “paid out” so far.
    


            The senator traveled to the Central American nation earlier this week in a push for the man's release and met with him Thursday – after initially being denied access to the maximum-security prison. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and his case has been at the center of the fight over the Trump administration's hardline deportation push.
    


            Van Hollen said the case has broad significance for the due process rights of all Americans.
    


            “This case is not just about one man, it's about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States of America,” he said. “If you deny the constitutional rights of one man, you threaten the constitutional rights and due process for everyone else in America.”
    


            While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error.
    


            A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return from CECOT, and the Supreme Court largely endorsed that order.
    


            Top Trump officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported and argued in recent days that because Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national, he belongs in El Salvador. US officials have also alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute.
    


            “He's a citizen of El Salvador, he's in El Salvador, he's home,” Trump border czar Tom Homan told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Thursday on “The Source.” “He's an MS-13 member, which is now classified as a terrorist, so we removed the illegal alien MS-13 member who has a final order removal issued by an immigration judge to his homeland.”
    


            Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain that he does not have ties to MS-13.
    


            President Donald Trump's administration has seized on Van Hollen's visit in particular to swipe at Democrats critical of Abrego Garcia's incarceration in El Salvador.
    


            “Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. GRANDSTANDER!!!” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform Friday morning.
    


            The White House was also quick to compare an image of Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia with one of Trump meeting with Patty Morin, whose daughter was murdered by an undocumented El Salvadorian immigrant in 2023, in the Oval Office earlier this week.
    


            “We are not the same,” the White House account posted on X.
    


            The White House said on social media Friday that Abrego Garcia is not and will “never” return to the United States.
    


            Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele similarly said in a Thursday night post on X, “Now that [Abrego Garcia has] been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.”
    


            Van Hollen also addressed Bukele's Thursday X post that Abrego Garcia had been “sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!”
    


            Salvadoran government officials, the lawmaker said, had placed the glasses on the table and the two men did not take a sip.
    


            “When I first sat down with Kilmar, we just had glasses of water on the table and I think maybe some coffee. And as we were talking, one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table with ice and I don't know if it was salt or sugar around the top. But it looked like margaritas,” Van Hollen said.
    


            He continued: “If you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one … in front of me to try to make it look — I assume — like he drank out of it. Let me just be very clear: Neither of us touched the drinks.”
    


            This incident is “a lesson into the lengths President Bukele will do to deceive people about what's going on,” Van Hollen added.
    


            The senator, further describing the meeting, said Abrego Garcia said he missed his family and that his loved ones keep him going.
    


            “He said that thinking of you, members of his family, is what gave him the strength to persevere, to keep going day to day even under these awful circumstances,” Van Hollen said, adding that Abrego Garcia spoke “several times” about his five-year-old son who has autism and who was in the car when he was pulled over by immigration agents.
    


            Recalling his first phone call with Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer, following the meeting, Van Hollen said he conveyed to her that her husband told him “first and foremost, that he missed her and his family.”
    


            “And as he said that, you could see a tear come down,” the senator added.

            A second round of nuclear talks between the United States and Iran is underway, as what both sides are looking for in a deal begins to take shape.
    


            Delegations from both countries met in Oman last weekend for talks mediated by the Gulf Arab nation. This weekend's round is being held in Rome.
    


            President Donald Trump has threatened that the US will resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors.
    


            Since last weekend's talks, which both parties described as “constructive,” remarks from various members of the Trump administration have flip-flopped, oscillating between maximalist demands that Iran has said were “red lines” and a more conciliatory approach.
    


            Here's what we know.
    


            A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US. Under the deal, Iran had agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
    


            That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities and has so far advanced its program of uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade.
    


            Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful.
    


            Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations on a new nuclear deal, making it clear that Iran had a two-month deadline to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents told CNN.
    


            Days later, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the Islamic Republic rejected direct negotiations with the US. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington.
    


            Trump has said that the deal he seeks with Iran would not be similar to the 2015 agreement inked under the Obama administration.
    


            “It'll be different, and maybe a lot stronger,” he said.

Trump envoy stresses need for verification in Iran nuclear talks



            Comments from Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, have suggested differently as of late.
    


            Iran has in recent weeks been vocal with its concerns about striking a nuclear deal with Trump, who it says has a history of backtracking. The Islamic Republic has also voiced objections to any deal that fully dismantles its nuclear program, as opposed to only limiting its uranium enrichment to civilian-only use – as was stipulated under the 2015 agreement.
    


            Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal ensured through a number of mechanisms that Iran's nuclear program would be exclusively peaceful.
    


            But conflicting remarks from US officials before and after last Saturday's meeting have muddied Washington's demands.
    


            Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, said that moving forward, talks with Iran would be about verification of its nuclear program, but stopped short of mentioning a demand to fully dismantle Iran's nuclear program, as other US officials have said in the past. In other words, indicating a deal that would be similar to the Obama-brokered agreement.
    


            “The conversation with the Iranians will be much about two critical points,” Witkoff told Fox News on Monday. The first is verification of uranium enrichment, “and ultimately verification on weaponization, that includes missiles, type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb.”
    


            However, Witkoff later reversed his position in a statement on X in which he said any final deal with Iran would require it to “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.”

            Asked to explain Witkoff's apparent reversal, an administration official told CNN: “It's the most recent elaboration of policy.”
    


            Other officials have been hawkish on what the US expects from Iran. On Sunday, a day after Witkoff started talks with Iranian negotiators in Oman, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Tehran to fully dismantle its nuclear program.
    


            “Iran, come to the table, negotiate, full dismantlement of your nuclear capabilities,” he said on Fox News.
    


            Iranian officials have dismissed that proposal as a non-starter, accusing the US of using it as a pretext to weaken and ultimately topple the Islamic Republic. Tehran is entitled to a civilian nuclear energy program under a UN treaty.
    


            The UN nuclear watchdog has however warned that Iran has been accelerating its enrichment of uranium up to alarming levels.
    


            Iran this week doubled down on its right to enrich uranium and accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals.
    


            “Iran's enrichment (program) is a real and genuine matter, and we are ready to build trust regarding potential concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters on Wednesday, state-run Press TV reported.

US-Iran negotiators hold ‘constructive' nuclear talks, will meet again next week



            Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei weighed in early Thursday on X, likening the shifting US position to “a professional foul and an unfair act in football.”
    


            “In diplomacy any such shifting (pushed by hawks who fail to grasp the logic/art of commonsensical deal-making) could simply risk any overtures falling apart,” he wrote. “It could be perceived as lack of seriousness, let alone good faith. … We're still in testing mode.”
    


            Iranian media has reported that Tehran had set strict terms ahead of the talks with the US, saying that “red lines” include “threatening language” by the Trump administration and “excessive demands regarding Iran's nuclear program.” The US must also refrain from raising issues relating to Iran's defense industry, Iranian media said, likely referring to Iran's ballistic missile program, which the US' Middle Eastern allies see as a threat to their security.
    


            Meanwhile, Iran's highest leadership has approached the talks with extreme caution.
    


            In his first comments on the issue since the Iranian and American negotiators met in Oman, Khamenei said Tuesday that Tehran is “neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic” about talks with the United States over its nuclear program.
    


            Israel has been among the staunchest advocates for Iran to fully dismantle its nuclear weapon and never acquire a nuclear bomb.
    


            On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement defending his aggressive policy towards Iran, saying, “Israel will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons.”
    


            A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday that Witkoff spoke with Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs and Netanyahu's closest confidant, about the first round of US-Iran talks in Oman.
    


            Dermer was sitting beside Netanyahu in Washington last week when Trump suddenly announced the US-Iran talks would begin imminently. The surprise revelation of the start of negotiations appeared to startle Netanyahu, who has increasingly pushed for a military option against Iran.
    


            Sources familiar with the matter had previously told CNN that news of the US-Iran nuclear talks were “certainly not” to Israel's liking, and it remains unclear if Netanyahu was given advance notice of the negotiations or if he was consulted ahead of time, the sources said.

US intelligence agencies believe Israel is likely to strike Iranian nuclear facilities this year



            Sitting beside Trump at the Oval Office earlier this month, Netanyahu touted a Libya-style nuclear deal between the US and Iran, which in 2003 dismantled the North African nation's nuclear program in the hopes of ushering in a new era of relations with the US after its two-decade oil embargo on Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
    


            After relinquishing its nuclear program, Libya descended into civil war following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Gadhafi's regime and led to his killing. Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be rejected from the outset.
    


            Dermer and Mossad director David Barnea met Friday with Witkoff in Paris ahead of the second round of Iran talks.
    


            Earlier this year, US intelligence agencies warned both the Biden and Trump administrations that Israel would likely attempt to strike facilities key to Iran's nuclear program this year, according to sources familiar with the assessments.
    


            However, The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump had urged Israel not to strike Iran's nuclear sites as soon as next month in order to let talks with Iran play out, which could impact planned engagements for Trump's national security team in the coming days.
    


            The Israeli Prime Minister's Office did not deny the veracity of the article, instead asserting that Israel's actions have delayed Iran's nuclear program.
    


            Responding to the New York Times' report that he'd waved off Israeli strikes, Trump said on Thursday: “I wouldn't say waved off,” but “I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death.”
    


            “I hope they (Iran) want to talk, it's going to be very good for them if they do, and I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well.”

            The death toll from US airstrikes on an oil port in western Yemen has risen to at least 74 people, the Houthi-run health ministry reported, marking the deadliest day since the United States escalated its aerial campaign against the Iran-backed group last month.
    


            US Central Command said Thursday the strikes on Ras Isa fuel port in Hodeidah province were aimed at cutting off revenue to the Houthis, adding the port has been used as a source of illicit profits to the group.
    


            “The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen,” CENTCOM said in a statement. “This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”
    


            The fatalities included workers at the port and paramedics, the health ministry said on Friday, adding that some 171 people were wounded.
    


            CNN reached out to the Pentagon for comment regarding the reported toll and was directed to CENTCOM's earlier statement.
    


            Houthi rebels vowed on Friday to continue their military operations against Israel and US forces in the region.
    


            “Yemen will not back down from continuing its support operations for the Palestinian people until the Israeli aggression on Gaza stops and the siege is lifted,” the Houthi-controlled armed forces in Yemen said in a statement.
    


            The militant group said the US “aggression” against Yemen would “only lead to further targeting, engagement, and confrontation.”
    


            The Houthis shot down a US MQ-9 Reaper drone on Friday, the sixth since March 3, US officials told CNN. Each MQ-9 costs about $30 million, the officials added, and the US only has a few more than 200 of the sophisticated drones in its arsenal.
    


            Since mid-March, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites, with US President Donald Trump vowing to use “overwhelming force” until the US achieves its goal of stopping the Houthis from targeting shipping in the Red Sea.

            Houthis have launched numerous missiles against Israel and disrupted shipping in the Red Sea in attacks they say are in solidarity with Palestinians against Israel's war in Gaza since the October 7, 2023 attacks.
    


            Video aired on Al-Masirah shows the injured receiving treatment at a hospital after dawn, many with visible burns to their bodies.
    


            “Multiple air raids targeted the area,” a man who identified himself as a civil defense worker told Al-Masirah as he lay on an examination table, breathing heavily. “I found myself falling on the ground as a rocket hit.”
    


            Another survivor at the hospital described the moment the port was struck.
    


            “One strike after another, the whole area was lit on fire,” he told Al-Masirah. “When we managed to leave the area, we saw the place where we were hiding earlier getting struck too.”
    


            The US says its campaign is working. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said that multiple Houthi leaders had been killed.
    


            CNN earlier reported that the total cost of the US military's operation against Houthi militants in Yemen neared $1 billion in three weeks, according to three people briefed on the campaign, but the attacks had so far had limited impact on the group's capabilities.
    


            While as many as 80 Houthi military officers may have been killed, according to analysts, the senior echelon of its military and political leadership appears intact. So are at least some of its missile-launching sites.
    


            On Monday, the Houthi-run health ministry said US attacks had killed at least 123 people, including women and children, and injured 247 others since March 15, the Houthi-run Saba news agency reported. CNN cannot independently verify the numbers.
    


            Meanwhile, the Houthis have continued to launch more than a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships. While none caused major damage, the threat remains.
    


            Early Friday, Israel's military said it intercepted a missile from Yemen. No injuries were reported, Israel's emergency service said.

White House ‘border czar' Tom Homan discusses increased ICE efforts to arrest migrant criminals and President Donald Trump's deportation policies on ‘America Reports.'

A Guatemalan national residing in the U.S. illegally has been indicted for his alleged role in smuggling a 14-year-old girl into the country.

Juan Tiul Xi, 26, was indicted on Thursday for allegedly coaxing a 14-year-old girl into illegally entering the U.S., according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) statement. Tiul Xi is also accused of submitting a sponsorship application containing false statements to gain custody of the teen.

""The prior administration's border policies created an environment that enabled human trafficking and allowed bad actors to take advantage of at-risk children,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. ""We are committed to protecting children from the scourge of human trafficking and will not rest until we deliver justice for those who suffered during the border crisis.""

Tiul Xi allegedly entered the U.S. illegally under the Biden administration in 2023. The DOJ alleges that after entering the country illegally, Tiul Xi encouraged the teen to say she was his sister. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) then  reportedly relied on Tiul Xi's false statements to release the teenager into his custody on Sept. 5, 2023.

The DOJ says Tiul Xi is charged with one count of encouraging or inducing illegal entry for financial gain, one count of making a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement, and one count of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison for encouraging illegal entry, up to 5 years for the false statement, and 2 years for the identity theft charge, according to the DOJ.

""This case is a testament to ICE's commitment to hold predators accountable for the harm they inflict on children,"" said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons.

ORR Acting Director Angie M. Salazar said that the office has ""significantly increased"" its sponsor vetting process which now prioritizes ""the well-being of the child.""

""We hope that our commitment is evident by our collaboration with law enforcement to right previous wrongs and help bring these crimes to light,"" Salazar said in a DOJ press release on Tiul Xi's indictment.

The case is part of the DOJ's Operation Take Back America, which the DOJ says aims to combat ""the ongoing threats and risks that the American people elected President Trump to address.""

Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about the recent excavation of 18th-century British redoubts in the Sunshine State.

Archaeologists in the oldest city in the United States recently excavated part of an historic district — unearthing remnants of its short-lived British past.

Fox News Digital spoke with Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, about the excavation. The project took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood and wrapped up in February. (See the video at the top of this article.) 

Archaeologists were digging at the site as they made way for construction and discovered the dried-up moat of a British redoubt, or small outpost.

TRAVELERS HEAD TO ‘MOST WELCOMING CITIES' IN AMERICA: SEE IF YOURS MADE THE LIST

""We knew there were a series of British redoubts,"" White said. 

""In St. Augustine, everyone thinks about the Spanish period, but we actually had a 20-year period where the British were in control of both East and West Florida.""

The British inhabitants of St. Augustine built the redoubt in 1781, due to fears of attacks by the Spanish. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)

St. Augustine was primarily a Spanish military town in the first 200 years of its history, beginning in 1565. 

Florida came under British control when Spain traded it for Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British.

In 1763, through the Treaty of Paris, the British gained control of Florida and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) ended. But the British inhabitants of St. Augustine still worried about attacks by the Spanish — hence the fortifications, according to numerous historical accounts.

At the end of the American Revolution, the Spanish crown was given back control of Florida in exchange for some of their assistance to the British. The Sunshine State didn't become U.S. territory until 1821.

""The Spanish actually attacked both [the port of] Mobile and Pensacola,"" White said. ""So there was a great fear that there could be an attack on St. Augustine.""

The redoubt contained a dry moat with organic material, including seeds, that will undergo additional testing. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)

""A series of these small redoubts were constructed sort of surrounding the historic town with plans to actually connect them by a series of walls and defensive moats,"" White added. 

""But that kind of never came to fruition because the American Revolution ended, and so did the threat to the British at the time.""

One of the most surprising parts of the excavation, first reported by The Associated Press, was not what the archaeologists found, but what they didn't find.

""We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.""

White told Fox News Digital the artifacts they uncovered were few and far between.

""In [an] urban context, we're used to finding tons of artifacts because people have lived here for over 4,000 years, but in this case, it was really the lack of artifacts that surprised us,"" the historian said.

""So we might've found a few pieces of pottery, a couple of pieces of [shotgun pellets], little pieces of lead that would've been used to fire out of a gun,"" she said.

But while many people may think archaeology is just about digging up artifacts, White encouraged a broader perspective about the field.

The excavation took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood. St. Augustine was established by the Spanish in 1565. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP)

""Everyone associates archaeology with finding things, and it's really the information that we're after as archaeologists,"" White said. 

She added, ""[It's] not what you find, but what you'd find out.""

One of the most interesting takeaways was the amount of seeds in the moat, which had survived thanks to the environmental conditions.

""They were really well-preserved because it's kind of in the water table at this point in time. The water table has risen over the last few centuries,"" she noted.

""So we've just started working with an ethnobotanist … and she's been starting to help us study these plant remains, these seeds. We're hoping to learn a lot more.""

White also said the redoubts were some of the only British-constructed fortifications in the city. When they took control of the territory, the British inhabitants usually reused Spanish infrastructure instead of building their own.

""Everything else was either already here and the Spanish built it, and the British might've modified it a little — but this was something that was uniquely British,"" she said. ""We know there's at least six additional [redoubts] out there.""

White added that she hopes the group finds ""evidence … now that we sort of know what to look for, especially since there's not a lot of artifacts associated with them.""

St. Augustine's city archeology program conducts over 60 projects a year, with archaeologists constantly learning more about the city's past.

At a time when many fascinating excavations are taking place across the world, from Europe to the Middle East, White emphasized the amount the U.S. has to offer in terms of archaeology. 

""I think sometimes we're surprised: 'Wait, there's archaeology in America, in our own backyard?'"" she said. ""Yes, there is archaeology everywhere.""

""It may not be as old as some people want to think, but there's stuff everywhere. [Archaeology is] always fascinating … and it's a great way to learn about ourselves today, too.""

Child psychologist Dr. Judith Joseph explains the disruptive behavior and what parents can do to help prevent it.

""A Minecraft Movie,"" the big-screen adaptation of the popular video game ""Minecraft,"" has been packing theaters with rowdy kids and teens since its release this month, spurring a social media phenomenon and sparking concern for America's youth. 

Videos on social media show young theatergoers huge reactions to one key scene, where one of the film's stars, Jack Black, yells out the phrase ""Chicken Jockey!"" as a small, Frankenstein-looking creature lands on top of a chicken in a boxing ring to face off with co-star Jason Momoa.

The scene has prompted excited fans to scream, shout, throw popcorn around, jump up out of their seats, and in one instance in Provo, Utah, toss a live chicken in the air during a screening, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

Springs Cinema & Taphouse in Sandy Springs, Georgia, told FOX 5 Atlanta that its staff has had to clean up popcorn, ICEEs, ketchup and shattered glass.

""The movie-going experience has changed a lot since I was younger,"" Josh Gunderson, director of marketing and events at Oviedo Mall in Florida, told FOX Business. ""And TikTok has changed that quite a bit.""

""There's a part of me that says this is just dumb fun. There's another part of me [that says] for the poor people who are there at the movie theaters having to clean up this mess, it's a disaster,"" Raymond Arroyo, Fox News' contributor and host of the ""Arroyo Grande"" podcast, told Fox News Digital. 

""And obviously, you know a safety hazard, because … anytime you get 200 young boys in a room, and they're all yelling and jumping in 20 directions, it's sort of like, you know, a social media ‘Lord of the Flies,' that's what this is. And I get why they're calling in the cops. I get why some theater chains are saying you can only come with a parent because you can't have that kind of mayhem every day and at every showing.""

Arroyo added, ""I think, if anything, it shows the deep passion and the connection that these boys feel to this video game, and therefore they've carried over to the movie. And that's part of the reason it's such a big hit.""

""…anytime you get 200 young boys in a room, and they're all yelling and jumping in 20 directions, it's sort of like, you know, a social media ‘Lord of the Flies.'""

WATCH: KIDS CAUSE CHAOS DURING 'MINECRAFT' MOVIE VIEWINGS

""A Minecraft Movie"" has earned $557 million worldwide so far, led by the established fandom of the games and the social media buzz created by filming videos related to ""Chicken jockey"" and other meme-able moments related to the game. 

The movie's director, Jared Hess, spoke with Entertainment Weekly about the chaotic screenings.

""It's been way too fun. People are sending me these really hilarious speeches that a lot of teenagers are giving right before the movie. It's so hysterical, man. I'm staying up way too late,"" he said.

Some screenings have had police called to break up the antics, which Hess thinks is a little much.

""It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called,"" Hess told the outlet. ""It's funny because I think it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. Yeah, it's hilarious. I've seen so many funny videos. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments. It's like this crazy anticipation. But, man, I'm just glad people are making memories with their friends and families.""

Arroyo is ""all for engagement,"" comparing the theater experience to that of midnight screenings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" or sing-alongs to ""Grease.""

""Singing along or clapping in unison or doing silly things at a certain point in a movie everybody knows and loves … throwing popcorn, throwing live chickens, throwing the guy next to you up into the air, I'm not sure that's the best way forward. 

""If there can be a more contained audience participation, I think everybody would be on board. But the moment you are [causing] a mess and injuring people, that turns into something very different, and I get why they don't want to tolerate that. It shouldn't be tolerated.""

ELVIRA CRITICIZES ARIANA GRANDE FOR DIVA BEHAVIOR AT ONE OF HER SHOWS

Arroyo also sees it as an opportunity to instill some life lessons in young boys.

""Boys need an element of freedom, and they need to be a little wild. That's a good thing,"" he said. ""On the other hand, they need to know how and when to rein that in and to discipline themselves, and I worry that when you let this kind of mayhem just go on and say, ‘Oh let them throw the popcorn, we love it,' like the director said, that may be good for the ticket sales, it's bad for society. Boys need to learn how to control themselves in public settings. The world is not your rec room.""

""I worry that when you let this kind of mayhem just go on and say, ‘Oh let them throw the popcorn, we love it' …that may be good for the ticket sales, it's bad for society. Boys need to learn how to control themselves in public settings.""

Jack Black recently attempted to dissuade audiences from bad behavior by popping up at a screening in Los Angeles to deliver a warning.

""For today's presentation of ‘A Minecraft Movie,' please no throwing popped corn, and also no lapis lazuli… and absolutely no chicken jockeys!"" he said in a video shared on social media.

JACK BLACK FELT 'WHOLE FOR THE FIRST TIME' AFTER TRYING PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS AT 13

""I love the Jack Black public service announcement,"" Arroyo said. ""I think he's worried, too, about their welfare. These are young kids for the most part. And you can see how excited they are because it's a big part of their lives."" 

Arroyo further explained why the ""Minecraft"" mania has been sweeping the nation.

""I think a way to put this in context, so everybody doesn't freak out, what the Barbie movie was for girls and women, this movie is for young boys and teens. It strikes a deep chord, it's something that's part of their growth and childhood and everyday life. It's also how they communicate. A lot of [kids], they put their headsets on, and they're talking while they're playing ‘Minecraft.' So it is a… touchstone for them.""

He continued, ""It's an exciting moment. It's like Hollywood validating their lived experience, so that's why you're seeing this level of excitement, I think. And it's a callback that they feel is only theirs, it's their own little personal thing. So it becomes kind of a communal ritual almost for them. That's what this is. This is a communal ritual of young guys saying, look, we all play this, we get the reference even though these idiot parents and everybody else don't. 

According to Arroyo, part of the excitement from young audiences for the ""Minecraft"" movies is seeing ""Hollywood validating their lived experience."" (AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)

""But there is a level where you have to say, ‘Guys, you've crossed a line here.' You need an adult in the room,"" Arroyo added.

National theater chain Regal Cinemas is trying to manage some of the excitement by offering ""Chicken Jockey"" screenings on April 20.

""Customers are invited to dress up as their favorite ‘Minecraft' characters, whoop, yelp, clap and shout ‘Chicken Jockey!' There are some rules we don't break. So here's the deal: build excitement? Absolutely. LOL with friends till you're rolling in the aisles? Totally. But please don't go full Creeper in the auditorium,"" their website states.

Representatives for Warner Bros. Pictures and Cinema United (formerly the National Association of Theater Owners) did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Arroyo noted that the hype for the ""Minecraft"" movie appears to be part of a cultural shift in taste from the superhero domination of the Marvel movies to an upswing in video game-based stories.

""This is the prevailing culture among young people, particularly for boys. ‘Mario Bros' was a big hit. You saw ‘The Last of Us' on HBO, ‘Fallout' [on Amazon Prime]. These are all video games that have spawned spin-offs. Some of them good, some of them not so good. But there's this built-in IP and what novels and stories and Broadway provided in years past to Hollywood, now video games are furnishing with IP and storylines that are already well-known enough that it diminishes your risk when you bring it to the big screen.""

He added, ""That is dying out, and we just imagine kids remain excited about that. I don't think they do. It doesn't hold the same fascination it held for us.""

April 19, 1995, started off as a beautiful spring day for Amy Downs, a teller at a credit union inside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.

""I remember the red buds were blooming,"" Downs recalled to Fox News Digital. ""I was so excited. I was getting ready to close my very first house. I don't think I did any work in that first hour of the day. I was running around talking to all my friends about the house. 

""And then I was looking at my watch, thinking, ‘Oh gosh, it's almost nine o'clock. I'm going to get in trouble. I had better get back to my desk.'""

Downs flew past her boss. A co-worker who was six months pregnant sat beside her. Downs asked if she needed anything.

""I don't know if the words even came out of my mouth or not, because that's when the bomb went off and everything went black,"" Downs said.

It was 30 years ago when a truck bomb detonated outside a federal building in America's heartland, killing 168 people in the deadliest homegrown attack on U.S. soil. Downs and other survivors and witnesses are speaking out in a new National Geographic docuseries, ""Oklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America.""

""I think it's so important to remember what happened and the lessons that were learned,"" Downs said of why she chose to come forward.

Downs was 28 years old when she found herself trapped upside down in her office chair. She had fallen three floors down and was buried under 10 feet of rubble. Whenever she gasped for air, it burned down to her chest. Her body was pierced with glass.

""I remember hearing roaring and screaming, and this powerful rushing sensation, like I was falling,"" said Downs. ""I found out I had fallen. … I couldn't move. I couldn't see. It was very hard to breathe. I had no idea what had happened. I just knew it was bad.""

Downs screamed for help, but no one replied. In the darkness, she heard silence. Suddenly, after what felt like an eternity, there was a sudden commotion of firefighters. One said, ""Let's split up. Let's look for the daycare babies.""

""I was confused,"" said Downs. ""I thought, ‘Why are they looking for the daycare babies here? The daycare is on the second floor, and we're on the third floor.' I had no idea that we were at the bottom of what was once this nine-story building.""

Fire Chief Mike Shannon heard Down's cries for help. Just as he was about to go get her, his crew learned there was a possibility of another bomb that was about to go off. It forced them to immediately evacuate, leaving Downs behind.

Shannon was determined to stay with Downs, but fellow firefighters refused to leave him behind. In the documentary, Shannon described how he heard the echoes of Downs sobbing, begging him to save her, as he was being rushed out.

At that moment, Downs believed her life was coming to an end.

""I now knew it had been a bomb, and it looked like there was another one,"" she said. ""I was getting ready to die. I prayed, or maybe you could call it bargained with God. I kept promising God anything, just to be able to live. I prayed for a second chance. My reality was that I was 28 years old and getting ready to die, and I've never really lived. I had a lot of regrets about how I had not been living.""

In between tears, she began to recite portions of Psalm 23 to comfort herself.

""The only thing I could remember was, ‘I walked through the valley of the shadow of death,'"" said Downs. ""I couldn't remember what came next. I thought that was awful. And then, of all the weird things to do, a song popped into my head that we used to sing growing up in church. I started singing this song, and I felt peace. This was the first time that I thought I was at peace with what was getting ready to happen.""

There was no second bomb. Once the firefighters realized this, they rushed back in. Shannon remembered to look for Downs. When Downs heard the sounds of men again, she promised in the darkness to bake them, anyone, chocolate chip cookies if they could save her.

Six and a half hours later, she was free.

""I was in the hospital for about eight days,"" she said. ""The biggest injury was my leg, which had been split open. My bone was intact, but the leg was open. But the hardest part was finding out that 18 of my 33 co-workers were killed. … Grief is something that I couldn't comprehend. Dealing with the grief and trauma was the hard part. The injuries were nothing.""

""We have our differences, and differences are not a bad thing,"" she said. ""But I think it's cool when we know when to put aside those differences and come together for good.""

Downs was still in the ICU when she saw a group of nurses glued to a television screen. It was revealed that the bombing was orchestrated by two former U.S. Army buddies, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.

""When I found out that it was an American, not only that, but somebody who also served in our military … I struggled with that,"" she said. ""I could not wrap my brain around that. My father is from the Greatest Generation. He lied about his age when he was 17 years old to fight World War II. It just didn't add up. How could you be an American? How could you serve our country? How could you do this?""

According to the documentary, Downs later faced McVeigh in court.

""It was very disturbing,"" she said, shuddering. ""He almost seemed proud of it.""

McVeigh was executed by lethal injection in 2001. He was 33. Nichols, now 70, is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Downs was ready to embrace her second chance at life. She went from a 355-pound ""couch potato"" to losing 200 pounds and completing a full ironman triathlon. She went on to work for the same credit union, now called Allegiance Credit Union, where she served as president and CEO.

""I'd flunked out of college because I couldn't pass a math class,"" she said. ""But I was very fortunate to have bosses who mentored me and believed in me. … I had promised God that I would never live my life the same if I survived, and I meant that. … I went back to college, got my degree, did all the things. … And just this week, I retired. So, I decided to launch a new chapter.""

Today, Downs is a full-time speaker. She also created a new bucket list. She and her sister are planning to walk about 160 miles of Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage known as ""The Way of St. James."" She's also eager to ride her bicycle across the United States.

""I'm still trying to figure out what I want to be when I grow up,"" the 58-year-old chuckled.

""It showcases the strength of the human spirit and the courage of these men who rushed in to help,"" she said. ""And the way we came together. The thing is, we are all going to face times in our lives when we're buried under the rubble, where devastation comes to us. … We will face difficult times.

""I think the lesson from this is that, as people, we can come together. And when you come together during times of difficulty, you are stronger than you realize. And together, you will get through it.""

AI applications extend far beyond sorting lines. For instance, WestRock is leveraging AI to design sustainable packaging that replaces plastics with fiber-based alternatives. Their innovations include creating packaging resistant to water and grease while maintaining recyclability, helping brands transition to more eco-friendly solutions. Municipalities are also adopting AI-driven recycling systems, such as Tasmania's $24 million materials recovery site, which processes recyclables from thousands of households using advanced AI sorting systems.

In metals recycling, AI is being used to predict market trends by analyzing large volumes of data on prices, supply, demand and trade patterns. This allows recyclers to optimize inventory management and production based on anticipated demand for specific metals. Together, these efforts illustrate how artificial intelligence is reshaping waste management globally, making recycling more efficient, sustainable and impactful.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Supreme Court sets stage for possible crackdown on nationwide injunctions","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3385092/supreme-court-sets-stage-nationwide-injunctions/","Sat, 19 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The Supreme Court is preparing to wade into one of the most significant aspects of the legal battles raging during the second Trump administration, one that could redefine how far federal judges can go in blocking certain presidential actions.

At issue is a growing use of nationwide injunctions in federal courts across the country. These court orders halt federal policies across all 50 states. National injunctions have hindered President Donald Trump from moving forward with his executive order to curtail birthright citizenship, and the Supreme Court will soon examine those decisions by lower courts.

On Thursday, the justices agreed to hear expedited arguments on May 15 in Trump's appeal of three lower court rulings that blocked his order. While Trump ultimately seeks to uphold his birthright citizenship order, the major question before the justices centers on whether lower court holds against his plan can be narrowed to apply only to the plaintiff beneficiaries, rather than the current “universal” or national block on the policy.

“This Court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the emergency filing. She urged the justices to limit the rulings to the individual plaintiffs and jurisdictions involved, which would allow the administration to proceed with its efforts in other jurisdictions.

The trio of cases, consolidated together for one hour of oral arguments in the middle of May, offers the justices a direct opportunity to address growing concerns over judicial overreach.

It also places Trump's immigration crackdown squarely before a court that has been historically reluctant to limit its own power but now faces pressure from both sides of the political aisle.

Trump's executive order, issued just hours after his inauguration, targets automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The order asserts that such children are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, and therefore do not qualify as citizens under the 14th Amendment.

The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” For more than a century, courts have interpreted this clause to mean that virtually anyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen, regardless of parental immigration status.

Civil rights groups and Democratic-led states immediately challenged the order, pointing to Supreme Court precedent, including the 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. That case confirmed birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents, establishing a principle that has remained largely untouched for more than 125 years.

Thomas Wolf, director of democracy initiatives at the liberal Brennan Center for Justice, called the order a direct violation of the Constitution. “If you're born here, you're one of us,” he wrote for the Brennan Center for Justice in January. “It doesn't matter who your parents were.” 

Wolf warned that Trump's order contradicts both the plain language of the 14th Amendment and the long-established legal consensus surrounding it.

Some conservative legal scholars disagree. Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation argues that the amendment has been misinterpreted. He argued in a 2018 article that undocumented immigrants do not fall fully under U.S. jurisdiction because they owe allegiance to another country. In his view, their children are not constitutionally entitled to citizenship.

Four separate district courts and three federal appeals courts have kept the Trump policy on hold during litigation, finding it very likely unconstitutional. One court called the order “blatantly unconstitutional.” 

The more direct legal conflict the justices are undertaking centers on whether a single district judge can block a federal policy for the entire country. The Trump administration argues that universal injunctions go far beyond the role courts are meant to play, which is to resolve disputes between actual parties.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, wrote in a 2020 concurring opinion that such injunctions allow plaintiffs to “shop” for favorable judges and force the government to win unanimous support across every circuit just to enforce its laws. “A single successful challenge can stop a policy cold,” he wrote.

That viewpoint is gaining traction as the judiciary faces increasing scrutiny over its role in national policymaking. 

The Supreme Court has never clearly defined the limits of nationwide injunctions, but both Republican and Democratic administrations have raised concerns about abuse of the tactic for years, and the complaints from conservatives have been rising as courts have levied 17 national injunctions against Trump's policies since his January inauguration.

“This is extraordinarily unusual,” Spakovsky said in a recent Heritage Foundation podcast. “In the entire history of the U.S. there has only been … a little over 180 nationwide injunctions ever issued … and a vast majority of the ones recently have been against Donald Trump.”

It is important to underscore that the scope of this eventual ruling, even if the high court grants Trump something close to his desired outcome, would likely not preclude all national injunctions going forward. That is because the presidential action at hand is not reviewable under the Administrative Procedures Act, the law that allows courts to review specific agency decisions.

“The inapplicability of the APA makes these cases particularly good vehicles for considering whether universal relief comports with Article III and traditional principles of equity,” the government wrote in a footnote of its application to the high court.

Still, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to limit national injunctions in other non-APA cases, making the grant for oral arguments important nonetheless.

Another dispute, Garland v. Texas Top Cop Shop, has drawn attention as a possible future vehicle for resolving the injunction issue.

That case involves the Corporate Transparency Act, a bipartisan anti-money laundering law passed in 2021. A federal judge in Texas struck down the law and barred the government from enforcing it against anyone, not just the plaintiffs in the case.

On Jan. 23, the Supreme Court temporarily lifted the injunction while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit continues to handle the case.

While the justices declined to take up the case for a merits argument for now, Gorsuch issued a comment in the order that the justices should address the use of nationwide injunctions “definitively.”

“I would, however, go a step further and, as the government suggests, take this case now to resolve definitively the question whether a district court may issue universal injunctive relief,” Gorsuch wrote.

Notably, the appeal in question arose from the former Biden administration's problems with the lower court injunction, underscoring the nature of bipartisan distaste for national injunctions.

Legal experts are divided over whether the birthright citizenship case is the best opportunity for the high court to act.

Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, questioned whether the justices would want to address the injunction issue in a case where every lower court has already ruled against Trump's position.

“This doesn't strike me as the best vehicle, I can't say that the Supreme Court is going to agree with me on that, right? I don't feel confident in predicting that,” Entin said.

The professor also noted that there are ways in which the justices could signal another future opportunity for them to address the scope of nationwide injunctions in a case where the law is more cut-and-dry, such as the issue with the Top Cop Shop case that rose to the justices' chambers earlier this year.

The Supreme Court's ruling is expected this summer. At a minimum, it could clarify how far district courts can go in blocking certain presidential actions.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR TRUMP BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP CASE

It's also not likely that this will be the last time the effort to curtail birthright citizenship will be weighed by the high court, given the fact that lower courts are still toiling over the thorny 14th Amendment questions as various lawsuits proceed in lower court.

But in the short term, the decision, expected by summer, could set the ground rules for how courtrooms handle many of Trump's executive decisions for the next four years.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former Rep. Barbara Lee, a progressive politician with more than 30 years of service under her belt, is projected to win Oakland, California's special mayoral election. 

Lee and her more centrist challenger, Loren Taylor, were the top two challengers in a crowded field of nine jockeying to lead the struggling Bay Area city. Lee will finish the two years left on former Mayor Sheng Thao's term. 

Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system, where voters rank candidates from most to least preferred. In multiple rounds of tallying, the candidate who receives the fewest votes is eliminated, and their supporters' votes are carried over to their next preferred pick until there is a winner. Taylor initially led Lee in the early stages of the voting after Tuesday's election, but as candidates were eliminated, Lee took the lead on Friday evening by about 5,000 votes and was declared the winner by multiple outlets, including the San Francisco Chronicle.

Lee herself has not claimed victory as of this writing with the new results, but posted, “Oakland! This evening's results are encouraging. I decided to run for Mayor knowing that Oakland is a deeply divided City–and I ran to unite our community. We worked hard every day to earn every vote!”

Sixty percent of Oaklanders voted to oust Thao last November. She has since been federally indicted on bribery, corruption, and fraud charges. She was the nation's first mayor of a major city to be voted out of office midterm in over a decade. Lee was against the recall and pledged to unite the city, while Taylor took a more tear-down approach. 

A win for Taylor would have signaled a pushback against progressive leadership in California. The former Oakland City Council member has called himself a “pragmatic progressive” in the past but has leaned more toward the center on issues.

Political insiders saw Lee as the front-runner in the contest, but in the race's final weeks, Taylor narrowed the gap, making inroads with voters frustrated by the status quo. 

Lee released a video the week before the election outlining a voting strategy for her supporters. In it, she told viewers to rank her in the top slot, followed by candidates Renia Webb, Suz Robinson, Swaney, and Cristina Grappo in the second through fifth-place spots on their ballots. Taylor, who narrowly lost to Thao in 2022 under the ranked choice voting system, did not. 

Taylor spent several months outraising Lee, tapping into voter frustration, and pitching his vision of a new Oakland. 

“It's not about whether or not we appreciate her service in Congress,” Taylor said about Lee. “It's about what we need right now to fix Oakland's problems — and particularly with the urgency that Oaklanders need.”

Taylor tried repeatedly to tie Lee to Thao while Lee attempted to link Taylor to President Donald Trump.

Lee, 78, came out of retirement to run for mayor after an open letter by a group of self-described “business, labor, community, government, and faith leaders who rarely agree on things” said “extraordinary times” brought them together and implored her to get in the race and keep the city from turning to shambles. 

Oakland's new mayor will have to hit the ground running.  

The city that has yet to bounce back from the pandemic, is plagued with serious public safety problems, has seen city services slashed due a budget deficit and years of fiscal mismanagement. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The startup carrier, which will begin flying later this year, reveals designs intended to rival the titans of sky-high luxury.

The center seats in Riyadh Air's business class cabin.

As motorsport enthusiasts and high-net-worth individuals flocked to Saudi Arabia for the F1 weekend, Riyadh Air used the event as a backdrop for a big unveiling. On April 19 at the Jeddah Yacht Club it showed off the seats that will soon fill the front of its planes: a plush business class designed to lure luxury-leaning travelers away from Emirates and Qatar Airways, the industry's heavy-hitters.

The startup carrier, which is set to begin flying near the end of this year, offered a first glimpse of the designs for the five-star service it plans to deliver. The cabin includes privacy panels, lie-flat seats, mood lighting, large screens and high-speed Wi-Fi, all cloaked in a color palette of deep purples, gold and stone. The interiors are inspired by the twisting canopies of traditional Arabian tents, with colors and materials that reflect Saudi heritage.

Iran and the United States held a second round of negotiations Saturday over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome, U.S. and Iranian officials said.

The U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations at the Omani Embassy in Rome's Camilluccia neighborhood. Iranian state media also reported the talks starting just before noon Saturday as journalists watched outside.

The talks in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks.

The negotiations will again be mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi.

That talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.

At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and after U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens more.

""I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,"" Trump said Friday. ""I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.""

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei told Iranian state TV the talks were ""indirect"" with the delegations in ""different halls"" at the embassy. He earlier wrote Saturday on X that Iran ""always demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues.""

""We are aware that it is not a smooth path, but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences,"" Baghaei added.

Araghchi met Saturday morning with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani ahead of the talks with Witkoff.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, also met Tajani on Saturday. Grossi's agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers.

Tajani said Italy was ready ""to facilitate the continuation of the talks even for sessions at the technical level.""

A diplomat deal ""is built patiently, day after day, with dialogue and mutual respect,"" he said in a statement.

Both men have been traveling in recent days. Witkoff had been in Paris for talks about Ukraine as Russia's full-scale war there grinds on. Araghchi will be coming from Tehran, Iran, after a visit to Moscow, where he met with officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Russia, one of the world powers involved in Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran's uranium enriched to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.

Oman's capital, Muscat, hosted the first round of negotiations between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an interlocutor between Iran and the West.

Ahead of the talks, however, Iran seized on comments by Witkoff first suggesting Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on X before the talks that Iran would not accept giving up its enrichment program like Libya, or agreeing to using uranium enriched abroad for its nuclear program.

""Iran has come for a balanced agreement, not a surrender,"" he wrote.

Iran's internal politics are still inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past

Iran's rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar earlier this month. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue.

Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China's Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran.

The aircraft had Rolls-Royce engines, which included significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

Under the 2015 deal, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined up tens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co. However, the manufacturers backed away from the deals over Trump's threats to the nuclear accord.

Bitcoin and crypto prices, after swinging wildly along with stocks, are braced for an epic showdown between U.S. president Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell.

The bitcoin price has held up better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq as tariff turmoil rocks crypto and equity markets, with billionaire Ray Dalio warning of “monetary order breakdown” that could spell something worse than 2008.

Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprising bitcoin price prediction, the chief executive of the world's largest crypto exchange has said Binance is advising countries on following the U.S. in adopting bitcoin as a strategy reserve asset.

""We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,"" Richard Teng, who took over the top job at Binance after founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao was ousted when he and the company plead guilty to failing to prevent money laundering in 2023, told the Financial Times without naming the countries.

Binance has also ""been approached by quite a lot"" of countries to ""[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto,"" Teng added.

Trump has made passing long-awaited crypto legislation a priority for his second administration, as well as signing an executive order that calls for the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile.

“Compared to many other jurisdictions, [the U.S. is] way ahead on that front,” Teng said, adding it's spurred countries into action.

In March, Standard Chartered Bank's head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick predicted the bitcoin price could surge to $500,000 per bitcoin within three years due to the creation of a U.S. bitcoin and crypto reserve.

Earlier this month, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan revealed CZ, who still holds a majority stake in Binance, had begun advising them on developing crypto regulations and adoption of bitcoin and crypto.

“It makes sense that countries would reach out to industry players to ensure they have informed views on policy,” Anthony Pompliano, the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, said in an emailed note.

“This is the game theory that bitcoiners have been talking about for decades. Once one large nation starts to acquire bitcoin, all countries are incentivized to compete to acquire bitcoin … it is not possible to ignore the United States of America—the greatest economy ever constructed in human history. If America says bitcoin is strategically important, then other countries will start seeing the asset that way as well.""

This month, Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential council of advisers for digital assets, said the U.S. is exploring many ways to increase its bitcoin reserve without using additional taxpayer dollars, including through tariff revenue and revaluing the government's gold certificates.

“We're looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there's literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said in an interview with Pompliano.

“Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it's not happening in a silo,"" David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher BTC Inc, which also organizes the bitcoin conference at which Trump first proposed the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, said in a statement teasing the upcoming Las Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference.

""President Trump's establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many steps he's taken to promote American innovation,"" Bailey said.
 In January, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he's had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin.

          Critics on the right and left say the bitcoin reserve is a pointless industry handout — and using tariff revenue is even dumber.        

If Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs send household good prices soaring and drive the economy into recession, at least one industry could profit.

The Trump administration is considering using tariff revenues to buy Bitcoin for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a top administration crypto official said in an interview last week.

The White House's proposal is driving interest from crypto industry figures who have made building the reserve one of their top priorities.

It is uniting critics on the right and left, however, who have cast the reserve as a pointless industry giveaway that will come at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. Using tariff money would add insult to injury, they say.

“There is nothing here but a conjunction of bad ideas,” said George Selgin, an economist and professor emeritus at the University of Georgia. “The tariffs are a bad idea, the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is a bad idea, and using the tariff revenue for the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is a bad idea.”

Ever since Trump proposed across-the-board tariffs on the campaign trail last year, he has touted the idea as a way to both build domestic industry and raise revenue.

Trump has suggested that tariff revenue could replace the nearly $5 trillion the government hauls in income tax revenue per year, while a top trade official in his administration estimated they could raise $6 to $7 trillion over a decade.

Both numbers are fantasies, according to economists of all political stripes. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said the massive tariffs — if they all go into effect as initially proposed on “Liberation Day” — could raise about $3.3 trillion over that period, assuming they don't send the economy into a tailspin.

The relatively meager scale of the tariffs' revenues has not stopped the Trump administration from cooking up ideas for how to spend them on everything from tax cuts for the rich to deficit reduction.

Last week, Bo Hines, the executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, added another proposal to the mix. In an interview with investor and crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano, Hines said the administration could use tariff revenue to buy bitcoin.

“We are looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, whether it be from something else,” Hines said. “Everything is on the table, and like we have said, we want as much as we can get.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

When Trump announced that he wanted to create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin at a crypto conference last July, it cemented his place as the industry's favored presidential candidate.

Supporters have cast bitcoin as a modern-day gold with near-limitless future growth potential. Socking it away could protect against depreciation of the U.S. dollar and inflation, they say.

Trump followed through on his promise almost as soon as he was in office by creating the reserve — but he disappointed some bitcoin boosters by stocking it only with tokens that had already been seized by the government. Still, Trump promised that he would search for “budget-neutral” ways to buy more bitcoins.

Tariffs could be one way of building the store, according to Hines. But they would hardly be budget-neutral, Selgin said, since they are essentially a tax on the consumers buying imported goods.

The tariffs would have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, which calculated they would cost an average household $3,800 per year.

Regardless of how they pay for it, critics say that it's inappropriate for the government to buy up an asset like bitcoin with no inherent use that is subject to wild price swings — and, in fact, has dropped in price since Trump's tariff announcement. If the government does wind up buying bitcoin, critics have warned, selling any substantial portion of it could depress the digital asset's price.

“You have a lot of people in the bitcoin community, bitcoin bulls who would like to see the government do a lot more, because it will benefit them,” said Selgin, who also serves as a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. “These people are trying by hook or by crook to rationalize something that really is just a subsidy for them, without any benefits for other people.

Prominent macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin is on track to finish 2025 above its current price of around $85,000.

“Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,” Alden with Natalie Brunell on Coin Stories.

While she still expects Bitcoin to post gains by year-end, Alden noted that the tariffs introduced in February have tempered her earlier bullish outlook.Lyn Alden Says Liquidity Surge Could Propel Bitcoin to Higher Targets

Alden explained that a major liquidity boost could push Bitcoin toward more ambitious targets.

Such a scenario might occur if the U.S. bond market faces a crisis, prompting the Federal Reserve to respond with quantitative easing or yield curve control.

Despite current macro headwinds, Alden believes there is still a “good chance” Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 mark in 2025.

However, she warned that global market volatility remains a key obstacle, especially because Bitcoin trades continuously — unlike traditional equity markets with limited trading hours.

“Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said, pointing out that Bitcoin often reacts first to market jitters due to its round-the-clock nature.

While its correlation to tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 has been noted, Alden believes Bitcoin can sometimes diverge, particularly when broader market conditions weigh on U.S. equities without directly impacting global liquidity.

She drew comparisons to the period between 2003 and 2007, when a weak U.S. dollar cycle fueled capital flows into commodities, emerging markets, and gold — bypassing U.S. stocks.

A similar environment could prove favorable for Bitcoin, Alden suggested.

“If we encounter a five-year period like that again, that could be a period where Bitcoin does pretty well, even as the U.S. stock market doesn't do particularly well,” she added.

In a recent market note, Thielen warned that short-term technical signals are painting a more cautious picture, even as many analysts forecast new all-time highs by mid-year.

Thielen pointed to the Bitcoin stochastic oscillator, a technical indicator that measures momentum, suggesting the market is displaying traits more consistent with a late-cycle top than the beginning of a new bull run.

While Thielen urges caution, other analysts maintain a more bullish stance.

Economists Timothy Peterson and Jamie Coutts, Real Vision's chief crypto analyst, expect Bitcoin to hit new highs in Q2.

Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range. Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June. — Timothy Peterson (@nsquaredvalue) 

Last week, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan reiterated his December prediction that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 before the close of 2025.

Hougan argued that recent developments in U.S. trade policy, particularly under former President Donald Trump's renewed tariff push, could act as tailwinds for Bitcoin.

After finding success with Bitcoin Miner, a vibrant mobile game in which players can earn real Bitcoin rewards for fake-mining an array of cryptocurrencies, Fumb Games has pivoted into a very different kind of mining game.

Idle Mine on iOS and Android is cut from the same cloth as Bitcoin Miner, as both are “idle” experiences that require minimal input, typically in the form of pressing buttons and deciding when and how to spend in-game funds on upgrades. In this case, however, your little miners are digging out gems and serving customers as you expand your operation.

But it also provides real Bitcoin rewards, which you can cash out and spend as you please. Granted, the earnings are tiny—so keep your expectations in check. But if you want to stack up satoshis while playing a simple phone or tablet game, Idle Mine is another option. Here's how it works.

Idle Mine is an iOS and Android game that was first released in 2024. This idle game tasks you with running a gem mining operation by spending in-game coins to upgrade particular mines, add staff, and better serve customers.

That's all done via menus, and when you're not interacting with menus, the game essentially plays itself: The miners run around, collecting gems and serving customers, and your earnings gradually increase over time.

That's why it's considered an “idle” game, because so much of the experience is automated. It's a lightweight management sim, in other words. There also isn't much strategy needed, since the game will always put a current “mission” at the top of the screen. Following those is an easy way to keep things simple and focus on gradually earning Bitcoin.

As you play and make upgrades, you'll earn tiny bits of Bitcoin denominated in satoshis, or 1/100,000,000 of a single BTC. This is real Bitcoin that you can withdraw to a ZBD wallet and then transfer elsewhere or spend as you please.

Idle Mine also has optional in-game purchases to help boost your earnings or speed up mine upgrades. It also has optional video ads that you can watch to get special boosts, such as adding a 5x multiplier to free gifts of coins or “magic gems” used for certain upgrades.

As noted above, you should keep your expectations modest. If you play a fair bit of Idle Mine daily, then you might be able to stack up a couple hundred satoshis each day. But at a price of $85,000 per Bitcoin, 200 satoshis is only worth about 17 cents.

We've played hours and hours of the game over time, stacking upwards of 4,000 satoshis… but that's barely a few bucks in total, and we'd rather not think too hard about the per-hour rate.

Basically, it's a little bit of free crypto as a bonus for playing the game, but don't expect that Idle Mine or any other play-to-earn Bitcoin game will make you rich.

Funds can be withdrawn into a ZBD wallet, though note that U.S. users in some states may not be able to use ZBD due to local restrictions. Be sure to check before you start racking up hours in pursuit of BTC rewards.

Idle Mine and Bitcoin Miner have both instituted a variable daily withdrawal limit, which is apparently tied to the price of Bitcoin. As of this writing, Idle Mine players can withdraw 330 satoshis per day, or about $0.28 worth.

A recent report from Bitso, a long-standing Ripple partner, highlights growing traction among Latin American users for XRP.

The report shared the activities of Latin American (LATAM) users on Bitso's crypto platform in the previous year. Notably, it highlighted some interesting details, including XRP's meteoric rise to fame among its customers.

For context, the 2024 report shows that despite a decrease in activities on the platform, the acquisition of XRP increased substantially. The outline indicated that users bought more of the asset than prominent coins like Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin.

Meanwhile, the report underscores XRP's preference last year. XRP accounted for 9% of all purchases on the Bitso platform, 3% more than the meme coin PEPE, which ranks next to it. In addition, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin acquisitions accounted for 5%, 4%, and 2% of all LATAM buy activities, respectively, falling short of XRP's traction.

However, Bitcoin and stablecoins dominated trading activity on Bitso last year. The pioneering cryptocurrency accounted for an average of 22% of all purchases, down from 28% in the first half of the year alone. Meanwhile, stablecoins led proceedings, with 39% of acquisitions tied to the dollar-pegged digital asset.

Furthermore, Mexicans bought more XRP than any other Latin American geographical region. Aside from preferences for Bitcoin and stablecoins, 10% of buying activities among the nation's users were accumulating XRP.

Meanwhile, the report identified a drastic change in average portfolio distribution as preferences among LATAM users evolve. Interestingly, a notable rotation was seen, particularly towards XRP, as users held more of the token compared to the previous year.

The statistics show that in 2023, XRP was not part of the average portfolio composition of Latin American users on Bitso. However, things escalated quickly last year, resulting in an average distribution of 13%. This means that portfolios of users in the region comprise at least 13% of XRP, a testament to the emerging interest in the ecosystem.

Notably, factors such as potential regulatory clarity and the asset's performance may have contributed to this newfound interest in the XRP. For context, XRP grew 238% in 2024, its strongest performance since 2021, with most of the rally happening in the last quarter of the year. Interestingly, the optimism triggered by Donald Trump's election victory and the resignation of US SEC Chair Gary Gensler ignited this foray.

Bitso's report highlighted a renewed interest in the XRP ecosystem in Latin America. Notably, the crypto exchange is a long-standing Ripple partner, facilitating cross-border remittances in LATAM. In 2022, Bitso processed $3.3 billion in remittances between the US and Mexico for Ripple.

Ethereum could soon face a technical deadlock as the growth of layer 2 solutions threatens to saturate its processing capacity, despite planned improvements.

Since the introduction of the EIP-4844, Ethereum uses “blobs“ as a low-cost storage mechanism to support L2 networks like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism.

These solutions allow offloading the main network while preserving its security. However, the current capacity of three blobs per block is now a major constraint.

The upcoming Pectra upgrade, scheduled for May 7, 2025, will double this capacity to six blobs per block. But according to the report, this enhancement will remain insufficient in the face of accelerated L2 adoption.

Simulations show that a tenfold increase in transaction volume on these networks would push fees to prohibitive levels, potentially reaching $0.64 per transaction.

Even with future upgrades like PeerDAS and Fusaka, experts estimate that Ethereum should support at least 33 blobs per block to keep L2 transaction costs below $0.02.

The case of Base, Coinbase's L2 blockchain, perfectly illustrates this dilemma. Since its launch, Base has generated over $106 million in fees, onboarded more than 155 million addresses, and contributed $4.5 million in blob fees for Ethereum.

With an average of 93 transactions per second over the past six months, Base demonstrates both the benefits and challenges of the current model. This blockchain already secures nearly $10 billion in total value, strengthening the Ethereum ecosystem, but its continued growth could put unsustainable pressure on the existing infrastructure.

If Ethereum fails to quickly scale its blob capacity, it risks its L2 strategy being compromised, resulting in a return to high fees that would negate the benefits of scaling solutions.

In a scenario where L2 transactions increase tenfold, Ethereum's annualized revenue would reach about $1.4 billion, roughly equivalent to its current fee generation.

Ethereum's future as the backbone of Decentralized Applications will therefore depend on its ability to resolve these technical constraints before they become an insurmountable obstacle to its adoption.

Old-school commodity trader Peter L. Brandt, who has been in the business since the mid-1970s, has stirred the crypto community with his recent tweet, where he predicts Ethereum to nosedive to a 2022 low of $800.

Brandt shared a chart, which clearly demonstrates the way he expects Ethereum's price trajectory to go from the current trading point. The chart shows a descending triangle pattern, which usually predicts further and deeper price declines.

Over the past year, the second largest cryptocurrency has already displayed a massive 46% decline. Since Wednesday, when ETH crashed by 4%, following Bitcoin down after the Fed Reserve's announcement about maintaining the current interest rates, it has recovered by 3.56% and is changing hands at $1,601. When Brandt published his chart, ETH traded at $1,587 per coin.

As covered by U.Today, earlier this week, the famous NBA player Scottie Pippen predicted the start of the biggest altcoin season this Sunday. He stated that historically, such a bull run has always begun approximately 340 days after a Bitcoin halving.

The most recent halving took place last year on April 20. That year, the SEC also approved on spot ETFs based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. All along, Bitcoin ETFs have been showing much higher inflows and smaller outflows than Ethereum ETFs.

Scottie Pippen stated that he was bullish on ETH long-term since he is building a project on this network. It is focused on AI, gaming and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA).

Tron founder and owner of two crypto exchanges, Poloniex and Huobi, Justin Sun, also tweeted that despite the recent poor performance, Tron does not intend to sell its Ethereum holdings. What they plan is to seek more opportunities to collaborate with Ethereum developers and work to improve the crypto space together.

Crypto World News

April 19, 2025 by Bena Ilyas 

Ethereum (ETH) has hovered at about $1,597 over the last three days, indicating that its price has stabilized. Despite this, the large-cap altcoin is still battling against a strong bearish downtrend, with a fully diluted market valuation of approximately $192 billion. Its 24-hour average trading volume of $7.03 billion highlights the ongoing market interest.

Technical analysis suggests that Ethereum is testing critical macro support within the $1,500–1,600 range, forming a descending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing early signs of bullish divergence, indicating the possibility of a rebound. Higher lows are forming while the price continues to decline, a pattern often seen before potential price recovery.

The current support level is crucial, as it marks the point that sparked Ethereum's rally in 2023. When Bitcoin dominance drops, it can be one of the first large-scale cryptocurrencies to react positively. A reclaim above the $1,700–1,800 level would be an indicator that the upward momentum of ETH continues, reflecting an even stronger trend.

Ethereum's chart shows an ongoing bearish downward trend since last year's high at $4,100. The cryptocurrency is trading below both the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), indicating weak market sentiment. However, there are positive signs as well. Ethereum has formed a bullish divergence, with the MACD lines rising and the RSI moving slightly above its descending trendline. Additionally, ETH has formed a falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential bullish breakout as the two trendlines converge.

Market analysts have provided optimistic comments about the recovery of Ethereum's price. According to Greg Miller, the breakout of ETH from the falling wedge may be followed by an increase of great magnitude up to $2,150. In case ETH breaks past this level, it may indicate the start of the crypto's next move up. 

Ted Pillows commented that the cryptocurrency needs to sustain the $1,550–1,600 zone to have an opportunity to recapture the $1,670 high. If successful, a rally towards $2,000 could follow. However, ETH remains in a highly competitive landscape, and its ability to overcome the challenges posed by layer-2 networks and declining ETF inflows will determine its future performance.

According to Crypto Rover, Ethereum's price could surge to $10,000 as historical patterns suggest a bullish trend. Crypto Rover points to past data where similar market conditions led to significant price increases. Traders are advised to monitor Ethereum's trading volume and market sentiment as these could influence ETH's trajectory. The potential for Ethereum to reach this price point is reinforced by its growing adoption and the upcoming network upgrades. Investors should consider these factors when strategizing their trades.

Bitcoin whales are buying again, and that's rarely a quiet signal.

Large holders are scooping up $BTC at levels not seen since the last bull market, while mid-sized wallets are finally flipping bullish too.

But here's the thing: when Bitcoin rallies, it rarely moves alone.

Altcoins with strong narratives, meme energy, or smart positioning often surge even faster. If you're scanning the market for the best altcoins to watch as momentum builds, we've got three that are starting to heat up.

On-chain data shows a clear pattern: large Bitcoin holders – aka whales – are steadily increasing their positions. That kind of accumulation usually signals long-term confidence.

More interestingly, even mid-sized holders, who tend to be more reactive to short-term sentiment, are now showing signs of accumulation too. This double signal suggests that broader belief in a new bullish cycle is forming.

Meanwhile, Benjamin Cowen, a well-known analyst in the space, recently said in an interview that Bitcoin could climb as much as 137% if macro and market conditions align.

While that's a best-case scenario, it shows just how much upside analysts are starting to factor in. If $BTC does take off like that, the altcoin market could ignite in its shadow.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn't just another meme coin hoping to go viral. It's designed to mirror Bitcoin's rise – but with serious perks.

As Bitcoin climbs to key milestones like $150K, $200K, and beyond, $BTCBULL holders are rewarded with real $BTC. Yes, actual Bitcoin.

At a current price of $0.00247, $BTCBULL has already raised over $4.8M during its presale, signaling strong early interest.

The token also features built-in supply burns as $BTC hits milestones, creating natural scarcity that could drive value over time.

Every time Bitcoin hits a milestone, $BTCBULL's supply shrinks (hello, token burns), and rewards drop straight to holders – but only if you bought $BTCBULL through Best Wallet and still hold it there. No Best Wallet? No airdrops.



The project has already partnered with Best Wallet to make claiming rewards easy – no BRC-20 headaches or complex $BTC wallets required. Buy $BTCBULL on Ethereum, hold it in Best Wallet, and if Bitcoin pumps, so do your rewards.

With Bitcoin whales accumulating and price predictions turning bullish, $BTCBULL is positioned to capitalize on the surge like few others.

Mind of Pepe ($MIND) is a meme coin unlike anything the space has seen before.

At its core is a self-evolving AI agent designed to act in the best interest of $MIND holders. It has its own blockchain wallet, can interact with decentralized apps (dApps), and even launch new tokens – all autonomously.

What sets this project apart is the AI's integration with social media. Mind of Pepe runs its own autonomous account on X, where it scans crypto conversations on X in real-time using hive-mind analysis.



Mind of Pepe identifies early narratives, predicts meme trends before they go mainstream, and engages with influencers to help shape the conversation.

This intelligence isn't just for show – it's delivered exclusively to $MIND holders through token-gated communities and Telegram drops.

As the AI continues to learn and evolve, it becomes a stronger force in the space – part influencer, part analyst, part builder. In a world where narrative drives value, $MIND offers direct access to the machine that's helping write it.

With market sentiment turning bullish again, $MIND is well-positioned to ride the next meme-fueled breakout. If you're looking to buy in, $MIND is currently priced at $0.0037215, with over $8M already raised during its presale.

Green Bitcoin ($GBTC) is a new crypto project offering a fresh take on staking – combining climate-conscious values with a gameified DeFi experience.

Priced at around $0.09914, $GBTC runs on Ethereum's proof-of-stake network, promoting sustainability while letting users earn rewards through prediction-based staking.

Here's how it works: holders can stake their $GBTC and guess the future price of Bitcoin. If their prediction is accurate, they earn extra rewards. If not, they still receive base staking income. It's part DeFi, part game, and built for a market that's increasingly leaning into eco-aware narratives.

The token's supply is capped, with deflationary mechanics in place, and the platform plans to use part of its ecosystem to fund renewable energy initiatives.

In a crypto world trying to shake off its carbon-heavy image, $GBTC offers a rare value proposition: make money, have fun, and feel a little better about your portfolio's footprint.

With bullish Bitcoin sentiment rising again, it could quietly become one of the best altcoins to watch in the months ahead.

Bitcoin's momentum is building fast – and it's pulling some high-potential altcoins into the spotlight.

$BTCBULL mirrors Bitcoin's rise with real $BTC rewards, $MIND fuses memes with AI-generated insights, and $GBTC gamifies staking with a green twist.

Together, these projects capture where the market is heading: narrative-driven, utility-backed, and community-powered. With whales accumulating and sentiment flipping bullish, this could be the ideal time to explore beyond Bitcoin itself.

Just don't forget – all crypto investments come with risk. Never invest more than you're willing to lose, and always do your own research (DYOR).

Binance Coin (BNB) has continued to show excellent market performance, going up between $575 and $591 over the last week. The cryptocurrency trended upwards between April 13 and April 19, 2025, with significant price leaps on April 17 and 18. As per latest figures, BNB registered a moderate 1.0% gain in the previous 24 hours.

BNB One Of Least Impacted By Market Declines

While most cryptocurrencies have taken huge losses from their highs, BNB is among the only coins that has exhibited remarkable stability. According to on-chain statistics provider CryptoQuant, BNB, along with Bitcoin, has witnessed little declines compared to other altcoins that dropped as much as 90% from their highs.

BNB: The Most Resilient Altcoin in the Crypto Market

“While most altcoins have suffered drops of up to -98.5% from their all-time highs, BNB stands out alongside Bitcoin (BTC) as one of the least affected cryptocurrencies” – By @joao_wedson

Link https://t.co/QLQwJOkfF7 pic.twitter.com/T7Wa6sK6jQ

The cryptocurrency managed to hit a new all-time high in the recent market cycle, a feat few other digital currencies have achieved. CryptoQuant's charts reveal BNB appearing in pale red on their charts, which is a much lesser decline compared to other cryptocurrencies that appear in darker shades of red.



Common coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) have experienced dramatic highs and lows with long stretches of lowering value before a rebound. Lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as COMP, DASH, and CAKE were hit the hardest when the market changed.

Strong Ecosystem Supports BNB Value

The good performance of BNB is not all about price action. CryptoQuant explains that BNB's stability is due to its real-world applications within the Binance ecosystem. The coin has various roles on the Binance platform, such as being used to pay for transaction fees, trading fees, and running applications on the Binance Smart Chain.

A lot of traders like to swap their altcoins for BNB, which keeps people wanting it. BNB has stayed useful over time, helping more people use it and making it one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies today.

Market analyst Master of Crypto noted how real-life utilities of BNB put it several steps ahead of other cryptocurrencies without real-world applications. The utility of the coin to sustain the whole ecosystem of Binance will continue to reinforce its market value.

Technical Signs Point To Neutral Outlook

Despite the overall stability of BNB itself, the technical prediction at the moment would indicate a neutral outlook in the broader market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48.57 puts it in the middle ground with no strong push in any direction.

This RSI reading just tells us that the market is in consolidation and that neither buyers nor sellers are gaining an edge. If the RSI crosses above 50, it would tell us that momentum is steadily building in the direction of the bulls. Conversely, if it drops below 45, what it could indicate is a deterioration of price strength.

Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen anticipates that Bitcoin BTC/USD will maintain its dominance over altcoins until there are alterations in the US monetary policy.

What Happened: In a video post on Wednesday, Cowen communicated his insights to his 892,000 YouTube subscribers. He anticipates that the total market cap of altcoins, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, will persist in its decline against Bitcoin.

Cowen's prediction is that Bitcoin will continue to outperform altcoins until the US Federal Reserve relaxes its monetary policy. “My base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over,” Cowen expressed in the post.

The term Bitcoin dominance refers to the proportion of Bitcoin's total market capitalization in comparison to all other crypto assets. A rise in Bitcoin dominance signifies that Bitcoin is either ascending faster than other crypto assets or its descent is less severe.

Regarding the timeline for the Federal Reserve to relax its monetary policy, Cowen said, “Now, I don't know how long it's going to take them to end quantitative tightening, it's possible they end it this summer.”

At the time of the report, Bitcoin was trading at $84,270.

Why It Matters: The dominance of Bitcoin over altcoins has significant implications for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin continues to outperform altcoins, it could lead to a consolidation of investment in Bitcoin, potentially driving its price even higher. 

Conversely, a shift in the US monetary policy that leads to an easing of the Federal Reserve's current stance could disrupt this trend, leading to a more even distribution of investment across different cryptocurrencies. 

This prediction by Cowen provides valuable insight for investors navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin has remained sideways for the last couple of months, tossing between the $88K and $75K levels. It hasn't made any significant moves to either side.

Keep reading to find out how Bitcoin can move in the weeks to come. We'll also suggest some of the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from a potential $BTC rally.

It's still too early to say that BTC has gone into bearish territory. Although the recent dips replicate its previous bearish run patterns, the dips aren't as sharp.

Plus, these drawdowns are mostly attributed to macroeconomic factors, including, of course, Trump's tariffs. The fundamentals of the coin itself have little to do with these dips.

A large part of the unrealized short-term losses are also because of the recent dips. A good thing, though, is that STHs aren't selling $BTC as of now.

Their willingness to sit on some losses shows that the market participants still believe in a positive long-term proposition.

If you look at Bitcoin's weekly chart, you'll notice a sharp bounce from the 50 EMA, which also happens to be a critical support zone for the token.

 



What's more, the bounce is also occurring from the 50% Fibonacci level, showing continued strength.

Another bit of positive news is that even after the recent turbulence, long-term holders are still sitting on unrealized profits and seem to be willing to absorb a bit of loss as well.

All in all, Bitcoin seems to be well-positioned for a good rally that could see the king cryptocurrency reclaim its recent highs. If you're looking to make the most of the upcoming run, here are some of the best cryptos to buy now.

Bitcoin's long-term bullish bias is very much intact thanks to unfazed institutional interest and increasing support from governments worldwide.

If you want to make the most amount of gains from the next Bitcoin bull rally, a cheap crypto like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) that's built to follow Bitcoin's coattails could be the answer.



$BTCBULL is likely to closely follow Bitcoin's upward trajectory because it will give free (and real) $BTC to its token holders. This will happen every time Bitcoin crosses a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K.

The good news keeps coming, as the project's tokenomics suggest that 40% of the total supply will be used for PR and marketing. Again, this will bolster $BTCBULL's hype in the market.

BTC Bull Token is currently in presale, which has gone from strength to strength to collect over $4.8M so far. One token is available for just $0.00247, and here's how to buy $BTCBULL.

Given the number of cryptos that have flooded the market in the last few months, finding profitable opportunities has become increasingly difficult. Enter MIND of Pepe ($MIND).

$MIND is not just the best AI agent coin, but it's also, quite frankly, a genius.

After it has studied the ongoing trends and chatter around crypto on online platforms like X, $MIND will use its revolutionary hive-mind intelligence to find out the best cryptos to invest in.



In addition to such expert insights into crypto investing, $MIND token holders will also get exclusive access to the tokens created by MIND of Pepe firsthand.

Naturally, these tokens will be built out of viral ideas, meaning they'll be in a pole position to join the list of the top trending cryptos.

The best part? MIND of Pepe is currently in presale ($8M+ raised), which is why each token is available for a low price of $0.0037215. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy $MIND.

Comedian ($BAN) is unlike the two cryptos mentioned above, seeing as it has no real utility. In other words, it's a pure meme coin that only thrives on market hype and community interest.

However, because of how intense meme coin rallies can be, the ROI potential of tokens like $BAN is multiple times greater than almost every single conventional investment.

$BAN, for instance, has gained more than 71,000% since its launch in October 2024. After a nearly month-long consolidation, the token has surged past its recent resistance level.



$BAN is up over 17% in the last seven days and is currently trading at $0.04527.

Comedian, by the way, is inspired by the controversial artwork of Maurizio Cattelan, which simply features a yellow banana taped to a wall.

This modern artwork is controversial because it's allegedly a disrespect to contemporary art, which features more sophisticated themes and intricate designs.

Meme coins, however, thrive on such virality, which is exactly why $BAN has been so successful.

Although Bitcoin's bullish outlook is undoubtedly great for your crypto portfolio, it's important to remember that the market can change tides overnight.

We suggest accounting for the current market volatility and uncertainty and only investing an amount you're happy sidelining.

Lastly, kindly do your own research before investing, as none of the above is financial advice.

President Trump isn't shy about shaking up the US government.

He's already slashed government agencies through DOGE, replaced department heads that were thought to be safe in their jobs, and reversed course on lawsuits against the crypto industry.

Most notably for crypto enthusiasts, Trump appointed crypto-friendly economist Paul Atkins as the new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to replace crypto public enemy #1 Gary Gensler. Atkins is expected to chart a much friendlier path for cryptocurrencies that leads to less regulation and more room for the industry to operate.

Now, rumors are flying that Trump could make a similar move at the Federal Reserve—ousting Fed Chair Jerome Powell midway through his term to replace him with someone more committed to lowering interest rates and nurturing the crypto industry. The frontrunner appears to be Kevin Warsh, an advisor at Bitwise (which offers Bitcoin ETFs) and a longtime backer of Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Warsh could institute a big economic shakeup with major implications for the crypto industry. Lower interest rates usually lead to bullish action around digital assets.

With that in mind, here are three tokens that could pop if Warsh takes over the Fed.

Solaxy ($SOLX) is a new altcoin that hasn't yet traded on exchanges—it's only available through a token presale that's raised more than $30 million. The project is building the first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution for the Solana blockchain and it has the potential to become the most important hub for new development in the Solana ecosystem.

Solaxy especially stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment like the one Warsh could institute because of the network's importance for meme coin traders. Solaxy offers lower gas fees and faster transaction processing compared to the Solana mainnet, so it could quickly become a hotspot for meme coin trading after the Layer-2 launches. Low interest rates encourage significantly increased meme coin trading volume, which in turn could drive activity on Solaxy and demand for its $SOLX gas token.

The fact that Solaxy is a new token could also play to its advantage in a low interest rate regime. If lower rates kick off a crypto bull market—as many analysts expect would be the case—investors and traders could flock to emerging tokens with higher growth potential than established altcoins. It's a perfect storm of tailwinds for Solaxy that could help the $SOLX token's price soar higher.

Aave ($AAVE) is one of the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for lending and borrowing cryptocurrency. It stands to be directly impacted by lower interest rates from the Fed because those impact the costs of borrowing crypto on the platform.

That's because in a lower interest rate environment, it's cheaper for traders and investors to borrow crypto through Aave since those funds can't fetch higher rates in alternative markets like treasuries. So, more transaction volume and bigger loans can take place on Aave—and the platform uses some of its fees to buy back $AAVE tokens, increasing their value.

Aave could also see a surge in loan volume because of the bull market kicked off by lower interest rates. More trading and investment opportunities translate to greater demand for crypto loans. The $AAVE token is currently trading almost 80% below its price during the last crypto bull run—when interest rates were low—so there's a huge potential for growth in this altcoin.

Toncoin ($TON) is a Layer-1 blockchain developed in partnership with Telegram, the world's largest messaging app. It's not directly impacted by lower interest rates, but we think $TON has the potential to be one of the biggest winners in a sustained crypto bull market driven by reduced interest rates. It's among the only major altcoins that didn't see the last bull run in 2021-2022, so Toncoin hasn't yet experienced the full-blown growth that comes during an extended period of low rates.

Toncoin has only just begun to tap into the potential audience of nearly 1 billion global users on Telegram. Rising token prices could reignite interest in crypto, especially in countries with shaky financial systems or high inflation. Since many of these people are already on Telegram—and have access to the messaging app's Toncoin integrations and wallet—they could turn to $TON over other altcoins.

$TON has a market cap of more than $7 billion, so it's hardly a small player in the altcoin market. But after the recent crypto pullback, it's trading 63% below its all-time high and 10x smaller than competing Layer-1 networks like Solana. So, we think there's a lot of room for the $TON token price to surge higher as Toncoin gains more attention.

Bitcoin dominance is decreasing, suggesting a potential shift towards altcoins.

Despite overall crypto market volatility, altcoins are showing signs of strength as Bitcoin's dominance weakens.

Analysts anticipate a possible altcoin season fueled by capital rotation away from Bitcoin.

Bitcoin dominance is starting to fade—and the market is paying close attention. As BTC.D breaks below a key support level, analysts are eyeing a potential shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. For many, this could mark the beginning of a new altcoin season.

Excited? We are too! Dive in.

April kicked off with a total crypto market cap of $2.63 trillion. But the first half of the month brought major volatility.

Between April 5 and 7, the market dropped sharply by 9.8%, hitting a low of $2.31 trillion. It didn't stay there long—between April 9 and 12, the market bounced back, climbing 11.71%. As of now, total market cap sits at $2.65 trillion, still 5.2% below this month's high.

Altcoins Follow the Trend

Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin's moves, but with some promising signs.

The altcoin market started April at $991.26 billion, then dropped to $831.83 billion by April 7. From April 9 to 12, it rebounded 11.6%. Today, the altcoin market cap is around $958.43 billion – about 7.8% below the April peak.

Looking at the four-hour chart, Bitcoin dominance peaked at 63.98% on April 7, meeting strong resistance. It briefly broke above that level on April 16 but quickly fell back. BTC.D now sits at 63.83%.

If this trend continues, Bitcoin dominance could retest the monthly low of 63.16%—a move that could fuel even more optimism around altcoins.

 Crypto analyst Crypto Rover shared on X that we may see sharp capital inflows into altcoins soon. Since April 16, the altcoin market has grown by 1.99%. Interestingly, when Bitcoin dropped from $84,936.62 to $84,479.38, the alt market climbed from $947.58 billion to $948.94 billion.

Top altcoins are already showing strength:

As Bitcoin dominance shows signs of weakening and top altcoins begin to climb, traders are watching closely. If this momentum holds, we could be at the start of a strong altcoin cycle.

Momentum is building beneath the surface, and the market may be closer to a full altcoin breakout than it seems.

Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.

The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin. A low index value, such as 15, can indicate potential for an altcoin rally. ​

Lower Bitcoin dominance often leads to capital flowing into altcoins, boosting their prices as investors diversify from BTC to major altcoins.

        Share    


            Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news' editorial.        

Our timelines were just filled with a bunch of pastel Miyazaki's ghosts. Studio Ghibli-style AI generations have become the internet's new favorite aesthetic. PFPs and marketing campaigns were reborn overnight in the watercolor warmth of Spirited Away. Selfies rendered as soot sprites. 

The results are charming yet deeply unsettling. Why? Because Hayao Miyazaki didn't draw them––and no one asked permission. This isn't just a copyright problem. It's an authenticity problem where there is a growing inability to see, trace, or understand the origins of the content that shapes our culture. 

In the chaos of AI-generated images and memecoins, we're watching creativity get flattened, authorship obscured, and ownership erased. If that feels like a plague, it's because it is.

The unfettered mess unleashed by generative AI has caused a powerful use case for blockchain to emerge: proof of provenance and onchain verifiability for agentic creation. By anchoring content to public, immutable ledgers, blockchain enables creators to prove authorship, timestamp originality, license works programmatically, and track derivatives across the network—without relying on centralized gatekeepers.

With the tools of blockchain, creators can participate in fairer, more transparent ecosystems that reward origin and empower open-source and composable content systems.

Studio Ghibli has not been the only target. In late 2024, Philip Banks created Chill Guy, a laid-back dog meme that exploded into a half-billion-dollar meme token on Solana. But Banks never gave permission. His accounts were hacked. A false licensing deal was forged. When the truth surfaced, the token crashed 45% in 30 minutes.

Now imagine that story playing out across every medium, on a global scale. That's exactly what's happening with OpenAI's recent co-option of Studio Ghibli's IP. Now, AI's tools can mimic any voice, style, or aesthetic—trained on unlicensed data scraped from the internet and any medium it can consume. 

Amazon is replacing voice actors with AI. Manga localization is being outsourced to machines. Lawsuits from The New York Times, Getty, and independent artists are piling up. A major problem is that enforcement can't keep pace with reproduction. The systems we rely on to manage content—from cloud drives to social platforms—cannot tell you where something came from. 

They fail at proving provenance and, in turn, fail the creators whose livelihoods depend on IP rights. We're building the next generation of digital culture on a foundation of guesses, not guarantees.

We don't need more IP lawsuits. We need new rails. Authenticity, or even lucidity—the ability to see clearly and act truthfully—is not just a philosophical idea. In a generative world, it's a technical requirement. If we want to preserve creative integrity in the age of AI, we need infrastructure that makes origin, attribution, and authorship cryptographically native to every digital asset.

Using content-addressable storage and Merkle tree structures, creators can hash their work and register it to a public chain. This hash becomes a permanent fingerprint of the original content. Smart contracts can define licensing conditions, automate royalties, and even govern remix rights.

Each derivative, usage event, or ownership change is logged immutably—creating a verifiable timeline of creation, modification, and transaction. This doesn't just protect artists. It improves the machines, too. With blockchain, creators can cryptographically register their work at the moment of creation. Every change, license, or remix becomes part of a transparent, tamper-proof timeline. Smart contracts can automate royalties. Attribution becomes verifiable. And usage becomes traceable—whether that's a social post, a dataset, or an AI-generated derivative.

This isn't just hype. It's a structural shift from guesswork to guarantees, from hearsay to hashes.

Without it, artists will keep getting erased. Investors will keep getting rugged. And trust in the creative economy will continue to corrode.

Freedom of communication and property rights are foundational principles in the canon of Western philosophy. We know that open communication channels and the rule of law to protect private property are the frameworks for building a free society. 

However, today, our creative systems are plagued with black-box models, closed-source platforms, and training systems on data without audit trails. We have mistaken this flood of content for an abundance of creativity when, in fact, it's a hollow kind of plenty—one that undermines the creative people it imitates.

If we want a future where new Miyazakis, Picassos, and myriad creators are possible––where artists can take risks without getting scraped into the next proprietary model––we must build systems that protect them by design.

Blockchain is how we embed authorship into content, how we stop laundering aesthetics, and how we let creativity thrive without erasure. This is not just about bad actors. It's bad architecture. And the cure isn't outrage—it's about provenance. Authenticity isn't a luxury anymore. It's a blockchain.

Despite the modest crypto market recovery, the NFT market sales volume has dropped by 4.7% to $95.9 million.

Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to the $85,000 level. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has shown a modest 2.4% recovery in the last seven days and is hovering at the $1,600 level. The global crypto market cap is now $2.69 trillion, up from last week's $2.63 trillion.

Surprisingly, while sales are down, market participation has surged with NFT buyers increasing by 96.6% to 252,354. NFT sellers have also grown by 79.2% to 153,892. 

NFT transactions have also risen by 10.4% during this period to 1,569,670.

According to data from CryptoSlam, the Ethereum blockchain maintains its position as the leading platform for NFT sales. However, its volume has dropped by 38.7% to $21.6 million. Ethereum's wash trading also decreased by 23% to $2.1 million.

Polygon (POL) has strengthened its second-place position with $21.1 million in sales, up 21.5% from the previous week. Bitcoin has climbed to third place with $17.2 million in sales, showing a 42.2% increase.

Mythos Chain now holds fourth position with $14.9 million in sales, a 5.4% improvement. Solana (SOL) rounds out the top five with $6.8 million and has recovered 7% from its previous performance.

The buyer count has increased across all major blockchains, with Solana seeing the largest growth at 133.7%, followed by Bitcoin at 128.9% and Polygon at 125%.

Courtyard on Polygon has maintained its first position in the collection rankings with $19.5 million in sales, up 24.6% from last week. DMarket holds second place with $9.7 million, which is an 8.8% increase.

Guild of Guardians Heroes has moved up to third place with $3.8 million in sales, a 3.6% rise. Bitcoin's BRC-20 NFTs follow in fourth with $3.6 million and have surged by 42.1%.

The most notable change in the rankings includes CryptoPunks. Considered one of the most iconic NFT  collections on the Ethereum blockchain, CryptoPunks has fallen to sixth place with just $1.7 million in sales. This is an 80.5% collapse from the previous week's $9.1 million. This collection has also seen drops in transactions (51.2%), buyers (56.6%), and sellers (59.4%).

Despite CryptoPunks' overall slump, individual sales from this collection still lead the top NFT transactions. Four of the top five highest-priced NFT sales were CryptoPunks. However, the top spot went to SuperRare #10093, which sold for 255 ETH ($419,772).

Other notable high-value sales include:

According to @LeonidasNFT, a critical metric for evaluating whether an NFT mint was a rug pull involves analyzing what percentage of the funds have been reinvested to provide utility to token holders. If after a year, a minimal percentage of funds have been allocated to enhance holder benefits, it may indicate a potential extraction or rug pull scenario.

              Teaching digital finance, in essence, is not just about technology; it is also about teaching students how to think critically, act ethically, and plan long-term for their finances.
            

In a world where money is changing quickly, the real question is when the next generation should learn about digital finance, not if they should. As discussions on decentralized technology bounce on from classrooms to homes to policy considerations, the next challenge is to prepare young minds not only to use digital money but to comprehend the systems that support it.

Financial literacy isn't just about balancing checkbooks or compound interest anymore; it has come to include digital wallets, blockchain systems, and the implications of programmable money. We have to marry all the traditional ideas of financial education and then integrate in the principles of the new digital economy so that we can create an empowered financially literate generation.

For the last several decades, financial education sought to cover essential subjects, such as budgeting, saving, credit scores, and investing, all through a classical orientation. These skills will continue to place relevant importance; however, the world is moving much faster than most curriculums can accommodate it. Young people live in an era when almost everything is growing up digital-first. Many will never hold a physical cheque. They will rarely even enter a bank. They will relate to money through apps, QR codes, and decentralized technology.

Interestingly, access increases almost exponentially. But understanding bottoms out. The older generation assumes today's younger ones to be 'naturally digital.' That assumption can be dangerous. A young person may be able to use a new device but not understand the risks and workings of modern finance. Exposure without education only enlarges the knowledge gap-and, perhaps, the inequality gap as well.

Teaching digital finance, in essence, is not just about technology; it is also about teaching students how to think critically, act ethically, and plan long-term for their finances. They need to learn about decentralization, how it affects control and accountability, and that trust involves systems, not just individuals.

Such knowledge does not amount to advocating for volatile speculative markets; rather, it includes demystifying terminologies like smart contracts, digital identity, and peer-to-peer value transfer. In fact, these terms are rather the scaffolding for emerging economies and new career ways.

Financial education should now inform students about data security, forever property rights, and why transparency on a blockchain does not constitute privacy. Knowing these fundamentals will help students ask the right questions and make correct decisions in situations where regulation is usually slower than innovation.

It's time to transition classrooms from being safe havens to launching pads

Schools and universities can play a great role in that. When few institutions started teaching digital finance in their curricula, it was mostly due to the lack of training that these institutions were suffering from or, simply, fear of controversy. However, shielding students from these realities is harmful to them.

Education should embrace this change, using it as a springboard for engagement, inquiry, and co-creation of meaning. Imagine the classroom where students would parse digital logs of transactions for lessons about the nature of transparency and discuss the different societal impacts that decentralized technologies would have on existing power structures. These types of conversations push students to become active, conscious citizens rather than passive consumers.

This also means equipping teachers. Teachers need the skills to traverse issues at the crossroads of finance, tech, and ethics. They need not be coders or economists but should facilitate conversations on the subject. This could be achieved through multidisciplinary partners, ongoing professional development, and flexible module design.

Parental guidance and community learning go a long way towards promoting the say of financial literacy among growing children. There are more healthy end of value shaping around money, risk, and accountability in the family and community environments. Parenting detail also understood as digital finance grows increasingly complex offers resource materials whereby both parents and children understand and explain this paradigm.

Curiosity begins here-the dinner table. When a teenage child throws up an inquisitive query about a hot digital investment or artifice to earn one's keep online, the answer must be truthfully grounded and informed caution. All these are instruction bases linking within lifelong education, at all ages and backgrounds: community centers, online workshops, and public libraries.

Digital finance is geopolitically, technology access, environmental impact and even art dependent. This is what makes it very good for such multi-generational learning. Together, students and families are learning about how resilience could be built against an infodemic threat and developing shared values regarding financial decision making.

With innovation, responsibility accompanies it. While decentralized finance can provide avenues for inclusion, it also allows more access points through which money laundering, fraud, and manipulative schemes could work—even against those people without full knowledge about the systems that they will engage with.

Education for the next generation has to provide them with access to participatory new economies and keep them in track. They ought to learn about financial literacy in these contemporary times as a matter of equity and justice. One has to be well conversant with the ability to differentiate between a secure platform and a scam platform, scrutinizing whether a particular financial model is sustainable, or recognizing long-term consequences following online transactions.

A future where this responsibility is ignored could lead to the birth of a digital underclass-those not excluded for lack of access but due to lack of understanding. That future must be avoided, and the only means of doing so is through intention and inclusion in education.

The thrust of teaching young people digital finance is not to make them investors, speculators, or techies. Rather it is to prepare them as thoughtful and empowered stakeholders into a world in transition. They need to be equipped to navigate economic worlds that may appear quite different from that known to their parents-or even to today's world.

In this sense, digital financial literacy is beyond just money: it is about agency, ethics, and equity. The sooner we can incorporate those values into our education system, the better prepared the next generation will be to not just endure the change but to shape it.

 The Bank for International Settlements warns that crypto and stablecoins may destabilize finance and widen inequality, urging stronger regulation in response. 

The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies may pose risks to the traditional financial system and exacerbate wealth inequality, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).

In an April 15 report, the BIS warned that the number of investors and amount of capital in crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have “reached a critical mass,” with investor protection becoming a “significant concern for regulators.”

The size of the crypto market signals that authorities should be worried about the “stability of crypto over and above the role it may have for TradFi and the real economy,” the report states, highlighting the role of stablecoins, which the BIS said have “become the means through which participants transfer value within crypto.”

The report calls for targeted stablecoin regulation on stability and reserve asset requirements that will guarantee the redemption of stablecoins for US dollars during “stressed market conditions.”

The report comes two weeks after the US House Financial Services Committee passed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy, or STABLE Act, with a 32–17 vote on April 2.

The STABLE Act aims to create a clear regulatory framework for dollar-denominated payment stablecoins, emphasizing transparency and consumer protection.

On March 13, the GENIUS Act, short for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, passed the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18–6. The act aims to establish collateralization guidelines and require full compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws from stablecoin issuers.

The BIS also raised concerns about how crypto markets may worsen income inequality by enabling larger investors to capitalize on the emotions of less sophisticated retail participants, as seen during the FTX collapse in 2022.

“As prices tumbled in 2022, users actually traded more,” the BIS report noted. “Most disturbingly, large bitcoin holders (“whales”) were selling as ordinary retail investors (“krill”) were buying.” It added:

The report concludes that DeFi and TradFi have similar underlying economic drivers, but DeFi's “distinctive features,” like “smart contract and composability,” present new challenges that need proactive regulatory interventions to “safeguard financial stability, while fostering innovation.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Lyn Alden lowers Bitcoin forecast after ‘tariff kerfuffle,' eyes liquidity","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-year-end-prediction-lowered-lyn-alden-liquidity-tariffs","Sat, 19 Apr 2025 04:30:00 GMT","

 Macroeconomist Lyn Alden says a period similar to the 2003–2007 run-up before the global financial crisis could play in Bitcoin's favor. 

Macroeconomist Lyn Alden expects Bitcoin to finish 2025 higher than its current price of around $85,000, though she says it would have been much higher if not for US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement in February.

“Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,” Alden told Natalie Brunell on the April 17 episode of Coin Stories. “My guess is that we end up higher at the end of the year than we are now, at least,” she added.

However, she said that a “massive liquidity unlock” could be the catalyst needed for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach more optimistic targets, similar to those before the tariffs were introduced.

For example, if the US bond market “broke” and the US Federal Reserve had to step in with measures like yield curve control or heavy quantitative easing (QE), Alden explained.

While Alden said that there is a “good chance” Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 price level before the end of the year, she emphasized that broader financial market “down days” will remain a challenge for the asset, especially since Bitcoin trades 24/7, unlike traditional stock markets with trading hours.

“Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said. 

Alden explained that crypto's round-the-clock trading contributes to its ""volatile pricing,"" particularly when traditional financial markets are “freaking out.”

At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $84,950, according to CoinMarketCap data.

However, Alden said Bitcoin can “disconnect” from the Nasdaq 100, especially in situations that “hurt Nasdaq margins” without affecting global liquidity. As an example, she pointed to a potential repeat of the five years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, which she believes could be favorable for Bitcoin.

She pointed to the 2003–2007 period, where there was a weaker US dollar cycle, and while there wasn't a mass exodus of capital, it did flow into “emerging markets,” commodities, gold, and other assets — with US stocks not “really being the place to be.”

Alden wrote in a September research report that Bitcoin moves in the direction of global M2 83% of the time in a given 12-month period. 

The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index concerning global liquidity.

 The XRP price rebound faces reversal risks as bearish patterns, fractal trends, and profit-taking pressure point to a potential 40–50% correction. 

XRP (XRP) has bounced nearly 30% after a four-month low of $1.61 amid rising tariff tensions. However, the rebound may be short-lived as technical patterns and on-chain signals now point to a deeper correction ahead.

XRP is forming a classic bearish reversal pattern that could see its price falling by at least 40% in the coming weeks.

Dubbed inverse-cup-and-handle (IC&H), the pattern forms when the price rounds off in a curved descent (cup) followed by a brief consolidation phase (handle) — all atop a common neckline support level. 

The pattern is confirmed by a breakdown stage, where the price breaks decisively below support and falls by as much as the pattern's maximum height.  

As of April 19, XRP had entered the pattern's handle-formation phase, eyeing a decisive close below the neckline support at around $2. In this case, the primary downside target will likely be around $1.24, almost 40% below current prices.

The IC&H target aligns with XRP's 200-3D exponential moving average (200-3D EMA; the blue wave) at around $1.28 — and further coincides with a November 2024 top.

Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests that XRP's market cap could drop by 50% in the coming weeks.

XRP's inverse cup-and-handle pattern is unfolding in line with its historical price behavior, signaling that its 2025 rally may have topped out. 

For instance, the cryptocurrency saw sharp pullbacks to its aggregated realized price following major surges in previous cycles, most notably in 2018 and 2021.

For traders, the realized price serves as a psychological benchmark, representing the average price at which the XRP supply was last moved. 

When the market price trades well above this level, most holders are in profit, which can encourage complacency or profit-taking. Conversely, if the price nears the realized price, fear of losses tends to rise, and selling pressure can intensify.

In 2025, XRP surged past $3.20 before losing steam, repeating patterns seen in past bull-to-bear cycles. The current realized price at around $1, a likely downside target in 2025 down about 50% from the current prices.

Interestingly, XRP's $1 realized price target is closer to its 200-week EMA (the blue wave in the chart below) at $0.81, a bear market target discussed in Cointelegraph's analysis in late March.

Adding to the bearish outlook, over 80% of XRP addresses are currently in profit. The metric historically reached similar levels during previous market tops, often preceding significant rounds of profit-taking and pullbacks.

If history repeats, such similar conditions could incentivize traders to exit positions, accelerating XRP's retracement toward the realized price.

Sentiment around XRP reaching a new all-time high above the $3.55 level is deteriorating, according to prediction market data from Polymarket. 

As of April 19, the odds of XRP achieving this milestone before 2026 have dropped to just 35%, marking a sharp 25% decline from peak confidence levels in March, as shown below.

The upside momentum in the crypto market has faded overall in April, coinciding with a broader decline in risk appetite driven by escalating global tariff tensions under Donald Trump's trade policies.

 Anthony Pompliano agrees with critics claiming the Federal Reserve isn't truly independent but says firing its chair will just make things worse. 

Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano says that US President Donald Trump shouldn't follow through on his recent threat to fire the head of the US Federal Reserve, saying it would set a dangerous precedent — especially considering the true motive behind it.

“I do not believe that the President of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed President,” Pompliano said in a video posted on X on April 18.

Pompliano said, “Where you have a disagreement and then the firing, I think that's not really the area that we want to go into.”

It comes after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social to accuse Fed chair Jerome Powell of being too slow to cut interest rates. “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said on April 17.

Pompliano explained that while the Fed is meant to operate independently, he agrees with critics who argue it's not truly independent. “The Fed, I think, is highly politicized, even though they pretend not to be,” he said.

Pompliano acknowledged his own criticism of the Fed, saying he's not exactly a fan, but emphasized that even if the Fed has made mistakes, responding in kind isn't the right approach.

“I still think that just because somebody else is doing something wrong doesn't mean that you should do something wrong,” Pompliano said.

US Senator Elizabeth Warren recently warned that if Trump eventually moves to fire Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash. 

“A big part of our economy strong, and a big part of the world economy strong, is the idea that the big pieces move independently of politics,” Warren said during an appearance on CNBC.

Lower interest rates often lead to increased liquidity, which has historically led to higher prices of perceived riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

It comes not long after Powell said establishing a stablecoins legal framework was a “good idea.” 

In an April 16 panel at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell said, “The climate is changing, and you're moving into more mainstreaming of that whole sector, so Congress is again looking [...] at a legal framework for stablecoins.”

Garmin, the maker of our favorite fitness trackers, has several series of entry-level hybrid trackers. Sorting through them can be confusing. The Venu series is the most expensive, the premium tracker with more smartwatch features (full-screen AMOLED, microphone, etc.). The Vivomove series has a hidden display and no onboard GPS. Right in the middle sits the Vivoactive series. The latest Vivoactive 6 has an AMOLED display, about a week of battery life, and of course, access to Garmin's top-of-the-line fitness software.

I wrote previously that the $100 Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Recommends) made me rethink what a fitness tracker's value proposition should be, and $300 now seems very expensive for an entry-level tracker. However, unlike Amazfit's, Garmin's trackers and software actually work. In an unsurprising turn of events, I tried Garmin's new AI-powered Active Intelligence, and it's the first AI-powered fitness service that provided me with useful insights. So far, Garmin's supremacy remains unvanquished.

Like all of Garmin's lifestyle lines, the Vivoactive 6 is easy to wear, with a silicone strap, an aluminum bezel, and a light, 42-mm polymer case. It's not actually lighter than my Apple Watch Series 10, but it feels lighter, because it's plastic. The display is a touchscreen AMOLED that I found readable in daylight and responsive to my touch, although it was easy to print the screen with my sunscreen-y fingers. There are two buttons on the side of the case, an activity button and a back button. You can also scroll up and down and tap to get stats and notifications.

Garmin touts 11 days of battery life, but with multiple tracked activities per day I got about a week. It uses the Garmin proprietary plug charger, which is more annoying than it should be, given that Garmin introduced wireless charging years ago with the Vivomove Trend (although the company is far from the only one that still relies on its own proprietary chargers instead of wireless charging or USB-C).

It has onboard satellite connectivity (GPS, Glonass, Galileo, QZSS, and Beidou) to make it incredibly accurate when tracking your outdoor activities, and the usual suite of onboard sensors—heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitoring (an important consideration if you want to switch from an Apple Watch)—a compass, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, a thermometer, and an ambient light sensor. It's also rated for water resistance at 5 ATM, you can track swimming.

I compared sleep scores, heart rate measurements, and step counts with my Oura Ring 4 and found that they mostly tallied—although oddly enough, a restless night registered with the Vivoactive 6 and did not with the Oura, which stands out, as the Oura is the best sleep tracker that we've tested.

The Vivoactive 6 also has the full suite of Garmin's long-established fitness and safety features, like incident detection to alert your emergency contact if you fell or were attacked on a run; Body Battery to register just how much energy you have left during the day; Training Readiness to assess how capable you are of tackling the day's hard workout; and Morning Report, which greets you every morning with the weather, how you slept, and other factors (you can customize this).

As usual, there are also over 80 activity profiles and suggested workouts for different activities, like strength training and yoga. I'm trying very hard not to ding Garmin for the fact that this is one of the only watch series that doesn't have rock climbing as an activity profile. Instead, it has a ton of golf features, which, like racquet sports, more fits the Vivomove demographic. However, it is still annoying to climb for an hour, then skateboard for an hour, and discover at the end of the day that the Vivomove 6 thought I barely moved at all.

Need some help sorting through it all? Garmin has a 100-page manual to learn how to do all the things you can do, even with this basic entry-level tracker.

If you frequent runner social media, you will see a running joke that your Garmin is your most critical companion. What did you do that day? All of Garmin's metrics will tell you that it's all not enough, and you're also probably a bad person who kicks dogs.

For those of us who just can't get enough of wearable verbal abuse, Garmin recently launched a subscription service for the first time. Connect+ launched on March 27 and is $7/month, or $70 per year. This is comparable in price to an Oura membership plan, and it gets you features like Garmin's new AI-powered Active Intelligence, a performance dashboard, and real-time live tracking on compatible smartphones with the Garmin Connect app.

One of the biggest pluses with Garmin is that Connect has always been free. Happily you will still be able to use most of Connect's features without a subscription. I don't think a subscription to Connect+ is necessary, but I should say that it's the only AI-powered personalized recommendation service that I've started to check every day. For example, today it told that while my sleep has never been “poor,” my HRV status tends to vary wildly. That's true, and I am, in fact, trying to get my nighttime scaries under control. This is a crazy detailed insight to come from an entry-level fitness tracker.

Garmins just work better than almost anything else. Every time I have a problem with a Garmin tracker, something happens to remind me that Garmin has been troubleshooting similar problems with people exactly like me for years. For example, I started a treadmill run that was suggested by Garmin Coach, but the Vivomove 6's measured speed was way different than the treadmill speed. After I finished, Garmin asked me to calibrate the distance. My treadmill runs were accurate thereafter.

The Move reminders were also great—instead of just telling you to stand up and walk around, the Vivomove 6 offers you several options for a quick 30-second break, like trunk twists or toe touches, along with a timer and a video demonstration on your watch of how to do the exercise. Both my dog and I found these very exciting. The suggested workouts for different activity profiles were also consistently good, and I found myself clicking on my Garmin coach's suggested runs more often than not.

It's hard to compete with a $100-$150 price for an entry-level fitness tracker, and Amazfit's do look very good. But you're just not going to get more or accurate measurements with anything other than an Apple Watch or a smart ring, and you're not going to find better training software anywhere around. I also appreciate that the company hasn't locked the metrics that we know and love, like Body Battery, behind the subscription paywall (yet).

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The summer of 2021 was brutal for residents of the Pacific Northwest. Cities across the region from Portland, Oregon, to Quillayute, Washington, broke temperature records by several degrees. In Washington, as the searing heat wave settled over the state, 125 people died from heat-related illnesses such as strokes and heart attacks, making it the deadliest weather event in the state's history.

As officials recognized the heat wave's disproportionate effect on low-income and unhoused people unable to access air-conditioning, they made a crucial change to the state's energy assistance program. Since the early 1980s, states, tribes, and territories have received funds each year to help low-income people pay their electricity bills and install energy-efficiency upgrades through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Congress appropriates funds for the program, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, doles it out to states in late fall. Until the summer of 2021, the initiative primarily provided heating assistance during Washington's cold winter months. But that year, officials expanded the program to cover cooling expenses.

Last year, Congress appropriated $4.1 billion for the effort, and HHS disbursed 90 percent of the funds. But the program is now in jeopardy.

Earlier this month, HHS, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., laid off 10,000 employees, including the roughly dozen or so people tasked with running LIHEAP. The agency was supposed to send out an additional $378 million this year, but those funds are now stuck in federal coffers without the staff needed to move the money out.

LIHEAP helps roughly 6 million people survive freezing winters and blistering summers, many of whom face greater risks now that the year's warm season has already brought unusually high temperatures. Residents of Phoenix are expected to have their first 100-degree high any day now.

“We're seeing the warm-weather states really coming up short with the funding necessary to assist people in the summer with extreme heat,” said one of the HHS employees who worked on the LIHEAP program and was recently laid off. Losing the people that ran the program is “absolutely devastating,” they said, because agency staff helped states and tribes understand the flexibilities in the program to serve people effectively, assistance that became extremely important with increasingly erratic weather patterns across the country.

In typical years, once Congress appropriates LIHEAP funds, HHS distributes the money in the fall in time for the colder months. States and other entities then make critical decisions about how much they spend during the winter and how much they save for the summer.

The need for LIHEAP funds has always been greater than what has been available. Only about 1 in 5 households that meet the program's eligibility requirements receive funds. As a result, states often run out of money by the summer. At least a quarter of LIHEAP grant recipients run out of money at some point during the year, the former employee said.

“That remaining 10 percent would be really important to establish cooling assistance during the hot summer months, which is increasingly important,” said Katrina Metzler, executive director of the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition, a group of nonprofits and utilities that advances the needs of low-income people. “If LIHEAP were to disappear, people would die in their homes. That's the most critical issue. It saves people.”

In addition to Washington, many other states have expanded their programs to provide both heating and cooling programs. Arizona, Texas, and Oregon now offer year-round cooling assistance.

HHS staff plays a crucial role in running LIHEAP. They assess how much each state, tribe, and territory will receive. They set rules for how the money could be used. They audit local programs to ensure funds are being spent as intended. All that may now be lost.

But according to Metzler, there are some steps that HHS could take to ensure that the program continues to be administered as Congress intended. First, and most obvious, the agency could reinstate those who were fired. Short of that, the agency could move the program to another department within HHS or contract out the responsibilities.

But ultimately, Metzler continued, LIHEAP funds need to be distributed so those in need can access it. “Replacing the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is a nearly impossible task,” she said. States “can't have enough bake sales to replace” it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Scientists Think They've Found the Region of the Brain That Regulates Conscious Perception","https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-think-theyve-found-the-brain-region-that-regulates-conscious-perception/","Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

A team of scientists has identified areas of the brain that are activated when a person becomes aware of themself and their thoughts. This enigmatic process appears to be controlled by the thalamus, a central region of the brain already known for its function as a filter between sensory signals and the cerebral cortex, the portion of the brain that governs higher-level processes such as memory, thought, and personality.

Conscious perception is the ability of human beings to become aware of the stimuli received by their senses. It is a different state from simply being awake, where sensations are processed automatically and unreflectively. Rather, conscious perception requires a detailed and voluntary analysis of external stimuli. For example, we can breathe automatically, but we can also be aware of our breathing and modify its rhythm. Likewise, when listening to a song, we can pay attention to and differentiate the instruments that compose it.

Recently, neurologists have set out to find the part of the brain where this change in perception occurs. Researchers had traditionally suspected that such a function must be controlled by the cerebral cortex, because it is where advanced brain processing occurs. The thalamus has never been ruled out from being involved in conscious perception, however it has typically been assigned a minor role as a filter that prepares sensory information to the cortex. A new study recently published in Science redefines that view, positioning the thalamus as an active participant in conscious perception.

Most studies of consciousness involving the thalamus have faced skepticism, either because they lack key observational data of the thalamus at work or, if they are evidenced with data, because of the controversial way in which that data was likely obtained. To see whether a patient's brain region “lights up” with activity when paying conscious attention to something, it's necessary for that patient to be aware of stimuli—that is, be conscious—while simultaneously having their brain surveyed with invasive sensors.

But in this new research, a team from Beijing Normal University in China turned to a group of people who already had thin electrodes inserted into their brains as part of an experimental headache therapy, bypassing the ethical question of whether this sort of research justifies an invasive operation.

The researchers administered a visual perception test to these patients. A blinking object was displayed on a screen, which would hide itself for half of the time of the test. These characteristics meant the patients had to pay attention to the object and adjust their eyes and focus to keep watching it, rather than just regard the screen without analyzing it. This thus facilitated conscious perception, with the already-implanted electrodes then recording the brain activity that accompanied this.

The researchers say that this is one of the first simultaneous recordings of conscious perception, and the information they recorded, they say, offers strong evidence for the hypothesis that the thalamus region acts a kind of gateway to conscious perception. “The findings indicate that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei regulate conscious perception. This conclusion represents a significant advance in our understanding of the network that forms the basis of visual consciousness in humans,” the authors write.

Women's sports bras were the bane of my teen existence. Few things are as humbling as struggling to wriggle out of a sweaty one post-workout. I've contorted, clawed, nearly dislocated a shoulder—and I once triggered what I can only describe as a sports bra-induced locked jaw. They were too tight, flattened my chest (and soul), and, on a bad day, gave me a decent dose of body image issues.

Somewhere between my fourth fitness renaissance and the realization that I hadn't worn a regular bra since pre-pandemic, I became a convert. After years of trial and error, I discovered the bra styles that worked (thank goodness for adjustable straps). Now I wear them to work, to work out, and sometimes to do absolutely nothing at all.

The right sports bra should be soft but structured, snug but breathable, and—for me—cute enough to pass as a top, like the Vuori AllTheFeels bra ($58). After testing dozens over the past few months—during runs, lifts, rides, and flows—I found the best sports bras worth your attention.

Most days, I'm in activewear, and the Vuori AllTheFeels Sports Bra is my favorite everyday bra for light support. Vuori's BlissBlend fabric (75 percent recycled polyamide and 25 percent elastane) is buttery soft and breathable. I have worn this bra for low-impact workouts, but the level of support feels too low for anything more than walking. It's perfect for lounging or running errands. If you're looking for extra support during more intense workouts, the Vuori Yosemite bra is my favorite and is designed with a flattering strappy back.

Materials: 75 percent recycled polyamide, 25 percent elastane.

Size Range: XXS through XXL.

Nike's Dri-FIT technology is moisture-wicking magic. It's quick to dry and bounce back into shape, even during your sweatiest workouts, so you're never left feeling soggy or cold. It's the most versatile bra in my rotation—I wear it for cycling, running, hiking, yoga, or even just a long walk on a hot summer day. If you order a bra size too small, the waistband can get uncomfortable, but if you nail the fit, you'll appreciate the balance between support and mobility. The thick waistband locks everything in place while giving your chest enough room to breathe and move naturally through your workout. Plus, the sewn-in pads don't shift or fold, even after multiple washes.

Nike's move to sustainability is a bonus; they use recycled polyester sourced from plastic bottles to reduce waste and carbon emissions. It comes in a rainbow of colors, with regular seasonal drops, so you're sure to find one you like.

Materials: Body—72 percent polyester, 28 percent spandex; Mesh—81 percent polyester, 19 percent spandex; Back lining—72 percent polyester, 28 percent spandex; Pad back fabric—100 percent polyester; Pad—100 percent polyurethane.

Size Range: XXS through 4X.

This is the lightest sports bra I've ever worn. This is the running bra that I wear in Mississippi or Virginia when the humidity goes over 93 percent during the day and it feels like there's a chemical reaction between my skin and sunlight that instantly covers me in sweat. This is also the bra I will take this summer on a family trip to the Philippines, where any heavier sports bra will take forever to line-dry outside.

Lume Six has two proprietary fabrics. DreamSupport makes up the front panel, and FeatherAir makes the straps on the back. Both are made from a proprietary blend of recycled polyester and elastane, with a thin cotton lining in the interior of the front so you don't have to deal with soaked, sweaty boob pads. Both fabrics feel paper-thin, without being stiff or uncomfortable. Although it's billed as a medium-impact bra, I use the Alta for high-sweat, high-impact activities like running and in humid climates. I would also suggest sizing up, as Lume Six suggests; I sized into an XS, which fits, but tightly. A larger size would be more comfortable for longer extended wear. —Adrienne So

Materials: Front—76 percent recycled polyester, 24 percent elastane; Back—74 percent recycled polyester, 26 percent elastane; Lining—61 percent polyester, 35 percent cotton, 4 percent spandex.

Size Range: XXS through 3X.

There's something about this Gymshark bra that makes me feel like I trained harder than I probably did. They look great on basically everyone and don't skimp on function. I adore the crossover back for upper body days when I want to see my back and shoulder pump in real time. It's medium support, but the compressive fabric holds everything in place like a high-support bra. I don't get any bounce or jiggle, even during HIIT exercises. Despite the ruched front and V neckline, I've never (knock on wood) had a nip slip incident. The straps are adjustable, the pads are removable, and the seasonal color drops mean you'll probably end up with more than one. Don't fight it. In fact, the Ruched Strappy Sports Bra, the Strap Feature Sports Bra, and the Blur Seamless Bralette have all muscled their way into my drawer.

Materials: 78 percent polyester, 22 percent elastane.

Size Range: XXS through XXL.

The Solace Sports Bra, crafted from Powervita fabric (75 percent nylon, 25 percent lycra) is soft, supportive, and airy. The bonded chest band remains flat and secure, even during deep stretches and inversions. This is a great bra for low-impact activities (yoga, barre, and pilates), but I especially reach for this during heated workouts, because it wicks moisture away and dries fast. Not to be overlooked, the crossover straps are so cute. I do wish they were adjustable, though.

Materials: 75 percent nylon, 25 percent lycra.

Size Range: XXS through XL.

Merino wool has many fantastic qualities, but being stretchy and compressive is not necessarily one of them. That's why this racerback sports bra is a remarkable feat—I have many merino wool bras, but none of them retain their shape and offer as much support as this one, although I should note here that I'm a 34A, so in my case, the claims of good support are not being tested as thoroughly as they might with other people.

Branwyn's sports bra is made from a blend of 76 percent merino, 14 percent nylon, and 10 percent elastane. The fabric itself is knit in a seamless, compressive, 4-way knit structure, so there are no seams to rub or chafe. I wear it mostly rock climbing, without a shirt, and it's long enough on my short torso for it to not be totally obvious that I'm only wearing a bra (I think). Moreover, it's BPA-, PFAS- and forever-chemical-free, which I prefer for garments that I wear close to my skin. There are sleeves for removable bra pads, but they're not included, and it's dark and thick enough that I don't worry about anything showing anyway. My only caveat is that since it's heavier than almost any other sports bra I own, it also takes longer to dry, both on the line and on my body. —Adrienne So

Materials: 76 percent extra fine merino wool, 14 percent nylon, and 10 percent elastane

Size Range: XS through XXL

Engineered by an orthopedic surgeon, the Forme Power Bra uses a blend of six tension fabrics and eight double-fabric panels to nudge your shoulders back, lift your chest, and train your upper body into better alignment. I wear it to Pilates. I wear it under my hoodies. I wear it as a top when I'm running errands because it's also cute. Forme claims it helps with recovery and deeper breathing, and while that may sound like wellness speak, I found that wearing this bra for just a few hours made me more aware of my posture.

If you get the Forme Power Bra, stretch out the armholes (Forme suggests 10 to 20 times) before your first wear so it's not too tight around the pits. The brand also sells the Revive Bra for $188, created specifically for those with musculoskeletal disorders or pain in the upper spine or shoulders—we're in the process of testing it ourselves.

Adidas PowerReact Train Medium-Support Bra for $35: The PowerReact crossback is a good sports bra but doesn't necessarily wow. It offers medium support, so it's fine for activities like HIIT, cycling, and other high-impact workouts. The band size does run tight, so I would size up if you have a larger cup size.

Most people don't associate Skullcandy—known for its plasticky skull-and-crossbones aesthetic—with premium audio. Skullcandy admitted as much at a launch event this week in New York City. Since its inception in 2003, it has aimed at (and impressively captured) the wallets of cash-strapped suburban punks across America with low prices, punchy colors, heavy bass, and skulls.

That's why its new $100 noise-canceling headphones are both exciting and ironic—they're made in collaboration with Bose, a company known best as the business-class choice for the parents of Skullcandy kids. The Method 360 ANC offer similar noise canceling to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in a similar design, but with a larger charging case (good for 32 hours of battery life with ANC on) and slightly larger earbuds. It's a “we'll dumb this down for Junior” approach that I'd love to see employed more in affordable products.

In my limited time with the headphones so far, I've been impressed with the noise canceling and audio quality, even with stiff competition from Google, JLab, and others in the sub-$100 space. They have multipoint pairing and a nine-hour battery life with ANC on, which is excellent for a full day of work. The one downside? Putting the buds back in the charging case is a bit of a pain at first—for whatever reason, they snap magnetically into the case upside down. That's not much of a deal-breaker to me, and I look forward to more testing before our upcoming review.

Alongside the Method 360 ANC, available now for $100, the company unveiled several other new audio products at its NYC event set to arrive throughout the year, from the Crusher 540 Active workout headphones to the revived Aviator 900 ANC and open-earbud Push 720 Open. Oh, and Tony Hawk was there—he's the brand ambassador for the new Method 360. —Parker Hall

If you've ever longed to join the Macrodata Refinement team at Lumon Industries, you'll be excited to hear that Atomic Keyboard has unveiled a real-life limited edition Severance keyboard. Called the MDR Dasher, this mechanical keyboard is modeled after the Data General Dasher 200 terminal from the late ‘70s, the same unit that inspired the show's production design team.

There's no Escape, Control, or Option keys—because, well, there is no escape. It's a cold grid of 73 chunky keys with a 70 percent keyboard layout. The bulky, aluminum case is dressed in shades of industrial blue, with an off-white frame that looks like it's been sitting in a forgotten department since the '80s. Instead of a mouse pad, there's a tactile trackball beside a cross-shaped directional pad.

There's no practical need for a keyboard like this in 2025, but it's a cheeky collector's item for fans of the Apple TV+ series. The MDR Dasher will be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux via USB-C. Atomic Keyboard isn't clear on the price yet (it says $399, but the price is crossed off, and it notes that final pricing is to be determined), and there's no release date, but you can sign up for email alerts on its site. —Boutayna Chokrane

This week, Apple says it will begin analyzing user data to improve its artificial intelligence models, a move widely seen as a means for the company to catch up to rivals like OpenAI and Google. Instead of relying on synthetic training models, Apple will use anonymized customer data to check the work of its synthetic data and improve it. The data is aggregated, so Apple isn't collecting emails or texts but instead tracking “trends in real user data” to compare with results from synthetic data. It only applies to users who have opted in to Device Analytics and will roll out in iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and macOS 15.5.

This will upgrade the quality of artificial-intelligence text-generation features like Writing Tools and summarizations, though it's unclear how quickly we'll see improvements. Apple's new-and-improved Siri was supposed to be here by now—a part of the broader Apple Intelligence rollout—but instead we're left with a marginally souped-up Siri that can tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT. That's about it. A few weeks ago, the company delayed the version of Siri it promised last year, one that can understand your personal context. It's now expected to arrive in 2026.

The Lyma Laser Pro has officially launched in the US this week for a cool $5,995. First released in Europe last year, the at-home, FDA-cleared skin-care tool has racked up a wait list of over 16,000 Americans, which the company says translates to more than $100 million in sales.

What does it do? The Laser Pro uses near-infrared cold laser technology to boost collagen production to address wrinkles, cellulite, redness, scarring, hyperpigmentation, and post-surgical recovery. Triple the size and power of the original Lyma Laser, the Pro delivers a continuous 808-nanometer laser beam at 1,450 milliwatts—deep enough to penetrate 10 centimeters into the dermis. Lyma claims visible results in 30 days if you stick to three minutes a day. What's more fascinating is that, unlike LED light therapy, this laser works over sun protection factor (SPF) or makeup without (supposedly) losing efficacy. I'm currently testing it—stay tuned for the full review. —Boutayna Chokrane

A few weeks ago, Verizon announced a three-year price lock for customers, citing rising prices in a challenging economic climate. Now, Comcast is following suit. This week, the company announced a five-year price guarantee if you subscribe to a new Xfinity Internet package, which includes a Wi-Fi router/modem and unlimited data, starting at $55 per month and going up to $105 depending on the plan. That also includes a free Xfinity Mobile line for one year. Comcast claims there's no annual contract, so you're free to cancel it at any time with no penalty.

Like all of these price lock initiatives, there are caveats. It applies only to new residential customers, and you're limited to 400 Mbps internet. You have to enroll in paperless billing and autopay or you'll pay extra, and there could be equipment-installation and other fees. If you downgrade the service, regular rates will apply. The promotion ends June 23.

Beats is getting into the cable business. Announced this week, the Apple-owned brand is launching Beats Cables, including USB-A to USB-C, USB-C to USB-C, and USB-C to Lightning varieties. The reinforced cables come in a 20-cm size in Bolt Black (AKA black) as well as 1.5 meters in signature Beats colors like Surge Stone, Nitro Navy, and Rapid Red (available this summer). The stylish cables provide data transfer at USB 2.0 rates and fast charging at up to 60 watts for the USB-C version, or 15 watts for the USB-A to USB-C cable. They're available now at Beats' site and Apple's site and stores, starting at $19 for a single or $35 for a two-pack. —Ryan Waniata

Are trunked networks ever used in amateur radio or outside of big commercial/government systems? Is there a standardized way to feed back channel info to the SDR frontend for trunked operation in GNU Radio? Eg. The control channel will tell the terminal to tune to traffic channel at X Mhz to receive or send a call, which requires reconfiguring the frontend.

Google has firmly established itself in the market as a top contender in the high-end smartphone market and fights it out with Apple's iPhone and Samsung Galaxy series. In the Pixel 9 Pro, Google goes another step further with a phone that in all aspects (design, functionality, features) gathers for a high-end contender to both its rivals.

Now, thanks to a magical Amazon offer, the Pixel 9 Pro is available at a historical low price—below Black Friday—so it's the perfect time to invest in this top-of-the-line smartphone. Regardless of how much storage space you require, you can have this device for a price that is unbeatable: $799 for the 128GB model (original price: $999), $849 for the 256GB model (original price: $1,099) and $919 for the 512GB model (normal price: $1,219 which marks a 25% discount).

The Pixel 9 Pro is powered by Google's latest Tensor G4 processor which delivers first-rate performance optimized for AI-intensive tasks. The chipset delivers effortless multitasking and app performance and also offers such capabilities as real-time language translation and pro-level photo editing. Paired with 16GB of RAM, it is ready to handle taxing applications super easily.

The Google phone has a stunning 6.3-inch Super Actua OLED screen with 495 PPI of pixel density. It is HDR-compatible with up to 3,000 nits peak brightness measurements and delivers a great deal of visibility even when subjected to direct sunlight. Its refresh rate varies from 1Hz to 120Hz which makes it super smooth at scrolling and optimizes the battery life. Of course, the screen is also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 which makes the device highly scratch and drop-proof.

If you like photography, you will absolutely love the Pixel 9 Pro's three-camera rear camera setup (and the competitions is quite far behind). The setup includes a 50MP wide-angle camera with ƒ/1.68 aperture for stunning detail and clarity, a 48MP ultrawide lens with macro focus for capturing detailed close-ups, and a 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and Super Res Zoom up to 30x. These smartphones arrive loaded with premium features like Night Sight mode for low-light photography and the quite unique Magic Eraser for the removal of unwanted objects from photographs. Even the selfie camera is on par with a 42MP ultra-wide lens which ensures a crisp selfie and can handle high-end video calls.

Battery life is also great on the Pixel 9 Pro: It has a high-capacity 4,700mAh battery and offers over 24 hours of use between charges. For those needing even more life, Extreme Battery Saver mode offers up to an incredible 100 hours of use. The phone charges rapidly (fast-charging to up to 55% in about 30 min) and also fast wireless charging and wireless charging with reverse wireless charging through Battery Share.

At its Amazon record-low price of $799 for the 128GB model, $849 for the 256GB model, and $919 for the 512GB model, the Pixel 9 Pro offers a great value for one of the most advanced smartphones on the market today. Given speculations that prices may double as a result of looming tariff increases in the U.S., you should better act fast.

After Ubisoft tried its hand at a Star Wars game with 2024's Outlaws, EA is back with another single-player game, this time from developer Bit Reactor and produced by Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Entertainment. It's called Star Wars: Zero Company, and if you've been wanting the franchise to deliver a turn-based tactics game, this might be it.

Unlike the recent Jedi games or Star Wars Squadrons, which were set during and after the Original Trilogy, Zero Company is set during the Clone Wars. Thanks to this weekend's Star Wars Celebration panel featuring Bit Reactor, Respawn Entertainment, and Lucasfilm Games, we know even more details of what to expect. In fact, here's a trailer.

“At Lucasfilm Games, we're huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” Douglas Reilly, GM & VP, Lucasfilm Games, said. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we're confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.”

Players will take on the role of Hawks, the customizable leader of Zero Company (meaning, yes, they can look however you want them to look), an elite outfit put together during the Clone Wars to do covert missions. Said team includes a trusty astromech, a Jedi padawan named Telia Tria, an Umbaran sharpshooter named Lucco Bronk, a Clone Trooper named Trick, and a Mandalorian named Klive. [Note: Spellings are not final as we got them from audio.) But, you don't have to use them.

You are also able to create and customize your own team of characters too. So, if you want a full team of just astromech droids, you can do that. Similar to the recent XCOM games from Firaxis—several among that team left to start Bit Reactor—you'll control the squad members and use their various abilities in tactical, grid-based combat. The team's exploits will have them waging a shadow war across the galaxy.

The Clone Wars was picked as the era for the game because, unlike many other eras in Star Wars, it's about a battle between relatively similarly sized forces: the Jedi/Clones and the Separatists. Players will make decisions throughout that have major, at times, permanent consequences and the map is, apparently, the biggest in a Star Wars game to date. There's also a bond system that, depending on which characters you use, will create new branches of the game. No two playthroughs will be alike.

Also of note, the music will be by Gordy Haab, who game fans know from his work on Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. And, yes, there will be cameos.

Star Wars: Zero Company deploys in 2026 on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.

Buying cloud storage might seem like the modern solution for managing your files, but let's be honest—it comes with its own set of challenges. Subscription fees stack up over time, and you're often left wondering about the safety and privacy of your data.

For those who prefer a reliable, one-time investment, nothing beats a physical hard drive at home. As it is, the Seagate Portable 5TB external hard drive is available for just $119 on Amazon, down from $129 just ahead of the tariffs increase. The 4TB model is priced at $99 (down from $124) which makes it also very popular.

See 4TB at Amazon

See 5TB at Amazon

The Seagate 5TB HDD is a high-quality storage solution if you're dealing with large files, whether they're photos, videos, games or critical documents. With a massive 5TB of storage space, this drive can hold up to 700 five-minute 4K videos or over two million average files. It's perfect for backing up priceless family videos or for expanding your gaming library without worrying about running out of space.

Small and portable, the Seagate drive itself is only 4.54 inches in length and 3.15 inches in width which allows it to fit easily into a bag or even a pocket. Weighing in at only 0.56 lbs, it's built to be portable without sacrificing durability. Its slim black profile will make it fit easily into any environment, at home or on the road.

The drive features USB 3.0 connectivity for transfer speeds up to ten times faster than USB 2.0. This provides fast and effective transfer of large files—like high-definition movies or entire collections of games. For compatibility with older systems, the Seagate drive is also backward compatible with USB 2.0 ports at reduced speeds. Its plug-and-play nature simplifies setup: simply plug it in with the included USB cable, and your PC or Mac will recognize it immediately with no software to install.

It is pre-formatted as exFAT and works with Windows and macOS computers right out of the box. This compatibility is great if you work on both operating systems or need an OS-agnostic storage device. Mac users who would like to use Time Machine backups can also reformat the drive to their needs without any issues. Gamers will love this hard drive too as it plugs in flawlessly with Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Whether you're safeguarding memories or expanding your digital library, this is a great deal!

In an update posted to Stampede Entertainment's news blog, the team behind the first Tremors movie followed up last fall's announcement that it has reclaimed the rights to the original script.

Months later, there's some clarification as to what that means for fans of the Tremors franchise: “We've been exploring what this may allow us to do, so here's the update. First, we aren't reading outside ideas. We are discussing a return-to-Perfection sequel, and one or two more outlandish ideas featuring graboids in new settings. Whatever we decide to pitch to Hollywood, it will not be a remake the first movie with a new cast. Nor will it be a version of our original script for Tremors 5.”

The original Tremors spawned several direct-to-video sequels and a TV series, though a second series that would have brought back OG lead Kevin Bacon never made it to the airwaves. Not unlike a Halloween re-quel, a direct movie sequel to Tremors could be in the works with the star.

“We are considering ideas that feature the return of Kevin Bacon as Val, but no promises!” Stampede teased.

The idea makes sense—there's still a lot of love for the Tremors franchise, and Bacon makes everything better. Plus, it's the age of worms in movies thanks to  Dune and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. Why not add a graboid revival in there too?

Would you be excited to see Bacon return in a Tremors movie? Let us know below.

Amid rising tariffs and growing uncertainty in the electronics sector, consumers are bracing themselves for higher costs for flagship phones. As manufacturers and retailers adjust to these changes, Amazon is offering an outstanding deal on Samsung's latest flagship device, the Galaxy S25 Ultra. This deal significant because of the huge discount but it also beats the price on Samsung's official website.

Now marked down to $1,129 on Amazon which is a 14% below its list price of $1,419, the Galaxy S25 Ultra 512GB is officially available for a record low price (previous low was $1,184). For comparison, Samsung's website sells the same model for $1,219, which only serves to highlight Amazon's advantage. We recommend you to act quickly, before tariffs push prices up even higher or supplies run low.

See at Amazon

The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung's innovation flagship and it was released in January 2025. It merges the newest hardware with advanced AI features to deliver a top-of-the-line experience. At its heart is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (the most powerful chip from Qualcomm right now) specially designed for Galaxy phones. The chip offers huge performance improvements including faster processing speeds and better AI capabilities—ideal for multitasking, gaming, and CPU-intensive apps.

We also love Samsung's S25 Ultra stunning display: Its massive 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen offers QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz with the promise of rich colors and silky-smooth graphics for gaming or streaming. The display reaches a brightness of up to 2,600 nits which makes it perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. The display is topped with Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 to avoid scratch and accidental drops.

We also all know that Samsung is one of the best regarding photography. The Galaxy S25 Ultra quad-camera setup includes a 200MP wide-angle lens with optical image stabilization that captures stunningly detailed photos with rich colors and sharp contrasts. There's also a brand-new 50MP ultra-wide sensor which excels at landscape and macro photography, and two telephoto lenses with 5x and 3x optical zoom allow users to capture clear images of distant objects. The front 12MP camera delivers high-quality selfies and video calls.

Battery life is another area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't disappoint: The big 5,000mAh battery delivers all-day performance despite heavy workloads. Quick wired charging at 45W and wireless charging at 20W offer quick top-ups as and when needed. Reverse wireless charging is also available on this phone which allows you to top up other devices on the go.

On the software side, the Galaxy S25 Ultra runs Android 15 with Samsung's One UI 7 interface. The user-friendly software provides productivity tools like Seamless Actions Across Apps and Now Brief to multitask with ease. Samsung has also assured seven years of OS updates for this device with a commitment to long-term support and security patches.

Our advice: Order one now before tariffs drive prices up (or stocks run out).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Opioid control policies linked to drop in domestic violence","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250418/Opioid-control-policies-linked-to-drop-in-domestic-violence.aspx","Sat, 19 Apr 2025 03:15:00 GMT","

A new study led by the University of South Florida reveals opioid control policies may offer broader public health benefits, including reducing instances of domestic violence. As policymakers continue to grapple with the opioid epidemic, this study highlights the power of research to inform effective public policy.

The research conducted by USF doctoral student Minglu Sun and Andrei Barbos, associate professor of economics, underscores how opioid abuse can cause a powerful ripple effect across society.

Published in Health Economics, the study analyzes the impact on the prevalence of domestic violence in Mandatory Access Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. These opioid control programs require health care providers to consult a centralized database before prescribing opioids, helping prevent patients from obtaining multiple prescriptions from multiple doctors. In the early 2010s, states began passing laws that mandated the use of these databases after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies said they were a key tool to combat misuse of opioids.

The staggered rollout of these programs across the country offered a unique opportunity to analyze their effects over time and across different regions, which allowed us to isolate the effects of these opioid control programs on the prevalence of domestic violence from other factors, such as economic cycles, concurrent policy changes or broader crime trends.""

Andrei Barbos, associate professor of economics, University of South Florida

With data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, they compiled reports from 31 states between 2007 and 2019 to create controlled models for dynamic variables including demographics, income, unemployment, health status, insurance coverage and overlapping regulations, such as legalized marijuana.

Sun and Barbos found that these opioid control programs not only curb misuse but contributed to a 10% reduction in the prevalence of simple assaults, which account for nearly 75% of domestic violence incidents in the data. Simple assaults are generally defined as an attempt to cause physical harm to another person that does not involve a weapon or result in serious injury.

The effect was strongest in states with the highest opioid prescription rates. According to the CDC, southern states consistently exhibit higher rates – reinforcing the connection between opioid access and domestic violence.

""Earlier public health literature documented a correlation between opioid consumption and domestic violence, but correlation does not imply a causal relationship,"" Barbos said. ""This article establishes a causal relationship and provides policy makers with evidence of an additional positive spillover of opioid control policies, which may also be relevant for the policy design surrounding the current fentanyl crisis.""

New research to be presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025, Malaga, Spain, 11-14 May) shows that the internationally recognized body mass index (BMI) cut-off points greatly overestimate overweight and obesity in male athletes. The study, from Italy, also proposes new cut-off points for overweight and obesity in this group.

Body mass index (BMI) is a key method for measuring people's weight status, defining whether they have normal weight, overweight or obesity. It is easily calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres. A BMI of 25 kg/m2 or above is in indicator of overweight and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or above indicates obesity in white men and women of all ages, according to World Health Organisation's (WHO) categorisation system.

However, some research has found that this classification system may not be good at identifying overweight and obesity in athletes and its use in this group has long been subject to criticism.

BMI doesn't distinguish between body fat and lean mass, which includes muscle. As a result, a muscular athlete with low body fat can be wrongly classified as living with overweight or obesity. Despite this, many sports organisations still rely on the traditional BMI classification system.""

Professor Marwan El Ghoch, Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy

In a new study, Professor El Ghoch and researchers from the University of Verona in Italy and Beirut University in Lebanon set out to determine how accurate the BMI cut-offs of 25 and 30 kg/m2 are at identifying overweight and obesity in male athletes and, if they were found to be inaccurate, to establish better cut-offs.

The cross-sectional study involved 622 males (average age of 25.7 years, BMI ≥ 20 kg/m2) who had been referred to the Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, of the University of Verona, Italy, and participated in sports including soccer, rugby, basketball, volleyball, cross-fit, karate and others at a competitive level.

The participants were categorised using the current BMI system and by their body fat percentage (BF%).

Using the current BMI system, more than a quarter of the individuals were categorised as living with overweight or obesity. Some 451 (72.5%) individuals were of normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.99 kg/m²), 148 (23.8%) individuals were with overweight (25 kg/m²-29.9 kg/m²) and 23 (3.7%) were with obesity (30 kg/m² and above).

Total body fat percentage (BF%) was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans – known to be a highly accurate tool for measuring body composition – according to age- and gender-specific cut-off points. A BF% of 21% or above was classified as overweight and a BF% of 26% or above was classified as obesity.

Using this system, fewer than 4% of the individuals were categorised as living with overweight or obesity. Some 598 (96.1%) individuals were of normal weight, 19 (3.1%) were with overweight and 5 (0.8%) were with obesity.

Professor El Ghoch, who led the study, says: ""This demonstrates that the current BMI cut-off points are clearly flawed in determining weight status in athletes, as many of the athletes were misclassified as living with overweight or obesity, where in reality, very few had body fat levels in this range."" 

The researchers went on to use statistical modelling to identify more accurate BMI cut-off points for young male athletes. The new cut-offs, which take into account athletes' lower BF%, are 28.2 kg/m2 for overweight and 33.7 kg/m2 for obesity.

Study co-author, Professor Chiara Milanese, of the University of Verona, explains: ""Although DXA scans measure body composition accurately, they are not always available in sports settings. In contrast, weight and height, the two measures needed to calculate BMI, are easy to obtain and, with the new BMI cut-offs that we identified, BMI could be a highly useful tool in sports clubs, both at training grounds and in competitions.

""A direct assessment of body composition remains the gold standard but, in its absence, we encourage sports organisations and committees to adopt the new BMI classification system.""

The authors add that several further pieces of research are needed. These include identifying new cut-offs for female athletes and, potentially, specific cut-offs for different sports, particularly those were not included in the current study.

The international soccer association FIFA is searching for volunteers to help organize this summer's Club World Cup, which includes several matches held in New Jersey during the month-long tournament.

Volunteers perform a variety of roles during the competition, from assisting teams and officials on game days to supporting the media and welcoming fans to each event. While the positions are unpaid, they provide a unique opportunity to be part of a worldwide initiative and interact with famous soccer players and representatives.

""As a volunteer at a FIFA event, you're at the heart of the team,"" the association said on its website. ""It's a chance to develop skills, make global connections and create unforgettable memories!""

Anyone interested in applying is encouraged to do so by visiting volunteer.fifa.com/invite/FCWC2025. No prior experience is necessary, and applicants can indicate their preferred city on the form.

Volunteers must be 18 years old as of Jan. 1, 2025 and be a United States citizen or permanent resident. They must also speak English (though knowledge of additional languages is a plus); be available for the entire tournament, including pre-event training sessions; and have a positive attitude that includes a passion for soccer.

If selected, volunteers must attend training sessions to prepare for the Club World Cup. The tournament begins Saturday, June 14, and culminates with the final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford Sunday, July 13.

MetLife is one of 12 venues throughout the country selected to host matches during the tournament. The stadium will be the site of five group stage matches in the tournament, one quarterfinal and both semifinals in addition to the final.

The FIFA Club World Cup features 32 club teams representing six continents. This year's participants include European teams like Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid, as well as Major League Soccer clubs Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami.

The Club World Cup was first organized in 2000 and took place annually from 2005 to 2023. Starting with this year, the tournament will be held every four years like the World Cup, which is contested among national teams.

The FIFA World Cup, hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will take place next summer. MetLife Stadium will also be the site of that tournament's final on July 19, 2026.

As is the way the likes of FIFA and UEFA run their respective organizations, the decision to expand the long-running Club World Cup from seven teams to 32 ahead of the 2025 edition of the tournament was one that was clearly financially driven and now it appears that interest in the competition is not as high as they would have hoped.

The summer tournament, which takes place across the United States and is something of a warm-up for the FIFA World Cup that will run in many of the same cities and stadiums, sees the biggest clubs in world football go head to head for the prize.



Fans of the likes of Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester City, among many others, who want to attend the event would do well to check out what Go Sport Travel have to offer ahead of the blockbuster competition, with great deals to be had.

The extended format sees European clubs and their players do battle having had little rest on completion of their domestic and continental campaigns, and this feeling of oversaturation may well have passed on to the club's fans. 

FIFA is so desperate to sell tickets for the Club World Cup that they are attempting to use these as incentives to secure tickets for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with one such example being the guarantee of a ticket to the final of the 2026 tournament, just so long as you buy 20 tickets for this summer's event.



On the move to increase the number of teams and games involved in the Club World Cup, FIFA president Gianni Infantino put his case forward, commenting on the new structure,

“Everyone thinks that the country winning their own national or continental competition is the best in the world,”

“But that's actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.” Infantino added.

This argument is perhaps a sound one, but given just how much bigger the club football season has become, with the likes of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League now adopting larger league phases, there is a sense that not only are players being burned out, so are supporters.



That said, the competition in the US provides fans Stateside to finally get to see their idols live and in person, having thus far had to settle for seeing them on their screens instead. 

So if there is one winner when it comes to the larger FIFA Club World Cup concept, then it's the football-mad fans across North America, who will no doubt turn out in their tens of thousands when the competition kicks off from June 14th. 

A big pull for the competition is obviously seeing Lionel Messi in action, but there are plenty of other superstars involved, with Real Madrid trio Vincius Junior, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo also being hugely popular in the US, not to mention Man City forward Erling Haaland.

President Trump started a trade war that could undermine some of the long-term benefits of one of the biggest sports events in the world. 

An avoidable own-goal.

A day at the soccer pitch should offer a nice distraction from trade wars and tariff talk. Next year's FIFA World Cup, to be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico and the US, will test that theory. Can the US, in particular, stage a successful tournament that attracts fans from around the world? Or will tensions, tariffs and deportations alienate visitors and businesses?

President Donald Trump certainly sees nothing but opportunity ahead for one of the world's biggest sporting events. ""Tension is a good thing,"" he recently said, when asked about the tournament in the Oval Office.

When and where — and by whose efforts — women's soccer first appeared in Mexico is likely never to be identified. But the earliest documented event is the arrival of a women's team from Costa Rica that made a long tour around the country in 1963. 

Their arrival didn't introduce women's soccer to Mexico but it certainly contributed to its growth. Around Mexico, a few enthusiastic young women recruited friends and assembled teams to play the Costa Rican visitors — and carried on playing afterward, which would lead within just a few years to Mexico creating a women's national selection team and even hosting the newly created Women's World Cup — to great success.

How did this happen?

By 1969, there was enough enthusiasm to stage the first Mexican women's championship, a competition involving 17 teams from around Mexico City. At this point, the situation in Mexico was very similar to that of women's soccer in Europe — where a handful of clubs operated under the radar, and usually without any recognition or assistance from the male-dominated associations.

The pockets of enthusiasm in Europe had gained enough traction in the 1960s to form the Federation of Independent European Female Football (FIEFF). In 1969, it organized a World Cup competition for women's soccer. 

Italy, who had led the way in women's soccer in 1968 with a nationwide and semiprofessional women's league, was the natural host, but how Mexico came to be one of the eight invited teams remains a mystery. We do know that they were not on the original list of competing teams and were only included only after Argentina and Brazil dropped out.

The Mexican team played its first game in the city of Bari, beating Austria 9-0 and throwing Alicia Vargas into the spotlight with four goals.

Vargas' story is worth following, as it is typical of so many women players of this generation. She had played soccer with her brothers and neighborhood boys in the street and — without realizing it — became a skilful player. When she was just 13, she saw more organized games involving the Guadalajara club and asked if she could join in. Despite no formal training, the skills she'd picked up on the street made her an instant star. 

In Italy, she became  “La Pelé” Vargas and was offered a contract to stay on to play with the Real Torino team, but she chose to return to Mexico.

During a two-day conference after the Cup in Torino, Mexico's representatives agreed to host the next tournament. The Federation of Mexican Football, however, opposed the idea and threatened fines on any club that granted women access to their stadiums. 

The organizers got around this by hiring the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City and the Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara. Both stadiums were privately owned and therefore beyond the control of the Federation. 

This had an unforeseen impact on the event. Both stadiums were owned by media outlets wanting a successful tournament. Their backing meant there would be no lack of advertising or media coverage. In addition, the Italian Martini & Rossi company covered the cost of hotels, flights and equipment for the Mexico event.

Planners invited Argentina, Denmark, England, France and Italy to join Mexico in the tournament. Team members arriving in Mexico City found the city swamped with posters and banners for the event. Central to the advertising campaign was Xóchitl, the tournament's mascot, a dark-haired little girl with pigtails who wore a red, white and green uniform jersey and short shorts.

Back then, even though several of the players on many of the teams, Mexico's included, were minors as young as 13, organizers were not shy about using the team's gender and sexuality to fill stadiums. The goal posts were painted pink. In between playing and attending a press interview, the players were encouraged to use the beauty salon situated inside the locker rooms. 

“Soccer,” the New York Times reported at the time, “goes sexy south of the border.”

While this grates with today's attitudes, organizers argued that the makeup and glamour wasn't just to encourage men into the stadiums but also to show young women that sports could be feminine and cool. 

The advertising paid off. Helped by live TV coverage, matches averaged crowds of 15,000, and Mexico's games in the Aztec Stadium probably — there were no official figures — attracted 100,000 fans. For the competitors, used to playing on local park pitches, it was an unbelievable experience.

Off the pitch, they were superstars, with crowds gathering outside their hotel and mobbing the team coaches. The fans included a few lovesick young boys with bunches of flowers! 

The Mexicans had been training for two months and were well prepared. They won both their group games and then beat Italy to make the final. The standard of play was “okay.” The Mexican team had good basic ball control, and there was a willingness to run with the ball. However, the games lacked pace, and defenders often needed an extra touch to control the ball, allowing them to get robbed close to their own penalty area.

Overall, as to be expected, there was also a lack of power compared to the men's game, and goal kicks usually landed well short of the halfway line.

Mexico had done well in making the final, but not all was well behind the scenes. With the tournament drawing in considerable revenue, the Mexican team asked for the creation of a bonus fund that would be split between them. Disputes over this distracted the team in the days before the final game.

Even so, the Danes were the outstanding team of the tournament, and it is doubtful that the squabble in the Mexican camp had any real impact on the result. In the end, Denmark's 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen scored a hat trick to guide her team to the title. 

A stunning 110,000 spectators packed the Estadio Azteca for that game, and coach Harry Batt felt a corner had been turned. 

Footage from the Mexico vs. Denmark final in 1971 in Mexico City, in which Denmark's 15-year-old Susanne Augustesen took her team to victory against Mexico.

“I am certain,” he told the press on his return to England, “that in the future, there will be full-time professional ladies' teams in this country.”

His team returned home with their suitcases so full of souvenirs that some worried about getting through customs. However, they left the fervor of 100,000-spectator crowds only to return to a wall of indifference back home. One player, invited to join her heroes Newcastle United at a club dinner, sat through a comedian whose main act was to ridicule women's football. The young players who returned to school were not acknowledged in assembly. 

And not just male authorities were indifferent: An official Women's Football Association had just been formed, and although it had declined to send a team to Mexico, the association's officials were furious at Harry Batt for what they saw as going behind their backs. Batt found himself blacklisted by the Women's Football Association. 

It was not only the English authorities cold-shouldered their team returning from Mexico. A couple of years later, the Danish Football Association (DBU) took over the running of women's football in Denmark and launched an official national team. Games were few and far between, and they never called up Augustesen for an official international, even though she had become one of the great stars of the Italian professional league. 

It was much the same story for the Mexican team. The press and cameras departed, and those who carried on playing did so on dusty second-rate pitches, relying on volunteers to keep the teams going. Internationally, there were a few more competitions, the mundialitos, but they were minor events, usually staged in Italy over the duration of a week for six invited teams. Mexico participated in the 1986 event but struggled in a tournament that nobody suggested had world championship status.

Memories of the 1971 World Cup faded, and the tournament had little impact on the later development of women's football. That revolution was driven by events in the United States. In 1975, Pele joined the New York Cosmos, and soccer suddenly became the most popular sport for children in the U.S. It didn't require the expensive equipment of baseball or American football, or carry the dangers of the latter.

Americans knew nothing about soccer, including the fact that only boys were supposed to play, and so a generation of American girls grew up playing soccer in mixed games. By the time an official Women's World Cup started in 1991, U.S. women's soccer was the world superpower, doing better than its male counterparts, winning two of the first three tournaments and attracting a 94,000 crowd for the 1999 final in Pasadena. 

The men who controlled the game slowly came to realize that soccer was a business — and in what business plan did it make sense to deliberately exclude half of the world's population? With FIFA's blessing, women's soccer has gone from strength to strength.

Mexico has been somewhat left behind by the modern growth of the women's sport, although that gap is closing. Today, the Mexican women's professional league is in its ninth season, with wide television coverage and sponsorships allowing players to earn a reasonable monthly wage — about the same as a well-paid teacher in a private school. 

Attendance hovers around 3,000, good compared to other women's leagues around the world but dwarfed by the crowds watching men's games. While Amelia Valverde Villalobos has done well at C.F. Monterrey, and Mónica Vergara has coached the national team, the coaching positions with the big female teams remain stubbornly filled by men. 

The Mexican national team ‘El Tri Femenil' has not become the regional power in the way that the men's team has been for generations. They have not qualified for the World Cup since 2015, and after a disappointing performance in the 2022 CONCACAF championship, the team will miss the next round of big international tournaments.

As women's soccer around the world moves slowly but steadily towards equality, the girls of 1971 are finally gaining some recognition. A movie about the Mexican World Cup, “Copa 71,” premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. Yet, the battle for equality is ongoing. 

A documentary produced by Venus and Serena Williams, “Copa '71” tells the story of the 1971 Mexico City Women's World Cup via interviews with many of the participants.

As late as 2016, Barcelona FC was slammed online for sending its men's and women's teams to the same tournament, giving the male players business-class tickets while the women's team flew economy. 

However, the fact that this was recognized as an injustice perhaps shows how far we have progressed.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup promises to be one of the biggest tournaments in football history. From the expanded format to the decision to host matches across multiple countries, all eyes of the footballing world will be on who will lift the Jules Rimet trophy.

The race to qualify for the World Cup is well and truly on, and despite the tournament being well over a year away, some countries have already booked their place on the plane to North America.

The USA, Mexico and Canada will share the honours of hosting games when the tournament comes around. As teams begin to set their sights on the tournament, attentions will turn towards the draw and who they will be facing. Below is everything you need to know about the 2026 World Cup draw, including details on when and where it will take place and on how to watch it.

The Athletic reported in April that FIFA are now in advanced talks with venues around the US city of Las Vegas to host the draw for the World Cup. When the USA were last awarded the right to be tournament hosts back in 1994, it was the Las Vegas Convention Center that saw Dick Clark present the draw in what was almost like a gameshow. Robin Williams helped former FIFA president Sepp Blatter with the draw, while then president Bill Clinton also appeared via a video link.

President Trump's alleged travel ban could have some serious consequences for next summer's tournament.

It is believed FIFA has identified Las Vegas as its preferred location, while it is also said to be the preference of several host city executives. Back in January, it was revealed that Monterrey (Mexico) and Vancouver (Canada) had been suggested as potential places for the draw to take place, but FIFA confirmed that it would be held in the USA - 75% of the games across the World Cup will be held Stateside, across 11 of the 16 total host cities.

In terms of venues being considered, the 17,000-seater MGM Grand Garden Arena is an option, while The Sphere and the T-Mobile Arena are also among the sites that could host the draw.

While an official date is yet to be confirmed as of April 2025, it is believed the 2026 World Cup draw will take place in December. The four winners of the UEFA play-offs, and the two winners of the inter-confederation play-off tournament, will not be known at the time of the draw as those matches are only scheduled to occur a few months later in March 2026.

The World Cup is now just over a year away, so here's what you need to know about buying tickets for the tournament.

For the draw, the 48 teams who will be a part of the tournament will be divided into four separate pots based on the FIFA World Rankings at the time in around November/December later this year.

Pot 1 will contain all three of the co-hosts and the nine best-ranked teams, then pots 2 and 3 will hold twelve teams each respectively - again, based on their rankings. Pot 4, however, will be determined by the six lowest-ranked teams left, and then the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the four UEFA play-off winners.

Though no official details have been confirmed as of yet as to where the World Cup draw will be made available to watch, it is likely to be streamed on FIFA's official website. The draw for the World Cup qualifying was open to viewers around the world via a live stream back in December 13 2024, so that is likely to be the case again for the main proper.

For the 2022 World Cup, for those living in the UK, the main draw was streamed live on FIFA's official website as well as being broadcasted on TV on BBC One. Again, it is likely to be made available to watch on terrestrial TV.

The President of the United States of America has already made a significant impact since coming into office, and appears to have quite the positive relationship with FIFA president Gianni Infantino. And, while Donald Trump isn't going to be personally intervening in the World Cup, it does appear that the draw itself could be impacted by the President.

The Athletic have claimed that FIFA have discussed holding the event in Washington D.C instead of Las Vegas if it makes it easier for Trump to participate more extensively in it. It's added that ""some of those at FIFA have also noted President Trump's repeated references to the World Cup since he returned to the White House, with him regularly praising his FIFA counterpart, Gianni Infantino, who visited the Oval Office earlier this year and attended one of Trump's pre-inauguration rallies.""

Reports have added that FIFA has held internal talks of bringing the World Cup draw closer to Trump, even if it means hosting it in a much more slimmed-down fashion, while the White House itself being a location has been floated as an idea.

Lionel Messi has cast uncertainty over his potential participation in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, emphasizing that his physical condition will determine whether he represents Argentina in the tournament co-hosted by the USA, Canada, and Mexico.

The Inter Miami star, who turns 39 during the competition, acknowledged the challenges of a packed schedule and his age but left the door open for a record sixth World Cup appearance.

Injury concerns and cautious optimismMessi's recent seasons have been marred by recurring injuries, including a muscle issue that sidelined him during Argentina's March qualifiers. Despite his absence, La Albiceleste secured World Cup qualification with dominant wins over Uruguay and Brazil. 

The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted he “doesn't want to set that goal” yet, prioritizing day-by-day assessments of his fitness. “I'll take it day by day and see how I feel physically above all else,” Messi told Simplemente Fútbol. “Last year, I missed games due to injuries, but this pre-season has been good, and I feel strong”

Club World Cup as a litmus testMessi is expected to lead Inter Miami at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in June, a tournament he views as critical to gauging his readiness for international duty. The event could serve as a proving ground for his ability to endure a grueling schedule, which includes MLS matches and international commitments.

Argentina's readiness with or without MessiWhile fans hope for a fairytale send-off, Argentina has demonstrated it can thrive without its captain. The team's 4-1 thrashing of Brazil in March showcased depth, with Julián Álvarez, Enzo Fernández, and Alexis Mac Allister stepping up. 

Coach Lionel Scaloni has urged patience, stating Messi will decide “whenever he wants” and dismissing speculation as premature. “We need to leave him alone. He'll decide when he's ready,” Scaloni said.

Legacy and historical stakesIf Messi competes in 2026, he would become the first player to feature in six World Cups, cementing his status as one of football's greatest ambassadors. However, his focus remains on maintaining peak performance. “I'll be honest with myself. If I'm not 100%, I won't go,” he implied.

As the countdown to 2026 continues, Messi's decision will hinge on his body's resilience—a balancing act between legacy and longevity that only he can navigate.

The Gunners were briefly level in the tie after Mariona Caldentey's penalty, but goals from Kadidiatou Diani and Melchie Dumornay gave OL the win

Arsenal will need to beat Lyon in France next week if they are to reach a first Women's Champions League final since they triumphed in the 2007 edition of the competition, after falling to a 2-1 defeat at home. The Gunners were by no means poor in the first leg of this semi-final and they had plenty of chances to get a positive result - they just didn't take them. Instead, clinical finishes from Kadidiatou Diani and Melchie Dumornay fired the eight-time European champions to victory in London, despite Mariona Caldentey briefly equalising from the spot.

It took Lyon just 17 minutes to break the deadlock, though they should've done so earlier when former Arsenal star Danielle van de Donk somehow missed from inside the six-yard box. It wouldn't come back to bite her, though, as Diani arrowed a shot beyond Manuela Zinsberger to put the visitors in a good position in the early stages. The Gunners had a whole host of opportunities to change the result, however, with Frida Maanum also guilty of a big miss and Alessia Russo watching a header crash off the bar, after Dumornay had hit the woodwork from range at the other end.

Despite more chances for Caitlin Foord, Beth Mead and Russo, it wasn't until 12 minutes from time that there was another goal and it was a controversial one. There were confusion, and no real appeals, when the referee was instructed by the VAR team to take another look at Lyon goalkeeper Christiane Endler making contact with Leah Williamson in the box, resulting in an Arsenal penalty that Caldentey coolly converted.

However, there was still time for Lyon to retake the lead, with an incisive team move finished off by Dumornay late on to give the French champions the advantage heading into their home leg next week.

Every ranking point counts for those players hoping to earn a main draw place in Paris.ByFlorian HeerPublished Apr 19, 2025 copy_link

The VII Open Comunidad de Madrid, hosted by the Club de Campo Villa de Madrid, proved to be the final opportunity for many players to earn crucial ATP Ranking points ahead of the Roland Garros entry deadline. For Kamil Majchrzak and Pablo Carreño Busta, it was more than just a tournament — it was an important moment in their respective careers. Both players clinched direct entry into the main draw of the second Grand Slam of the season, thanks to their performances in the Spanish capital.The weeks leading up to a major are always critical for players hovering around the cut-off ranking line. Out of the 128 available spots in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, 104 are reserved for the highest-ranked players, leaving just 24 remaining places for the thousands of other professionals competing for a chance to qualify. Each Ranking point earned can mean the difference between a direct spot in the main draw and having to go through the grind of qualifying - or missing out altogether. That sense of urgency was palpable in Madrid, where players competed not only for a title but also for their place in Paris.Read more: Borna Coric: Players on the ATP Challenger Tour are hungrier!

For Poland's Kamil Majchrzak, the title in Madrid was a powerful comeback statement. The 28-year-old returned to the winner's circle after a turbulent period in his career. In late 2022, Majchrzak accepted a 13-month ban from professional tennis after admitting to a doping offence. He tested positive for multiple banned substances in an out-of-competition test and later explained that the contamination was unintentional. His cooperation with the authorities helped reduce the suspension, and since his return to the tour, Majchrzak has worked steadily to rebuild both his ranking and reputation.His effort was rewarded in Madrid, where he defeated 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic in a hard-fought final, winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. The 100 ATP Ranking points he gained propelled him 11 places up the rankings to World No. 91, securing direct qualification for Roland Garros. The title marked Majchrzak's eighth ATP Challenger career trophy and a significant personal milestone on his road back to the top. In February 2022, he was ranked inside the Top 75 in the world.“There were many players fighting for French Open spots. I am incredibly proud of my team as well as of myself. It was a very difficult and demanding week for me. It feels amazing,” Majchrzak stated after the championship match.

Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta, meanwhile, is on a comeback journey of his own. The former World No. 10 has endured a complicated two-year stretch marked by persistent injuries, most notably a serious issue with his right elbow that kept him out of competition for extended periods. The recovery process has been slow and frustrating, but the Asturias native is now gradually finding his rhythm again.Despite falling in the quarterfinals in Madrid - coincidentally to Majchrzak - the 14 points he earned were enough to lift him four spots in the ATP Rankings to World No. 99. That climb was just enough to push the 33-year-old from Gijón over the Roland Garros cut-off line, ensuring his place in the main draw without needing a wildcard or qualifying.“The level on the Challenger Tour is very high in general, but it's probably even more competitive during the weeks ahead of Roland Garros,” said Carreno Busta, who has returned to the Top 100 for the first time since August 2023.Several other players also made gains following the tournament on the banks of the river Manzanares. Alexander Shevchenko rose two positions to No. 104, while Cilic's runner-up finish gave him 50 points and a boost of six spots to No. 111. France's Valentin Royer (No. 115, +1), Russia's Pavel Kotov (No. 121, +3), Lithuania's Vilius Gaubas (No. 144, +5), and Spain's Carlos Taberner (No. 145, +1) also improved their positions.Read more: Marin Cilic is embracing the challengeThe Open Comunidad de Madrid once again highlighted the critical role of the ATP Challenger Tour in shaping careers.

Carlos Alcaraz and Arthur Fils will be going head-to-head for the second time in their careers and for the second time in the last two weeks when they meet again in the semifinals of the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell on Saturday.They just faced each other for the first time in the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, where Alcaraz prevailed 4-6, 7-5, 6-3. Fils could see the finish line of a straight-set victory when Alcaraz served at 5-5, 0-40 in the second set, but the Spaniard simply refused to lose and not only won that match but also went on to lift the trophy.That means there has been a lot of tennis in a short amount of time for Alcaraz. On the bright side, he has conserved energy with a routine path through the Barcelona bracket–much unlike the case in Monte-Carlo. The would No. 2 did not drop a set in his first three matches against Ethan Quinn, Laslo Djere, and Alex de Minaur.Fils has bounced back from his heartbreaker against Alcaraz last Friday by maintaining his fine form in Barca. The 20-year-old Frenchman erased Pablo Carreno Busta and Pedro Martinez in straight sets before getting a first-set retirement from Stefanos Tsitsipas. Up to 14th in the rankings, Fils has reached at least the quarterfinals of four consecutive tournaments–including three Masters 1000s.The underdog is on fire and also well rested, so an upset would not come as a massive surprise. And although Alcaraz is motivated to succeed in front of the home crowd, this is not exactly Roland Garros. He has bigger fish to fry coming up.Pick: Fils in 3    131WWW: Alcaraz vs. Fils?

Ben Shelton laid down a clay-court statement on Saturday at the BMW Open by Bitpanda, where he notched a slice of American history.

The 22-year-old dug deep for a 2-6, 7-6(7), 6-4 victory over Francisco Cerundolo to seal his spot in the final at the newly-upgraded ATP 500 event. Shelton trailed an early break in the deciding set, but conjured an inspired response to become the first American man to reach a clay final above ATP 250 level since Andre Agassi won the 2002 ATP Masters 1000 in Rome.

“It's a big win for me,” said Shelton, who improved to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Cerundolo. “To get a win on clay against a guy like that gives me a lot of confidence, and to be in an [ATP] 500 final over here in Europe, I'm really happy. I've been playing well here, I love the energy here in Munich and I'm going to go for that title tomorrow.”

With his two-hour, seven-minute victory, Shelton is into his fourth ATP Tour final, and second on clay after triumphing in Houston last year. The two-time tour-level champion arrived in Munich off back-to-back defeats in Miami and Monte-Carlo after reaching the semi-finals in Indian Wells, but is now up two spots to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just one off his career high.

“I'm just competing and enjoying myself, that's one thing that was lacking in Monte-Carlo last week,” said Shelton, who is now 14-12 on clay. “Not everything is straightforward and perfect on the clay. You're going to get broken more, but you can also break more. Dealing with adversity and adapting makes a great clay-court player and I'm trying to learn day by day.”



Cerundolo raced out of the blocks in a watertight opening set, during which he won 100 per cent (10/10) of first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Yet Shelton, who saved three match points in his first-round clash with Borna Gojo on Monday, rallied with intent. The American twice came within two points of losing the match in a dramatic second-set tie-break, but held his nerve to convert his fourth set point.

Shelton bided his time in the deciding set, capitalising on an error-strewn 10th game to earn a meeting with top seed Alexander Zverev or Fabian Marozsan in Sunday's final.

Roger Federer was part of several unforgettable matches throughout his career, both as a winner and a loser.

Federer has been named the most elegant player ever by Juan Martin del Potro, with the former having retired from the sport in 2022.

Swiss legend Federer called time on his career with 20 Grand Slam titles, with that tally behind only Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal.

Still playing on the ATP Tour, Djokovic has 24 such wins to his name, with Nadal having retired last season on 22.

Another legend in Andre Agassi said Federer was the best player he played against, with the latter having added 11 Grand Slam runner-up finishes to his 20 wins.

Surprisingly, his glittering career included just one triumph at the French Open, which Federer won in 2009.

He beat Swede Robin Soderling 6–1, 7–6(7–1), 6–4 at Roland Garros, a tournament that was dominated by one of his fierce rivals Nadal.

And speaking after the success on the clay court, the Swiss icon said: “It was probably my greatest victory, I was under big pressure. I did it and it's phenomenal.

“It was great to be on the podium as a winner for a change. Andre said it was my destiny to win this and that I deserved it.”

As was the case for many players at the French Open, coming out on top was hugely difficult given the dominance of Nadal.

The King of Clay won a stunning 14 titles at Roland Garros, with Bjorn Borg coming closest to challenging that figure with six.

But despite being the top seed in 2009, Nadal suffered a shock defeat in the fourth round, losing to an inspired Soderling.

The 23rd seed enjoyed a stunning run all the way to the final, but didn't have enough in the tank to pull off one more shock against Federer.

Soderling was, however, gracious in defeat, saying after the match: “Roger was too good for me today, he played much better.

“He is a worthy winner and for me he is the best player in history. He gave me a lesson in how to play tennis.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Every ranking point counts for those players hoping to earn a main draw place in Paris.ByFlorian HeerPublished Apr 19, 2025 copy_link

The VII Open Comunidad de Madrid, hosted by the Club de Campo Villa de Madrid, proved to be the final opportunity for many players to earn crucial ATP Ranking points ahead of the Roland Garros entry deadline. For Kamil Majchrzak and Pablo Carreño Busta, it was more than just a tournament — it was an important moment in their respective careers. Both players clinched direct entry into the main draw of the second Grand Slam of the season, thanks to their performances in the Spanish capital.The weeks leading up to a major are always critical for players hovering around the cut-off ranking line. Out of the 128 available spots in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, 104 are reserved for the highest-ranked players, leaving just 24 remaining places for the thousands of other professionals competing for a chance to qualify. Each Ranking point earned can mean the difference between a direct spot in the main draw and having to go through the grind of qualifying - or missing out altogether. That sense of urgency was palpable in Madrid, where players competed not only for a title but also for their place in Paris.Read more: Borna Coric: Players on the ATP Challenger Tour are hungrier!

For Poland's Kamil Majchrzak, the title in Madrid was a powerful comeback statement. The 28-year-old returned to the winner's circle after a turbulent period in his career. In late 2022, Majchrzak accepted a 13-month ban from professional tennis after admitting to a doping offence. He tested positive for multiple banned substances in an out-of-competition test and later explained that the contamination was unintentional. His cooperation with the authorities helped reduce the suspension, and since his return to the tour, Majchrzak has worked steadily to rebuild both his ranking and reputation.His effort was rewarded in Madrid, where he defeated 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic in a hard-fought final, winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. The 100 ATP Ranking points he gained propelled him 11 places up the rankings to World No. 91, securing direct qualification for Roland Garros. The title marked Majchrzak's eighth ATP Challenger career trophy and a significant personal milestone on his road back to the top. In February 2022, he was ranked inside the Top 75 in the world.“There were many players fighting for French Open spots. I am incredibly proud of my team as well as of myself. It was a very difficult and demanding week for me. It feels amazing,” Majchrzak stated after the championship match.

Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta, meanwhile, is on a comeback journey of his own. The former World No. 10 has endured a complicated two-year stretch marked by persistent injuries, most notably a serious issue with his right elbow that kept him out of competition for extended periods. The recovery process has been slow and frustrating, but the Asturias native is now gradually finding his rhythm again.Despite falling in the quarterfinals in Madrid - coincidentally to Majchrzak - the 14 points he earned were enough to lift him four spots in the ATP Rankings to World No. 99. That climb was just enough to push the 33-year-old from Gijón over the Roland Garros cut-off line, ensuring his place in the main draw without needing a wildcard or qualifying.“The level on the Challenger Tour is very high in general, but it's probably even more competitive during the weeks ahead of Roland Garros,” said Carreno Busta, who has returned to the Top 100 for the first time since August 2023.Several other players also made gains following the tournament on the banks of the river Manzanares. Alexander Shevchenko rose two positions to No. 104, while Cilic's runner-up finish gave him 50 points and a boost of six spots to No. 111. France's Valentin Royer (No. 115, +1), Russia's Pavel Kotov (No. 121, +3), Lithuania's Vilius Gaubas (No. 144, +5), and Spain's Carlos Taberner (No. 145, +1) also improved their positions.Read more: Marin Cilic is embracing the challengeThe Open Comunidad de Madrid once again highlighted the critical role of the ATP Challenger Tour in shaping careers.

Rafael Nadal will be honored on the first day of the French Open this year, which promises to be a significant and poignant event in tennis history. For the man who created his legend on the red clay of Paris, the tribute will follow the day's matches on May 25 at Court Philippe Chatrier. This is the court where he has achieved his highest ceiling as a tennis player.

After retiring last November, Nadal left behind a legacy at Roland Garros that few dared deny. His name is inscribed into the fabric of the French Open, with 14 titles and an almost flawless 112-4 career record. More than a ceremony, his farewell will be a time of reverence for the best clay court player ever.

Though Rafael Nadal won 22 Grand Slam trophies over a fantastic 23-year run, Roland Garros defines his legend first. Paris was his domain from his teenage debut in 2005 and his first title when he stormed onto the scene. Astonishingly, he has collected 13 more Coupe des Mousquetaires since then, a record that may never be broken.

Nadal's last title at Roland Garros came in 2022 when he beat Casper Ruud to win his 14th French crown. His victory at the age of 36 attested to his persistent tenacity and unswerving determination. His skill on the clay never faltered until the very last, even if injuries became a problem. Nadal was given a difficult first-round draw in 2024, his last tournament appearance, and he fell to Alexander Zverev—a defeat that marked only his fourth career.

A ceremony celebrating Rafael Nadal's extraordinary accomplishments will be organised on May 25, says the French Tennis Federation (FFT). It will take place at Philippe Chatrier, a stadium he transformed into his own coliseum. This honour came after a prior permanent act from 2021. That year brought the unveiling of the Nadal statue outside the Philippe Chatrier court, marking his long-lasting influence on the event.

This time, the emotional depth is stronger. Though his 112-4 record is surreal, it is not only about the titles or numbers but also about the atmosphere he brought to Paris every spring. Ritualistic, dramatic, artistically rich, and emotionally raw, observing Nadal storm onto the clay was a scene. He made matches into experiences and rivalries into witnesses to mastery.

Even though Rafael Nadal's days of seeking Grand Slams are gone, his link to Roland Garros persists. Signaling that his link with the French Open will endure, FFT President Gilles Moretton has announced the Spanish intention to assume an ambassadorial position for the competition. Not only is his resume, but also his sportsmanship, humility, and influence on younger people, a perfect fit for the job.

In the Olympics, Nadal won singles gold in Beijing 2008 and doubles gold in Rio 2016, distinguishing himself from Spain. On the same surface, he bowed out in the second singles round to Novak Djokovic last year and got knocked out in doubles with Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals at last year's Olympic event. Though those games represented a changing of the guard, the 38-year-old remained quite prominent. His heritage shaped even his successors' path.

At Roland Garros, Rafael Nadal's homage will be about honoring trophies and celebrating excellence, determination, and passion for the sport. Though the Parisian clay courts could stage many thousands of matches in the next years, no one else will possess them the way Nadal did. As his competitive trip ends, the French Open stops to pay tribute to the guy who made it mesmerizing.

Aussie tennis Alex de Minaur has once again fallen to Carlos Alcaraz in his fourth-straight defeat to the Spaniard as his fiancee Katie Boulter embarks on her second clay campaign. De Minaur reached the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open, where he faced Spaniard and No.2 Alcaraz.

Unfortunately, de Minaur struggled to overcome the higher-ranked opponent having succumbed to the 21-year-old in a hard-fought 7-5 6-3 defeat. De Minaur looked strong in the first set as he broke to take a 3-1 lead. He then broke again after Alcaraz had broken back.

Although the Aussie wasn't able to stop the Spaniard winning four of the last five games to claim the first set. And Alcaraz took his game to the next level in the second to continue his winning record over the Aussie.

De Minaur has now lost all four matches to Alcaraz in their career battles as he still seeks a major victory over the likes of Jannik Sinner and Alcaraz. While de Minaur will be disappointed not to have reached the semi-final, he still gained 200 points. This has seen him leapfrog Caper Ruud, Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev on the live rankings and he will remain as World No.7 off the back of his Monte Carlo efforts last week.

This puts him in good stead ahead of Roland Garros, where a higher ranking will see him avoid the likes of Alcaraz, Sinner and Novak Djokovic until late into the tournament. Alcaraz has now won eight matches in a row after winning Monte Carlo.

""I started quite badly with the serve, I was struggling a little bit mentally with [it],"" said Alcaraz. ""It was just the first few games with my serve, then I think I improved a lot. I calmed myself down and started to think positively again. Alex started strong, playing aggressively, and the first set was really tight.""

Despite the setback, de Minaur has shown huge improvements on clay across the last two years. His bigger forehand and tenacious defence holds him in a good position to make another deep run at Roland Garros in 2025. And only for the second time his partner Boulter will also be in Paris for the main card of the French Open.

In exciting news for Boulter she will take part in the Madrid Open after securing entry into Roland Garros for just the second time in her career. Boulter will enter due to her ranking, but the British star hasn't always enjoyed her time on clay.

Boulter was knocked out in the first round of the French Open last year in her first ever match at Roland Garros. However, she has since moved to improve her clay court form. Most recently she helped lead Great Britain into the BJK Cup finals on clay.

The top women's star helped GB score a 2-1 victory over Germany in the first tie, before she won the deciding doubles rubber in the second tie to beat Netherlands 2-1. Boulter posted she had arrived in Madrid ahead of the WTA event, which will give her another chance to push herself on clay in a new challenge for the British star.

(Reuters) -World number one Jannik Sinner may take time to hit his stride on his return from a three-month doping ban next month but will be in top form when he heads to the French Open, Italy's Davis Cup captain Filippo Volandri said. 

Sinner has not played since winning the Australian Open at the start of the season. He accepted a ban in February following a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had challenged a tribunal's decision to clear him after two positive tests. 

The 23-year-old's ban will end on May 4 and he will make a return at the Rome Masters that begins three days later. His national team captain believes Sinner will hit top gear, though,  only in time for the year's second Grand Slam, which starts on May 25. 

""His physical preparation is focused on Roland Garros. It's a gruelling event with long, best-of-five-set matches,"" Volandri told Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport earlier this week.

""I'm convinced the preparation he's had over the past three months will be beneficial in the long run. He has not been able to complete a proper winter pre-season in recent years and this break allows him to recharge for the next two to three seasons.""

Sinner, who was cleared to return to training from April 13, ramped up his preparations this week with a stint in Monte Carlo, and also practised with Indian Wells champion Jack Draper of Britain at the Tennis Club de Beaulieu in France. 

Volandri, who guided Italy to Davis Cup glory in the last two years, said he had spoken to Sinner's coach Simone Vagnozzi and had no doubt about the player's mindset before his comeback in Rome. 

""He told me Jannik is extremely motivated, fully focused on upcoming tournaments and mentally calm,"" Volandri said. 

""Let's not forget nothing replaces match adrenaline and that's why I don't expect a winning streak right away ... But the more matches he plays, the closer he'll get to his ideal form for Paris.""

American tennis sensation Jessica Pegula is on fire and ready to conquer the tennis world, with the unwavering support of retired tennis star Lindsay Davenport. Pegula, who reached the US Open final last year only to narrowly miss out on the title, has been climbing the ranks and making a name for herself on the court.

Currently sitting at an impressive third place in the WTA rankings, Pegula has left behind big names like Coco Gauff as she continues her winning streak. With two titles already under her belt this season and a spot in the quarterfinals at the Stuttgart Open, Pegula's star is undoubtedly on the rise.

Lindsay Davenport, a former World No.1, has expressed her confidence in Pegula's abilities, highlighting her clean shots and strategic gameplay. Davenport commended Pegula's perseverance and growth, especially after her strong performance in Miami and Charleston.

Davenport shared her belief in Pegula's potential, stating, “There is no reason why you cannot win Wimbledon or the US Open.” Encouraged by Pegula's skill set and determination, Davenport sees a bright future ahead for the rising tennis star.

Pegula's recent victory over Sofia Kenin in Charleston, where she clinched her first clay court title despite being down in the second set, showcases her resilience and competitive spirit. With an impressive record of 25 wins this year and counting, Pegula is proving to be a formidable force in the tennis world.

As Pegula continues to make waves on the court, all eyes are on her journey towards potential Grand Slam victories and solidifying her status as a top contender in the world of tennis.

Following the ATP and WTA tours can serve as both a geography lesson and an exercise in time zone calculations, for tennis fans and players alike.While each week might leave bleary-eyed tennis fans to wonder if their fave's 4:00 a.m. start time is worth setting an alarm for, the pros have to navigate changing time zones too. Part of the job means constant globe-trotting and always being ready to perform at their peak on the court, or to serve face at a promotional event off of it—and do it all while staying fresh week after week.“And now with a baby, it's much harder,” new mom Belinda Bencic, a winner in Abu Dhabi, told me. “She's going to be up all night and everything, no matter what time.“But also, I think we tennis players are just so used to it by now.

Frances Tiafoe, a fan of the Washington Wizards, says there are pros and cons to losing sleep during this part of the red-clay season.“I go to Europe every year and that's usually around NBA Playoffs time. So for me, I struggle with jet lag to get on the proper time, but then also it's like… You wake up at 3 a.m. and don't really mind it because you can just put the game on,” Tiafoe tells me with a grin.“In my mind I'm just like, 'Oh well, I can watch hoops for five hours!' But then, I can't see at two o'clock. It just takes longer for me.”🥗 Stay one step aheadThe protocol for beating jet lag is to always stay one step ahead:“Basically, as fast as possible, you have to kind of pretend you're already in the time zone that you're going to,” Bencic explained. “So even on the plane, you should try to sleep and try to eat at the time zone that you're going into.“The quickest way to adapt is to kind of shock yourself on the first day. Just try to stay awake or go straight to sleep.”Or, as Tiafoe puts it: “For a couple days, just tell yourself you're not tired, even though you're dying.”

When asked her go-to way to fend off jet lag, Doha winner Amanda Anisimova had a straightforward strategy: “Take melatonin for the first few nights!”Melatonin supplements can help regulate sleep and help the body adjust to a new time zone quicker—but it's not a magic fix. Timing is everything, as research shows melatonin only works if taken at the right time, around 30 minutes before the desired bedtime.In fact, it can do more harm than good when it's not, which Stefanos Tsitsipas found out the hard way at the 2023 French Open. After crashing out to Carlos Alcaraz following a sluggish straight-sets performance, the Greek said: “One thing that I'm going to try to avoid in the future is to (not) have melatonin pills and naps before matches, because it clearly doesn't seem to be working.”Risks can even go beyond a poor match or a lethargic morning, as a bad batch of melatonin threatened to derail Iga Swiatek's career last year. The five-time Grand Slam winner tested positive for low levels of a prohibited substance called trimetazidine, a contamination that was eventually traced back to the supplements she took ""for jet lag and sleep issues.”

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can McLaren carry their strong Friday form into Qualifying – and who are their main threats in Jeddah?

McLaren's Ella Lloyd thrived under intense pressure from the more experienced Maya Weug to secure her first win in F1 ACADEMY, taking Race 1 victory around the Jeddah Corniche Circuit.

The British driver had the advantage of starting on the front row of the grid, where she got the better of her Rodin Motorsport teammate Emma Felbermayr at Turn 1 to storm into the lead.

From there, she managed the race calmly over the opening stages, charging away from battles behind her to build a solid lead over her rivals. Felbermayr continued to drop back, losing P2 to Red Bull Racing's Alisha Palmowski before Weug broke into the top three.

Just as series leader Doriane Pin was getting stuck into a fight for P6 with Tina Hausmann, disaster struck for Williams driver Lia Block, who had started in last place on the grid after she crashed out of Qualifying.

She was tagged from behind by Courtney Crone, bringing out the Safety Car and forcing Chloe Chong into a retirement as she sustained damage after trying to avoid the collision.

Lloyd controlled the restart well but the gap to Weug, who had taken P2 from Palmowski, rapidly closed down as Race 1 approached its end. The two took part in a thrilling drag race on the final lap, but the Briton managed to stave off the Ferrari driver and cross the line 0.176s ahead.

Palmowski similarly held off Pin for the final podium spot as Alba Larsen took P5 over Aston Martin's Tina Hausmann. Chloe Chambers, polesitter for Race 2, finished in P7, leaving Nina Gademan to take the final point of Race 1.

Chambers will be hoping to convert her maiden pole position to victory when Race 2 kicks off at 15:05 local time on Sunday (UTC+3).

Aston Martin boss Cowell brushes off Verstappen future talk in Jeddah

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can McLaren carry their strong Friday form into Qualifying – and who are their main threats in Jeddah?

George Russell believes that the deciding factor in this weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will be about “getting the most out of the tyres” as Mercedes look to challenge pacesetters McLaren.

Russell finished sixth in Free Practice 1 before slipping back to seventh in the second session on Friday, held in the cooler, more relevant conditions that Qualifying and the race will take place.

Drivers' Championship leader Lando Norris finished fastest in FP2, just over a tenth faster than McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri, with the pair having generally dominated this season so far.

But while the papaya cars were expected to disappear into the distance last time out in Bahrain, tyre degradation meant the battle at the front remained close with Russell suggesting a similar situation could arise in Jeddah.

Russell is pushing to close the gap to McLaren

“It always comes down to the same, which is getting the most out of the tyres,” he said.

“I think we tried some things, me and Kimi [Antonelli] did some different things which was valuable to try and learn. I think we got a bit of a direction from that.

“I was intrigued to see the long-run pace but unfortunately with the red flag [after Yuki Tsunoda's crash] at the end we didn't manage to see that. I think it'll be a close battle again for the next best team and hopefully we can try and sneak up there, but McLaren are very good again.”

Mercedes team mate Kimi Antonelli had several moments on Friday which included taking to the run-off areas and even clouting the wall on the exit of the last corner, albeit carrying on with no damage.

The young Italian finished 13th and 11th respectively as he got to grips with the high-speed circuit but believes there were encouraging signs to take from the opening day of practice.

“Quite a tricky day, obviously it's about trying to find every detail because it's not an easy track and it's really important to place the car very well, especially in sector one, but overall I think was quite positive,” he said.

“I think FP2 was looking pretty good, I was feeling good, especially on the medium and on the soft I did a mistake on lap one and obviously the tyre didn't hold on as they could have. But overall I think a positive day and looking forward to tomorrow.”

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can McLaren carry their strong Friday form into Qualifying – and who are their main threats in Jeddah?

Lando Norris ended the third and final practice session of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix weekend fastest of all, leading his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri by 0.024s while George Russell was best of the rest in third.

Free Practice 3 took place in hot 30 degree conditions as the sun began to set over the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, with the final opportunity to make set-up tweaks getting under way at 1630 local time.

PRACTICE DEBRIEF: Can McLaren carry their strong Friday form into Qualifying – and who are their main threats in Jeddah?

While the majority of the field opted to remain in the garages during the early stages of the session, Gabriel Bortoleto hit the track immediately, attempting to make up time after a fuel leak in his Kick Sauber had forced him to miss the more representative FP2.

Jack Doohan was the first driver to complete a lap on the Pirelli soft tyres, with the Haas pairing of Esteban Ocon and Ollie Bearman also choosing to burn a set early, as Aston Martin sent out Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll to bed in some medium rubber.

With 10 minutes gone, Lewis Hamilton headed out to discover if overnight improvements had transformed his prospects after struggling on Friday. Although his initial effort fell short of Bearman's then-target time by 0.115s, it put him half-a-tenth clear of Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc – who had a near miss with the wall at the final corner in a moment of wild oversteer.

As the track grew ever more busy, the times tumbled with Piastri and Norris leading the way before Max Verstappen usurped the duo by 0.045s.

Setting up an intriguing Qualifying session, drivers were finding time on their second timed efforts on the soft tyres following one or two cooldown laps. This process also highlighted how traffic could be an issue later on Saturday, with Isack Hadjar one driver caught out by a slower driver when on a timed effort.

Cautious of the threat of yellow or red flags, drivers were sent out onto the track for their second runs on fresh soft tyres with 17 minutes remaining. George Russell revealed Mercedes' hand with a 1m 28.214s to move briefly to the top, before Piastri bettered this by 0.701s with a 1m 27.513s, an effort that Norris fell 0.158s short of.

Hamilton's Saudi Arabian struggles continued in final practice

But in the closing stages, Norris found time and reversed these positions, with his session-best 1m 27.489s clear of Piastri by 0.024s. Having found an extra tenth, Russell improved to third while Verstappen benefitted from a tow to go fourth, although 0.845s off the pace.

Hamilton's struggles continued in the second runs as he ended the session four tenths and seven places behind fifth placed Leclerc. In 12th, Hamilton's gloomy Friday feeling that he was simply trying to reach the top 10 and make Q3 looked like an ever-increasingly difficult task.

Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz continued a strong weekend for Williams in sixth and seventh, while Pierre Gasly backed up his FP1-topping pace by again featuring in the top 10.

Yuki Tsunoda bounced back from his FP2 crash to go ninth fastest, 1.181s off Norris but inside 0.3s of team mate Verstappen.

With the final practice session of the weekend now complete, the drivers and teams will have a final chance to debrief before returning to action for Qualifying at 2000 local time.

Katz began his career representing James Brown and went on to handle major artists, industry executives and organizations. 


													By
												

	Melinda Newman



Powerhouse attorney Joel Katz, who at one point seemingly represented most of the top executives in the music industry, died today (April 18), peacefully in his Atlanta home, with his wife Rikki by his side. Katz, who was named Billboard‘s 2017 Lawyer of the Year, was 80.


	As the founding chairman of the global entertainment and media practice at Greenberg Traurig, Katz was a major kingmaker, not just serving as an attorney, but often placing executives in high-level positions while he looked at the music industry like a giant chessboard. During Grammy Week, Katz held court in a front booth at the restaurant at the Four Seasons in Los Angeles, rolling over client meeting after client meeting. He was also well-connected in political circles, easily able to get politicians, including former senator Orrin Hatch, on the phone. He also worked with foreign governments, including the African country of Gabon, to establish a music school. 


	“Joel was an original, one of a kind,” says attorney John Branca, who worked with Katz on the Michael Jackson estate. “Like a character from a novel, he was warm and empathetic with genuine concern for others. He was an effective advocate who could sell snow to an Eskimo. We miss him.” 




			Trending on Billboard		







	In addition to executives, he represented artists over the decades, including Willie Nelson, Jimmy Buffett, Tim McGraw, George Strait, Faith Hill, Ludacris and Justin Timberlake, as well as industry organizations, including the Recording Academy and Country Music Association, often negotiating landmark television deals that set the standard for future pacts.


	“Over the course of my 17-year tenure at the Academy, there were many, many areas and situations in which Joel played a part but perhaps one of the most significant was the [2016] renegotiation of the [CBS] network agreement for the broadcast of the Grammy Awards telecast,” says former Recording Academy chairman/CEO Neil Portnow. “The amount of time, thought, and strategic planning involved as one might imagine were massive and with Joel's help, we were able to conclude the most lucrative and longest contract in the history of the academy at the time, and one that actually set the bar for other awards and similar properties to emulate.  At the time, that deal gave the Academy the security and certainty for the decade to follow and in hindsight, was a transformative milestone…He truly loved the academy, all that it stood for, and as a builder and architect of growth and development by nature, provided many ideas, insights, and guidance in order to assist the organization in achieving goals and aspirations to that end.” 


	Current Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason similarly cites Katz's tremendous contributions. “Joel was one of one and was instrumental in the Recording Academy securing the media rights deals that allow us to contribute to and impact the music community in profound ways,” Mason said in a statement to Billboard. “He was also a trusted and loved adviser to previous academy leaders and an influential person in music for decades. We send our condolences to his family and loved ones – he will be missed.” Katz was outside general counsel for the Recording Academy until the end of 2023. 


	In 2024, the Recording Academy presented Katz with its Trustees Award, which is given to non-performing individuals who have made significant contributions to the recording industry.  


	“We are saddened to learn of the passing of Joel Katz. Joel represented CMA for many years and was tireless in his efforts to expand the reach of our television specials,” added CMA CEO Sarah Trahern. “I first met Joel while working on Farm Aid with Willie Nelson in the mid 90s, and I quickly came to admire Joel's drive and deep passion for this industry. I never visit the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills without thinking of Joel holding court at his table—hour after hour of meetings, always in motion. He was straight out of Central Casting, in the best way. My heart goes out to Rikki and the entire Katz family during this difficult time.”


	The ebullient Katz often played an outsized role in his clients' professional and personal lives, including officiating the wedding of  longtime client Jason Owen, CEO of The Sandbox, to his husband, Sam Easley, in 2017. 


	“The architect is gone, but the blueprint he left behind—of boldness and belief in his clients —will shape this industry forever,” says Owen, whom Katz began representing in 2002. “Joel was my friend, my champion, and a once-in-a-lifetime force. He believed in me before I believed in myself. I will miss his laugh, his wit and his ability to bill me back for 15-minute conversations. I loved him like family and will miss him every single day.”


	The Atlanta-based Katz grew up in the Bronx, but headed south to attend the University of Tennessee Law School in Knoxville on a scholarship while working nights at a Holiday Inn. (The law library at UT now bears his name.)


	The first deal Katz negotiation was in 1971 for his client James Brown. In a 2019 interview with Billboard, Katz said the biggest thing he learned from Brown was “patience. He was very patient. He was one of the smartest people I ever met. He wasn't educated; he had a doctorate of street-ology.”


	For a short time, Katz operated his own record label through CBS (which became Sony). Among the signings to Kat Family Records were Bertie Higgins, whose “Key Largo” was a major hit in 1982 and has become a yacht rock staple, as well as Major Lance, who released 1983's The Major's Back through the imprint.


	Deb Dugan, who was ousted as head of the Recording Academy in 2020 after a short tenure, accused Katz of sexually harassing her in a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Katz soundly denied the allegations.


	Shortly thereafter, he left  Greenberg Traurig. “We were saddened to learn of the passing of our long-time colleague, Joel Katz, and his legacy will be remembered. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time,”  Bobby Rosenbloum,  chairman of Greenberg Traurig's Global Entertainment & Media Practice, told Billboard. 


	Katz then joined Barnes & Thornburg in 2021, taking with him such clients as then-Universal Music Group Nashville head Mike Dungan and then-Sony Music Nashville chief Randy Goodman. He is listed as “retired” on the firm's website.


	“It was an honor and a privilege for us to work along side Joel in the final years of his career,” says Barnes & Thornburg partner Jason Karlov, who is chair of the firm's entertainment, media and sports practice group.  “For as long as I can remember he was the consummate counselor, partner, mentor and friend.”


	Katz was also a major philanthropist, donating much of his time to the City of Hope and T.J. Martell Foundation, where he served as a board member and then chairman of the board. At the University of Georgia campus at Kennesaw State University, Katz endowed and began a commercial music program with more than 500 students. As he advised younger attorneys in Billboard, “Don't do everything you do for money. Give back to the organizations that are good. Help people do things. It will make you a better lawyer, it will make you a better person, and you will rise in the community of this business.”


	In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters. A funeral will be forthcoming.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Gosh, it's been a long time since the season one finale of Ahsoka — one year and seven months. But two teases came out of the Ahsoka panel tonight at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo about season 2, which is going into production next week. First, Hayden Christensen is coming back as Anakin Skywalker — that makes all the sense in the world. Anakin is the Jedi Master of Ahsoka, and the duo have a very complex relationship. But in more news, Game of Thrones‘ actor Rory McCann is stepping in to play evil Jedi Baylan Skol after the death of Ray Stevenson. 


	Also, Admiral Ackbar is returning — and that's not a trap. “He's going head-to-head with Thrawn,” promised Ahsoka creator Dave Filoni.

	“It took all of my effort to resist writing the line — ‘It's a trap!' Because I'm like, I can't do that, that would be so lame. Because this guy can't always get into traps. You'd think he would see it this time,” joked Filoni.  




			Watch on Deadline		







	Stevenson died in May 2023 before season one of Ahsoka debuted. He played a key nefarious antagonist who locks horns with Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka. Dawson worked with McCann 20 years ago in Oliver Stone's Alexander. She concurred with Filoni that when it came to filling in Stevenson's shoes, it boiled down to an actor and their eyes. McCann possessed that intensity.


	Filoni got emotional when remembering Stevenson. 


	“Season 2 was predictably a big challenge because of losing Ray,” said Filoni. 


	“I knew Ray from working on voice acting with him,” he said, “It was a challenge for me to consider continuing for a while. But I have a wonderful support group in Jon (Favreau) and Rosario (Dawson)”. 


	Favreau, Dawson and Christensen were also on stage today in Tokyo with Filoni.   


	“I found a way in — I had Ray in my head. I'm grateful for all my conversations with him about Baylan. So, I understood what to do, it just took a while to get there. I'm very confident now that Ray would be happy with the direction that we've chosen,” added Filoni who made the decision in concert with the late actor's family. 


	“The character is meant to be the parallel to Ahsoka in every way. If there's a light, there's a dark, and Baylan is representing a different journey for a Jedi as you (Rosario) represent one who walked away from the (Jedi) order, so did he. That's a parallel that must continue,” said Filoni.   

	











	McCann's credits are numerous including Gladiator II, Hot Fuzz, Jumanji: The Next Level as well as 39 episodes of HBO's Game of Thrones as Sandor ‘The Hound' Clegane. 


	The last we left off in October 2023 with the Ahsoka season one finale, Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) made the jump to hyperspace via a space loop while Ahsoka (Rosario Dawson), Sabine (Natasha Liu) and Ezra (Eman Esfandi) were marooned in the green tundra tumbleweeds of Peridea in a galaxy far, far away. Thrawn's m.o. is to reassemble the Empire aka “The Thrawn campaign,” which was a series of military and political maneuvers by the blue man to restore the Empire and implode the New Republic. 


	Filoini has been a fan of Thrawn since author Timothy Zahn introduced him in the post Return of the Jedi novel Heir to the Empire. “He is the iconic villain. Thrawn doesn't have the force, but holds his own against everybody.”


	Dawson said that she hasn't read all the scripts for season 2, and that's because Filoni “keeps re-writing them.”

	The truth is still out there, and with any luck, Agent Dana Scully could be back on the case.


Ryan Coogler recently gave an update on his upcoming reboot of The X Files, which he revealed is “immediately next” for him, noting that he's “spoken to the great Gillian Anderson” about the series.


	“She's incredible. Fingers crossed there,” said Coogler on Last Podcast on the Left. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I've been excited about that for a long time, and I'm fired up to get back to it. Some of those episodes, if we do our jobs right, will be really f—ing scary,” he teased, adding: “We're gonna try to make something really great, bro, and really be something for the real X Files fans, and maybe find some new ones.”

	











	Following news of Coogler's reimagining, Anderson said she “cannot think of a better way around for a reboot to happen,” calling the filmmaker “a bit of a genius.”


	“Whether I am involved in it is a whole other thing,” she added. “I'm not saying no. I think he's really cool and I think if he did it, it would probably be done incredibly well. And maybe I'll pop in for a little something something.”


	Originally running for nine seasons from 1993 to 2002, The X Files starred Anderson and David Duchovny as FBI Special Agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder, who are tasked with investigating cases of the paranormal.


	In addition to the feature adaptations, The X Files (1998) and The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008), the show was brought back for a two-season revival from 2016 to 2018.


	Last year, OG series creator Chris Carter revealed that Coogler is “going to remount The X Files with a diverse cast” amid the Black Panther director's five-year exclusive deal with Disney Television through his Proximity Media banner.


	“So, he's got his work cut out for him because we covered so much territory,” said Carter on the On the Coast podcast, acknowledging that a modern update in which the characters investigate the paranormal would look different as “we're steeped in conspiracies” today.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:deadline.com","‘Minecraft Movie' Still Hitting Gold With $45M Third Weekend, ‘Sinners' Singing $40M+ & ‘A' CinemaScore: Warner Bros Easter Box Office Double Feature","https://deadline.com/2025/04/box-office-sinners-a-minecraft-movie-1236371775/","Sat, 19 Apr 2025 15:26:00 GMT","


					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


SATURDAY AM: Warner Bros‘ didn't have a Good Friday, they had a Great Friday with Ryan Coogler's Michael B. Jordan starring Sinners winning the day with $19.2M and A Minecraft Movie‘s third Friday banking $16M. Penciled out, the Legendary co-production A Minecraft Movie will win the weekend at $45M while Sinners will leg out like a horror movie with $40M, the 11th best opening ever over an Easter frame. The entire weekend for all film is expected to hit $134M, which is 104% ahead of the same frame a year ago (a non-Easter one), and only -2% behind the Easter 2024 weekend. 


	For what we had been hearing about Sinners in the $30M range before a few days ago, this is a solid start for an original movie in period horror, which is a tricky genre at the box office (Focus Features pulled it off with Nosferatu over Christmas with a $21.6M 3-day, $40.8M 5-day). A $40M start for an original movie in a post-strike-streaming-Covid era is to be commended. It cannot be denied that with Coogler, Warner Bros Motion Picture motion picture co-chiefs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy made an excellent movie. Look at these exits: Solid ‘A' CinemaScore, 5 stars PostTrak, 92% positive, and a massive 84% definite recommend. Men and women over 25 respectively gave the 2 hour and 17 minute running film 93% positive. High scores among diverse groups with Black moviegoers turning out at a huge 49% giving the pic 95%, Caucasians at 27% grading it 91%, Hispanic and Latino at 14% (90%) and Asian at 6% an 86% grade.  The under 18 crowd who made it into Sinners gave the movie an A+.     

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	We'll get into the economics on Sinners in a bit. 


	After seeing the movie a week ago, I questioned whether a prestige film such as Sinners with its awards patina (great cinematography, production design and acting all around) with its horror bent was better suited for the fall coupled with a TIFF world premiere, a populist festival for moviegoers. We don't often think of horror pairing with bunnies, peeps, lilies and chocolate. However, a tracking source pushed back, reminding me about the power of Easter weekend, that this was clearly the better date in its access to audiences to launch Sinners versus anytime in September or October. In addition, it was wise that Warners went with A Minecraft Movie in the first weekend of April versus Easter weekend. How's that? Had A Minecraft movie launched this weekend, it would run into Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* two weeks from now. In the case of Sinners, the movie is counterprogramming to the MCU title in its R-rated sensibility. 

	











	Imax, PLF and select 70MM are pulling in 47% of the weekend gross for Sinners with strong plays in the East, South and West. Currently, AMC Lincoln Square in NYC is the top grossing multiplex with $114K. 


	 more…


UPDATE, FRIDAY MIDDAY: Warner Bros' Easter double feature weekend is currently shaping up with Ryan Coogler's Sinners winning Good Friday over A Minecraft Movie, $18 million to $16.5 million, but the Mojang movie looks to overtake the R-rated Michael B. Jordan movie, $44M–$40M, for its third No. 1 weekend win. Both projections could go higher as the weekend continues, per sources. Some see Minecraft potentially hitting $50M; Minecraft is playing at 4,032 theaters, while Sinners is at 3,308 sites.


	It's the second time that Warner Bros has led the Easter weekend box office in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots following The Curse of La Llorona ($26.3M) and Shazam (third weekend of $16.4M) going 1-2 in 2019. Last night's turnout by Black moviegoers at 46% indicates good walk-up business for Sinners, especially after the excellent word of mouth, and we're hearing a high Imax share as well. Sinners is the first release shot with Imax film cameras since Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, and the last until next year's The Odyssey.


	Coogler leaned heavily into Imax in the promotion of the film with a viral video breaking down aspect ratios; Imax premieres in NYC, Mexico City and London; and inviting tastemaker friends Lebron James, Adele, Jay-Z, The Weeknd and Snoop Dogg to screen the film at Imax's Playa Vista headquarters. Exclusively in Imax auditoriums, sequences in the film visually expand to fill the screen, allowing moviegoers to experience more picture with detail and clarity.

	Social media reach on Sinners was pretty big at 222.5 million per RelishMix across X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Facebook. That's higher than the social media universe before the release of comps Us (123M), Nope (179.8M) and Candyman (144.3M, $22M opening). Jordan and co-star Hailee Steinfeld are socially activated with 24M followers apiece. Among the positive reaction online, RelishMix noticed that fans loved how the trailer didn't give everything away, and they love how Coogler and Jordan are a combo much like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.

	Elsewhere this weekend, third will go to Angel Studios' second weekend of The King of Kings at 3,535 theaters, with $6M today and $17M in its second weekend. That will take its running cume before Easter Monday to an estimated $45M.


	In fourth is 20th Century Studios' The Amateur with $8M in its second weekend, -46%, after a near $3M Friday at 3,400 sites. Its 10-day total would stand at $28M.


	Fifth is A24's Warfare at 2,670 locations seeing $1.4M today, $4M (-50%) for its second weekend and a running total by Sunday of $16M. The movie will easily eclipse the domestic run of the 2008 Iraq War bomb-squad unit movie The Hurt Locker at $17M stateside, which you'll remember won the 2009 Oscar for Best Picture.


PREVIOUSLY, FRIDAY AM: Warner Bros' $90 million+ period vampire movie Sinners chalked up $4.7 million in Thursday night previews that began yesterday at 3 p.m. Out of the gate with preview-night audiences, Sinners gets 5 stars on PostTrak with 80% definite recommend, an excellent exit that could bode well for over-indexing, knock on wood. Rotten Tomatoes is also high on the Ryan Coogler-Michael B. Jordan reteam, with reviews at 97% certified fresh and exits at that level as well.

	











	The diversity demos last night were 46% Black, 30% Caucasian, 15% Latino and Hispanic and 5% Asian. 


Sinners in its preview take is under that of genre comps like 2022's Nope ($6.4M Thursday night, $44.3M opening) and 2019's Us ($7.4M, $71.1M).


	The miracles of Good Friday at the box office, with 72% of K-12 schools and a close to a third of colleges on break, were already in effect last night, with Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie shooting up in its daily take by 21% over Wednesday with $6.5M, sending the Jared Hess movie past the three-century mark at the domestic box office with $303.3M.

Jeff Bridges has shared that he'd be up for making a sequel to The Big Lebowski – which brought him one of the most beloved roles of his career. 


	Bridges, who played “The Dude” in the 1998 Cohen Brothers thriller, spoke to the audience after a screening of the original film at the Orpheum Theatre in LA. 


The Daily Mail newspaper reports that Bridges was asked about the prospect of returning to the role that helped make him a star, and replied that he and original co-star Julianne Moore were of the same mind:

	“Of course. Julianne and I would fantasize about that. We did another movie together, Seventh Son, she played a witch in that movie. And we would often say, ‘Gee it's all set up for a sequel.'”

	He added, though, he thought the prospect of the Coens wanting to return to the subject matter was unlikely: 


	“I don't think the brothers are going to do that. I don't think that's their style. But I must say, they surprise us all the time… If they called me up and said, ‘Hey let's do it again,' I'd say, ‘Absolutely, come on.'”


	The beloved thriller follows the life of Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski, slacker and enthusiastic bowler, who is assaulted as a result of mistaken identify. Besides Bridges and Moore, the original cast included John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, David Thewlis, Peter Stormare, Jon Polito, and Ben Gazzara.


	The original film made a relatively small box office of $46.7million on its release, but has become an enduring fan favorite, with its eccentric characters, unique dialogue and memorable soundtrack. 


The Daily Mail reports that Bridges, who won a Best Actor Oscar for his role in Crazy Heart (2010), previously called The Big Lebowski “one of my favourite movies I've ever been involved in.”

Pedro Pascal is teasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps, in which he plays the role of Reed Richards, Mister Fantastic.


	Although the Marvel superhero has elastic abilities, it's his intellect that Pascal is focused on in playing the character.


	“With Reed, his body may stretch, but this is a brain character,” the actor said in an interview with ComicBook. “I guess I'll just give it completely away. I thought of the brilliance of an octopus. Not in any literal physical translated way, but I put it into my subconscious. Yeah. That's the biggest character secret reveal that I've given to you.”

	











	Pascal also compared the differences in physical demands between his Fantastic Four character and Din Djarin in The Mandalorian.

	“You know, with Din Djarin, there's so much physical authorship that is a collective effort, with my work, Brendan Wayne's work, Latif Crowder's work, other bodies that have stepped into the armor, but primarily, those two guys and myself,” he said. “With Reed, that, for me, was a brand new kind of experience to author something that is very, very familiar to the world, has previous authorship, a very specific understanding of the pages of the comics, and different evolutions and stuff like that. And then something that is so independent in its identity as far as our version is concerned. To me, you know, his body may stretch, but this is a brain character, and it's really his mind that was the most important to me.”


The Fantastic Four: First Steps opens in theaters on July 25 and it also stars Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ralph Ineson, Julia Garner, Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, Natasha Lyonne, Sarah Niles, and more.

Dr. Oz was forced to jump into medical mode during a visit to the White House on April 18, 2025 when his granddaughter suddenly fainted, per a TMZ report.

The outlet, which has video footage of the reality star's bravery, says Dr. Oz and his family members were listening to a speech in the Oval Office when chaos ensued because Daphne Oz's daughter, Philomena Bijou, lost consciousness.

A post shared by D A P H N E  O Z (@daphneoz)

Bijou survived the incident. The press was ordered out of the room immediately after the panic started. The speech was halted as family members huddled around the child. The eleven-year-old was able to stand and left the room with her mother. Daphne Oz, who formerly hosted the cooking show “The Chew,” initially alerted everyone to the emergency by exclaiming, “Phil fainted!”

“A minor family member fainted during Dr. Oz's swearing in ceremony in the Oval Office. We are happy to say she is okay,” CBS says the White House explained in an official statement.

Dr. Oz has four children with wife Lisa. People says the pair met through a mutual connection to medicine, as their fathers were both surgeons. 

Four of the couple's grandchildren belong to their daughter, Daphne Oz, and her husband, John Jovanic. 

In a May 2024 Instagram post, Dr. Oz announced the birth of his newest grandchild, a boy named Ozzie who was welcomed by his youngest daughter, Zoe.

A post shared by Dr. Oz (@dr_oz)

In March 2025, the physician shared a Facebook update on the growing boy, marveling at the baby's impressive mane. “Fun week with the grandkids. Ozzie is full of personality to go with all that hair!” he captioned the post.

Parade says Dr. Oz's exact net worth isn't known, but is estimated to be between $100 and $315 million.

Writer/director Ryan Coogler understands that, just as every language has words that are untranslatable or very hard to express any other way, there are things that cinema can say like nothing else.

Such was the case with a sequence from the earliest drafts of “Sinners.” Coogler wrote what he initially referred to as the “surreal montage.” It was a musical sequence set in the film's fictional rural Mississippi juke joint, where a live performance by young bluesman Sammie (Miles Caton) conjures the spirit of Black musicians past and present, ranging from West African drumming to hip hop.

 










Only cinema — its specific combination of movement, composition, color, choreography, music, rhythm, on top of speech, writing, and expression — can really pull off the connection across time and space that Coogler intended for audiences to feel in that moment: a reflection of how important Mississippi blues had been to the history of music, and the ripple effect it's had throughout multiple generations and cultures.

As Coogler explained when he was a guest on IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, if audiences were down for vampires to show up and take chunks out of people's jugulars, there's no reason why he couldn't use film language to weave different strands of Black music history together and create a sense of immorality that wasn't vampire-related.

“[It's about] that feeling of being at a live performance of any art,” said Coogler of creating the scene. “When you see a virtuoso perform, and you're in the presence of a group of people who also appreciate the art form, but also know the context of it and know where the artist is coming from, they relate to what's being portrayed, and the feeling of euphoria becomes like a storm system. It's feedback happening and rippling. I've had a few of those moments [in my life], and you feel immortal, like you are outside of space and time for [a moment], like there's another presence there with you.”

At each step of the sharing the script — first with his Proximity producing partners Zinzi Coogler and Sev Ohanian, then the “Sinners” team at Warner Bros. — the response was overwhelmingly positive. “ It was a scene that all of my department heads were the most excited about,” Coogler said. But it was the director's long-time composing partner, Ludwig Göransson, who made him think he might be onto something special.

 










“[Ludwig] is a relatively even-keeled guy,” said Coogler. “And he was so excited about this, I hadn't seen him that excited about something maybe ever. So that was kind of when I knew that I had something.”

Göransson was the first of many of Coogler's filmmaking collaborators who couldn't wait to get their hands on the scene. “I read the script and I was just blown away,” cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw told IndieWire. “The visuals just jumped off the page, and I could already see in my head how layered and textured the light would be for the scenes that [Coogler] wrote.” 

The filmmaking team had a single shooting day to capture the oner where Caton's performance of “I Lied to You” summons both his musical ancestors and descendants to come, and Durald Arkapaw and her team using the 80-pound IMAX camera on a steadicam, which winds its way around the juke in two sections — although when the camera reveals that the juke joint is on fire, that was stitched in by VFX from a separate plate shot of the burning roof. 

“It was a beautiful scene that Ryan wrote, and it had many layers to it,” Durald Arkapaw said. Those layers required extensive planning, previs, and rehearsals to nail down, but the sequence demonstrates one of the reasons that Durald Arkapaw and Coogler were drawn to IMAX for “Sinners.” 

 










“The IMAX frame is so different because your eye needs to be able to scan the image, whereas traditional films allow you to see the image without moving your eyes across the screen,” Durald Arkapaw said. That scanning process allows the importance of connections across musicians from different times to build and build, as the surreal montage unfolds and the camera swirls like the turning of a magic cauldron. 

“[The surreal montage] grew to something bigger when we shot it. Everyone was very inspired by it 'cause it had so much meaning,” Durald Arkapaw said. “It's all departments working together on a very high level. All of these cultures woven together.”

Göransson told IndieWire that part of the magic of the surreal montage came from the immediacy of live performance. 

“It took months of prep before shooting the scene, every department working together, mapping it out. And then I had a rough video of the take, and I wrote music to that video. We went back on the stage, and we had one day of shooting this,” Göransson told IndieWire. “You had little pieces of musical histories coming at you, depending on where the camera is, and it was all happening live the moment we created it.” 

Wunmi Mosaku, who plays Annie, told IndieWire that for as intricately planned as the sequence was, there were moments that were just beautiful to witness. “I really remember a moment with Papa Toto and Miles just talking in between takes,” Mosaku told IndieWire. “What Papa Toto was saying to Miles was almost a transcript of what Delta Slim [Delroy Lindo] says to Sammie, and that's an ancestor and the future ancestor and these two people, in sharing ancestors in the present moment onscreen and off the screen… That's a moment I really treasure — when you know that you're in the right place at the right time doing the right thing and everything just makes sense.” 

 










It was Göransson's charge to make that community of once and future ancestors all sound coherent. The cue for the montage, appropriately titled “Magic What We Do,” and based on his collaboration with ​​Grammy-winning songwriter Raphael Saadiq on “I Lied to You,” needed to create solos for each style of music and connective tissue that strings them together with Caton's vocals. 

Göransson did some of this by turning to original instruments, from an original 1932 Dobro Cyclops slide guitar to the original drum machine beat that became the beginning of hip-hop. But a key part of how Göransson connected the musical pieces was through the mix itself. “We could really play with the [Dolby] Atmos of music panning around you. It was also very much using modern technologies,” Göransson said. 

The genius of the surreal montage is the way in which all of that technology and craft is used to express something ineffable about the blues, about the characters in the film, and about how we use stories to relate to history.

“You're watching a movie through the most beautiful of lenses, and then when you step into the IMAX world, it almost feels like a look behind the curtain and into the soul of the character. This pulls you deeper in, and it becomes an experience,” Durald Arkapaw said.  

 










“Sinners” is now playing in theaters. Marcus Jones contributed reporting.

The breadth and depth of music on television were on full display on April 15 at IndieWire and Disney's Pass the Remote panel, where some of the best composers and music supervisors in the business gathered in front of a packed theater at Vidiots Foundation in Los Angeles to discuss their work.

Music supervisors Tiffany Anders (“Good American Family”) and Jen Ross (“English Teacher”) joined composers the Newton Brothers (“Daredevil: Born Again“), Siddhartha Khosla (“Only Murders in the Building,” “Paradise”), Ariel Marx (“Dying for Sex”), and Michael Paraskevas (“Agatha All Along“) for a lively panel on the pleasures and challenges of creating great soundtracks.

 








Related Stories Join IndieWire and Disney for ‘Sly Lives!' Screening and Panel with Questlove in Attendance May 3 Kingpin Steps Out of the Shadows in Blood-Soaked ‘Daredevil: Born Again' Finale 

One common thread throughout the discussion was the impulse to use music as an expression of character. For Anders, the needle drops on “Good American Family” — which include everything from 1970s ballads like “Sometimes When We Touch” and “Romeo's Tune” to later radio hits from Jimmy Eats World, Meat Loaf, and Miley Cyrus — were carefully chosen to represent the kind of music the middle American family at the story's center would consume.  

“The parameters were, what did these people from the late '90s and 2000s grow up listening to?” Anders said. “What kind of stuff do they respond to? We went for that zone of radio music that they connected to and maybe said a little bit about them.” When Michael, the stressed-out father and husband played by Mark Duplass, loses his job and blasts Green Day in his car, Anders felt it was the only choice for his “mad music.” “It's not gangsta rap, it's not metal. It's not Korn. It's Green Day, which is perfectly Michael. He's a wounded man-child, and the song has this pop sensibility to it while still having an edge.”

On “Daredevil: Born Again,” composers Andy Grush and Taylor Stewart, collectively known as The Newton Brothers though they are not actually siblings, took their cues from the title character and his relationship to the imposing city in which he lives. “Taylor and I decided that the city was an omniscient presence that is always calling out to its people, whether they're the vigilantes or just everyday people,” Grush said. “The idea was to create the city's own theme that calls out and is only answered — or sometimes not answered — by the themes of each character.”

 










Stewart added that the score also had to build on the theme music established by composer John Paesano on an earlier iteration of “Daredevil” or risk infuriating the franchise's fans. “On IP that's not particularly old, as a fan, you're expecting a certain something from the character,” he said. “We had discussions about how to incorporate that, but then enhance things with organs and choirs, bringing in more religious elements. But there was a lot to work with already.”

While The Newton Brothers had to think about what to carry over from the prior “Daredevil” seasons and where to branch out in new directions on “Daredevil: Born Again,” Khosla had to reinvent his own score for the fourth season of “Only Murders in the Building,” a series he has been on since the beginning. 

“[Showrunner and co-creator] John Hoffman wants to reinvent stuff every season, which is exciting,” Khosla said. “We don't have to use the same score every year. John and I have a conversation a few months before they shoot, and he walks me through the arc of the whole season, and then I just start writing new themes.”

Khosla's work elsewhere on “Paradise” is as far from the catchy piano hooks of “Only Murders in the Building” as you can get, featuring a sophisticated blend of classical techniques and synth music that evokes mood more than melody. The tense score grew out of conversations between Khosla and showrunner Dan Fogelman, with whom he has been friends for more than half his life. 

 










“Dan and our directors were very specific about what they wanted the audience to feel,” Khosla said. “They wanted us to constantly feel like we were trapped in this world and couldn't get out. So it's very tonal, textured, weird-sounding string stuff and a lot of loops.”

“Dying for Sex” presented a different kind of challenge for Marx, who had to create a musical language for the show's unusual tone — a tone that veers between jaunty comedy, charged eroticism, and devastating tragedy. She credits the unusually long pre-production period, during which she was brought on early, with enabling her to experiment with multiple ideas. 

“It was all about just seeing what was working and how to play the comedy,” Marx said. “I tried to stay true to the idea that this is about a woman whose body is betraying her, and she's using her body and her last days to experience as much life as possible. So there are a lot of humorous sounds that are very organic, but also very fun.”

The Marvel series “Agatha All Along” might not seem very similar, but in its own way, its tonal range is as broad as that of “Dying for Sex,” as the show jumps genres and emotions throughout its first season while reinventing its title character after her introduction on “WandaVision.” 

 










“Agatha was the supervillain, just straight-up evil,” Paraskevas said. “Here, she's an antihero, and we're trying to sympathize with her, but you don't really understand her trauma and motivations until the very end of the show. So there was this balance that we had to find. The first thing we did was get rid of the traditional superhero sound — no French horns, no trumpets. We had this weird ensemble of strings, six trombones, a tuba, and a lot of processed effects and electronics.”

For “English Teacher,” Ross took a big swing by using 1980s pop songs like Scandal's “The Warrior” and The Bangles' “Eternal Flame” on what is a contemporary show, but the idea was to give the series a timeless feel and to associate it in viewers' minds with classic coming-of-age movies that adult viewers grew up watching. (That's why many of the cues come from movies, like “Flashdance” and “Streets of Fire.”) “We also wanted to find the humor and the heart,” Ross said. “That's why we use a lot of songs that bring some kind of familiarity, but still work in a very timeless way. We weren't trying to just play a joke. We were trying to make a greater narrative with it.”

There was added pressure on Ross given that “English Teacher” has no score — the songs have to do the heavy lifting. “We didn't have a composer for the show, so one of the first conversations I had with the showrunner was about the fact that he thought the dialogue and the songs should set the tone and an emotional narrative. That's really how we found the 1980s of it all, and then we found other songs that were current to complement them.” One of the challenges? For some of the 1980s songs, original versions were impossible to clear because artists had re-recorded them — just one of the less desirable aspects of a job that Ross and Anders say is as administrative and business-oriented as creative.

 










Anders added that her background working in record stores, where she had to recommend albums to customers based on their taste, prepared her for the job of music supervising — where she often has to pick music that doesn't necessarily align with her own taste but is right for the material and the showrunner. “You need to be able to think of something really quick as a backup, and you need to know who owns it,” Anders said. “You need to know who wrote it. You need to know all this information as a researcher and be able to offer suggestions for replacements. I can't think of a single show that I've been on where that hasn't been needed, no matter what the budget is.”

Finding music that fits the showrunner's vision was a key concern for everyone on the panel. The composers and music supervisors all noted that filmmakers all communicate differently — some directors and showrunners can speak in very specific musical terms, while others don't have the language, and part of the job is interpreting what they're looking for. 

“It's a lot like a relationship,” Grush said. “I haven't been on a date in a really long time, but it reminds me of what that is like.

Genre:

Rap

Label:

self-released

Reviewed:

April 19, 2025

You can draw a line from Pi'erre Bourne's spacey, pixelated beats on Playboi Carti's self-titled mixtape to countless production choices of the last half-decade. To name two: flansie and Skimayne's synth storm on Yeat's “Gët Busy” and OK's bruising bassline on OsamaSon's “Fool.” For a couple years in the late 2010s, Pi'erre was one of the most innovative producers in hip-hop, concocting pure ear candy by layering sugary electronic melodies and silly soundbites over locomotive 808s. You can hear plenty of Atlanta in his beats, but albums like The Life of Pi'erre 4 sound more like he's hotboxing a spaceship in the vein of Wiz Khalifa, Sledgren, and Cardo Got Wings.

The next star in the lineage of futuristic chill might be Minneapolis producer tdf. A fixture of 2020s blown-out underground rap, he's surely studied Pi'erre's music like a sacred text. His great new album, CULTURE, is full of similarly dramatic transitions, collagist sound design and hypnotic melodies that seem suspended in time. But tdf transcends Pi'erre's sound by leaning into the swampiness, cranking up the low end, and scuffing up the mixes a bit more. He also leans harder into the ethos of a mixtape, playing conductor to a chorus of underground rappers. These songs were likely stitched together over email or Discord and assembled piecemeal, but they have the lived-in feel of a stoned hangout in the basement.

Even with all the vocalists in the mix, the star of the show here is tdf, who fits together drums, melodies and samples into chugging, noisy dreamscapes. A flip of a Frank Ocean Tumblr classic becomes the gleefully twitchy “Numb” with jssr. On the next song, “Stamped,” tdf cuts up on a keyboard as 1oneam deadpans sweet nothings. Like the artists he's influenced by, it's hard not to mention “vibes” when talking about this music—zone out and let this tape's hazy synth clouds wash over you. Key to his beat construction are bits of found sound, which are sometimes so sticky and surprising they're like mini hooks. Like Pi'erre Bourne, he loves animal sounds, lion roars especially, but he can get even weirder; on “Still My Patna” with ATL Smook, he punctuates bars with a sample of Dragonball Z character Goku screaming.

CULTURE could use even more of this cheekiness. I miss the irreverence of his 2023 album BLUEPRINT, where he spams actual audio snippets of salty haters saying things like, “N***a put somebody named Spoof on his tape; that is the craziest shit I ever seen, bro.” (Justice for Spoof; he slid on “Bands Gone!”) CULTURE has narration, too, but this time it's from an aggravating uncle who sounds like he was given zero guidance on what to talk about.

Speaking of Spoof: The rappers on this tape range from mythic pulls from tdf's inner sanctum (omgkeon, NYM Riz) to Hyperpop Daily has-beens (Dom Corleo) to artists who might blow up (1oneam and the actual white rapper of the moment, Okaymar). That parity is refreshing, it reminds me of an old DJ Clue mixtape that might've put you on to someone cool. They largely coast on the same handful of melodic flows, shrugged-off flexes, and vocal textures, all loosely stemming from the styles of Duwap Kaine and Izaya Tiji. Some of them have their moments—Okaymar skates all across “Face Card,” BenjiCold sounds delirious on “Rave”—but CULTURE is not a talent show. They seem aligned on curating a specific vibe here, one that's communal, bantering, and relaxed like a group chat. Like a DJ mix, the edges of songs melt together via pristine pitch-shifting and beat-matching. It's rare to come across a producer-led compilation tape that has such a focused collective vision.

There is one stretch, about halfway through CULTURE, that will break most brains on impact: the suite of skull-crushing, no-Auto-Tune tracks helmed by wildkarduno, Smokingskul and thr33, whose raucous chemistry brings to mind an image of Ed, Edd n Eddy. It's all gnarly, chattering 808s and scalding, sermon-esque raps that might grate on your ears but also would've made DMX proud. Zoomer genre taxonomists often call it “dark plugg,” although in a Fader interview, tdf dismissed that name for it entirely. However you categorize it, his work on these five beats is wonderfully disgusting, particularly “Cassava Leaf,” which sounds like entering the eye of a malware storm. Just when you thought tdf's bag was pillowy, post-Pi'erre bliss, he inspires thr33 to release his inhibitions and full-on black out: “tdf beat, you know I'm finna preach.” Even though CULTURE is all about setting a mood, it also showcases the rising producer's tantalizing range.

	A new study models the impact of the implosion of U.S.-funded disease treatment and prevention in the developing world — and suggests that Elon Musk and Marco Rubio will go down as among history's greatest monsters if funding and effective administration are not restored.


	In short: Tens of millions will die, millions of them children. 


	The second Trump administration began by driving a stake through the heart of America's foreign aid programs. Led by Musk, and enabled by Secretary of State Rubio, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has been shuttered, and its life-saving programs in global health either defunded or thrown into disarray.


	The new paper is not yet finalized or peer-reviewed; it was published as part of a project called Preprints with The Lancet. But it offers a first glimpse of the potential impact of the Trump administration's cut-and-run approach to foreign aid — fueled by lies and red-pill conspiracy theories promoted by Musk about USAID being a “radical left” and “criminal” organization that deserved to be sent through the “wood chipper.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The study models the collapse of nearly $13 billion in U.S. funding for health programs in developing countries, including for the treatment and prevention of HIV and tuberculosis; family planning; and maternal and child health. It forecasts the increase in global death and suffering through 2040 if this funding — which accounts for nearly a quarter of global donor investment — is zeroed out.


	The findings shock the conscience. Cessation of U.S. aid will lead to people in poor countries dying, in genocidal proportions, of preventable and treatable diseases. That includes more than 15 million additional deaths from HIV/AIDS, more than 2 million additional casualties from tuberculosis, and nearly 8 million additional children dead of other maladies. 


	The impact on family planning is similarly stark — with tens of millions of new unplanned pregnancies (ranging between 40-55 million). Counter to the administration's stated “pro-life” agenda, the collapse of American aid is projected to lead to as many as 16 million “unsafe abortions.”

	According to the study, this mass suffering would be avoided by continuing U.S. funding on a “status quo” level from 2024 commitments. (Current funding for these programs represents about 0.2 percent of America's $6.75 trillion in annual federal spending.)

	











	The deadliest projected impact comes from the hobbling of PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — an enormous humanitarian accomplishment of the George W. Bush presidency that has made anti-retroviral medication widely available in the developing world, particularly in African countries hardest hit by HIV. The program has been credited with saving tens of millions of lives and preventing HIV transmission to nearly 8 million children since 2023.


	The GOP-led Congress shares blame here, too. PEPFAR's authorization expired in March, and the current Congress has provided funding only through September — throwing the entire program's future into doubt. Regardless of appropriated funds, however, the chaotic governance of Trump, Musk, and Rubio has monkey-wrenched the program on the ground. 


	PEPFAR was supposed to be exempt from a 90-day funding “pause” the administration imposed on most foreign aid, but USAID administered a majority of PEPFAR aid and the agency now no longer exists, with its chipped remains being swept into the State Department. International partners on the ground in places like South Africa have likened the Trump-Musk era to being “pushed off a cliff.” The George W. Bush Presidential Center has blasted the new administration for having “gravely undermined PEPFAR.”

	The future of U.S. funding to prevent and treat tuberculosis, as well child and maternal health programs, is similarly uncertain. (By one estimate, a Trump freeze on TB funding has already killed 11,000 people.) This gutting of medical aid comes atop the deadly havoc caused by the suspension of food aid to relieve famine in the world's poorest countries. 


	The authors of the preprint paper are stark in their warning about the impact of continued cuts, insisting that a U.S. withdrawal from its 2024 commitments “would reverse decades of progress in global health” and send levels of deaths and disease soaring to levels not seen since the 1990s.

Donald Trump‘s administration is preparing to deport a new group of Venezuelan men detained in Texas, said the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in an emergency Friday court filing. ACLU lawyers urged the Supreme Court to block the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to justify sending migrants to El Salvador‘s notorious prison system known for torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses.


	Migrants have already been placed on buses “presumably headed to the airport” and are at risk of being deported to prison in El Salvador, read the emergency application. Last month, the government sent 238 men to El Salvador without due process, citing dubious claims that the men had ties to gangs that the president has deemed terrorist organizations. CBS' 60 Minutes released a report that found 75 percent of the Venezuelans — 179 men — deported had no apparent criminal record.


	Attorneys for the ACLU also filed similar requests for immediate intervention with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could continue deporting migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law from 1798. All nine justices agreed, however, that anyone the administration is seeking to deport under the act must receive notice and be given the opportunity to challenge the removal through “habeas petitions” — meaning that migrants have the right to have their detention or deportation reviewed by the federal court, but only for themselves and in the area where they are being detained.


	In Friday's emergency filing, the ACLU said that Venezuelan migrants currently in custody in Texas were given notices that they were subject to removal under the act and could be deported as soon as Friday or Saturday. The government's “lightning-fast timeline” does not give the Venezuelan migrants “a realistic opportunity to contest their removal under the AEA,” argued the application, which also said that some of the notices were in “English only” and “do not inform proposed class members of their right to contest the designation in a federal court.” As far as the migrants in government custody and their attorneys know, “the government is not giving notice to proposed class members' immigration attorneys,” stated the filing.

	The ACLU said that any imminent deportations without proper legal review would be “in direct contravention” of the April 7 order from the Supreme Court. 


	Boasberg declined to issue an order late Friday blocking deportations from northern Texas, saying he lacks the authority to issue a nationwide order after the high court tossed his order earlier this month.


	Trump and his administration have continued to defy court orders, in what legal scholars have warned is escalating to a constitutional crisis. After the Department of Homeland Security admitted that it had wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a Salvadoran prison mega-prison due to an “administrative error,” a district court judge ordered the Trump administration return him to the U.S.


	The Supreme Court, noting that Abrego Garcia's deportation was “illegal,” unanimously upheld that court order and directed the administration to “facilitate” his release and return to America. Trump and his administration have refused to comply, arguing the court didn't say that and that they don't have to do anything because Abrego Garcia is in the custody of El Salvador.


	Trump's administration sought to halt the lower court's order with an appeal, but were quickly shut down by a three-judge panel on Thursday.

	The judges wrote that Trump officials are “asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” adding that his administration “claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”


	On Wednesday, Boasberg ruled that the administration's “willful and knowing” actions — and their stonewalling during subsequent hearings in his court — constitute “probable cause for a finding of contempt.” (That ruling was temporarily halted by an appeals court.)

	After the Who announced that they had parted ways with drummer Zak Starkey earlier this week, band co-founder Pete Townshend took to social media to say this is not the case.


	“News Flash! Who back Zak!,” Townshend wrote on Instagram on Saturday. “Zak is not being asked to step down from The Who. There have been some communication issues, personal and private on all sides, that needed to be dealt with, and these have been aired happily.”


	The guitarist's post directed fans to visit the band's official website “for the full statement,” which was updated about an hour later, with a statement signed by Townshend. He opened by reiterating what he wrote on Instagram and added that he and Roger Daltrey wanted Starkey to “tighten up” his drumming style. “Roger and I would like Zak to tighten up his latest evolved drumming style to accommodate our non-orchestral line up and he has readily agreed,” Townshend said. “I take responsibility for some of the confusion. Our TCT shows at the Royal Albert Hall were a little tricky for me. I thought that four and a half weeks would be enough time to recover completely from having a complete knee replacement. (Why did I ever think I could land on my knees?) Wrong!”

	











	This appears to confirm reports that Daltrey appeared upset with their performance at the Royal Albert Hall shows. When the band attempted to play the Who's Next deep cut “The Song Is Over” for the first time in their history, Daltrey stopped the song after just one verse and sounded frustrated.


	“To sing that song, I do need to hear the key, and I can't,” he said. “All I've got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can't sing to that. I'm sorry, guys.”


	In Townshend's statement on the band's website Saturday, he acknowledged that the issues could've been exacerbated by a short sound check. “Maybe we didn't put enough time into sound checks, giving us problems on stage,” he continued. “The sound in the centre of the stage is always the most difficult to work with. Roger did nothing wrong but fiddle with his in-ear monitors. Zak made a few mistakes and he has apologised. Albeit with a rubber duck drummer.”

	The hubbub began on Wednesday following the Who's performances at Royal Albert Hall. “The band made a collective decision to part ways with Zak after this round of shows at the Royal Albert Hall,” a representative for the band said in a statement announcing the initial news. “They have nothing but admiration for him and wish him the very best for his future.”

	











	By Wednesday afternoon, Starkey addressed his then-departure. “I'm very proud of my near thirty years with The Who,” Starkey —the oldest child of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr who grew up around original Who drummer Keith Moon — told Rolling Stone in a written statement. “Filling the shoes of my Godfather, ‘uncle Keith' has been the biggest honor and I remain their biggest fan. They've been like family to me. In January, I suffered a serious medical emergency with blood clots in my right bass drum calf. This is now completely healed and does not affect my drumming or running.”


	He added: “After playing those songs with the band for so many decades, I'm surprised and saddened anyone would have an issue with my performance that night, but what can you do? I plan to take some much needed time off with my family, and focus on the release of Domino Bones by Mantra Of The Cosmos with Noel Gallagher in May and finishing my autobiography written solely by me. Twenty-nine years at any job is a good old run, and I wish them the best.”


	On Saturday, it appears the parties have resolved their communication issues. “We are a family, this blew up very quickly and got too much oxygen. It's over,” Townshend said. “We move forward now with optimism and fire in our bellies.”

	“As for Roger, fans can enjoy his forthcoming solo shows with his fabulous drummer, Scott Devours, who it was rumoured might replace Zak in The Who and has always been supportive of the band,” Townshend concluded. “I owe Scott an apology for not crushing that rumour before it spread. He has been hurt by this. I promise to buy him a very long drink and give him a hug.”

O
n Dec. 21, 1967 — the winter solstice, when the sun's annual perambulations through the zodiac had reached their most southerly point — light was dimming on the Summer of Love.In an unassuming pad at 69 La Espiral St. in Orinda, California, just east of Berkeley, a half dozen hippies were finishing their breakfast. They polished off square portions of steak, eggs, and black coffee. No granola here. They required heartier sustenance to fuel the hard work at hand: mass-manufacturing LSD.


	A peaceful winter morning was spoiled, as one person who was there recalls, by a bark just outside: POLICE! OPEN THE DOOR! Before anyone had time to comply, cops crashed in. The front door was broken down with a heavy sledge, while another flank busted through the back. One overzealous officer crashed through a window. The hand-cranked pill press ground to a halt, leaving microscopic granules of hallucinogenic dust gleaming in the light of a cool, clear winter morning.


	Court documents described the little Orinda home as housing “a small factory for the manufacture of LSD.” It was actually a small tableting facility, where crystalline LSD, synthesized off-site, was pressed into tablets for distribution. The feds had been led there by a weak link in their crew, who had unwittingly sold a substantial wad of acid ($3,400 worth) to an undercover cop. And now, in sleepy Contra Costa County, the whole operation had come crashing down. The cops separated the close-knit crew, egging them into diming each other out. But their loyalties were strong. Nobody said a word.

	Six people were arrested, four men and two women — one woman wearing a Guatemalan tribal dress and the other a bear-fur vest. Reports at the time estimated the street value of the bust at almost $10 million. Chalk it up to some creative math: 217 grams producing some 2,170,000 hits dosed in standard units of 100 micrograms (µg), peddled at $3 to $5 a pop. These weren't “standard units,” though. They were heroic doses, measured out at 270µg to 300µg. This was Owsley acid — the strongest, purest LSD ever produced in the underground.

	











	It was the namesake of Augustus Owsley Stanley III, as eccentric a figure as has ever proweled the American underground. Wiry, furry, and proudly carnivorous, he also answered to “Bear.” He was ostensibly known for his work as an audio engineer, having designed sound systems for the Grateful Dead. (He also designed the band's iconic skull-bisected-by-a-lightning-bolt logo, and inspired the Dead's just-as-ionic “dancing bear” mascots.) Equally crucial to the band's creative output was Owsley's work as a chemist, leading a piebald crew of flower children who cranked out some 5 million doses of LSD into the world, turning on everyone from Jimi Hendrix to John Lennon. Some speculate that Owsley acid, smuggled from the Bay Area to Britain in a telephoto lens case, suffused the Beatles' cartoonishly psychedelic Magical Mystery Tour movie. In The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Tom Wolfe hailed him as “the greatest LSD manufacturer in the world.” Newsweek compared him to Henry Ford. Even the reports of the Orinda bust doubled as both a coronation and premature abdication. “Stanley is known throughout the west,” one paper reported, making him sound like some neurochemistry cowboy, “as the King of Acid.” The bust was followed by months of prolonged legal rigmarole. By the fall of 1969, Stanley was convicted. Owsley acid was no more. Or so the story goes.

	In recent years, psychedelics have benefitted from some pretty positive PR, thanks to research carried out by respectable scholars at reputable schools like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and London's Imperial College. The legal landscape for drugs like MDMA and psilocybin (the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms) has opened up, thanks to a mix of legal ballot measures and Big Pharma investment. This renewed interest has seen the old-school, tie-dye-and-headband stripe of psychedelic sidelined for a more conspicuously serious culture of lab coats and lanyards. There has been a concerted effort, as Michael Pollan, author of the bestselling history of modern psychedelics How to Change Your Mind, previously told me, to “rescue psychedelics from the ‘60s.” But the story of Owsley acid suggests that these histories are inextricable, and that many of the lessons (chemical and spiritual) of the freewheeling hippie-era counterculture still inform modern-day clinical trials and capital investment.

	There exists, to this day, a direct line between the LSD manufactured in inconspicuous, illegal clandestine chemistry operations and ongoing clinical trials, authorized amid the ongoing renaissance in psychedelic science. With slight tweaks and modifications, Owsley acid has passed from chemist to chemist, from underground to the pharmaceutical mainstream, like a grape-bearing vine safeguarded by generations of vintners. It has been synthesized, transmuted, and safeguarded for decades, by a family tree of gifted outlaw chemists using tried-and-true methods developed in home labs across the Bay Area since the mid-1960s. It has been shepherded across generations, binding an expansive, wiggly community of artists, chemists, criminals, rock stars, researchers, and good ol' fashioned heads.


	IF YOU'VE EVER SPENT AN IDLE Saturday binging The Antiques Roadshow on PBS, you're probably familiar with the idea of provenance. Basically, an item's value can increase if there's a recorded history of ownership and transfer, traceable back to its origin. Same goes with drugs. Vintners may pass specialized wine grapes or vines down through generations, preserving not merely a legacy, but a particularized body or complex. Cannabis cultivators talk about “strains”: marijuana hybrids engineered to accentuate (or discount) certain of the plant's psychoactive characteristics. With LSD, however, things are a bit trickier.


	Drug chemists on popular cable crime shows may talk about “cooking” (Owsley once called himself “a master of fine mental cuisine”). But drug synthesis is more like baking. It's not about panache but the boring stuff like precision, punctuality, and fastidious cleanliness. LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide, a semi-synthetic derivative of ergoline, an alkaloid first isolated from a range of gnarly plant and grain fungi. Alter a molecule here, add a propionyl group there, condense too much valeric acid, and a chemical becomes a whole new chemical.

	











	Whether in cannabis dispensaries, concert parking lots, caves à vin, or dark-web narcotics markets, a drug's pedigree is a link, drawing together users through history and binding them through a common experience, or headspace. But with Owsley acid, purity connotes something more than the molecular immaculacy of the compound. It's a philosophy, an ethos. And it's one that endures today, as the drug — or a version of it — is deployed in licensed medical trials as a psychopharmacological intervention. Tracing this LSD's trip from the counterculture to the clinic tells the story of psychedelic drugs themselves: how criminalized compounds have found a second life as part of a cultural and psychopharmacological renaissance, wielded against intractable maladies from addiction to end-of-life anxiety. It is the story of how attitudes and cultures shift — and of just how far people will go to preserve access to the absolute best LSD. Ever.


	“OURS WAS 99.9 PERCENT pure!” Rhoney Gissen Stanley tells me. “There was nothing better.” When she was around 20, Rhoney was one of the young women arrested in the Orinda raid — the one in the bear-fur vest. She was booked, but never indicted by the grand jury. She was Owsley's girlfriend, or one of them, anyway. She took Owsley's last name, despite the two never legally marrying. She has a son by him, Starfinder, who works as a large-animal veterinarian. Now 76, Rhoney is fiery and exploding with personality. She is also quite tiny. When she opens a spiral-bound diner menu, only her small black cowboy hat peeks above the laminated edge. “I eat nutritiously,” she beams, sitting in a booth at the Boulevard Cafe and Grill in Petaluma, California. “I follow Bear's diet: not meat-only, but not carbs. He was brilliant about so many things.” She orders a crab benedict.


	Before Rhoney knew Owsley the guy, she knew “Owsley” the product. She was introduced to LSD in 1965, while an undergrad at UC Berkeley. As she remembers it in her 2012 memoir, an ex-boyfriend drove her out to the Mendocino coast, handed her a capsule from a pharmaceutical bottle, and told her it was “Owsley acid, the best.” They sat watching the waves lap against the sand, and listened to Bob Dylan on the radio. It wasn't long before Owsley himself would swoop into her life, when he delivered a rare German microphone to that ex-boyfriend, an aspiring songwriter who was also moving a small amount of Bear's LSD at the time. Owsley, she remembers, was highly charismatic, and quick to dole out drips of his psychoactive potion from an old Murine bottle he squirreled away in his pocket. In those underground labs, Rhoney worked chiefly as an assistant: She'd monitor the column chromatography process, wash glassware, and — crucially — cue records on the turntable. A lifetime later, Rhoney is proud of serving as the handmaiden to Owsley acid.


	But, burned by busts and raids, she'd duck out of the drug game after her Orinda arrest. “We were on constant alert,” she says. “It was so difficult to have a life that was so underground, and so full of cops and robbers.” As much as their LSD juiced all kinds of massive cultural “happenings,” Rhoney's own circle was tighter. It was a group bound by the necessary distinctions of criminal conspiracy, and a common cosmology of lysergic idealism. “LSD,” she says, “taught us how to be a tribe.”

	











	Another key figure in that tribe was Tim Scully, a Berkeley math whiz and electronics designer who, in time, would stake out his own LSD empire. Beyond a shared criminal enterprise, Bear, Rhoney, Scully, and the rest of their merry gang were united by what Scully calls “purity of intentions.” A high idealist, in a few senses of the term, Scully believed that LSD could alter individual consciousness, and change the world for the better. The best way to express this high-minded idealism was by mass-producing extremely potent, extremely pure LSD, almost as if its non-dilution was an expression of their own virtue.


	“Making a pure product,” Scully says, “was part of expressing purity of intentions.”


	Scully first took LSD on April 15, 1965, with his childhood friend and soon-to-be outlaw associate Don Douglas, when they were in their early twenties. The trip produced what modern-day psychedelic clinicians call a “quantum change”: a shift in emotion and cognition that can radically alter one's outlook. As they came down, Scully turned to his friend and said, “You know, Don, we could make this.”


	Scully, who now hunkers down in a remote cabin near Mendocino, is lanky and balding, with big round glasses and a trim gray beard that makes him look a bit like a wizard. He spends his days working on his memoir, and compiling a massive history project chronicling the history of underground drug chemistry. It consists, he says, of “thousands of massively hyperlinked PDF files,” which he hopes to donate to a university library someday. He has self-diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, but on acid, he loosened up. “For a while,” he recalls, “I knew what it feels like to be a poet, an artist. Whole new universes of perception, thought, and feeling were revealed to me.” This formative trip was catalyzed by — what else? — Owsley acid. Scully tasked himself with meeting its maker. He didn't have to wait long. Serendipitously, Owsley would appear one day at the door, to chat up a female tenant who was renting a room from Scully. Scully immediately ingratiated himself to Stanley by volunteering to assist with his electronics work, rigging up PAs for early Dead concerts and Ken Kesey's freaky “acid trip” parties. He calls it “an extended job interview.”


	In the winter of 1966, Scully and Douglas trailed Owsley and the Dead to Los Angeles, where they set up shop in a stucco mansion dubbed “the Pink House.” Scully worked on electronics and assisted in some light LSD tableting. “I was paying dues so I could work in a real lab,” Scully says. Douglas mostly handled the driving; his greatest asset was his ability to competently pilot 16-foot box trucks on 600µgs of acid — a double dose of “Owsley.”

	











	In L.A., Scully and Douglas studied under Bear, and another important figure in their merry company: Melissa Cargill. She was the other woman arrested in Orinda, cuffed and led out of the house in Mayan traje tipico. If Owsley is something of a psychedelic Zelig, who became a countercultural cult figure (inspiring books, articles, bumper stickers, collectable tie-dye couture) despite keeping a relatively low profile at the time, then Cargill is practically phantasmic. “Melissa is a quiet person,” Scully says. “She made a new life for herself and her new husband which involved teaching, and I'm pretty sure that she had no interest in jeopardizing her ability to teach in the school system by flaunting her past.” Indeed, our own repeated attempts to reach her were unreturned. Additionally, her daughter declined.


	Cargill met Owsley Stanley in 1964, when she was a student at UC Berkeley. According to Robert Greenfield's unauthorized 2016 biography Bear: The Life and Times of Augustus Owsley Stanley III, he chanced upon her while drifting through the chemistry labs at UC Berkeley's Latimer Hall, in search of an electronic scale, to precisely measure out some methamphetamine. The only other person in the lab was Cargill, whose studies in bacteriology were funded by student loans and part-time jobs. They chatted and hit it off. It wasn't long before the pair moved into a house on Virginia Street in Berkeley, dubbed “the Green Factory,” for the fact of it being both green and a factory, of sorts. There, they began producing LSD in the bathroom. Writer Charles Perry, who lived near the Green Factory, remembered Cargill as “a cute little honeybee with tender intellectual eyes.” UC Berkeley's records show that she never completed her degree.


	In the available biographies, histories, and news reports, Cargill is typically framed as something like a complement to Rhoney: a lab-assistant/girlfriend. Some other sources, however, afford her considerably more credit: not merely an accomplice to the best acid ever made, but, potentially, its prime creator. A newswire report detailing the Orinda bust claimed that “Miss Cargill, Stanley's girlfriend and a chemistry major, reportedly provided the knowledge for the manufacture of LSD.” The extent of that knowledge is hotly debated. As is Cargill's operational role.


	It's well-documented that Owsley had lots of ideas about everything from electronics to LSD to the health benefits of a meat-only diet. But even such an eclectic intellect can't quite account for mastering the nuts and bolts of psychedelic chemistry. Albert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who first synthesized LSD in 1938, proclaimed that “there are probably only a few natural substances that are characterized by such a broad spectrum of activity of ergot alkaloids,” like lysergic acid. These are extremely complex, variegated compounds. And transmuting them into LSD is similarly intricate. It seems unlikely that anyone — even a highly-motivated autodidact like Owsley Stanley — could teach themselves how to synthesize the drug, absent some sort of hands-on instruction. Author Robert Greenfield, who wrote the unauthorized biography of Bear, refers to Owsley and Cargill as “co-equal partners.” One other chemist is unequivocal about who actually catalyzed Owsley acid: “She was the brains behind it.”

	











	“I wasn't there when Owsley and Melissa worked out the process for making LSD to begin with,” Tim Scully says. “I'm sure that she contributed significantly in a quiet way.” Scully's friend Don Douglas echoes this sentiment, stating that Cargill “had an awful lot to do” with those early syntheses. Certainly, by the time that pair had been folded into the crew, Cargill seemed like Owsley's counterpart — an isomer, in chemical terms. She, too, would have a child by Bear: a daughter named Redbird. In a testament to their deep tribal bonds, Rhony says, Cargill once stepped in to breastfeed Rhoney and Bear's son. While Owsley stewed in a federal penitentiary, Cargill and Rhoney would take turns bringing the newborns to meet their dad. Rhoney remembers Cargill as primarily interested in the complicated chemistry, and less with the highfalutin mission to turn on the world. “She had this lovely, charming quality,” she says. “But she was not a revolutionary.”


	TIM SCULLY WAS, IF NOTHING else, lashed to the revolutionary potential of LSD. The Orinda bust, and Stanley's subsequent incarceration, left a gaping hole in the underground LSD market. Still possessed by his calling to “scatter LSD to the four winds,” Scully was more than happy to fill the void. In the words of his friend Douglas, Scully embraced a role as Bear's “chosen successor.”


	Scully teamed up with another clandestine chemist: Nick Sand, a gregarious Brooklyn transplant and alumnus of Timothy Leary's psychedelic-research-group-cum-drug-church, the League of Spiritual Discovery (note the acronym). Where Bear's LSD was primarily moved at the street level by biker gangs (“I did not approve of the Hells Angels,” Scully notes), Scully would team up with a criminal organization that possessed a mellower vibe. The “Brotherhood of Eternal Love” were a sophisticated cartel, sometimes called (pejoratively, and mostly by law enforcement) “the hippie mafia.” (“We were not the fucking mafia,” says former Brotherhood honcho Michael Randall, sitting on a patio bar in Fairfax, a cute little hippie town in Marin County, where he holds court like a local celebrity. “We didn't endorse violence of any kind. I never wore a gun.”)


	The Brotherhood's sway over 1970s drug culture cannot be overstated. They imported massive amounts of hash into the U.S. (stacked into imported VW buses and, later, hollowed-out surfboards), cultivated one of the most popular, and potent, cannabis strains of the era (“Maui Wowie”), and conspired, in 1970, with the outlaw Marxist militants in the Weather Underground to successfully bust Timothy Leary out of prison. Two years earlier, in 1968, they set up Scully and his new partner, Sand, in a Sonoma County farmhouse, where they'd batch their own legendary LSD, “Orange Sunshine.” In Owsley's absence, Randall claims that LSD prices spiked as high as $100 a hit. Scully, Sand, and the Brotherhood were determined to flood the market, bringing the price of revolution back down to earth. “Millions of dollars went through my hands,” says Randall, who is enormously tall, sporting a scruffy Pancho Villa mustache. “But we never considered anything other than a way to continue our idea.”

	











	Beyond the acid-fueled warehouse happenings and tripping mobs shoring up audiences at massive outdoor concert festivals, LSD was long valued in the hippie underground in ways that were more measured and deliberate. This includes being deployed in the lay treatment of depression — or what would have been called, in those days, “having a bad time.” For as much Orange Sunshine as the Brotherhood sold, they also gave plenty away. During a 1970 Christmas Day “happening” in Laguna Beach, a plane piloted by Brotherhood associates dropped some 25,000 hits onto the crowd. In the 1960s, “Owsley” acid was moved under a variety of colorful names, like White Lightning, Monterey Purple (the inspiration for Jimi Hendrix's wailing hit “Purple Haze”), and Blue Cheer (from which the San Francisco hard-rock band took its name). Scully and Sand's Orange Sunshine, derived from Stanley's (and Cargill's) original formulation, carried that legacy into the next decade. The drug was, by Scully's own admission, produced in line with the same best practices established in Owsley's labs. “I just followed in Bear Stanley's footsteps,” he says. “The same dose and the same purity.”


	While Scully and Sand kept a relatively low profile, the drug's infamy would also be their undoing. In 1973, the Feds managed to turn one of the Brotherhood's big benefactors: Gulf Oil heir Billy Hitchcock. Hitchcock bankrolled the operation with money from a trust fund that a 1974 Village Voice article pegged at $160 million. Hitchcock had been derelict in his tax payments and was persuaded to rat on Scully, Sand, and other Brotherhood associates in order to save his own skin. News reports at the time stated that the chemists were “charged with organizing a worldwide conspiracy to manufacture and sell LSD in huge amounts.” Prosecutor John Molina, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury that the pair “produced millions of hits of LSD and were proud of it and laughed all the way to their safe deposit box.” They were convicted: Scully was sentenced to 20 years, and Sand to 15. The bookish Scully pursued years of appeals options, before resigning himself to serving prison time. Sand, the more skittish of the pair, absconded to Canada. The drug itself remained the stuff of legend. By Randall's estimation, the Brotherhood produced and distributed in excess of 150 million doses of Orange Sunshine. It saturated the psychedelic underground — in America, and across the world.


	THE AMERICAN COUNTERCULTURE CAME late to the Netherlands. By the early 1970s, as flower power withered across the U.S., Amsterdam became a micro-mecca for wayfaring hippies. It was here, in 1972, that a 20-year-old longhair named Peter van der Heyden first tripped on Orange Sunshine. The experience blew open a door in his mind. He wanted to really understand what produced such profound experience at such teeny-tiny, submicroscopic doses. “I got really interested in these molecules,” he explains. “It seemed like a miracle that somebody could make something that had that kind of effect.”

	











	Now, van der Heyden is in his early seventies with a stern, serious countenance that belies a life lived with tremendous joy and adventure. Decamping for North America, van der Heyden dreamed of meeting the men who synthesized this miracle. But he wouldn't get the opportunity until many years later, while working as lab tech in the University of British Columbia's geology department, where he'd settled into a fairly quiet life studying molecular composition of old rocks. One day, in the mid-1980s, van der Heyden was tasked with the disposal of a number of the geology lab's rare chemicals; working through an itemized manifest of compounds, he realized that some of the chemicals at hand could be combined to make 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA. Gripped as much by curiosity as by boredom, he smuggled out some material and whipped up a homemade batch, and passed it among a few close friends.


	As he recalls, word soon spread throughout the Vancouver underground. It wasn't long before a stranger appeared on his doorstep: squat and a bit balding, with pouty lips and eyes ringed by deep laugh lines. It was Scully's old partner, Nick Sand, who was living and working on the lam in Vancouver. Van der Heyden's long-discarded dream of meeting Orange Sunshine's creators had finally, fatefully, been satisfied. “My work up to that point was very small scale, making a few grams of this or that,” he recalls. “Nick laughed and literally said, ‘I'll teach you how to make drugs with wheelbarrows and shovels.'”


	They set up their own massive underground LSD operation, in a lab tucked away in the Vancouver suburb of Port Coquitlam. Van der Heyden's day job granted him access to large quantities of diethylamine, a colorless liquid that stinks of ammonia, used in seawater analysis. It is also, incidentally, a chemical precursor for diethylamide, which puts the “D” in “LSD.” In 1996, the duo was busted. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it was “the largest production capacity of any laboratory ever seized in Canada.” Authorities recovered 43 grams of synthesized LSD — enough to dose every person in Canada at least once — along with a stash of Ecstasy and other so-called designer drugs like 2C-B. Sand, still a wanted man in the U.S., was extradited and sentenced to 14 years. Van der Heyden faced a softer, five-year stint in Canadian prison. He'd end up serving just 10 months.


	Recent revolutions in the public understanding of drugs led van der Heyden back to psychedelic chemistry, albeit in a more official capacity. Witnessing the changes in clinical — and cultural — attitudes toward psychedelics over the past decade, he knew he had the opportunity, and the knowledge, to get in on the action. In 2019, he founded PsyGen, supplying legal psychedelic material for clinical trials. The company is headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, an improbable place to find a warehouse-sized laboratory mass-producing psychedelic drugs. Still, this has always been the MO of the great psychedelic chemists: hiding in plain sight, whether in roadside barns and silos, or nondescript commercial spaces in snoozy Canadian office parks. (The Canadian government can provide exemptions — called “dealer's licenses” — to practitioners, researchers, or in PsyGen's case, manufacturers working with substances otherwise banned by the nation's Controlled Substances Act.) The difference between van der Heyden and his predecessors is that his work is all aboveboard. But the philosophy of purity remains. According to a report in the San Mateo Times, on the occasion of his Orinda bust, Owsley Stanley bragged to arresting officers that his LSD was made to the most exacting FDA standards. Van der Heyden actually has the certifications to prove it.

	











	In the autumn of 2022, van der Heyden realized a dream he'd been nurturing for half a century: He made his first, legal, pure batch of LSD. In PsyGen's labs, van der Heyden has determined that some street LSD may only approach 50 percent purity. His 2022 batch achieved 99.96 percent purity. “Very few people in the world have ever tried really pure LSD,” he says. “But for those who have, and that of course includes chemists, we know that there's a qualitative difference in the experience.”


	The heroic strength of Owsley's LSD was seen by some as reflective of his own macho posturing — “devastatingly strong in a heavy-handed way that recalled Owsley's own insistent manner,” as the writer Charles Perry put it. For Scully and the Brotherhood, purity mirrored the stated sincerity of their ambitions: their belief that they were not moving a drug, but something like a countercultural holy rite. And so it behooved them to distribute the best version of this sacrament, even if cutting corners and compromising purity would have been more profitable. For van der Heyden, purity provides a cleaner, profounder, “more transparent” trip. If the landscape of LSD research keeps advancing, he hopes to one day analyze what he calls “the fingerprint of pure LSD on the brain.” For the time being, however, his LSD is being wielded toward more modest — if altogether more practical — ends.


	WHEN IT WAS STILL LEGAL, in the 1950s and early 1960s, LSD was investigated in the treatment of neurosis, schizophrenia, and alcoholism. (Alcoholics Anonymous co-founder “Bill W.” believed that LSD could stimulate a “spiritual awakening” that could spur recovery.) But the countercultural explosion of “acid” still makes the drug seem like a bit of a psychoactive “problem child,” in the words of the father of LSD Albert Hofmann. Despite the newfound enthusiasm around drugs like psilocybin, MDMA, and even high-octane, super-psychedelic compounds like 5-MEO-DMT, LSD remains something of an outcast. Despite these hang-ups, some researchers are delving back into LSD-tweaked clinical investigations — albeit with requisite caution and circumspection.

	











	Dr. Suresh Muthukumaraswamy came to LSD by a fairly conventional route. After completing his Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, Muthukumaraswamy began a postdoc fellowship at the University of Cardiff in Wales. There, he met Robin Carhart-Harris, a researcher who had pioneered recent brain neuroimaging work, exploring how, exactly, psychedelics affect brain chemistry. He conducted clinical research on how a range of treatments — the dissociative ketamine, the anti-nausea medication scopolamine, even magnetic fields — can help treat clinical depression. Now, Muthukumaraswamy works in the School of Pharmacy at his alma mater, the University of Auckland. It's an important homecoming, in no small part because New Zealand's regulatory landscape is somewhat friendlier to researchers wanting to work with “high-risk” class-A drugs like methamphetamine, cocaine, and, yes, LSD.


	Muthukumaraswamy has secured government funding for a batch of pilot programs investigating the effects of LSD on focus, mood, cognition, and even the treatment of severe PMS symptoms. It's part of a broader, albeit rather cautious, reintroduction of acid back into clinical and medical settings, despite lingering cultural suspicions around the drug. “There is absolutely a stigma,” he admits. “With LSD, you take that to a regulatory board, and they'll say, ‘Stay away from that.'”


	Nevertheless, Muthukumaraswamy has cleared the regulatory hurdles and investigated LSD's efficacy in treating major depressive disorder, with a recent study that supplies take-home “microdoses” — about 10µg, not nearly enough to catalyze a full-blown psychedelic experience — to a group of clinically depressed volunteers. Early phases of the trial showed a significant, 60 percent remission in depressive symptoms after eight weeks. This marks a substantial improvement over the current state-of-the-pharmaceutical-art: Current rates of remission among users of prescription antidepressants hover around 43 percent. And the LSD used in this trial was supplied by none other than reformed clandestine chemist Peter van der Hyden, via PsyGen. “The purity is high. And the stability is good,” Muthukumaraswamy says with a laugh. “They make excellent LSD at PsyGen!” The formula van der Hyden had learned from Sand, who'd had it passed down from Bear himself, was to be used in the lab.

	











	After eight weeks, the top-line data revealed “rapid and statistically significant improvements” in depressive symptoms. More precisely, there was a 60 percent reduction in depressive symptoms, with more than half of the participants exhibiting total remission. These benefits lasted for six months after the initial microdose treatment. This marks a notable increase over more conventional antidepressant therapy treatments, whose remission rates hover around 45 percent. Muthukumaraswamy notes, modestly, that the trial went “pretty well.” He is now moving on to a study investigating the potential of microdosed LSD in mitigating severe premenstrual syndrome. Drugs dispensed in such trials tend to eschew the more colorful street names applied to the LSD over the decades. No Purple Haze, White Lightning, Blue Cheer, or Orange Sunshine here. Instead, patients are treated with “MB22001,” a proprietary formulation developed by PsyGen and licensed to a Vancouver-based psychedelic medicine company that trades publicly on the Canadian securities exchange. “It's wonderful,” says Rhoney Stanley of the revived interest in LSD. “It makes me happy. We knew it was a useful tool. And now it's become put to use.”


	There are regrets, of course. Tim Scully laments his wild-eyed plans to megadose the world. Older, probably somewhat wiser, and almost certainly chastened by his own experiences scraping up against the drug war and the American carceral system, he seems a bit more moderate. “I know that whenever I took LSD,” he says, “I felt a very strong impulse to want to share this magical experience with everyone, immediately. If only we could have found a way to weave it into the social fabric so that society would provide a backdrop of appropriate expectations and rituals for the experience.”

	The weaving of such a powerful — and in the view of some true believers, actually magical — drug within the broader social fabric may affront some true-believing psychonauts' own purity tests. When a drug that once inspired a passionate, even fanatic, desire to turn the whole world on its head is being marshalled as a medicament to treat more down-to-earth maladies, it can seem like LSD's latent potential is being hemmed in. But for a great many others, these medical and clinical interventions are just new forms of the same psychedelic rituals, in which LSD has always served as a sacrament.

	











	Van der Heyden remembers sitting through a 2017 conference on psychedelic medicine — one of those glossy, businesslike contemporary confabs that occupy convention centers these days, where lanyard-wreathed pharma bros tune into researchers discussing drug development, and trial designs, and patent law, and the potential of LSD in treating everything from depression to cocaine addiction, chronic pain, Azlheimer's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Beside him was Michael Randall, the reformed LSD bandito. “He turned to me,” van der Heyden recalls, “shrugged his shoulders, and said, ‘We knew all of this in the Sixties.'”

Just over a decade ago, the anime world was graced with an adaptation of one of the most artistically beautiful shonen manga series: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Following the Joestar family through six, depending on how you view the family tree, an array of stories across multiple locales. So, what better way to celebrate the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise than turn Shibuya into one giant celebratory area for JOJODAY? Anime News Network explored the area around JR Shibuya Station to see what the JoJo collaboration has to offer.

Authors Note: I will be referring to different JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime story arcs throughout this write-up. The arcs in order are: Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency, Stardust Crusaders, Diamond Is Unbreakable, Golden Wind, Stone Ocean, and Steel Ball Run.

There are six primary JoJo's Bizarre Adventure sites around Shibuya, but some are a bit more hidden than others. For instance, two of the easiest JoJo sites to spot are the giant Iggy (from Stardust Crusaders) just outside the Shibuya 109 building and the giant billboard on the Magnet by Shibuya 109 building.



The other Shibuya JoJo spots, though, require a bit of exploration around JR Shibuya Station. While there is a handy information guide online, you'll have to explore the buildings to their fullest to find where they are tucked away. For instance, the JoJo spot in the Shibuya Sakura Stage is hard to locate because the building layout itself is a bit confusing. But once you find it, you feel a sense of accomplishment.



The Shibuya Hikarie JoJo location is also a bit tough to find. The online guide says the “South show window.” But without a good sense of direction and familiarity of Shibuya, it's like looking for DIO in his secret layer in Cairo, Egypt.



JoJo spots aren't the only JoJo's Bizarre Adventure collaboration taking place in Shibuya. Several restaurants are participating in the collaboration, and one features a JoJo-themed menu. Shibuya Excel Hotel Tokyu is hosting a limited menu; fans who visit will also receive a coaster and sticker. You'll want to get their early, as the menu items can sell out.



Although we missed our chance to fill up on JoJo's Bizarre Adventure-themed food, it wasn't long before our soul was filled with Hamon and Stand energy from the JOJODAY stage event. Taking place at the Yoyogi 2nd National Gymnasium, there was a long line of JoJo fans waiting to enter.



Fans slowly found their way to their seat when the doors opened at 5 p.m. with others exploring the venue, looking for any hints of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. For many, it didn't take long, as JOJODAY was also handing out mouillettes, or smelling strips, of the reissued JoJo's Bizarre Adventure perfume.



As the JOJODAY's start time drew near, the atmosphere in the Yoyogi 2nd National Gymnasium grew heavy with anticipation. As the lights dimmed, the chatter of JoJo  fans died down only for the crowd to erupt with cheers as the opening riff of “Jojo (Sono Chi no Sadame)”, the opening to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure first season, rang throughout the venue. Fans were then greeted with a live performance by Hiroaki “Tommy” Tominaga. Playing into the fans' excitement, Tommy had the crowd join in a call-and-response for the song's line, “Sono Chi no Sadame, Jojo,” all three times it's heard in the song.



As the final riff of “Jojo (Sono Chi no Sadame)” played, Tommy called four JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's cast members, three of who were the titular Jojo, on to the stage. Yelling “JOJODAY Stage guest, COME ON!”, Kazuyuki Okitsu (voice of Phantom Blood's Jonathan Joestar), Daisuke Ono (Stardust Crusaders' Jotaro Kujo), Junichi Suwabe (Golden Wind's Leone Abbacchio), and Fairouz Ai (Stone Ocean's Jolyne Cujoh) appeared on stage to wild applause.



Hosts Kendō Kobayashi and Atsuko Uchida asked the cast to introduce themselves. In exemplary fashion, each cast member quoted their character from the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise. However, Okitsu and Ono had a little fun with their introductions, with Ono calling Okitsu “Grandpa's grandpa” and Okitsu responding “Grandson's grandson.”

Of course, Ono didn't disappoint either. Starting with some Jotaro poses, Ono then asked the fans if they loved JoJo. With a healthy response from fans, Ono then asked just the men in the audience, followed by the women, the same question. As the women in attendance let Ono know their love for the franchise, he let out one of Jotaro's iconic introductory lines, “Shut the hell up! You're so damn annoying, you bitch!” to the fan's elation.

With the fanservice-heavy introduction concluded, the cast members shared their introduction to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The four voice actors were introduced to the series at a young age or during their formative years. Ono and Ai added that the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series inspired them to pursue a career in voice acting. Ai further said when she auditioned for Stone Ocean, she wanted to play Emporio Alniño or F.F. However, when Ai learned she got the part of Jolyne she was happy to get the lead role, but a bit upset she didn't get the part she wanted.

The discussion moved to what Okitsu, Ono, Suwabe, and Ai what they love about the series. Suwabe quickly responded that he loves the onomatopoeias and joked about what the sound “Memetaa!” even is, referencing the frog from Phantom Blood. He then further elaborated that he thinks the introduction of the Stands in Stardust Crusaders was innovative, especially since Stands are preternatural powers that have a visible form. As the conversation progressed Ono noted that the JoJo anime is just like the manga. Agreeing with Ono, Suwabe said the number of “muda” in the scripts were the same as the manga series.

Ai also spoke about her experiences with the line “Ora,” saying that by the time she joined the series, the directors had become more forgiving and didn't require the phrase to be uttered the same number of times as in the manga. Ai then recalled during her final audition after reading a series of “Ora,” she was told she got the part. It was her first time reading a series of “ora,” and the staff had caught it on film. While unreleased to the public, Ai watches the footage to cheer herself up.

Following Ai's heartwarming story, Uchida steered the conversation to some special video messages from Tomokazu Sugita (Battle Tendency's Joseph Joestar), Yūki Ono (Diamond Is Unbreakable's Josuke Higashigata), and Kenshō Ono (Golden Wind's Giorno Giovanna). Like the cast in attendance, Sugita, Yūki Ono, and Kenshō Ono were asked how they were introduced to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, if they had any stories about being influenced by the series, and what their feelings were when they were cast in their respective roles in the franchise. Adding some fun to the messages, though, Okitsu, Daisuke Ono, Suwabe, and Ai were given a multiple-choice quiz regarding the answers in the video messages. But to give Okitsu, Daisuke Ono, Suwabe, and Ai a slight edge, they were allowed to ask the audience, remove half the answers, or call a mystery person using a multiple-use phone call, akin to a popular 2000s-era game show.

The hosts first quizzed Okitsu, Ono, Suwabe, and Ai on which character Sugita found charming between Stardust Crusaders' Hol Horse, Alessi, N'Doul, and Anubis. After calling the mystery person and asking the audience, the four cast members settled on Alessi, the correct answer. When it was Yūki Ono's turn, the question was who he would like to be reborn as between Diamond Is Unbreakable characters Josuke Higashigata, Akira Otoishi, Stray Cat, and the Angelo rock. Once again calling the mystery person and removing half the answers the cast settled on the Angelo rock. The cast laughed and joked how it was the craziest answer.

Finally, it was Kenshō Ono's turn. With the question ""Which JoJo's Bizarre Adventure quote do you get the most courage from?"", the choices were certainly bizarre. The options were Dio's “I'm throwing away my humanity” from Phantom Blood, Rohan Kishibe's “I refuse” from Diamond Is Unbreakable, Diavolo's “This is a test” from Golden Wind, or Bruno Bucciarati's “Are you prepared? I am.” from Golden Wind. 

The cast once again phoned the mystery person. To Okitsu, Daisuke Ono, Suwabe, Ai, and everyone in attendance's surprise, the mystery person revealed themselves as none other than Kenta Miyake (Stardust Crusaders' Mohammed Avdol). Joining the four other cast members on stage, Miyake gave a hint that pointed to the Dio quote. And as it turns out Kenshō Ono gets the most courage from throwing away his humanity and following Dio.



With Miyake introduced as a fifth guest at JOJODAY, the guests turned to the topic of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games. As a special treat, the organizers brought out a console with the 1998 fighting game of the same name, ready for play. But, with certain time constraints only Okitsu played the game. The rest of the cast wasn't left out of the fun, though. Rather than commenting on the game, the voice actors were tasked with voicing the characters and narration for the “greatest arcade experience,” according to Okitsu.

After some hemming and hawing by Okitsu, he finally settled on playing as Jotaro in Story Mode. His first opponent was none other than Avdol. Ono had the work cut out for him, as Okitsu let a torrent of “ora” attacks on Avdol. Ono feigned annoyance at saying “ora” so much, but Okitsu quickly responded that he would see how many times he could get Ono to say the line. Miyake, on his part, had to react and improvise lines on his feet, making it a battle for the ages. While the skirmish was close, Okitsu managed to escape the first fight and continue. Despite having a good time, sadly the cast had to move on.



As Ono and Miyake caught their breath after an intense live voice-acting session, the hosts presented the cast and audience with the results of the JoJo Anime Series Episode Poll.  

Okitsu, Ono, Suwabe, Ai, and Miyake were given a short interlude as several Jojo's Bizarre Adventures announcements were made. There was only one announcement on the fan's minds: a new anime series. As new information about figures, the JoJo collaboration perfume, and new mobile game came and went, there was a palpable tension in the air for the adaptation of Steel Ball Run, the seventh part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but no announcement was made.

Thankfully it didn't cause a riot. Instead, the fans had one more special event waiting for them. A short concert started, featuring singers Coda, Jin Hashimoto, and Tommy performing “Fighting Gold” from Golden Wind, “Bloody Stream” from Battle Tendency, “Stand Proud” from Stardust Crusaders, and “Jojo Sono Chi no Kioku ~End of the World~” from Stardust Crusaders Battle in Egypt Arc, respectively.

As the mini-concert ended, the cast came on stage once again for their final statements. Just as fans in attendance at JOJODAY thought the event was over, though, the lights cut for one final movie. Flashing 1888, 1938, 1988, 1999, 2001, and 2011, with respective events occurring in the world of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, the clock raced forward to the end of time, then to a new universe's 1890. The captions “Total Distance: Roughly 6,000 km”, “Prize money: 50 million dollars”, and “Humanity's first horse race across America” appeared on screen. The assembled crowd sat in pure silence as two visuals of men on horseback and the words “STEEL BALL RUN JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, anime in production” appeared on screen. That was all it took to get every JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's fan in attendance off their feet and cheering. It was the perfect ending to the night's events.

The night wasn't quite over for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fans watching the JOJODAY live stream. Following the main show, Okitsu, Ono, Suwabe, Ai, and Miyake were joined backstage by Uchida once again for just over 20 minutes. One of the first topics was the announcement of the Steel Ball Run anime. Suwabe apologized to fans who were waiting with bated breath for the main JOJODAY show's announcements, noting they had been asked not to discuss it.



To the cast and Uchida's shock and awe, it was revealed that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure creator Hirohiko Araki had posted an original celebratory image to his official X (formerly Twitter) account. Cooling down from their excitement over the new Araki illustration, Okitsu, Ono, Suwabe, Ai, and Miyake spoke about their thoughts and what they're looking forward to in Steel Ball Run. Ono noted that each cast member spoke about how they started reading JoJo's Bizarre Adventure somewhere in the middle of the series and then went back to the beginning. Thus, Ono thought it would be fantastic if people got into JoJo through Steel Ball Run, then went back to the start, as they did.

A few more announcements later, particularly for the JoJo Caravan exhibition taking place in the Shibuya SACS between April 13 to 24, the JOJODAY aftershow concluded.

Although the whole JOJODAY event, including the aftershow, ran for about three hours, the time flew by. The fun anecdotes, stories, and games, along with the concerts, were truly something any JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fan would want to see in person. But the clincher for the event was undoubtedly the announcement of Steel Ball Run. While the excitement of JOJODAY has died down, fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure can still explore the area around JR Shibuya Station to find all the JoJo spots until April 28.

BALDWINVILLE — Fitchburg native Jeff Maki is headed to the Pennhurst Asylum in Pennsylvania next month, one of the many places he is exploring as part of his paranormal investigations.

“Lots of dark stuff happened there,” the 44-year-old said of the former state run mental and physical asylum that is now a haunted attraction with tours that explore tunnels and a morgue.

He officially got into paranormal activity research four years ago and named his adventures Ghost Quest Solo.

“I always had a curiosity for strange things ever since I was a little kid, but I really became curious in my early 30s when I first moved into my current apartment and started seeing black shadow figures and having paranormal experiences,” he said.

Born and raised in Fitchburg, Maki moved to Baldwinville with his family and graduated from Narragansett Regional High School in Templeton as a member of the Class of 1999. He's an assistant manager at a local warehouse and during his downtime he travels all over the country in search of paranormal activity.

His first paranormal investigation was at the Winchendon Historical Society building, which was founded in 1930.

“Honestly, not much happened, but it still made me want more,” he said. “On a quest to find more answers.”

He visited the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa, the site of the 1912 brutal murder of eight people, including six children, and two of his most recent trips include spending the night at The Historic Lizzy Borden House in Fall River — the location of the 1892 unsolved double murder of Lizzie's father and stepmother Andrew and Abby Borden — and investigating the USS Salem in Quincy.

“I didn't see or hear anything, but I did get some intelligent responses using the SBox Ghost Scanner,” Maki said of the Lizzie Borden House, adding that the USS Salem “was quite the active night, had a great time.”

When asked what some of the most bizarre things are that he has come across, Maki reported that he has “seen shadow figures hanging from the ceiling and off the walls of my apartment” and that he had “a pretty intense paranormal experience” while investigating Yorktown Memorial Hospital in Yorktown, Texas.

“I was in an old jail cell in the basement, and I was hit with an enormous amount of energy,” he said of the latter. “It felt like electricity running through my body. It was like goosebumps on steroids.”

Maki shared that he has learned a lot on his paranormal journey.

“There is so much more to this life and this world than we can't begin to imagine,” he said. “Things that were told to us as ghost stories as children and we were made to believe didn't exist as adults do in fact actually exist. There is something after you die. I don't know what or where we go, but everything in the universe is made out of matter and energy and in simple terms, when we shed our physical being there's an energy left over. Some call it a ghost or a spirit but whatever you choose to call it, it is real because I've seen it with my own two eyes, and I have felt it with my body.”

He went on to say that he knows that some people do not believe in the paranormal — and he's fine with that.

“Everyone should be a skeptic. I even consider myself a skeptic, and I've seen some things that would make most people think I was crazy,” Maki said. “It's one of those things that unfortunately most people will never believe until they see it with their own eyes and even then, like in my case, you might either still be in denial, or you will convince yourself that you just might be going crazy, like I initially did when I first started having genuine paranormal experiences.”

“I tell people I am not here to prove anything to you,” he continued. “I am here to present my evidence and to share my experiences. Believe me or don't believe me, that's perfectly okay. I probably wouldn't believe me either. Having critics is perfectly normal in life. Especially when you are dealing with high strangeness such as ghosts and spirits.”

Future plans include continuing paranormal investigations and traveling to paranormal locations, “seeking answers.” He said that while he of course wants to uphold high investigative standards and capture as much evidence as possible, his main goal is to “have lots of fun and enjoy what I do.”

“I completely understand and respect that the paranormal field is a topic some don't feel comfortable with. I just ask people have an open mind,” Maki said. “I am just living life to the fullest and having a blast doing so.”

  A paranormal investigator has reacted with sadness to the news that a former smallpox hospital and ""paranormal hotspot"" is being demolished.



  The site, which also served Don Styler's Physical Training Centre, has been a popular spot for paranormal investigators over the years.



  The former hospital is set to be demolished ahead of its purchase by the Ministry of Defence. This comes after guns and drugs were seized at the site.



  Paranormal investigator Tony Ferguson, who has visited the site several times with his team, said: ""This will be such a sad occasion, as many paranormal teams have investigated, experienced, and caught many unexplained things at this site.""

  The site, often referred to as Monk's Walk, has been a hotbed for paranormal activity, with investigators capturing various unexplained phenomena.



  Mr Ferguson and his team recently made a final visit to the site, accompanied by fellow investigators GS Exploring with Ghosts and Exploring the Afterlife.



  During their visit, the team reportedly encountered several unexplained phenomena, including male voices telling them to ""get out"" and responses to questions related to the hospital.



  Mr Ferguson said: ""A lot of these captures were heard in real time, and the camera has backed up the evidence.



  ""We also heard many taps, knocks, and bangs in the buildings, but as investigators, we like to rule these out, as this could be the building deteriorating.""

  Having investigated the location when it was active and in use, Mr Ferguson expressed sadness at seeing the state of the building due to vandalism.



  He added: ""I think I can speak for many paranormal investigators and gym users that they will be sad to see this knocked down, especially for the legacy of Don Styler, who was a well-liked and respected person in Gosport.""



  The MoD moved to purchase the site in 2024 on the condition that the existing buildings would be demolished by Gosport Borough Council prior to completion of the purchase.



  A spokesperson for the MoD said: ""We have purchased land in Monks Walk, Gosport, to support operational requirements and this land will then form part of the security perimeter around Defence Munitions Gosport.”
