                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TRUMP, the memecoin tied to U.S. President Donald Trump, gained more than 9% in the past 24 hours following a $320 million token unlock. The price now sits around $8.40, still down more than 88% from its peak above $71 on Jan. 18. The recent unlock may spell further trouble for investors, who are estimated to have lost a total of $2 billion after purchasing the token earlier this year. Token unlocks typically flood the market with new supply and tend to depress prices. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that just $1.3 million could move the token's price by 2% on major exchanges. The move also comes during the Easter holiday weekend, when trading volumes are subdued and price swings can be more pronounced. On social media, rumors are swirling about a possible event for large token holders, supposedly being organized by Trump himself. Data from Dune analytics shows there are currently 636,000 TRUMP token holders on-chain, with just 12,285 wallets having more than $1,000 worth of the cryptocurrency. Before joining CoinDesk he worked at major financial and crypto publications. He owns bitcoin, ether, solana, and PAXG above CoinDesk's $1,000 disclosure threshold.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The XRP price rebound faces reversal risks as bearish patterns, fractal trends, and profit-taking pressure point to a potential 40–50% correction. However, the rebound may be short-lived as technical patterns and on-chain signals now point to a deeper correction ahead. XRP is forming a classic bearish reversal pattern that could see its price falling by at least 40% in the coming weeks. As of April 19, XRP had entered the pattern's handle-formation phase, eyeing a decisive close below the neckline support at around $2. In this case, the primary downside target will likely be around $1.24, almost 40% below current prices. The IC&H target aligns with XRP's 200-3D exponential moving average (200-3D EMA; the blue wave) at around $1.28 — and further coincides with a November 2024 top. Additionally, veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests that XRP's market cap could drop by 50% in the coming weeks. XRP's inverse cup-and-handle pattern is unfolding in line with its historical price behavior, signaling that its 2025 rally may have topped out. For instance, the cryptocurrency saw sharp pullbacks to its aggregated realized price following major surges in previous cycles, most notably in 2018 and 2021. When the market price trades well above this level, most holders are in profit, which can encourage complacency or profit-taking. Adding to the bearish outlook, over 80% of XRP addresses are currently in profit. The metric historically reached similar levels during previous market tops, often preceding significant rounds of profit-taking and pullbacks. If history repeats, such similar conditions could incentivize traders to exit positions, accelerating XRP's retracement toward the realized price. Sentiment around XRP reaching a new all-time high above the $3.55 level is deteriorating, according to prediction market data from Polymarket. As of April 19, the odds of XRP achieving this milestone before 2026 have dropped to just 35%, marking a sharp 25% decline from peak confidence levels in March, as shown below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Critics on the right and left say the bitcoin reserve is a pointless industry handout — and using tariff revenue is even dumber. If Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs send household good prices soaring and drive the economy into recession, at least one industry could profit. The Trump administration is considering using tariff revenues to buy Bitcoin for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a top administration crypto official said in an interview last week. The White House's proposal is driving interest from crypto industry figures who have made building the reserve one of their top priorities. Using tariff money would add insult to injury, they say. “There is nothing here but a conjunction of bad ideas,” said George Selgin, an economist and professor emeritus at the University of Georgia. Ever since Trump proposed across-the-board tariffs on the campaign trail last year, he has touted the idea as a way to both build domestic industry and raise revenue. Trump has suggested that tariff revenue could replace the nearly $5 trillion the government hauls in income tax revenue per year, while a top trade official in his administration estimated they could raise $6 to $7 trillion over a decade. Both numbers are fantasies, according to economists of all political stripes. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said the massive tariffs — if they all go into effect as initially proposed on “Liberation Day” — could raise about $3.3 trillion over that period, assuming they don't send the economy into a tailspin. In an interview with investor and crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano, Hines said the administration could use tariff revenue to buy bitcoin. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Friday. When Trump announced that he wanted to create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin at a crypto conference last July, it cemented his place as the industry's favored presidential candidate. Supporters have cast bitcoin as a modern-day gold with near-limitless future growth potential. Socking it away could protect against depreciation of the U.S. dollar and inflation, they say. Trump followed through on his promise almost as soon as he was in office by creating the reserve — but he disappointed some bitcoin boosters by stocking it only with tokens that had already been seized by the government. Still, Trump promised that he would search for “budget-neutral” ways to buy more bitcoins. Tariffs could be one way of building the store, according to Hines. The tariffs would have a disproportionate impact on low-income households, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University, which calculated they would cost an average household $3,800 per year. Regardless of how they pay for it, critics say that it's inappropriate for the government to buy up an asset like bitcoin with no inherent use that is subject to wild price swings — and, in fact, has dropped in price since Trump's tariff announcement. If the government does wind up buying bitcoin, critics have warned, selling any substantial portion of it could depress the digital asset's price. “You have a lot of people in the bitcoin community, bitcoin bulls who would like to see the government do a lot more, because it will benefit them,” said Selgin, who also serves as a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. “These people are trying by hook or by crook to rationalize something that really is just a subsidy for them, without any benefits for other people. BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat? That's all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.

Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen anticipates that Bitcoin BTC/USD will maintain its dominance over altcoins until there are alterations in the US monetary policy. Cowen's prediction is that Bitcoin will continue to outperform altcoins until the US Federal Reserve relaxes its monetary policy. “My base case right now for Bitcoin dominance is that it will likely go higher until quantitative tightening is over,” Cowen expressed in the post. A rise in Bitcoin dominance signifies that Bitcoin is either ascending faster than other crypto assets or its descent is less severe. Also Read: Bitcoin, Solana and Pepe Show Bullish Reversal Signs Amid Market Recovery Regarding the timeline for the Federal Reserve to relax its monetary policy, Cowen said, “Now, I don't know how long it's going to take them to end quantitative tightening, it's possible they end it this summer.” If Bitcoin continues to outperform altcoins, it could lead to a consolidation of investment in Bitcoin, potentially driving its price even higher. Conversely, a shift in the US monetary policy that leads to an easing of the Federal Reserve's current stance could disrupt this trend, leading to a more even distribution of investment across different cryptocurrencies. This prediction by Cowen provides valuable insight for investors navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent macroeconomist Lyn Alden believes Bitcoin is on track to finish 2025 above its current price of around $85,000. “Before all this tariff kerfuffle, I would have had a higher price target,” Alden with Natalie Brunell on Coin Stories. While she still expects Bitcoin to post gains by year-end, Alden noted that the tariffs introduced in February have tempered her earlier bullish outlook.Lyn Alden Says Liquidity Surge Could Propel Bitcoin to Higher Targets Alden explained that a major liquidity boost could push Bitcoin toward more ambitious targets. Despite current macro headwinds, Alden believes there is still a “good chance” Bitcoin surpasses the $100,000 mark in 2025. However, she warned that global market volatility remains a key obstacle, especially because Bitcoin trades continuously — unlike traditional equity markets with limited trading hours. “Because it trades 24/7, if people are worried about how things are going to open on Monday, some pools of capital can sell their Bitcoin on a Sunday and prepare,” she said, pointing out that Bitcoin often reacts first to market jitters due to its round-the-clock nature. While its correlation to tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq 100 has been noted, Alden believes Bitcoin can sometimes diverge, particularly when broader market conditions weigh on U.S. equities without directly impacting global liquidity. “If we encounter a five-year period like that again, that could be a period where Bitcoin does pretty well, even as the U.S. stock market doesn't do particularly well,” she added. Economists Timothy Peterson and Jamie Coutts, Real Vision's chief crypto analyst, expect Bitcoin to hit new highs in Q2. Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range. Nearly all of Bitcoin's annual performance occurs in 2 months: April and October. It is entirely possible Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high before June. Last week, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan reiterated his December prediction that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 before the close of 2025. Hougan argued that recent developments in U.S. trade policy, particularly under former President Donald Trump's renewed tariff push, could act as tailwinds for Bitcoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After finding success with Bitcoin Miner, a vibrant mobile game in which players can earn real Bitcoin rewards for fake-mining an array of cryptocurrencies, Fumb Games has pivoted into a very different kind of mining game. Idle Mine on iOS and Android is cut from the same cloth as Bitcoin Miner, as both are “idle” experiences that require minimal input, typically in the form of pressing buttons and deciding when and how to spend in-game funds on upgrades. Granted, the earnings are tiny—so keep your expectations in check. But if you want to stack up satoshis while playing a simple phone or tablet game, Idle Mine is another option. Idle Mine is an iOS and Android game that was first released in 2024. This idle game tasks you with running a gem mining operation by spending in-game coins to upgrade particular mines, add staff, and better serve customers. That's why it's considered an “idle” game, because so much of the experience is automated. Following those is an easy way to keep things simple and focus on gradually earning Bitcoin. It also has optional video ads that you can watch to get special boosts, such as adding a 5x multiplier to free gifts of coins or “magic gems” used for certain upgrades. As noted above, you should keep your expectations modest. If you play a fair bit of Idle Mine daily, then you might be able to stack up a couple hundred satoshis each day. But at a price of $85,000 per Bitcoin, 200 satoshis is only worth about 17 cents. We've played hours and hours of the game over time, stacking upwards of 4,000 satoshis… but that's barely a few bucks in total, and we'd rather not think too hard about the per-hour rate. Basically, it's a little bit of free crypto as a bonus for playing the game, but don't expect that Idle Mine or any other play-to-earn Bitcoin game will make you rich. Funds can be withdrawn into a ZBD wallet, though note that U.S. users in some states may not be able to use ZBD due to local restrictions. Be sure to check before you start racking up hours in pursuit of BTC rewards. As of this writing, Idle Mine players can withdraw 330 satoshis per day, or about $0.28 worth.

It hasn't made any significant moves to either side. We'll also suggest some of the best altcoins you can buy to benefit from a potential $BTC rally. It's still too early to say that BTC has gone into bearish territory. Plus, these drawdowns are mostly attributed to macroeconomic factors, including, of course, Trump's tariffs. A good thing, though, is that STHs aren't selling $BTC as of now. Their willingness to sit on some losses shows that the market participants still believe in a positive long-term proposition. If you look at Bitcoin's weekly chart, you'll notice a sharp bounce from the 50 EMA, which also happens to be a critical support zone for the token. Another bit of positive news is that even after the recent turbulence, long-term holders are still sitting on unrealized profits and seem to be willing to absorb a bit of loss as well. All in all, Bitcoin seems to be well-positioned for a good rally that could see the king cryptocurrency reclaim its recent highs. Bitcoin's long-term bullish bias is very much intact thanks to unfazed institutional interest and increasing support from governments worldwide. If you want to make the most amount of gains from the next Bitcoin bull rally, a cheap crypto like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) that's built to follow Bitcoin's coattails could be the answer. $BTCBULL is likely to closely follow Bitcoin's upward trajectory because it will give free (and real) $BTC to its token holders. This will happen every time Bitcoin crosses a new landmark, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Again, this will bolster $BTCBULL's hype in the market. One token is available for just $0.00247, and here's how to buy $BTCBULL. $MIND is not just the best AI agent coin, but it's also, quite frankly, a genius. After it has studied the ongoing trends and chatter around crypto on online platforms like X, $MIND will use its revolutionary hive-mind intelligence to find out the best cryptos to invest in. In addition to such expert insights into crypto investing, $MIND token holders will also get exclusive access to the tokens created by MIND of Pepe firsthand. Naturally, these tokens will be built out of viral ideas, meaning they'll be in a pole position to join the list of the top trending cryptos. For more info, check out our guide on how to buy $MIND. Comedian ($BAN) is unlike the two cryptos mentioned above, seeing as it has no real utility. In other words, it's a pure meme coin that only thrives on market hype and community interest. However, because of how intense meme coin rallies can be, the ROI potential of tokens like $BAN is multiple times greater than almost every single conventional investment. $BAN, for instance, has gained more than 71,000% since its launch in October 2024. After a nearly month-long consolidation, the token has surged past its recent resistance level. Comedian, by the way, is inspired by the controversial artwork of Maurizio Cattelan, which simply features a yellow banana taped to a wall. This modern artwork is controversial because it's allegedly a disrespect to contemporary art, which features more sophisticated themes and intricate designs. Meme coins, however, thrive on such virality, which is exactly why $BAN has been so successful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hold steady in the mid-$80,000 range, analysts are forecasting that significant volatility may be imminent for the leading cryptocurrency. That said, most analysts predict a potential price rally for the apex digital asset. In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Mignolet highlighted that approximately 170,000 BTC has recently moved from the 3–6 month holder cohort. Historically, such large movements from this group have often preceded notable price swings. Mignolet shared the following chart, noting how spikes in BTC movement from the 3–6 month cohort have frequently led to heightened price volatility. For example, seasoned crypto analyst Master of Crypto made an observation about the realized price of short-term holders (STH) versus long-term holders (LTH). Master of Crypto added that whenever such a wide gap exists between STH and LTH realized prices, it often paves the way for severe price volatility. They concluded by saying “either the weak hands fold, or we rip higher.” Low exchange reserves are typically bullish for BTC, as they suggest investors prefer to hold rather than sell at current prices. Another analyst, Ted, drew attention to BTC's correlation with the global M2 money supply. According to Ted, Bitcoin is tracking the growth in global M2 with a 108-day lag, suggesting a potential trend reversal as early as May. I think for the next few weeks, BTC could consolidate between $75K-$90K. Meanwhile, noted analyst Titan of Crypto recently stated that BTC's consolidation around the $83,000 level could be laying the groundwork for a rally toward $135,000.

Now, he covers the crypto scene for Coinpedia, uncovering a vibrant new world where technology and journalism converge. Bitcoin dominance is decreasing, suggesting a potential shift towards altcoins. Despite overall crypto market volatility, altcoins are showing signs of strength as Bitcoin's dominance weakens. Analysts anticipate a possible altcoin season fueled by capital rotation away from Bitcoin. As BTC.D breaks below a key support level, analysts are eyeing a potential shift in momentum from Bitcoin to altcoins. For many, this could mark the beginning of a new altcoin season. April kicked off with a total crypto market cap of $2.63 trillion. Between April 5 and 7, the market dropped sharply by 9.8%, hitting a low of $2.31 trillion. It didn't stay there long—between April 9 and 12, the market bounced back, climbing 11.71%. As of now, total market cap sits at $2.65 trillion, still 5.2% below this month's high. Altcoins mirrored Bitcoin's moves, but with some promising signs. It briefly broke above that level on April 16 but quickly fell back. If this trend continues, Bitcoin dominance could retest the monthly low of 63.16%—a move that could fuel even more optimism around altcoins. Crypto analyst Crypto Rover shared on X that we may see sharp capital inflows into altcoins soon. Since April 16, the altcoin market has grown by 1.99%. Interestingly, when Bitcoin dropped from $84,936.62 to $84,479.38, the alt market climbed from $947.58 billion to $948.94 billion. As Bitcoin dominance shows signs of weakening and top altcoins begin to climb, traders are watching closely. If this momentum holds, we could be at the start of a strong altcoin cycle. Momentum is building beneath the surface, and the market may be closer to a full altcoin breakout than it seems. Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more. A low index value, such as 15, can indicate potential for an altcoin rally. Lower Bitcoin dominance often leads to capital flowing into altcoins, boosting their prices as investors diversify from BTC to major altcoins. Search keywords to find relevant market currencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Notably, it highlighted some interesting details, including XRP's meteoric rise to fame among its customers. XRP accounted for 9% of all purchases on the Bitso platform, 3% more than the meme coin PEPE, which ranks next to it. In addition, Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin acquisitions accounted for 5%, 4%, and 2% of all LATAM buy activities, respectively, falling short of XRP's traction. However, Bitcoin and stablecoins dominated trading activity on Bitso last year. Meanwhile, stablecoins led proceedings, with 39% of acquisitions tied to the dollar-pegged digital asset. Furthermore, Mexicans bought more XRP than any other Latin American geographical region. Aside from preferences for Bitcoin and stablecoins, 10% of buying activities among the nation's users were accumulating XRP. Meanwhile, the report identified a drastic change in average portfolio distribution as preferences among LATAM users evolve. Interestingly, a notable rotation was seen, particularly towards XRP, as users held more of the token compared to the previous year. The statistics show that in 2023, XRP was not part of the average portfolio composition of Latin American users on Bitso. However, things escalated quickly last year, resulting in an average distribution of 13%. Notably, factors such as potential regulatory clarity and the asset's performance may have contributed to this newfound interest in the XRP. Interestingly, the optimism triggered by Donald Trump's election victory and the resignation of US SEC Chair Gary Gensler ignited this foray. Notably, the crypto exchange is a long-standing Ripple partner, facilitating cross-border remittances in LATAM.

Brandt, who has been in the business since the mid-1970s, has stirred the crypto community with his recent tweet, where he predicts Ethereum to nosedive to a 2022 low of $800. Brandt shared a chart, which clearly demonstrates the way he expects Ethereum's price trajectory to go from the current trading point. The chart shows a descending triangle pattern, which usually predicts further and deeper price declines. Since Wednesday, when ETH crashed by 4%, following Bitcoin down after the Fed Reserve's announcement about maintaining the current interest rates, it has recovered by 3.56% and is changing hands at $1,601. When Brandt published his chart, ETH traded at $1,587 per coin. Earlier this week, Peter Brandt slammed Ethereum as “worthless junk.” The most recent halving took place last year on April 20. It is focused on AI, gaming and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Tron founder and owner of two crypto exchanges, Poloniex and Huobi, Justin Sun, also tweeted that despite the recent poor performance, Tron does not intend to sell its Ethereum holdings.
