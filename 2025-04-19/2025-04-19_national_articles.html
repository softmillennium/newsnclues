White House ‘border czar' Tom Homan discusses increased ICE efforts to arrest migrant criminals and President Donald Trump's deportation policies on ‘America Reports.' A Guatemalan national residing in the U.S. illegally has been indicted for his alleged role in smuggling a 14-year-old girl into the country. Juan Tiul Xi, 26, was indicted on Thursday for allegedly coaxing a 14-year-old girl into illegally entering the U.S., according to a Department of Justice (DOJ) statement. Tiul Xi is also accused of submitting a sponsorship application containing false statements to gain custody of the teen. "The prior administration's border policies created an environment that enabled human trafficking and allowed bad actors to take advantage of at-risk children," Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. "We are committed to protecting children from the scourge of human trafficking and will not rest until we deliver justice for those who suffered during the border crisis." U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announces the arrest of gang members involved in four homicides, Friday, April 4, 2025, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.  (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier) The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) then  reportedly relied on Tiul Xi's false statements to release the teenager into his custody on Sept. 5, 2023. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, along with other federal law enforcement agencies, attend a pre-enforcement meeting in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. The DOJ says Tiul Xi is charged with one count of encouraging or inducing illegal entry for financial gain, one count of making a false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement, and one count of aggravated identity theft. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison for encouraging illegal entry, up to 5 years for the false statement, and 2 years for the identity theft charge, according to the DOJ. "This case is a testament to ICE's commitment to hold predators accountable for the harm they inflict on children," said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons. Officers from the FBI conduct immigration enforcement in New York on Thursday, January 30, 2025. "We hope that our commitment is evident by our collaboration with law enforcement to right previous wrongs and help bring these crimes to light," Salazar said in a DOJ press release on Tiul Xi's indictment.

Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, spoke to Fox News Digital about the recent excavation of 18th-century British redoubts in the Sunshine State. Archaeologists in the oldest city in the United States recently excavated part of an historic district — unearthing remnants of its short-lived British past. Fox News Digital spoke with Andrea White, a city archaeologist in St. Augustine, Florida, about the excavation. The project took place in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood and wrapped up in February. Archaeologists were digging at the site as they made way for construction and discovered the dried-up moat of a British redoubt, or small outpost. "We knew there were a series of British redoubts," White said. "In St. Augustine, everyone thinks about the Spanish period, but we actually had a 20-year period where the British were in control of both East and West Florida." (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) St. Augustine was primarily a Spanish military town in the first 200 years of its history, beginning in 1565. Florida came under British control when Spain traded it for Havana, Cuba, which had been captured by the British. The Sunshine State didn't become U.S. territory until 1821. The redoubt contained a dry moat with organic material, including seeds, that will undergo additional testing. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) "A series of these small redoubts were constructed sort of surrounding the historic town with plans to actually connect them by a series of walls and defensive moats," White added. White told Fox News Digital the artifacts they uncovered were few and far between. "In [an] urban context, we're used to finding tons of artifacts because people have lived here for over 4,000 years, but in this case, it was really the lack of artifacts that surprised us," the historian said. But while many people may think archaeology is just about digging up artifacts, White encouraged a broader perspective about the field. St. Augustine was established by the Spanish in 1565. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) "Everyone associates archaeology with finding things, and it's really the information that we're after as archaeologists," White said. "They were really well-preserved because it's kind of in the water table at this point in time. "So we've just started working with an ethnobotanist … and she's been starting to help us study these plant remains, these seeds. We're hoping to learn a lot more." When they took control of the territory, the British inhabitants usually reused Spanish infrastructure instead of building their own. "Everything else was either already here and the Spanish built it, and the British might've modified it a little — but this was something that was uniquely British," she said. White added that she hopes the group finds "evidence … now that we sort of know what to look for, especially since there's not a lot of artifacts associated with them." St. Augustine's city archeology program conducts over 60 projects a year, with archaeologists constantly learning more about the city's past. St. Augustine archaeologists hope to conduct more excavations in the future, as the city's archeology program conducts dozens of projects per year. (City of St. Augustine Archaeology Program via AP) "It may not be as old as some people want to think, but there's stuff everywhere. [Archaeology is] always fascinating … and it's a great way to learn about ourselves today, too." Readers can follow her on X at @andreamargs or send story tips to andrea.margolis@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At issue is a growing use of nationwide injunctions in federal courts across the country. These court orders halt federal policies across all 50 states. National injunctions have hindered President Donald Trump from moving forward with his executive order to curtail birthright citizenship, and the Supreme Court will soon examine those decisions by lower courts. On Thursday, the justices agreed to hear expedited arguments on May 15 in Trump's appeal of three lower court rulings that blocked his order. “This Court should declare that enough is enough before district courts' burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the emergency filing. It also places Trump's immigration crackdown squarely before a court that has been historically reluctant to limit its own power but now faces pressure from both sides of the political aisle. Trump's executive order, issued just hours after his inauguration, targets automatic citizenship for children born in the United States to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, guarantees citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” For more than a century, courts have interpreted this clause to mean that virtually anyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen, regardless of parental immigration status. Civil rights groups and Democratic-led states immediately challenged the order, pointing to Supreme Court precedent, including the 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. That case confirmed birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents, establishing a principle that has remained largely untouched for more than 125 years. “It doesn't matter who your parents were.” He argued in a 2018 article that undocumented immigrants do not fall fully under U.S. jurisdiction because they owe allegiance to another country. In his view, their children are not constitutionally entitled to citizenship. Four separate district courts and three federal appeals courts have kept the Trump policy on hold during litigation, finding it very likely unconstitutional. The Trump administration argues that universal injunctions go far beyond the role courts are meant to play, which is to resolve disputes between actual parties. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, wrote in a 2020 concurring opinion that such injunctions allow plaintiffs to “shop” for favorable judges and force the government to win unanimous support across every circuit just to enforce its laws. That viewpoint is gaining traction as the judiciary faces increasing scrutiny over its role in national policymaking. The Supreme Court has never clearly defined the limits of nationwide injunctions, but both Republican and Democratic administrations have raised concerns about abuse of the tactic for years, and the complaints from conservatives have been rising as courts have levied 17 national injunctions against Trump's policies since his January inauguration. “This is extraordinarily unusual,” Spakovsky said in a recent Heritage Foundation podcast. It is important to underscore that the scope of this eventual ruling, even if the high court grants Trump something close to his desired outcome, would likely not preclude all national injunctions going forward. Still, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to limit national injunctions in other non-APA cases, making the grant for oral arguments important nonetheless. Another dispute, Garland v. Texas Top Cop Shop, has drawn attention as a possible future vehicle for resolving the injunction issue. That case involves the Corporate Transparency Act, a bipartisan anti-money laundering law passed in 2021. “I would, however, go a step further and, as the government suggests, take this case now to resolve definitively the question whether a district court may issue universal injunctive relief,” Gorsuch wrote. Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, questioned whether the justices would want to address the injunction issue in a case where every lower court has already ruled against Trump's position. “This doesn't strike me as the best vehicle, I can't say that the Supreme Court is going to agree with me on that, right? I don't feel confident in predicting that,” Entin said. The Supreme Court's ruling is expected this summer. At a minimum, it could clarify how far district courts can go in blocking certain presidential actions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is weighing a crackdown on the tax-exempt status of left-wing groups, an exercise of executive power that would test his authority under the law. He also reportedly plans to strip some environmental groups of their tax-exempt status. In pursuing such measures, the administration could argue that the organizations broke rules designed to prevent them from engaging in political activity or violated other regulations. Trump's plan to go after these groups will invariably spark legal challenges and stretch the administration's power in targeting organizations that it says have breached the bounds of their tax-exempt status. “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness? “Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Likewise, Trump told reporters that the administration is “looking at” CREW. The organization's founder, Norm Eisen, is an attorney who was involved in Trump's first impeachment. “The only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. “For more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,” the group said. “Good governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy. Republicans have long accused environmental advocacy groups of getting funding from China and having ties to foreign governments. Going after green groups would almost certainly spark court battles. Bishop-Henchman said his group doesn't hold a position on the matter but urges the administration to keep it to policy rather than politics. Unfair IRS treatment of tax-exempt political or ideological groups has long been a contentious topic in Washington. During the Obama administration, Republicans were outraged when the IRS acknowledged that it had subjected some conservative and Tea Party groups to heightened scrutiny in applying for tax-exempt status.</p>

Child psychologist Dr. Judith Joseph explains the disruptive behavior and what parents can do to help prevent it. "A Minecraft Movie," the big-screen adaptation of the popular video game "Minecraft," has been packing theaters with rowdy kids and teens since its release this month, spurring a social media phenomenon and sparking concern for America's youth. Videos on social media show young theatergoers huge reactions to one key scene, where one of the film's stars, Jack Black, yells out the phrase "Chicken Jockey!" The scene has prompted excited fans to scream, shout, throw popcorn around, jump up out of their seats, and in one instance in Provo, Utah, toss a live chicken in the air during a screening, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Springs Cinema & Taphouse in Sandy Springs, Georgia, told FOX 5 Atlanta that its staff has had to clean up popcorn, ICEEs, ketchup and shattered glass. The scene featuring the "Chicken Jockey" in "A Minecraft Movie" has spawned some chaotic movie theater behavior from young audiences. "The movie-going experience has changed a lot since I was younger," Josh Gunderson, director of marketing and events at Oviedo Mall in Florida, told FOX Business. "And TikTok has changed that quite a bit." "There's a part of me that says this is just dumb fun. There's another part of me [that says] for the poor people who are there at the movie theaters having to clean up this mess, it's a disaster," Raymond Arroyo, Fox News' contributor and host of the "Arroyo Grande" podcast, told Fox News Digital. "And obviously, you know a safety hazard, because … anytime you get 200 young boys in a room, and they're all yelling and jumping in 20 directions, it's sort of like, you know, a social media ‘Lord of the Flies,' that's what this is. And I get why they're calling in the cops. I get why some theater chains are saying you can only come with a parent because you can't have that kind of mayhem every day and at every showing." Arroyo added, "I think, if anything, it shows the deep passion and the connection that these boys feel to this video game, and therefore they've carried over to the movie. And that's part of the reason it's such a big hit." "…anytime you get 200 young boys in a room, and they're all yelling and jumping in 20 directions, it's sort of like, you know, a social media ‘Lord of the Flies.'" "A Minecraft Movie" has earned $557 million worldwide so far, led by the established fandom of the games and the social media buzz created by filming videos related to "Chicken jockey" and other meme-able moments related to the game. People are sending me these really hilarious speeches that a lot of teenagers are giving right before the movie. I'm staying up way too late," he said. Some screenings have had police called to break up the antics, which Hess thinks is a little much. "A Minecraft Movie" director Jared Hess has been amused by the chaotic screenings: "It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called." "It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called," Hess told the outlet. "It's funny because I think it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments. But, man, I'm just glad people are making memories with their friends and families." Arroyo is "all for engagement," comparing the theater experience to that of midnight screenings of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" or sing-alongs to "Grease." "Singing along or clapping in unison or doing silly things at a certain point in a movie everybody knows and loves … throwing popcorn, throwing live chickens, throwing the guy next to you up into the air, I'm not sure that's the best way forward. But the moment you are [causing] a mess and injuring people, that turns into something very different, and I get why they don't want to tolerate that. Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo "is all for engagement" from audiences, but thinks it needs to be more contained. Arroyo also sees it as an opportunity to instill some life lessons in young boys. "On the other hand, they need to know how and when to rein that in and to discipline themselves, and I worry that when you let this kind of mayhem just go on and say, ‘Oh let them throw the popcorn, we love it,' like the director said, that may be good for the ticket sales, it's bad for society. The world is not your rec room." "I worry that when you let this kind of mayhem just go on and say, ‘Oh let them throw the popcorn, we love it' …that may be good for the ticket sales, it's bad for society. Jack Black recently attempted to dissuade audiences from bad behavior by popping up at a screening in Los Angeles to deliver a warning. he said in a video shared on social media. Jack Black dropped in at a recent screening to warn fans to not throw popcorn and "absolutely no chicken jockeys!" "I love the Jack Black public service announcement," Arroyo said. "I think he's worried, too, about their welfare. These are young kids for the most part. And you can see how excited they are because it's a big part of their lives." "I think a way to put this in context, so everybody doesn't freak out, what the Barbie movie was for girls and women, this movie is for young boys and teens. It strikes a deep chord, it's something that's part of their growth and childhood and everyday life. It's like Hollywood validating their lived experience, so that's why you're seeing this level of excitement, I think. So it becomes kind of a communal ritual almost for them. This is a communal ritual of young guys saying, look, we all play this, we get the reference even though these idiot parents and everybody else don't. According to Arroyo, part of the excitement from young audiences for the "Minecraft" movies is seeing "Hollywood validating their lived experience." You need an adult in the room," Arroyo added. National theater chain Regal Cinemas is trying to manage some of the excitement by offering "Chicken Jockey" screenings on April 20. "Customers are invited to dress up as their favorite ‘Minecraft' characters, whoop, yelp, clap and shout ‘Chicken Jockey!' There are some rules we don't break. LOL with friends till you're rolling in the aisles? But please don't go full Creeper in the auditorium," their website states. Representatives for Warner Bros. Pictures and Cinema United (formerly the National Association of Theater Owners) did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. At least one theater chain, Regal Cinemas, is offering a "Chicken Jockey" screening where fans can make some noise but keep it clean and respectful. "This is the prevailing culture among young people, particularly for boys. These are all video games that have spawned spin-offs. But there's this built-in IP and what novels and stories and Broadway provided in years past to Hollywood, now video games are furnishing with IP and storylines that are already well-known enough that it diminishes your risk when you bring it to the big screen."

April 19, 1995, started off as a beautiful spring day for Amy Downs, a teller at a credit union inside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. "I remember the red buds were blooming," Downs recalled to Fox News Digital. I was getting ready to close my very first house. I don't think I did any work in that first hour of the day. I was running around talking to all my friends about the house. "And then I was looking at my watch, thinking, ‘Oh gosh, it's almost nine o'clock. I had better get back to my desk.'" A co-worker who was six months pregnant sat beside her. Downs asked if she needed anything. Amy Downs is speaking out in National Geographic's "Oklahoma City Bombing: One Day In America." "I don't know if the words even came out of my mouth or not, because that's when the bomb went off and everything went black," Downs said. It was 30 years ago when a truck bomb detonated outside a federal building in America's heartland, killing 168 people in the deadliest homegrown attack on U.S. soil. Downs and other survivors and witnesses are speaking out in a new National Geographic docuseries, "Oklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America." April 19, 1995, started as a beautiful spring day for Amy Downs. "I think it's so important to remember what happened and the lessons that were learned," Downs said of why she chose to come forward. A rubble pile and heavy damage are visible at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on the afternoon of April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma City, Okla. (National Geographic/Danny Atchley) Downs was 28 years old when she found herself trapped upside down in her office chair. She had fallen three floors down and was buried under 10 feet of rubble. Whenever she gasped for air, it burned down to her chest. "I remember hearing roaring and screaming, and this powerful rushing sensation, like I was falling," said Downs. Firefighters ran through thick smoke toward the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Downs screamed for help, but no one replied. Suddenly, after what felt like an eternity, there was a sudden commotion of firefighters. Edye Raines and her mother, Kathy Sanders, realize the blast occurred in the building where America's Kids Daycare is located. "I thought, ‘Why are they looking for the daycare babies here? I had no idea that we were at the bottom of what was once this nine-story building." Rescue workers search through the rubble looking for survivors. Fire Chief Mike Shannon heard Down's cries for help. Just as he was about to go get her, his crew learned there was a possibility of another bomb that was about to go off. It forced them to immediately evacuate, leaving Downs behind. District Fire Chief Mike Shannon heard Amy Downs' cries for help. Shannon was determined to stay with Downs, but fellow firefighters refused to leave him behind. In the documentary, Shannon described how he heard the echoes of Downs sobbing, begging him to save her, as he was being rushed out. At that moment, Downs believed her life was coming to an end. Mike Shannon recalled hearing Amy Downs' pleas for help. "I now knew it had been a bomb, and it looked like there was another one," she said. I prayed, or maybe you could call it bargained with God. My reality was that I was 28 years old and getting ready to die, and I've never really lived. Panicked onlookers, survivors and first responders clear the area after the threat of a possible second explosive device in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma City. "I couldn't remember what came next. And then, of all the weird things to do, a song popped into my head that we used to sing growing up in church. Luke Franey, who had just escaped through the rubble, is led away. Once the firefighters realized this, they rushed back in. When Downs heard the sounds of men again, she promised in the darkness to bake them, anyone, chocolate chip cookies if they could save her. Six and a half hours later, she was free. "I was in the hospital for about eight days," she said. "The biggest injury was my leg, which had been split open. But the hardest part was finding out that 18 of my 33 co-workers were killed. … Grief is something that I couldn't comprehend. President Bill Clinton departs the White House briefing room in Washington, D.C., April 19, 1995, after meeting with reporters to discuss the bombing. The Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people, including 19 children. "I remember on the eighth day in the hospital, they found my best friend's body," she tearfully said. District Fire Chief Mike Shannon confers with a colleague at the site of the bombed Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. As Downs grieved, the community banded together. An Oklahoma City firefighter walks near explosion-damaged cars on the north side of the Alfred Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City after a car bomb explosion April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma City. "But I think it's cool when we know when to put aside those differences and come together for good." Downs was still in the ICU when she saw a group of nurses glued to a television screen. It was revealed that the bombing was orchestrated by two former U.S. Army buddies, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Timothy McVeigh is pictured sitting on his car while he was selling anti-government bumper stickers at Mount Carmel, Waco, during the ATF/FBI standoff with the Branch Davidians in April 1993. They shared a deep-seated hatred of the federal government fueled by the bloody raid on the Branch Davidian religious sect near Waco, Texas, and a standoff in the mountains of Ruby Ridge, Idaho, that killed a 14-year-old boy, his mother and a federal agent. Timothy McVeigh is escorted out of the Noble County Courthouse in Perry, Okla., to be transferred to Tinker AFB for his arraignment April 21, 1995. "When I found out that it was an American, not only that, but somebody who also served in our military … I struggled with that," she said. "I could not wrap my brain around that. My father is from the Greatest Generation. He lied about his age when he was 17 years old to fight World War II. According to the documentary, Downs later faced McVeigh in court. "It was very disturbing," she said, shuddering. Terry Nichols was convicted of being an accomplice to Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. McVeigh was executed by lethal injection in 2001. Nichols, now 70, is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole. Downs was ready to embrace her second chance at life. She went from a 355-pound "couch potato" to losing 200 pounds and completing a full ironman triathlon. She went on to work for the same credit union, now called Allegiance Credit Union, where she served as president and CEO. "I'd flunked out of college because I couldn't pass a math class," she said. "But I was very fortunate to have bosses who mentored me and believed in me. … I went back to college, got my degree, did all the things. So, I decided to launch a new chapter." Mike Shannon is featured in the National Geographic docuseries "Oklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America." She also created a new bucket list. She and her sister are planning to walk about 160 miles of Camino de Santiago, a pilgrimage known as "The Way of St. She's also eager to ride her bicycle across the United States.

(National Geographic/Courtesy The Stephen Jones Oklahoma City Bombing Archive, Dolph Briscoe Center, at the University of Texas) The thing is, we are all going to face times in our lives when we're buried under the rubble, where devastation comes to us. "I think the lesson from this is that, as people, we can come together. And together, you will get through it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Chris Van Hollen on Friday detailed his recent meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying the Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador described being “traumatized” by his time at the country's notorious CECOT prison and has since been moved. “He said he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways,” Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters at Dulles Airport near Washington, DC, after landing back in the US. The US senator said Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, told him he had been moved from the maximum-security prison to another detention center nine days ago. “He's at a different prison which is pretty far outside of San Salvador.” The senator shared that the new facility is in Santa Ana where “conditions are better” but did not provide additional details. He claimed that $4 million has been “paid out” so far. “This case is not just about one man, it's about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States of America,” he said. “If you deny the constitutional rights of one man, you threaten the constitutional rights and due process for everyone else in America.” While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error. A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return from CECOT, and the Supreme Court largely endorsed that order. Top Trump officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported and argued in recent days that because Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national, he belongs in El Salvador. “He's a citizen of El Salvador, he's in El Salvador, he's home,” Trump border czar Tom Homan told CNN's Kaitlan Collins Thursday on “The Source.” “He's an MS-13 member, which is now classified as a terrorist, so we removed the illegal alien MS-13 member who has a final order removal issued by an immigration judge to his homeland.” Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain that he does not have ties to MS-13. President Donald Trump's administration has seized on Van Hollen's visit in particular to swipe at Democrats critical of Abrego Garcia's incarceration in El Salvador. “Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention from the Fake News Media, or anyone. The White House was also quick to compare an image of Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia with one of Trump meeting with Patty Morin, whose daughter was murdered by an undocumented El Salvadorian immigrant in 2023, in the Oval Office earlier this week. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele similarly said in a Thursday night post on X, “Now that [Abrego Garcia has] been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.” Van Hollen also addressed Bukele's Thursday X post that Abrego Garcia had been “sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!” He continued: “If you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one … in front of me to try to make it look — I assume — like he drank out of it. Let me just be very clear: Neither of us touched the drinks.” This incident is “a lesson into the lengths President Bukele will do to deceive people about what's going on,” Van Hollen added. “He said that thinking of you, members of his family, is what gave him the strength to persevere, to keep going day to day even under these awful circumstances,” Van Hollen said, adding that Abrego Garcia spoke “several times” about his five-year-old son who has autism and who was in the car when he was pulled over by immigration agents. “And as he said that, you could see a tear come down,” the senator added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The objective of these strikes was to degrade the economic source of power of the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen,” CENTCOM said in a statement. “This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.” CNN reached out to the Pentagon for comment regarding the reported toll and was directed to CENTCOM's earlier statement. Houthi rebels vowed on Friday to continue their military operations against Israel and US forces in the region. Since mid-March, US airstrikes have pounded Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting oil refineries, airports and missile sites, with US President Donald Trump vowing to use “overwhelming force” until the US achieves its goal of stopping the Houthis from targeting shipping in the Red Sea. Related article Far from being cowed by US airstrikes, Yemen's Houthis may be relishing them Video aired on Al-Masirah shows the injured receiving treatment at a hospital after dawn, many with visible burns to their bodies. “Multiple air raids targeted the area,” a man who identified himself as a civil defense worker told Al-Masirah as he lay on an examination table, breathing heavily. “I found myself falling on the ground as a rocket hit.” “One strike after another, the whole area was lit on fire,” he told Al-Masirah. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said that multiple Houthi leaders had been killed. While as many as 80 Houthi military officers may have been killed, according to analysts, the senior echelon of its military and political leadership appears intact. So are at least some of its missile-launching sites. On Monday, the Houthi-run health ministry said US attacks had killed at least 123 people, including women and children, and injured 247 others since March 15, the Houthi-run Saba news agency reported. Meanwhile, the Houthis have continued to launch more than a dozen ballistic missiles at Israel, and barrages of drones and missiles at US navy ships. While none caused major damage, the threat remains. Early Friday, Israel's military said it intercepted a missile from Yemen. No injuries were reported, Israel's emergency service said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Rep. Barbara Lee, a progressive politician with more than 30 years of service under her belt, is projected to win Oakland, California's special mayoral election. Lee and her more centrist challenger, Loren Taylor, were the top two challengers in a crowded field of nine jockeying to lead the struggling Bay Area city. Lee will finish the two years left on former Mayor Sheng Thao's term. Oakland uses a ranked choice voting system, where voters rank candidates from most to least preferred. In multiple rounds of tallying, the candidate who receives the fewest votes is eliminated, and their supporters' votes are carried over to their next preferred pick until there is a winner. Lee herself has not claimed victory as of this writing with the new results, but posted, “Oakland! Sixty percent of Oaklanders voted to oust Thao last November. She has since been federally indicted on bribery, corruption, and fraud charges. She was the nation's first mayor of a major city to be voted out of office midterm in over a decade. In it, she told viewers to rank her in the top slot, followed by candidates Renia Webb, Suz Robinson, Swaney, and Cristina Grappo in the second through fifth-place spots on their ballots. Taylor, who narrowly lost to Thao in 2022 under the ranked choice voting system, did not. Taylor spent several months outraising Lee, tapping into voter frustration, and pitching his vision of a new Oakland. Lee, 78, came out of retirement to run for mayor after an open letter by a group of self-described “business, labor, community, government, and faith leaders who rarely agree on things” said “extraordinary times” brought them together and implored her to get in the race and keep the city from turning to shambles. Oakland's new mayor will have to hit the ground running. The city that has yet to bounce back from the pandemic, is plagued with serious public safety problems, has seen city services slashed due a budget deficit and years of fiscal mismanagement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A second round of nuclear talks between the United States and Iran is underway, as what both sides are looking for in a deal begins to take shape. Delegations from both countries met in Oman last weekend for talks mediated by the Gulf Arab nation. President Donald Trump has threatened that the US will resort to military strikes against Iranian nuclear sites, with Israel's help, should Tehran fail to reach a deal with its interlocutors. Since last weekend's talks, which both parties described as “constructive,” remarks from various members of the Trump administration have flip-flopped, oscillating between maximalist demands that Iran has said were “red lines” and a more conciliatory approach. A nuclear deal was reached in 2015 between Iran and world powers, including the US. That agreement was, however, abandoned by Trump in 2018 during his first presidential term. Iran retaliated by resuming its nuclear activities and has so far advanced its program of uranium enrichment up to 60% purity, closer to the roughly 90% level that is weapons grade. He said however that Iran's response, delivered by Oman, left open the possibility of indirect talks with Washington. Related article Trump envoy stresses need for verification in Iran nuclear talks Comments from Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, have suggested differently as of late. But conflicting remarks from US officials before and after last Saturday's meeting have muddied Washington's demands. Witkoff, who represented the US last weekend, said that moving forward, talks with Iran would be about verification of its nuclear program, but stopped short of mentioning a demand to fully dismantle Iran's nuclear program, as other US officials have said in the past. In other words, indicating a deal that would be similar to the Obama-brokered agreement. The first is verification of uranium enrichment, “and ultimately verification on weaponization, that includes missiles, type of missiles that they have stockpiled there, and it includes the trigger for a bomb.” However, Witkoff later reversed his position in a statement on X in which he said any final deal with Iran would require it to “stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.” Asked to explain Witkoff's apparent reversal, an administration official told CNN: “It's the most recent elaboration of policy.” Other officials have been hawkish on what the US expects from Iran. On Sunday, a day after Witkoff started talks with Iranian negotiators in Oman, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called on Tehran to fully dismantle its nuclear program. “Iran, come to the table, negotiate, full dismantlement of your nuclear capabilities,” he said on Fox News. Iranian officials have dismissed that proposal as a non-starter, accusing the US of using it as a pretext to weaken and ultimately topple the Islamic Republic. Iran this week doubled down on its right to enrich uranium and accused the Trump administration of sending mixed signals. “Iran's enrichment (program) is a real and genuine matter, and we are ready to build trust regarding potential concerns, but the issue of enrichment is non-negotiable,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters on Wednesday, state-run Press TV reported.

Meanwhile, Iran's highest leadership has approached the talks with extreme caution. A source familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday that Witkoff spoke with Ron Dermer, Israel's Minister for Strategic Affairs and Netanyahu's closest confidant, about the first round of US-Iran talks in Oman. Dermer was sitting beside Netanyahu in Washington last week when Trump suddenly announced the US-Iran talks would begin imminently.

Iranian officials have long warned that a similar deal would be rejected from the outset. However, The New York Times reported Wednesday that Trump had urged Israel not to strike Iran's nuclear sites as soon as next month in order to let talks with Iran play out, which could impact planned engagements for Trump's national security team in the coming days.
