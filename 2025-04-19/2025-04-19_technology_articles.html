Shipping documents sourced from NBD.ltd purport that Intel might switch to the LGA1954 platform for its next-generation Nova Lake processors on desktop (via Olrak). This is accompanied by PCH tooling likely intended for the 900-series chipsets. Importantly, these listings do not indicate an imminent launch, especially since Nova Lake has officially been confirmed as a 2026 product. Preliminary silicon configurations allege two clusters of eight Coyote Cove P-cores and 16 Arctic Wolf E-cores, complemented by four Low-Power Efficient (LPE) cores in the SoC Tile, adding up to 52 hybrid cores. Intel's engineers explore numerous design strategies, so whether this ambitious 52-core project will ever see the light of day is unclear. Specifically, these are not full-fledged motherboards but appear to be some form of a specialized interposer to test voltage regulation for the upcoming platform. There are also mentions of reball jigs or reballing stations for an 888-ball BGA chip, measuring 600 mm2 (25mm x 24mm), and these seem to be for Nova Lake's PCH. Existing 800-series chipsets (Z890, B860, and H810) use a package that's around 650 mm2. The limited lifespan of LGA1851 is a letdown, though the rumored Arrow Lake Refresh might offer some solace to enthusiasts who've invested a lot in this platform. The total count, including debugging pins, could exceed 2,000, as many sockets feature more pads than their name indicates; a fact that was meticulously confirmed by a manual count of all the pads on an LGA1851 motherboard at an event in Japan. If this leak holds, Nova Lake and possibly even Razer Lake should be compatible with the LGA1954 platform, but the provided details are stretched too thin for us to draw any conclusive statements.

Are trunked networks ever used in amateur radio or outside of big commercial/government systems? Is there a standardized way to feed back channel info to the SDR frontend for trunked operation in GNU Radio? Eg. The control channel will tell the terminal to tune to traffic channel at X Mhz to receive or send a call, which requires reconfiguring the frontend.

Y'all can use 25 kHz for repeaters? Here in Germany repeaters are 12.5 kHz only, allegedly due to a lack of free frequencies...

Most people don't associate Skullcandy—known for its plasticky skull-and-crossbones aesthetic—with premium audio. Skullcandy admitted as much at a launch event this week in New York City. Since its inception in 2003, it has aimed at (and impressively captured) the wallets of cash-strapped suburban punks across America with low prices, punchy colors, heavy bass, and skulls. That's why its new $100 noise-canceling headphones are both exciting and ironic—they're made in collaboration with Bose, a company known best as the business-class choice for the parents of Skullcandy kids. The Method 360 ANC offer similar noise canceling to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in a similar design, but with a larger charging case (good for 32 hours of battery life with ANC on) and slightly larger earbuds. It's a “we'll dumb this down for Junior” approach that I'd love to see employed more in affordable products. In my limited time with the headphones so far, I've been impressed with the noise canceling and audio quality, even with stiff competition from Google, JLab, and others in the sub-$100 space. They have multipoint pairing and a nine-hour battery life with ANC on, which is excellent for a full day of work. If you've ever longed to join the Macrodata Refinement team at Lumon Industries, you'll be excited to hear that Atomic Keyboard has unveiled a real-life limited edition Severance keyboard. The bulky, aluminum case is dressed in shades of industrial blue, with an off-white frame that looks like it's been sitting in a forgotten department since the '80s. There's no practical need for a keyboard like this in 2025, but it's a cheeky collector's item for fans of the Apple TV+ series. The MDR Dasher will be compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux via USB-C. Atomic Keyboard isn't clear on the price yet (it says $399, but the price is crossed off, and it notes that final pricing is to be determined), and there's no release date, but you can sign up for email alerts on its site. This week, Apple says it will begin analyzing user data to improve its artificial intelligence models, a move widely seen as a means for the company to catch up to rivals like OpenAI and Google. Instead of relying on synthetic training models, Apple will use anonymized customer data to check the work of its synthetic data and improve it. It only applies to users who have opted in to Device Analytics and will roll out in iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and macOS 15.5. This will upgrade the quality of artificial-intelligence text-generation features like Writing Tools and summarizations, though it's unclear how quickly we'll see improvements. Apple's new-and-improved Siri was supposed to be here by now—a part of the broader Apple Intelligence rollout—but instead we're left with a marginally souped-up Siri that can tap into OpenAI's ChatGPT. A few weeks ago, the company delayed the version of Siri it promised last year, one that can understand your personal context. First released in Europe last year, the at-home, FDA-cleared skin-care tool has racked up a wait list of over 16,000 Americans, which the company says translates to more than $100 million in sales. The Laser Pro uses near-infrared cold laser technology to boost collagen production to address wrinkles, cellulite, redness, scarring, hyperpigmentation, and post-surgical recovery. Lyma claims visible results in 30 days if you stick to three minutes a day. What's more fascinating is that, unlike LED light therapy, this laser works over sun protection factor (SPF) or makeup without (supposedly) losing efficacy. I'm currently testing it—stay tuned for the full review. This week, the company announced a five-year price guarantee if you subscribe to a new Xfinity Internet package, which includes a Wi-Fi router/modem and unlimited data, starting at $55 per month and going up to $105 depending on the plan. That also includes a free Xfinity Mobile line for one year. Like all of these price lock initiatives, there are caveats. If you downgrade the service, regular rates will apply. They're available now at Beats' site and Apple's site and stores, starting at $19 for a single or $35 for a two-pack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Cities across the region from Portland, Oregon, to Quillayute, Washington, broke temperature records by several degrees. As officials recognized the heat wave's disproportionate effect on low-income and unhoused people unable to access air-conditioning, they made a crucial change to the state's energy assistance program. Since the early 1980s, states, tribes, and territories have received funds each year to help low-income people pay their electricity bills and install energy-efficiency upgrades through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Congress appropriates funds for the program, and the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, doles it out to states in late fall. But that year, officials expanded the program to cover cooling expenses. Earlier this month, HHS, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., laid off 10,000 employees, including the roughly dozen or so people tasked with running LIHEAP. LIHEAP helps roughly 6 million people survive freezing winters and blistering summers, many of whom face greater risks now that the year's warm season has already brought unusually high temperatures. Residents of Phoenix are expected to have their first 100-degree high any day now. States and other entities then make critical decisions about how much they spend during the winter and how much they save for the summer. Only about 1 in 5 households that meet the program's eligibility requirements receive funds. As a result, states often run out of money by the summer. At least a quarter of LIHEAP grant recipients run out of money at some point during the year, the former employee said. “That remaining 10 percent would be really important to establish cooling assistance during the hot summer months, which is increasingly important,” said Katrina Metzler, executive director of the National Energy and Utility Affordability Coalition, a group of nonprofits and utilities that advances the needs of low-income people. “If LIHEAP were to disappear, people would die in their homes. They assess how much each state, tribe, and territory will receive. They set rules for how the money could be used. They audit local programs to ensure funds are being spent as intended. First, and most obvious, the agency could reinstate those who were fired. “Replacing the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is a nearly impossible task,” she said. States “can't have enough bake sales to replace” it.

Google has firmly established itself in the market as a top contender in the high-end smartphone market and fights it out with Apple's iPhone and Samsung Galaxy series. In the Pixel 9 Pro, Google goes another step further with a phone that in all aspects (design, functionality, features) gathers for a high-end contender to both its rivals. Now, thanks to a magical Amazon offer, the Pixel 9 Pro is available at a historical low price—below Black Friday—so it's the perfect time to invest in this top-of-the-line smartphone. The Pixel 9 Pro is powered by Google's latest Tensor G4 processor which delivers first-rate performance optimized for AI-intensive tasks. Paired with 16GB of RAM, it is ready to handle taxing applications super easily. The Google phone has a stunning 6.3-inch Super Actua OLED screen with 495 PPI of pixel density. It is HDR-compatible with up to 3,000 nits peak brightness measurements and delivers a great deal of visibility even when subjected to direct sunlight. Its refresh rate varies from 1Hz to 120Hz which makes it super smooth at scrolling and optimizes the battery life. If you like photography, you will absolutely love the Pixel 9 Pro's three-camera rear camera setup (and the competitions is quite far behind). The setup includes a 50MP wide-angle camera with ƒ/1.68 aperture for stunning detail and clarity, a 48MP ultrawide lens with macro focus for capturing detailed close-ups, and a 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom and Super Res Zoom up to 30x.

At its heart is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (the most powerful chip from Qualcomm right now) specially designed for Galaxy phones. We also love Samsung's S25 Ultra stunning display: Its massive 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen offers QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz with the promise of rich colors and silky-smooth graphics for gaming or streaming. The display reaches a brightness of up to 2,600 nits which makes it perfectly visible even in direct sunlight. The display is topped with Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 to avoid scratch and accidental drops. We also all know that Samsung is one of the best regarding photography. The Galaxy S25 Ultra quad-camera setup includes a 200MP wide-angle lens with optical image stabilization that captures stunningly detailed photos with rich colors and sharp contrasts. The front 12MP camera delivers high-quality selfies and video calls. Battery life is another area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't disappoint: The big 5,000mAh battery delivers all-day performance despite heavy workloads. The user-friendly software provides productivity tools like Seamless Actions Across Apps and Now Brief to multitask with ease. Samsung has also assured seven years of OS updates for this device with a commitment to long-term support and security patches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is a different state from simply being awake, where sensations are processed automatically and unreflectively. Rather, conscious perception requires a detailed and voluntary analysis of external stimuli. Researchers had traditionally suspected that such a function must be controlled by the cerebral cortex, because it is where advanced brain processing occurs. The thalamus has never been ruled out from being involved in conscious perception, however it has typically been assigned a minor role as a filter that prepares sensory information to the cortex. Most studies of consciousness involving the thalamus have faced skepticism, either because they lack key observational data of the thalamus at work or, if they are evidenced with data, because of the controversial way in which that data was likely obtained. To see whether a patient's brain region “lights up” with activity when paying conscious attention to something, it's necessary for that patient to be aware of stimuli—that is, be conscious—while simultaneously having their brain surveyed with invasive sensors. But in this new research, a team from Beijing Normal University in China turned to a group of people who already had thin electrodes inserted into their brains as part of an experimental headache therapy, bypassing the ethical question of whether this sort of research justifies an invasive operation. The researchers administered a visual perception test to these patients. A blinking object was displayed on a screen, which would hide itself for half of the time of the test. These characteristics meant the patients had to pay attention to the object and adjust their eyes and focus to keep watching it, rather than just regard the screen without analyzing it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Ubisoft tried its hand at a Star Wars game with 2024's Outlaws, EA is back with another single-player game, this time from developer Bit Reactor and produced by Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Entertainment. It's called Star Wars: Zero Company, and if you've been wanting the franchise to deliver a turn-based tactics game, this might be it. Thanks to this weekend's Star Wars Celebration panel featuring Bit Reactor, Respawn Entertainment, and Lucasfilm Games, we know even more details of what to expect. “At Lucasfilm Games, we're huge tactics fans and we have wanted to make a game like this for a long time,” Douglas Reilly, GM & VP, Lucasfilm Games, said. “The best tactics games are all about meaningful choices, and we're confident we have chosen the right squad in Bit Reactor to deliver a compelling and innovative title that is authentic to Star Wars.” Players will take on the role of Hawks, the customizable leader of Zero Company (meaning, yes, they can look however you want them to look), an elite outfit put together during the Clone Wars to do covert missions. [Note: Spellings are not final as we got them from audio.) But, you don't have to use them. You are also able to create and customize your own team of characters too. Similar to the recent XCOM games from Firaxis—several among that team left to start Bit Reactor—you'll control the squad members and use their various abilities in tactical, grid-based combat. Players will make decisions throughout that have major, at times, permanent consequences and the map is, apparently, the biggest in a Star Wars game to date. There's also a bond system that, depending on which characters you use, will create new branches of the game. Also of note, the music will be by Gordy Haab, who game fans know from his work on Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and Survivor. Star Wars: Zero Company deploys in 2026 on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.

Best for RunningLume Six Alta Medium Impact Sports BraRead more Best for Strength TrainingGymshark Ruched Sports BraRead more Women's sports bras were the bane of my teen existence. They were too tight, flattened my chest (and soul), and, on a bad day, gave me a decent dose of body image issues. Somewhere between my fourth fitness renaissance and the realization that I hadn't worn a regular bra since pre-pandemic, I became a convert. After years of trial and error, I discovered the bra styles that worked (thank goodness for adjustable straps). The right sports bra should be soft but structured, snug but breathable, and—for me—cute enough to pass as a top, like the Vuori AllTheFeels bra ($58). After testing dozens over the past few months—during runs, lifts, rides, and flows—I found the best sports bras worth your attention. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED. Includes unlimited digital access and exclusive subscriber-only content. Most days, I'm in activewear, and the Vuori AllTheFeels Sports Bra is my favorite everyday bra for light support. I have worn this bra for low-impact workouts, but the level of support feels too low for anything more than walking. It's perfect for lounging or running errands. If you're looking for extra support during more intense workouts, the Vuori Yosemite bra is my favorite and is designed with a flattering strappy back. It's quick to dry and bounce back into shape, even during your sweatiest workouts, so you're never left feeling soggy or cold. It's the most versatile bra in my rotation—I wear it for cycling, running, hiking, yoga, or even just a long walk on a hot summer day. If you order a bra size too small, the waistband can get uncomfortable, but if you nail the fit, you'll appreciate the balance between support and mobility. The thick waistband locks everything in place while giving your chest enough room to breathe and move naturally through your workout. Plus, the sewn-in pads don't shift or fold, even after multiple washes. Nike's move to sustainability is a bonus; they use recycled polyester sourced from plastic bottles to reduce waste and carbon emissions. It comes in a rainbow of colors, with regular seasonal drops, so you're sure to find one you like. This is the lightest sports bra I've ever worn. This is the running bra that I wear in Mississippi or Virginia when the humidity goes over 93 percent during the day and it feels like there's a chemical reaction between my skin and sunlight that instantly covers me in sweat. This is also the bra I will take this summer on a family trip to the Philippines, where any heavier sports bra will take forever to line-dry outside. Both are made from a proprietary blend of recycled polyester and elastane, with a thin cotton lining in the interior of the front so you don't have to deal with soaked, sweaty boob pads. Both fabrics feel paper-thin, without being stiff or uncomfortable. Although it's billed as a medium-impact bra, I use the Alta for high-sweat, high-impact activities like running and in humid climates. I would also suggest sizing up, as Lume Six suggests; I sized into an XS, which fits, but tightly. A larger size would be more comfortable for longer extended wear. There's something about this Gymshark bra that makes me feel like I trained harder than I probably did. I adore the crossover back for upper body days when I want to see my back and shoulder pump in real time. It's medium support, but the compressive fabric holds everything in place like a high-support bra. I don't get any bounce or jiggle, even during HIIT exercises. Despite the ruched front and V neckline, I've never (knock on wood) had a nip slip incident. The Solace Sports Bra, crafted from Powervita fabric (75 percent nylon, 25 percent lycra) is soft, supportive, and airy. This is a great bra for low-impact activities (yoga, barre, and pilates), but I especially reach for this during heated workouts, because it wicks moisture away and dries fast. Not to be overlooked, the crossover straps are so cute. I do wish they were adjustable, though. Merino wool has many fantastic qualities, but being stretchy and compressive is not necessarily one of them. That's why this racerback sports bra is a remarkable feat—I have many merino wool bras, but none of them retain their shape and offer as much support as this one, although I should note here that I'm a 34A, so in my case, the claims of good support are not being tested as thoroughly as they might with other people. The fabric itself is knit in a seamless, compressive, 4-way knit structure, so there are no seams to rub or chafe. I wear it mostly rock climbing, without a shirt, and it's long enough on my short torso for it to not be totally obvious that I'm only wearing a bra (I think). Moreover, it's BPA-, PFAS- and forever-chemical-free, which I prefer for garments that I wear close to my skin. There are sleeves for removable bra pads, but they're not included, and it's dark and thick enough that I don't worry about anything showing anyway. My only caveat is that since it's heavier than almost any other sports bra I own, it also takes longer to dry, both on the line and on my body. Engineered by an orthopedic surgeon, the Forme Power Bra uses a blend of six tension fabrics and eight double-fabric panels to nudge your shoulders back, lift your chest, and train your upper body into better alignment. Forme claims it helps with recovery and deeper breathing, and while that may sound like wellness speak, I found that wearing this bra for just a few hours made me more aware of my posture.
