                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is registering the worst economic approval numbers of his presidential career amid broad discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation and government spending, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. The survey found that the boost in economic optimism that accompanied Trump's reelection has disappeared, with more Americans now believing the economy will get worse than at any time since 2023 and with a sharp turn toward pessimism about the stock market. Trump's Republican base remains solidly behind him, but Democrats, at -90 net economic approval, are 30 points more negative than their average during his first term, and independents are 23 points more negative. Blue collar workers, who were key to the president's election victory, remain positive on the Trump's handling of the economy, but their disapproval numbers have shot up by 14 points compared to their average for his first term. "Donald Trump was reelected specifically to improve the economy, and so far, people are not liking what they're seeing," said Jay Campbell, partner with Hart Associates, the Democratic pollster on the survey. That figure includes 76% of Republicans who see the economy improving. Among those believing the president's policies will have a positive impact, 27% say it will take a year or longer. However, 40% of those who are negative about the president's policies say they are hurting the economy now. "We're in a turbulent, kind of maelstrom of change when it comes to how people feel about what's going to happen next," said Micah Roberts, managing partner with Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollsters for the survey. "The data… suggests more than ever that it's the negative partisan reaction that's driving and sustaining discontent and trepidation about what comes next." While partisanship is the most significant part of the president's negative showing, he loses some support among Republicans in key areas like tariffs and inflation, and has seen a notable deterioration among independents. Tariffs look to be a substantial part of the overall public's discontent. Americans disapprove of across-the-board tariffs by a 49 to 35 margin, and majorities believe they are bad for American workers, inflation and the overall economy. Large majorities of Americans see Canada, Mexico, the EU and Japan as more of an economic opportunity for the United States rather than an economic threat. In fact, all are viewed more favorably than when CNBC asked the question during Trump's first term. On China, however, the public sees it as a threat by a 44% to 35% margin, substantially worse than when CNBC last asked the question in 2019. The president's worst numbers come on his handling of inflation, which the public disapproves of by a 37 to 60% margin, including strong net negatives from Democrats and independents. 57% of the public believe we will soon be, or are currently in, a recession, up from just 40% in March 2024. The public also disapproves of the president's handling of federal government spending by a 45% to 51% and foreign policy by a 42% to 53% margin. Trump's best numbers come on immigration, where his handling of the Southern border is approved by a 53% to 41% margin, and deportation of illegal immigrants is approved 52% to 45%. The president achieved a slight majority of support from independents on deportations and 22% support from Democrats on the Southern border. While still modest, it's the best-performing issue for Trump among Democrats. Meanwhile, Americans have turned more negative on the stock market than they've been in two years. The president's troubles with his approval rating do not appear to be translating for now into significant potential gains for Democrats. Asked about congressional preference, 48% of the public support Democratic control and 46% support Republican control, barely changed from CNBC's March 2022 survey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Stockton thinks she has a viable option for investors trying to withstand wild market swings. She manages the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF (TACK), which is designed to be nimble in times of market stress. "What we try to do is help investors leverage the upside through sector rotation, but also minimize drawdowns," the Fairlead Strategies founder told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. "That's obviously a big advantage longer term when you can just go into a less deep hole to climb out of." According to Stockton, her ETF is particularly nimble in this environment because it uses multiple strategies — not just one. Since President Donald Trump announced his "reciprocal" tariffs on April 2, the ETF has fallen just over 4%, while the S&P 500 has lost 6.9%. Stockton's ETF rotates monthly between all 11 S&P 500 sectors. "We don't own technology anymore," Stockton said. "Some of the sectors that we like to invest in have fallen out of favor." As of April 16, the fund's top sector holdings included consumer staples, utilities and real estate, according to Fairlead Strategies. As of Thursday's close, the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF is down 4% so far this year. BTIG's Troy Donohue, the firm's head of Americas portfolio trading, thinks Stockton's ETF employs a sound strategy – particularly during the recent "dramatic pullback." "TACK is a great example of how you can be nimble during these market times," Donohue said. "It's great to see it in an ETF product that has performed really well during this recent drawdown."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House letter sent to Harvard University outlining a list of demands about the university's hiring and admissions was sent without authorization, according to the New York Times, citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. The April 11 letter, which demanded that Harvard eliminate its DEI programs and screen international students for ideological concerns, among other sweeping changes, was "unauthorized," people familiar with the matter told the Times. A Harvard spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that "the letter that Harvard received on Friday, April 11, was signed by three federal officials, placed on official letterhead, was sent from the e-mail inbox of a senior federal official, and was sent on April 11 as promised." "Recipients of such correspondence from the U.S. government—even when it contains sweeping demands that are astonishing in their overreach—do not question its authenticity or seriousness," the spokesperson said. "It remains unclear to us exactly what, among the government's recent words and deeds, were mistakes or what the government actually meant to do and say," the spokesperson added. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the New York Times report. The April 11 letter set off a public feud between the White House and Harvard. The university on Monday rejected the White House's demands that were put forth in the April 11 letter, putting almost $9 billion in federal funding for the university at risk. The White House quickly fired back and, in response, said it would freeze approximately $2.2 billion in grants to the university. According to the New York Times, the April 11 letter came as lawyers at Harvard University were in dialogue with the White House about how the school handled antisemitism and other issues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marc Bowker's shop, Alter Ego Comics, has been a staple on North Main Street in downtown Lima, Ohio, for 16 years. The shop sells comics and collectibles and frequently hosts community events, including an annual free comic book day, where they give away thousands of comics. But now Bowker says he doesn't know what Monday will bring, given the whiplash of President Donald Trump's tariff policy. Those products are made in China, which has been hit with up to a 245% tariff rate for some goods. Bowker said his profit margins have been slashed in half on many items, including some that were pre-ordered months ago. Small business owners and retail experts told BI that smaller businesses are being hit hard by tariffs. Meanwhile, bigger, corporate counterparts are better positioned to weather the storm. Trump has framed his economic policy as explicitly for middle America. "President for Main Street, Not Wall Street," the White House touted on an online recap of Trump's speech earlier this month after his tariff policy sent financial markets tanking and businesses around the world scrambling. Businesses on America's main streets are feeling the impact of Trump's trade war. Many independent retailers — some of which have been longtime fixtures in their towns — are struggling to adapt to the tariffs, especially the steep tariff placed on goods from China. "It's all devastating, but small businesses have a worse ability to manage it," Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a free-market think tank, told BI. Small businesses operate in lower margins, so they can't really absorb it as easily." The White House did not respond to a request for comment. ​​Winegarden said a lot of small businesses are family-owned, and are the classic example of how Americans climb the economic ladder to middle class, upper middle class, and beyond. Trump has said Americans could feel "short-term" pain as a result of tariffs, but experts said that pain may not be short-term for everyone, and that it's the small businesses that will go out of business first. They will withstand it," Winegarden said, adding, "But if it's a year, that's probably too long for a lot of small businesses, and that's permanent pain." Jason Miller, a Michigan State University professor and expert in supply chain management, told BI there were several factors that make tariffs harder for small businesses. For one, their cash flow is more limited, meaning they aren't necessarily able to pay a tariff for a product that they won't actually sell until some point in the future, sometimes months later. Small retailers are also less likely to source directly from vendors and instead rely on an intermediary like a wholesaler or importer. That gives them far less leverage to negotiate prices on their goods. In contrast, a huge buyer like Walmart has a lot more options and negotiating power to get better deals on the products they sell. Miller said toy stores stand out to him as a sector of small businesses that could be especially hard hit by the tariffs on China, where 80% of all toy imports to the US come from. Owners of independent, brick-and-mortar bridal shops, a common fixture on main streets, previously told BI they are also being hit hard, as a majority of wedding dresses sold in the US come from China. Peter Cohan, associate professor of management at Babson College, told BI that the pain small players on Main Street are feeling would likely exacerbate the existing trends toward market concentration, with cascading effects on prices, innovation, employment, and economic inequality. "Small retailers employ nearly half of all US private-sector workers. Their decline would eliminate jobs disproportionately in local communities," said Cohan. Retail giants like Walmart have been linked to lower wages in local labor markets." Cohan added that the tariffs could push out local retailers and allow large corporates to expand unchecked, which hurts competition for consumers and workers. Instead, suppliers may cut quality or reduce wages to meet demands," said Cohan. "Profits would concentrate among shareholders of large firms, worsening wealth gaps." When Trump announced widespread tariffs on April 2, Victor Schwartz and his daughter Chloe Schwartz, who owns and runs VOS Selections, a specialty wine and spirits importing company based in New York, spent the next two days in an intense math marathon trying to figure out how to re-price their products — and which ones to give up. A week later, Trump decided to pause so-called reciprocal tariffs on most trading partners for 90 days but left a 10% baseline rate in place, and the Schwartzs' efforts immediately disappeared into the wind. "We're in that position of having to make firm decisions about what our pricing was going to be under very uncertain situations," Victor Schwartz told BI. "This means we have to be much tighter in our inventory. Alcohol is a heavily regulated product, and regulations mandate that importers report their prices at least one month ahead of time before anything reaches retailers — prices importers cannot change later. Any surprise expenses in this process, such as a sudden change in tariffs, would spell disaster for a small business with limited cash flow. But surprise expenses aren't the only concern, said Schwartz. Retail stores and restaurants that buy wines from him haven't been doing well in the first quarter under dampened consumer sentiments and other tariff-associated costs, which he said caused his business to be down 16% in comparison to the first quarter in 2024. "If a restaurant has a $20 price point for their white wine, and I can no longer offer it at $20, they're going to buy something else, and I'll lose that business," said Schwartz. "The customer that was paying $20, they're not going to say 'yes, we really liked that wine, so we're willing to pay $24 for it.'" As of April 18, the Liberty Justice Center, a Libertarian legal group that is representing this lawsuit in court, has filed an application with the US Court of International Trade for a temporary restraining order to suspend Trump's tariffs. Why are we implementing policies that punish them in particular?" Do you have a story to share about how tariffs are affecting your small business?</p>

The startup carrier, which will begin flying later this year, reveals designs intended to rival the titans of sky-high luxury.

The center seats in Riyadh Air's business class cabin.

As motorsport enthusiasts and high-net-worth individuals flocked to Saudi Arabia for the F1 weekend, Riyadh Air used the event as a backdrop for a big unveiling. On April 19 at the Jeddah Yacht Club it showed off the seats that will soon fill the front of its planes: a plush business class designed to lure luxury-leaning travelers away from Emirates and Qatar Airways, the industry's heavy-hitters.

The startup carrier, which is set to begin flying near the end of this year, offered a first glimpse of the designs for the five-star service it plans to deliver. The cabin includes privacy panels, lie-flat seats, mood lighting, large screens and high-speed Wi-Fi, all cloaked in a color palette of deep purples, gold and stone. The interiors are inspired by the twisting canopies of traditional Arabian tents, with colors and materials that reflect Saudi heritage. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran and the United States held a second round of negotiations Saturday over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome, U.S. and Iranian officials said. Iranian state media also reported the talks starting just before noon Saturday as journalists watched outside. The talks in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The negotiations will again be mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and after U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens more. "I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon," Trump said Friday. He earlier wrote Saturday on X that Iran "always demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues." "We are aware that it is not a smooth path, but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences," Baghaei added. Araghchi met Saturday morning with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani ahead of the talks with Witkoff. Grossi's agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers. A diplomat deal "is built patiently, day after day, with dialogue and mutual respect," he said in a statement. Both men have been traveling in recent days. Witkoff had been in Paris for talks about Ukraine as Russia's full-scale war there grinds on. Araghchi will be coming from Tehran, Iran, after a visit to Moscow, where he met with officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia, one of the world powers involved in Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran's uranium enriched to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Oman's capital, Muscat, hosted the first round of negotiations between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks. Ahead of the talks, however, Iran seized on comments by Witkoff first suggesting Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on X before the talks that Iran would not accept giving up its enrichment program like Libya, or agreeing to using uranium enriched abroad for its nuclear program. Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China's Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran. The aircraft had Rolls-Royce engines, which included significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. Under the 2015 deal, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined up tens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co. We want to hear from you.
