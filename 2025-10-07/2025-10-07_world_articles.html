                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A general view of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on March 29, 2023. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) remains disconnected from the Ukrainian electricity grid and without external power for two weeks, creating an increasingly "risky" situation,  experts told the Kyiv Independent. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its team heard "several rounds of incoming and outgoing shelling from near the site." Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom warned that the diesel generators powering the plant are designed only for short-term emergency use and are not meant to sustain the plant's operational needs for an extended period. A shutdown of these generators could result in a loss of control over the facility's nuclear safety systems. Diesel generators are now supplying power to the plant, but one has already failed, he said. Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil/environmental engineering, industrial and systems engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California, also confirmed that diesel generators "are not designed to be run in such a sustained period of time." "It's a risky situation because emergency generators are big machines, and they could easily break down. They are reliable, but at the same time, (require) a high-maintenance type of machinery due to their wear and tear," Meshkati said. Ukraine's Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the situation is further complicated by Russia's failure to carry out scheduled repairs and maintenance, which increases the risk of diesel generator failure and threatens a shutdown of the nuclear fuel cooling system and failure of critical safety systems. This could lead to a nuclear or radiation accident. "The potential consequences of the failure of safety systems at the ZNPP will be transboundary and pose a danger not only to Ukraine but also to many European countries," a spokesperson said. The ZNPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The six reactors were shut down a month after Moscow's occupation, but the facility still requires electricity to maintain cooling and prevent a nuclear incident. Russian troops reportedly struck a power line on Sept. 23, severing the plant's connection to Ukraine's electrical grid. While Russian state media blame Ukraine for the strike, Greenpeace Ukraine published an investigation on Oct. 1, saying that there is no evidence of any military strikes around the pylons and power line network at the ZNPP. Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Vande Putte told the Kyiv Independent that Russia can repair the line "in a matter of hours." It's a very precise sabotage," Vande Putte said. President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 1 social post that "Russia is deliberately creating the threat of radiation incidents, taking advantage, unfortunately, of the weak position of the IAEA and its director, Rafael Grossi, as well as the distraction of global attention." Zelensky's statements came after a Russian attack on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast, which caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 1. While ZNPP "is not going to blow up tomorrow," the situation is serious in a long-term perspective, Vande Putte said. "They (Russians) can let the crisis get worse. (...) They can move closer and closer to that point over the coming week, and to have that kind of nuclear blackmail. "But they pressured the staff to the point that there was almost no one left to work there," he said. And the station has been turned into a military base." An investigation by the Truth Hounds and Greenpeace Ukraine published on Sept. 24 detailed Rosatom's role in pressuring plant staff,  including torture, "including beatings, electrocution, sexual violence, mock executions, and threats to family members of detainees." Meshkati suggests that Russia's actions at the power plant could be a negotiating tactic. "Nuclear plants are too important to be used as a bargaining chip or for political horse-trading or power plays. If something goes wrong, everybody, the friend and foe, will be hurt equally," Meshkati said. Vande Putte also suggests that Russia's motivation is based "not so much for electricity reasons, but for military and political reasons." It's the way for them to say clearly "this is Russian territory, it's our nuclear power plant," Vande Putte said. In a Sept. 30 statement, the bloc's diplomatic service denounced Russian occupation of the plant as illegal and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces. The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ed Yohnka of the ACLU of Illinois discusses how the ongoing immigration crackdown is putting communities at risk. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. As Chicago braces for a possible deployment of National Guard troops by President Trump, we speak with Ed Yohnka from the ACLU of Illinois about how the administration's ongoing immigration crackdown is putting communities at risk. For weeks, federal agents with ICE and other agencies have carried out violent immigration arrests across Chicago, including in a high-profile raid on a residential building in which many U.S. citizens were also detained. “There's no emergency,” says Yohnka, who blames the administration for needlessly escalating tensions in Chicago, seemingly in search of excuses for more violence. “And when anybody protests, then that's seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces,” says Yohnka. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: A federal judge in Chicago has refused the Illinois attorney general's request to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to the state, instead saying she'll hear arguments on Thursday. This is in contrast to Portland, Oregon, where a federal judge appointed by President Trump did issue a restraining order to stop Trump from sending troops. Illinois Governor Pritzker said Monday he would not back down. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. JB PRITZKER: Since the beginning of this invasion, families have been snatched up off the streets or removed from their homes, zip-tied and detained for hours, including especially U.S. citizens and legal residents of our state. And in the words of CBP chief patrol agent Greg Bovino, they're being chosen by how they look. AMY GOODMAN: Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announced he had signed an executive order to stop federal immigration agents from using certain city-owned spaces. MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON: The order establishes ICE-free zones. That means that city property and unwilling private businesses will no longer serve as staging grounds for these raids. AMY GOODMAN: This comes after an overnight ICE raid on a Chicago apartment complex days ago, when ICE agents, wearing fatigues and carrying guns, rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and zip-tied children and U.S. citizens while carrying out arrests. A neighbor described the terrifying ordeal to ABC 7 Chicago. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids out, too, had them zip-tied to each other. That's all I kept asking: Where's the morality? AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Friday, federal agents handcuffed Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes and briefly detained her when she asked if they had a signed warrant for a man they were trying to detain at a hospital. JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed — JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant? FEDERAL AGENT 2: You are going to be placed under arrest. JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant for me? The video was shared in a report by the news outlet Book Club Chicago, which is part of a coalition of Chicago journalists and activists who filed a new lawsuit with the ACLU of Illinois against the Trump administration over a pattern of, quote, “extreme brutality,” unquote, by federal agents during protests at the Broadview ICE detention center in a Chicago suburb. In this CBS News Chicago story, correspondent Asal Rezaei describes how she was attacked while reporting at the ICE jail. ASAL REZAEI: An ICE agent that was masked pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. You can see the point of impact right there. MARISSA SULEK: You can see white powder exploded on the hood of her car, windshield, and even engulfed the inside. ASAL REZAEI: And I was sitting right there with my window open. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois. Ed, thanks so much for being with us. Apparently, Governor Abbott allowed the troops to go from Texas, and they're in Indiana right now. But talk about the judge's ruling and the other lawsuits, as well, that you're a part of. So, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, as you say, filed a lawsuit yesterday to challenge the federalization of National Guard and deploying them here, for a very simple reason: There's no emergency, and there's no justification for having done — or, for having guards or troops here in the city of Chicago or in the Chicagoland area. In fact, what we have seen over the last few weeks is the escalation of violence and chaos on behalf of ICE agents, or conducted by ICE agents, everything from, you know, marching up and down in fatigues and pulling families out of parks, marching up and down Michigan Avenue, pulling families out of parks, to, as was described in our lawsuit yesterday with a coalition of legal organizations, you know, taking on what we've seen is, you know, just the indiscriminate firing of projectiles and chemical weapons at the Broadview detention center and — or, processing center, which has become a detention center. So, what we're seeing, and, you know, in the other clips you played, is just this escalation of violence. And when anybody protests, then that's seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces. But further forces are just going to escalate tensions here. They're not going to make things better. Can you talk about what actually happened there? Last week, what we saw was, in the middle of the night, hundreds of heavily armed ICE agents, you know, masked up, attacked a single apartment building, broke into that building, rappelled off of a Black Hawk helicopter to get to the roof of the building, then proceeded to go through the building and kick down every single door that they could, take whomever they found into custody, and then, as we know, release some of those people hours later because they either had no background, criminal background, they were green card holders, and, in many cases, you know, they were citizens, including zip-tying children, zip-tying children out in the streets of Chicago, separating them from their families and then hauling them away, as well. You know, this is just — you know, and we have not yet, to this hour, heard any justification or rationalization for why it was that they needed this kind of overwhelming force. There's not been charges brought against anybody. There's been no production of a warrant in public to justify why an entire apartment building was attacked. Even if there was a person or set of people in the building that they wanted to try to detain, they didn't need to literally render, you know, a hundred people unhoused because they've created a situation where they can't go back into the building. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And have they — have there been any reports of who was actually detained or where the people are? ED YOHNKA: No, that's been very difficult to find out, Juan. But the reporting on this is just awful. AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the possibility of President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, and how rare this is? ED YOHNKA: It would be incredibly rare, Amy. As you know, the Insurrection Act has been used only a few times in our country's history. There is no armed conflict going on. You know, just to make the point, yesterday, government lawyers stood against state lawyers in a federal courthouse and in a federal courtroom to raise the question about whether or not National Guard was available. Police stopped people yesterday in the city of Chicago. ICE continued to make raids in the city of Chicago. There is nothing here that justifies something as extreme as declaring that there is an insurrection, which requires, you know, troops and allowing troops to engage in practices that take them beyond just, quote-unquote, “providing protection” for federal officials. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk, Ed, also about the response of local city officials? There was an extraordinary press conference by Police Superintendent Snelling yesterday, where he said that some — more than 20 Chicago police officers were actually hit with tear gas at Broadview, fired by ICE agents. ED YOHNKA: Actually, that was at a protest after a person was shot in the Brighton Park neighborhood — JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Oh, Brighton Park, I'm sorry, yeah. There was — you know, people had gathered around. There were people protesting, decrying the fact that ICE had once again shot someone, as we saw here a couple of weeks ago in a traffic stop. And in this instance, you know, CPD showed up to try to assist with crowd control, with clearing the traffic and allowing people to move on, and ICE, instead of letting CPD or any other official do their — other officials do their job, simply began to fire tear gas at the crowd. Last weekend, the Illinois State Police set up a protection zone at Broadview and tried to sort of create at least some barrier between ICE agents and others. You know, these are just these kind of bullying, goonish tactics that we're just seeing them do anywhere. AMY GOODMAN: Ed, we were just showing video put out by the Department of Homeland Security, as you were talking about the Black Hawk helicopter, ICE agents rappelling down from it, armed, automatic weapons, the agents moving into apartments. Can you comment on this, the terror that these families felt, with faces not being obscured? And let me start by noting they put out this propaganda reel before they ever explained what the actual rationale for the raid is. And what you're — you know, what you see in that video, and I think what you hear from members of the community, is a complete terror, a sense of terror that their community, a working-class, Black and Brown community, is being targeted in this way by federal forces using this kind of militarized force. You know, restaurants and cafes and stores in some of our neighborhoods are suffering economically as the result of this fact. And all of this is in service of a reckless policy that is not in any way, shape or form making the city of Chicago or the Chicagoland area any more safe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump predicted Canada and the United States would ultimately reach a deal over punishing U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods, suggesting some amount of levies would remain in place, and was ambivalent about whether he remains committed to a trilateral trade pact with Mexico as the third partner. He spoke Tuesday ahead of a working lunch with Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House. Mr. Carney left the lunch and got into his motorcade at around 2:32. He did not respond to shouted questions about how the meeting was. Speaking in front of reporters earlier, Mr. Trump told told Mr. Carney that the U.S. and Canada have a “natural conflict” because the U.S. wants to stop importing cars from Canada. Still, Mr. Trump said, “we'll probably work that out” and the pair have “come a long way” in recent months. The President said that on trade “the U.S. was always giving everything to Canada” but Americans now “want to make our own steel” and autos. Instead, Mr. Trump said, he might do separate trade deals with Canada and Mexico. I want to make whatever the best deal is for this country, and also very much with Canada in mind.” Mr. Trump said he thinks the problem with Canada-U.S. trade is that the two countries are geographically close and so Canadian auto and steel production is not limited to domestic demand. He said this isn't as much of a problem for overseas trading partners. “In other countries, they're very far away, and there's no problem.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's second White House meeting is taking place as economic pressure on Canada mounts from U.S. President Donald Trump's punishing tariffs.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press Pete Hoekstra, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, last month talked of such an idea. U.S. tariffs rise to 27.5 per cent for each car beyond 100,000 units. The President also revived his longstanding complaints about Canada's supply-management system for dairy and eggs. Asked whether a new USMCA would include tariffs, Mr. Trump said “we're going to have tariff between Canada, you know they have them with us.” He cited dairy tariffs that he said can reach 300 per cent in some cases. Mr. Trump confirmed that he would work with Ottawa on joining his planned Golden Dome missile defence system. “One area where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome,” he said. “We'll be working together on a Golden Dome for the two countries.” Mr. Carney is under domestic pressure to reach a new economic and security deal with the U.S.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press “There are areas where we compete and it is in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” he said. Opinion: When Mark Carney visits Donald Trump, the best outcome might be none at all “This prospect of peace that you've made possible, Canada stands four-square behind those efforts,” he said. He also promised a deal that Canadians would be happy with. “I think the people of Canada, they will love us again,” Mr. Trump said. Canada faces a wide range of tariffs from Mr. Trump, including sector-specific levies on steel, aluminum, autos and lumber.Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Mr. Carney's second White House meeting is taking place as economic pressure on Canada mounts from the U.S. President's punishing tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump hailed Prime Minister Mark Carney as a 'world-class leader' on Tuesday. “A lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States, you know, everybody's moving back,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, adding federal officials were finding “billions of dollars that they didn't even know they had” because of the tariffs. Mr. Carney, who won April's election on a pledge to reach a new economic and security deal with the U.S., is under domestic pressure to deliver relief. But the template of trade deals Mr. Trump has struck in recent months with Britain, Vietnam, Japan and other countries has required U.S. trading partners to accept Mr. Trump's tariffs and make other concessions in exchange for not being hit with even higher tariffs. In recent days, the Trump administration has signalled that it might pursue separate trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico rather than keeping the deal trilateral. “If you look at NAFTA and then USMCA, it's almost like: why did we bundle it all together?” Jamieson Greer, the U.S. Trade Representative, told the Economic Club of New York last week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats have demanded that tax credits introduced in 2021 to make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans be extended, arguing that their expiration would double what low-and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act pay on their premiums next year. In a lengthy post on X, she wrote: “I'm going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children's insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district.” Republicans have said these negotiations can take place after a spending bill is passed and have repeatedly claimed that Democrats are trying to expand government subsidised healthcare, also known as Obamacare, to illegal migrants. “No, I'm not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games. I'm a Republican and won't vote for illegals to have any tax payer-funded healthcare or benefits,” she wrote. She added: “And I'm absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year.” As the shutdown enters its eighth day on Wednesday, flights have been delayed across the country owing to major airports facing staffing shortages. On Monday night, 12 federal aviation administration facilities saw personnel shortages, with control towers in Burbank, Phoenix and Denver announcing so-called staffing triggers, according to CNN. Other airports dealing with understaffing include Newark, New Jersey, Jacksonville, Florida, Chicago, Washington, DC and Indianapolis. Last time the government shut down in 2019, widespread flight delays caused by controllers calling in sick at high rates brought a swift end to the standoff. The delays came hours after Sean Duffy, the transport secretary, warned that a federal programme that subsides rural flights would run out of funding by Sunday, further threatening service. On Tuesday, Mr Trump dubbed the flight backlog “Democrat delays” and accused the opposition of pursuing a “kamikaze” policy by pushing for a government shutdown. “They're the ones that started it....and it's almost like a kamikaze attack by them,” he told reporters inside the Oval Office. Under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, furloughed government employees have previously been entitled to backpay once a shutdown comes to a close. Our view is: No, it doesn't,” a senior White House official told the news outlet. Democrats have so far weathered threats from Russ Vought, the White House budget director, to use the shutdown to implement mass lay-offs. After another vote in the Senate on Monday night failed to advance a stopgap spending bill, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said that if there are lay-offs “it falls on Donald Trump's shoulders”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The attorney for a woman who was shot by federal agents in Chicago over the weekend after she allegedly rammed a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicle has claimed that body-camera footage captures one of the officers saying: “Do something, bitch,” before opening fire, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Federal agents allege that the woman, 30-year-old Marimar Martinez, was involved in a vehicle chase that ended in her ramming a CBP vehicle. Authorities claim that a government vehicle carrying three border protection agents was followed and boxed in by a “convoy of civilian vehicles”, including cars driven by Martinez and another driver, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz. Both Martinez and Ruiz have been charged with “forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer”, according to the US justice department. On Monday, after Martinez's attorney disputed the government's portrayal of the case, a judge ordered her and Ruiz released from custody pending trial, ABC7 Chicago reported. They claim that Martinez and Ruiz drove into and struck the CBP vehicle, “leading to a temporary loss of control” of the car. She was transported to hospital and treated for gunshot wounds. However, the criminal complaint does not mention her being armed. “What I do know is – it was Ms Martinez who has seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent, who fired within seconds of getting out of this vehicle,” Parente said, as the Tribune reported. The body camera footage has not been made public. At the same hearing, the Chicago Tribune reported, assistant US attorney Sean Hennessy described Martinez and Ruiz's actions as “extremely dangerous and extremely reckless”. She's going to make contact,” before the car was indeed struck. He reportedly said that she has a concealed-carry permit and acknowledged that she did not brandish the gun during the interaction. The Trump administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago has been met with protests. Meanwhile, national guard troops from Texas were headed to Illinois after a federal judge declined to immediately block them in the wake of an Illinois lawsuit against the Trump administration. US district judge April Perry allowed the federal government to continue the troop deployment in Chicago while it responds to Illinois' suit.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian regions are dramatically increasing the amount of money they pay to new military recruits as analysts say “ideological” recruitment campaigns are no longer enough to motivate people to fight in Ukraine. Several regions announced in recent days they would as much as quadruple the sign-up bonuses in a bid to boost their recruitment numbers. Russia has been suffering enormous casualties in its war on Ukraine, with an estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the full-scale invasion three and half years ago. Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov made recruitment one of the military's top priorities during a high-level defense meeting in August, stressing that manpower was “key for supporting offensive operations.” Russian advance into Ukraine slowed in September, monitoring group says But while Belousov claimed recruitment targets were being met, the independent Russian investigative outlet IStories reported otherwise. It said that, based on official budget expenditure data, some 37,900 people signed contracts with the defense ministry in the second quarter of 2025 – two-and-a-half times fewer than a year ago. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russian force generation efforts were “increasingly resembling complex business models rather than an ideologically driven recruitment campaign.” In an analyst note in September, the ISW said Russian authorities and informal recruiters “continue to employ financial incentives, deception, and coercion” to bolster recruitment. The Tambov, Krasnodar, Kurgan and Altai regions, and the republic of Tatarstan, also announced significant increases in the payments, which come on top of the monthly salary for contract soldiers fighting in Ukraine. That starts at roughly 210,000 rubles ($2,600), more than double the average Russian wage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US has provided Israel with $21.7 billion in military assistance during the two years of the conflict in Gaza, a new report has said. The paper by the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson School of International and Public Affairs was released on Tuesday, the second anniversary of the October 7, 2023 incursion into Israel by Palestinian armed group Hamas, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage. Israeli airstrikes and a ground offensive in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, have left more than 67,000 people dead and almost 170,000 injured, according to the Palestinian health authorities. Last month, a UN commission described West Jerusalem's actions as “genocide.” The figure, which was based on open source data, did not include tens of billions of dollars worth of arms to be paid for and delivered in the coming years in line with deals earlier agreed between Washington and West Jerusalem, it added. The US weapons, including combat aircraft, helicopters, missiles and bombs, “have been central to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Police operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and beyond,” the report said. With their use, Israel “inflicted a devastating humanitarian toll on the people of Gaza,” with more than 10% of the Palestinian enclave's population being killed or injured and at least 5.27 million displaced in Gaza and the wider region, it stressed. Last week, US President Donald Trump, who has maintained the policy of arming Israel pursued by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, proposed a prisoner swap agreement between West Jerusalem and Hamas, which he claimed should pave the way for ending the conflict. Despite halting its advance on Gaza City, the IDF has ignored Trump's demand to immediately end airstrikes across the Palestinian enclave. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BELGRADE, October 7. The European Union will side with US restrictive measures against NIS company and JANAF, the Adriatic oil pipeline operator, will halt feedstock supplies in the near time, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters. "The Europeans will support US sanctions. I am absolutely confident that [the Croatian company] JANAF will stop oil supplies after some time," he said. In early January 2025, the US Department of the Treasury introduced sanctions against Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft, its CEO Alexander Dyukov, and against Serbian NIS. Main production facilities of NIS are in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Majority shareholders are Gazprom Neft (44.85%) and Serbia (29.87%). The JANAF oil pipeline links the terminal of the Croatian port of Omisalj with Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia. Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenkovic said earlier that 95% of oil consumed by Serbia are supplied over this pipeline. He also said that Zagreb expects changes in the NIS ownership structure to bring it out of US sanctions and continue cooperation with the JANAF.</p>

PARIS (AP) — UNESCO is slated to have its first director from the Arab world after an Egyptian former tourism and antiquities minister, Khaled el-Anani, was nominated by the agency's executive board Monday. If confirmed by UNESCO's general assembly next month, el-Anani will inherit an agency reeling from the Trump administration's recent decision to pull the United States out, portending a budget shortfall at the agency best known for its World Heritage sites around the globe. El-Anani was seen as the front-runner for the position of director-general and won a vote Monday against his only challenger, Firmin Edouard Matoko, an economist from Republic of Congo who promoted schooling in refugee camps. The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency's 194 member states, is expected to be finalized at a meeting of UNESCO's general assembly in Uzbekistan next month. Outgoing UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay notably led a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated under the Islamic State group. UNESCO has also long been plagued by accusations of mismanagement and waste. Trump argues that the agency, which voted in 2011 to admit Palestine as a member, is too politicized and anti-Israel. U.S. supporters of UNESCO, meanwhile, say withdrawing Washington's support allows China to play an outsized role in the world body. He served as minister of antiquities from 2016 to 2019, then led the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities for two years after the two portfolios were merged. Arab countries have long wanted to lead UNESCO. The African Union and Arab League are among those that expressed support for his bid. While he has no U.N. experience, his backers say that could help him make tough reform decisions. Firmin Matoko, 69, spent most of his career working for UNESCO, including stints in Rwanda soon after the genocide, during peace negotiations in El Salvador and beyond. He described helping train teachers at a refugee camp in Somalia in the 1990s, and meeting one of them years later after she became education minister. Both candidates pledged to tap more private sector money to make up for the loss of U.S. and other funding, continuing efforts started under Azoulay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JEREMY SHAPIRO is Research Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. After over a decade of conflict with Russia, including four years of all-out war, Ukraine understandably does not trust Moscow to abide by any cease-fire. Before Kyiv signs one, it wants assurances from its key partners that if Russia attacks again, Ukraine will not be left to fend for itself. Others have recommended stationing European troops in the country as a way to give such assurances teeth. NATO allies have steadfastly refused to intervene directly in the current war, so any promise they make to fight Russia in a new one is simply not believable. The Kremlin knows this better than anyone, and such bluffs will not deter it. American and European leaders can provide Ukraine with a real postwar guarantee. And that means committing to a more intense version of their current behavior in the event that Russia violates a cease-fire deal. In other words, should Moscow attack Ukraine again, the country's allies would reimpose sanctions on Russia, provide new financial support to Kyiv, and offer Ukraine military assistance that goes beyond what they would offer in peacetime. But if combined with peacetime measures that strengthen the Ukrainian military (which will remain Kyiv's primary source of deterrence), they will still affect the Kremlin's calculus. The United States and Europe, then, can help ensure that any renewed aggression is prohibitively costly for Russia, even without directly intervening. NATO countries have made enormous efforts to help Kyiv resist Moscow's invasion since it began February 2022. Among many other steps, they have levied progressively harsher sanctions on Russia, supplied Ukraine with vital intelligence, and given it sophisticated weapons (including air defenses). They have also declined to offer Kyiv membership in NATO. New pledges by a few European countries to deploy troops to Ukraine after a cease-fire agreement might suggest that this approach is shifting. Europe has refused to fight Moscow on Kyiv's behalf in this war, because it is not in the continent's core national security interests to do so. If France, the United Kingdom, or any other countries send troops and they come under Russian attack, they might well catch the next train out. The United States and Europe are not prepared to fight on Ukraine's behalf. The bilateral security agreements signed in 2024 between Ukraine and its key international partners have already committed multiple NATO members (including Washington) to consistently supply such assistance, both during the war and after it ends. But Ukraine also needs a promise that its partners will dramatically surge support in the event of future Russian aggression, and a structured process to ensure they make good on that pledge. The country's guarantors must signal to Moscow that renewed aggression will be met not just with Ukrainian resistance but with a massive intensification of external support. As part of any negotiated settlement with Moscow, the United States and Europe will likely agree to relieve some of their economic restrictions. Ukraine's allies could also pile on sanctions in escalating tiers should Russia continue its aggression. The first tier might freeze any Russian assets held abroad; the second could extend sanctions to shipping, insurance, and commodity trading; and another could impose secondary sanctions on entities in third countries, particularly those enabling Russia's war economy through oil and gas purchases (something that Washington and Europe have not been willing to do in the current war). Sanctions alone, of course, cannot stop Russia's tanks. If Moscow agrees to a cease-fire, the United States and Europe would shift away from flooding Ukraine with offensive arms and provide it with weapons that enable a porcupine type of defense-oriented strategy that incorporates air defenses, antitank systems, and drones. They will have to accelerate deliveries of combat aircraft, armor, long-range strike drones, and artillery. The sharing of intelligence for targeting Russian forces, suspended in peacetime, would resume. The last instrument of a credible security guarantee is financial help. War, after all, is as much a test of economic stamina as it is of battlefield performance, and Ukraine will need monetary assistance to stay afloat while fighting. The G-7 states should thus set up a standing Ukraine stabilization fund that can surge aid to Kyiv. But if Russia resumes its attacks, the fund would disperse large-scale budgetary support and finance military production, allowing Ukraine to keep fighting as long as necessary. Ukraine's guarantors should therefore set up a clear framework, agreed-on triggers, and financial and legal mechanisms that ensure each state meets its commitments. Ukraine's allies can accomplish this by codifying some of their commitments into law. Washington, for example, could pass legislation that triggers automatic sanctions against Russia and provides funds for Ukraine in case of renewed Russian aggression. But there are workarounds—namely, the body's qualified majority clauses—that EU member states can use to reimpose restrictions. The process of triggering these guarantees should be fast and direct. If Kyiv charges Moscow with violating the cease-fire, the guarantors' foreign ministers should meet within 48 hours to examine Ukraine's claims and pore over intelligence from a variety of sources. Otherwise, Russia might salami-slice its way across the cease-fire line without triggering consequences. To make sure that Ukraine quickly receives the military support it will need in the event of a renewed Russian assault, the United States and Europe should sign standing contracts with their defense industries to produce the long-range missiles, advanced aircraft, artillery systems, and other weapons necessary to support Kyiv. Likewise, NATO should make sure training centers in Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom always have room for Ukrainian troops, in case the war resumes and Kyiv needs to get its reserves into fighting shape. Finally, the United States and Europe must review this system regularly. But for Kyiv, those are illusions, not real options. These measures, by contrast, are credible precisely because NATO has already demonstrated its willingness to take them. They can, in other words, give Ukraine confidence that it will not be abandoned—without inspiring false hope. They can make clear to Russia that an attack will bring automatic punishment.
