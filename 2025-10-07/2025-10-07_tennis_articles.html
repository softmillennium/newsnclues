                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Valentin Vacherot was on the verge of tears on Tuesday when he advanced to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. The first Monegasque player to reach a tour-level quarter-final in history, the qualifier Vacherot ousted Tallon Griekspoor 4-6, 7-6(1), 6-4 after a topsy-turvy, two-hour, 22-minute battle that ended 10 minutes shy of 1 a.m. ‚ÄúIt means everything,‚Äù said Vacherot in disbelief. Vacherot entered the week at World No. 204, with just one career win at an ATP Tour event, having reached the second round of his home tournament, this year's Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. ‚ÄúThis is 100 per cent the reward, being on the bench six months last year [due to injury],‚Äù said Vacherot, who has ousted three seeded players consecutively: 14th seed Alexander Bublik, 20th seed Tomas Machac and 27th seed Griekspoor. ‚ÄúThankfully, I was able to play free since January. I had a nasty fall at Wimbledon in the [qualifying] first round, I was a few points from victory. Now this is the reward for everything I went through.‚Äù Vacherot will next meet 10th seed Holger Rune. Vacherot's cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, is also still alive in the tournament. Vacherot and Rinderknech both attended Texas A&M University, where they shared two seasons together (2016, 2017). Since 2022, Vacherot's half-brother, Benjamin Balleret, has been his full-time coach.
