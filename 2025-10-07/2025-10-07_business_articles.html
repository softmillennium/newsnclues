                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that some federal workers who have been furloughed during the government shutdown will not receive back pay after they return to work. The remark came hours after the circulation of a draft White House memo arguing that federal employees placed on unpaid leave are not guaranteed back pay. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in a shutdown guidance sheet issued last month, stated definitively that furloughed workers would be paid retroactively once the funding lapse ends. A federal law, which Trump signed after the last government shutdown in 2019, additionally says that furloughed U.S. government employees "shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations." Trump, when asked at the White House on Tuesday afternoon about back pay for those workers, said, "I would say it depends on who we're talking about." "But it really depends on who you're talking about," he said. "For the most part, we're going to take care of our people." Trump added, "There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way." When asked why he said some workers should not get their back pay, he said, "Ask the Democrats that question." The administration's signaling about workers' back pay has been widely viewed as an attempt to ratchet up pressure on Senate Democrats to vote for Republicans' proposal for a stopgap bill that will resume government funding at current levels until late November. The administration has previously warned that the shutdown will soon lead to thousands of federal workers being permanently laid off, rather than just furloughed, as has been the case in past funding lapses. Asked Tuesday how many permanent jobs are on the chopping block, Trump said he will be able to say "in four or five days, if this keeps going on." "It'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back," he added. They want any short-term resolution to include an extension of enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at year's end. Republicans, who hold a 53-seat majority in the Senate, need at least seven more votes to overcome the chamber's filibuster. The administration's scrutiny about back pay prompted a fiery response from the American Federation of Government Employees, a major federal workers' union. "The frivolous argument that federal employees are not guaranteed backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act is an obvious misinterpretation of the law," AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement. "It is also inconsistent with the Trump administration's own guidance from mere days ago, which clearly and correctly states that furloughed employees will receive retroactive pay for the time they were out of work as quickly as possible once the shutdown is over," he said. "It's long past time for these attacks on federal employees to stop and for Congress to come together, resolve their differences, and end this shutdown."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo said that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are "at a bubble," comparing it to the dotcom era. But one key difference in the market now, he said, is that large companies with "healthy balance sheets" are financing AI businesses. Bravo's private equity firm boasts more than $181 billion in assets under management as of June, and focuses on buying and selling enterprise tech companies, with a significant chunk of its portfolio invested in cybersecurity. Bravo told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday that investors can't value a $50 million annual recurring revenue company at $10 billion. "Even if the product is right, even if the market's right, that's a tall order, managerially." OpenAI recently finalized a secondary share sale that would value the ChatGPT-maker at $500 billion. The company is projected to make $13 billion in revenue for 2025. Nvidia recently said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, in part, to help the ChatGPT maker lease its chips and build out supercomputing facilities in the coming years. Other public companies have soared on AI promises, with Palantir's market cap climbing to $437 billion, putting it among the 20 most valuable publicly traded companies in the U.S., and AppLovin now worth $213 billion. Even early-stage valuations are massive in AI, with Thinking Machines Lab notching a $12 billion valuation on a $2 billion seed round. "Now you have some really big companies and some big balance sheets and healthy balance sheets financing this activity, which is different than what happened roughly 25 years ago," he said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told staff that the company will continue to sponsor H-1B visas and cover all associated costs following President Donald Trump's executive order last month that imposed a $100,000 fee on each new application. Huang reiterated his earlier support for the changes and shared personal reflections on immigration in the internal message, which Business Insider viewed. "As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we've found in America have profoundly shaped our lives," he wrote. "And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration." In his message to staff, Huang said "legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas," and that the Trump administration's "recent changes reaffirm this." Huang previously said on CNBC that he was "glad" to see Trump's executive order. Huang also acknowledged another critique in his podcast interview: that the $100,000 fees could have a more significant impact on cash-strapped startups than well-funded tech companies, which can more easily afford them. Critics argue that it could have the opposite effect, leading to increased hiring abroad. It's also one of the top sponsors of H-1B visas in the tech industry, with roughly 1,500 approvals in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle stock slipped 5% on Tuesday after a report from The Information that raised questions about the company's plans to buy billions of Nvidia chips to rent as a cloud provider to clients like OpenAI. Oracle had 14% gross margins on $900 million in sales in its Nvidia cloud business in the three months ending in August, according to the report, which cited internal documents. That's significantly lower than Oracle's overall gross margin of around 70%. The report said that Oracle's recent transformation into one of the most important cloud and artificial intelligence companies may run into profitability challenges because of how expensive Nvidia chips are and aggressive pricing on its AI chip rentals. In September, Oracle said that its backlog of cloud contracts, which it called remaining performance obligations, had jumped 359% in a year. Much of that forecasted revenue is from Oracle's role in the Stargate project, in which the enterprise vendor is working with OpenAI to open five massive data centers filled with AI chips from Nvidia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Los Angeles jury late on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from mesothelioma, finding the company liable in the latest lawsuit alleging its baby powder products cause cancer. The family of Mae Moore, who died in 2021, sued the company the same year, claiming Johnson & Johnson's talc baby powder products contained asbestos fibers that caused her rare cancer. The jury ordered the company to pay $16 million in compensatory damages and $950 million in punitive damages, according to court filings. The verdict could be reduced on appeal as the U.S. Supreme Court has found that punitive damages should generally be no more than nine times compensatory damages. Representatives for Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has said its products are safe, do not contain asbestos, and do not cause cancer. J&J stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a cornstarch product. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday stonewalled a question at a Senate Judiciary Committee about who ordered FBI agents to flag any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump during a review this year of investigative files about the late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein. Sen. Dick Durbin, in a letter in July, mentioned that purported order to FBI agents as he asked the Justice Department about past promises to release the Epstein files and a subsequent decision by Bondi not to do so. Durbin, D-Ill., asked Bondi at Tuesday's Judiciary Committee hearing. Boni bristled as she answered, "I'm not going to discuss anything about that with you, senator." Durbin, in his letter to the Justice Department, said that in March, hundreds of personnel in the New York field office of the FBI were assigned to review files related to Epstein. "Mr. Trump said of Mr. Epstein, 'I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,' " Durbin wrote. Durbin on Tuesday also asked Bondi why, in February, she had said that the so-called Epstein client list was sitting on her desk for her to review, when she eventually said she would not release the Epstein files. "I said I had not yet reviewed it, and if you see our memo on Epstein, you will see our memo on Epstein  clearly points out that there was no client list," Bondi replied. That joint Justice Department and FBI memo was released on July 7, months after the review of Epstein file documents. It concluded that there was no Epstein client list, and supported the long-standing official finding that Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in Manhattan in 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges. The Trump administration, for months, has faced criticism, including by some Republican allies in Congress, for its reneging on promises by Bondi and FBI officials to release the Epstein files. Some supporters of Trump have refused to believe there was no Epstein client list, which they suspect was a list of powerful or wealthy men who had sexual contact with girls and young women under his control, making those men vulnerable to blackmail or other pressure. Trump had been friends with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell for years before the two men fell out in the mid-2000s. Maxwell was convicted in 2022 at a federal trial in New York of charges related to procuring and grooming underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear Maxwell's appeal of that conviction. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla announced a new version of its full self-driving supervised technology Tuesday morning, but investors are looking for something bigger. Tesla posted a second clip to X on Sunday showing the outline of a vehicle's headlights in the dark. Investors expect a reveal of Tesla's stripped-down, lower-cost Model Y,  but are also hoping for updates on the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years. The company hasn't released a new model vehicle for sale since it began shipping the Cybertruck, its angular unpainted steel pickup, in late 2023. Musk originally promoted the Cybertruck at an "unveiling" event in 2019, where his demo went awry and he shattered a window. With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car business. The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, "We, Robot" event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000. As of the company's second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production. At an event in late 2017, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to "fly," and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor. Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade. The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like Alphabet's Waymo and Baidu's Apollo Go. In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla's Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they've yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots. Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

"It ended up being a cave in the middle of nowhere, and there was a handful of people there that they wanted us to take out," he said. See an extended interview with him for BI's video series "Authorized Account" below: During his time in the Air Force, Yackley said he logged over 3,000 combat hours as a drone sensor operator. People often have this misconception that the job is similar to a video game, but nothing could be further from the truth, Yackley said. "Back in 2013, I didn't have a clue what it was doing or how it was changing me," Yackley said. The US Air Force did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. After years on the job, Yackley was burned out. Yackley was on a team that worked 24 hours around the clock, divided into three groups, each working 8-hour shifts. To ensure that no one group was on the midnight shift for too long, each group rotated to a new shift every seven weeks. Yackley was on this rotating shift schedule for years. "The shift work in itself was just grueling," Yackley said. An estimated 64.3% of active-duty servicemembers do not get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, according to the DOD's most recently available Health Related Behaviors Survey, published in 2018. And studies have found that sleep deprivation increases the risk of PTSD, which Yackley said he has. It's difficult for me to talk to family about it, because unless somebody actually sat in that box and did the job, they don't understand. They can try to, but most of the time it ends up doing more harm than good — trying to relate to it instead of just being supportive in the moment," he added. In May, Yackley founded the organization Remote Warrior to help spread awareness about drone operators' mental health.</p>

A stated goal of President Donald Trump's ambitious tariff policy was to reduce the United States' trade deficits around the world, but at least one has ballooned this year: the travel trade deficit. When it comes to travel, that means when Americans are spending more money on travel abroad than international visitors are spending in the United States. According to the US Travel Association's travel forecast released last week, the travel trade deficit for 2025 was on track to be nearly $70 billion, as international visitors have pulled back on visiting the United States. Travel is a major export for the United States. While exports are often thought of as physical products that are shipped abroad, such as crude oil or cars, they also include services produced domestically and consumed by foreigners. Historically, the industry has produced a trade surplus, meaning that foreigners spent more visiting the United States than Americans spent abroad on travel. But at the same time that international inbound travel has declined, the number of Americans traveling abroad has continued to increase. In April, after international travel to the United States experienced a decline, the US Travel Association said the country was running at a $50 billion travel trade deficit, marking "a sharp reversal from our historical surplus in travel exports." In 2022, the United States had a $3.5 billion travel trade surplus, according to data from the US Department of Commerce. United States border towns and business owners recently told Business Insider they are feeling the economic impact of fewer Canadian visitors. There are a couple of major travel events coming up next year that could help reverse the decline in international visitors to the United States: the FIFA World Cup and celebrations for America's 250th birthday. The US Travel Association said it expects international visitation to resume growth as a result of these events. However, it also said the United States is at risk of further deterring international visitors due to "potential increases in visa fees, extended wait times for visa applications and renewals, and negative sentiment towards the U.S. in key markets."</p>

When Sriram Krishnan, a senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, appeared onstage at an event in Washington last month, he listed the Trump administration's priorities for advancing the AI revolution. "Let's make sure we build our infrastructure," Krishnan said. That rallying cry is echoing across Silicon Valley. Executives at Meta say they expect to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure, including massive data centers, through 2028. OpenAI and Oracle have announced plans to put $500 billion into a data center project dubbed Stargate, while Amazon plans to spend more than $30 billion on capital expenditures, or capex, in each of the next two quarters. If it doesn't, the fallout could reshape the economy — from stock market crashes to communities left with vast, vacant data centers. The investigation found 1,240 data centers in America already built or approved for construction at the end of 2024, an almost fourfold increase since 2010. The data didn't include any projects that received permits this year. This year, four of the five biggest energy users from our tally, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google, could spend an estimated $320 billion on capex, primarily for AI infrastructure, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 19% this year, with Nvidia, the world's largest company by market capitalization, Google, and Microsoft all up more than 25%. Oracle has seen its stock rise 75% this year. The money spent this year on AI infrastructure and software has contributed more to GDP growth than consumer spending, according to Renaissance Macro Research's reading of Bureau of Economic Analysis data. It's a construction boom unlike any in living memory, transforming landscapes, drawing on scarce water resources, and taxing America's already strained electricity grid. "A lot of people have compared the AI era to things like the railway build-out, because it is a very capital-intensive build-out," Friar told Yahoo Finance. We've maybe laid some track from New York to Baltimore, but we're ultimately going to blanket the US, and ultimately blanket the world." AI agents and custom models could form the basis of steady, high-margin subscription products. The AI infrastructure boom is built on a fundamental assumption about how machines learn best. The approach involves feeding massive amounts of data into large language models, which then look for patterns, or signals, buried in the noise. To improve, the theory goes, the models must ingest and analyze increasing amounts of data, which requires more and more computing power. That need for scale has shaped the competitive landscape. If better models depend on more computing power, the obvious next step is to secure as much of it as possible. And that means more data centers — large warehouses filled with graphics processing units, or GPUs, that handle the complex computations required. In a recent blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman imagined what might be possible if AI systems had virtually unlimited computing power. AI could cure cancer or give every student on Earth a personalized tutor. Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus of psychology and neural science and a vocal critic of Silicon Valley's approach to developing AI, has argued against the strategy that building bigger is better. Marcus has repeatedly argued that the fundamental theory driving Big Tech companies to build computing capacity, the scaling laws, is wrong. "'Scaling' used to mean 'I can predict pretty much exactly how well a given LLM will do, by knowing the size of its database and the amount of compute being used to train it, and those increases will be exponential." OpenAI's August launch of GPT-5, its latest model, underscored Marcus' skepticism, as many perceived it as an incremental step and a challenge to the idea that adding more computing power makes better models. The leading language models still make simple mistakes, or hallucinations, that hurt their reliability. The problem persists even as companies have poured exponentially more computing power into training them, according to Bain & Company. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report this summer suggesting 95% of early corporate AI initiatives had yet to deliver a return. Tech stocks briefly slumped on the report, among other reasons. With its utility still in question, it's not clear when or if the revenue to come from AI products will justify its spending. Bain estimates that by 2030, annual capex spending will be $500 billion to meet the industry's computing needs. That's about $800 billion more than companies can save by using AI to make sales, marketing, customer support, and R&D more efficient. In other words, the consulting firm concluded, the industry will come up short unless it can find new products or services to sell. In September, Friar, OpenAI's CFO, said the company will triple revenue this year to about $13 billion. That same month, the company agreed to pay Oracle an average of $60 billion a year for data center capacity — nearly five times more than it expects to bring in. McKinsey & Company acknowledged, in an April report about capex spending, the difficult position the industry is in: Spend too little and risk missing out on a technology that may be one of the most transformative in history. "Overinvesting in data center infrastructure risks stranding assets, while underinvesting means falling behind." Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it more bluntly when he admitted how much money he was prepared to waste to win the AI arms race. "If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate," Zuckerberg told a podcast interviewer. Companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing spent tens of billions of dollars in the five years through 2001 laying fiber optic cables and installing other networking capabilities, only to crash the following year when the dot-com bust led lenders who had financed the construction to demand their money. While the fiber optic cable was eventually put to use, largely by the streaming video revolution pioneered by Netflix, many of the companies that laid it weren't around to see it. Like fiber optic cables and the railroads of an earlier era, data center construction and the purchase of GPUs are being financed by Wall Street. Some of the money is coming through familiar channels. Oracle recently sold $18 billion worth of bonds to finance its data center expansion plans, while data center upstart CoreWeave, which went public in March, has tapped the public debt and equity markets to the tune of $25 billion since last year to fund its own expansion. Increasingly, companies are also turning to less traditional lenders. Meta recently raised $29 billion for its latest data center project from firms including the Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. When Meta CFO Susan Li was asked about the company's plans for non-traditional financing methods at a recent conference, she said the company had built its own data centers for most of its history. Once a project is built and leased, they're turning the leasing revenue into bonds and selling to investors eager to be part of the AI boom. That frees up more money to put into future projects and fuels the spending, even if demand for mature data center projects starts to wane, said Paul Kedrosky, a financial blogger and advisor to hedge funds who recently wrote about the development. "Developers build data centers, lease access to hyperscalers, and then package the rental income into bonds. Proceeds are recycled into the next round of construction," Kedrosky wrote on his website. Increasingly, Silicon Valley itself is helping to finance the boom. In September, Nvidia agreed to invest $100 billion into OpenAI to help with its data center build-out, with the expectation that OpenAI would turn around and use the money to purchase Nvidia's GPUs for its data centers. On Monday, chipmaker AMD announced that OpenAI has agreed to buy GPUs to power as many as 6 gigawatts of computing capacity in return for a warrant that would give OpenAI a 10% stake in the chipmaker if it hits certain milestones. The circular flow of money is yet another element of the AI infrastructure bet that underscores its scale, as well as its risks. Even proponents of AI say the math is daunting. "We are bullish on this in a big way," said David Crawford, the chairman of Bain's technology practice. "The point we were trying to make is that it's expensive."</p>

It's true that consumer spending represents a significant share of the economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the country's GDP. A consumer slowdown is never the precipitating cause of an economic slump. When Americans stop spending, by that time, it's already too late. For starters, consumption has managed to grow modestly in previous economic slumps. In other words, during those recessions, the best that spending could do was to help economic conditions from deteriorating further, cushioning the blow rather than preventing it altogether. In other periods of negative growth, consumption declined substantially, so that on average, its contribution to GDP during recessions is close to zero. Next, consumption has never declined before an economic slump; it's always happened after the economy began to go into the tank. Therefore, the growth in recent quarters does not look especially unusual. Let's deepen this analysis by breaking out the various types of major spending: durable goods, such as washing machines and TVs; nondurable goods like T-shirts and groceries; and services, encompassing everything from restaurants to movie tickets. Prior to previous recessions, the most common signal from these categories was Americans cutting back on big-ticket durables rather than cutting spending in service industries. So far this year, spending on durables has been about flat. At the very least, this suggests a degree of caution among Americans when it comes to making big-ticket spending decisions that could portend more trouble coming down the line. One confounding variable, of course, is the degree to which President Donald Trump's herky-jerky tariff announcements are influencing the data, creating a push and pull in consumer behavior regarding durables. The threat of tariffs may have prompted people to pull forward activity, making big purchases before anticipated price hikes, while the hope for tariff removals might cause consumers to wait it out. This suggests that if you're waiting for the consumer to make a call about a turn in the business cycle, you're likely waiting too long. Despite this, the unemployment rate rose by 0.3 percentage points in each of those two years. So far this year, the unemployment rate is on track to increase by another 0.3 percentage points. Key areas of the jobs market appear to be slowing. First, the bulk of recent job growth has been in industries that are not correlated with the economic cycle, such as healthcare. And even in those still-expanding sectors, growth has been slowing lately. Third, despite "loose" financial conditions, such as a rising stock market and falling interest rates, which are generally thought to be supportive of hiring, labor markets have now reached a point where the level of unemployment exceeds the number of job vacancies. If consumption is the end-all and be-all of employment ("sell more stuff, hire more people"), why has the labor market slowed to begin with? During a recession, nonresidential business investment — which excludes spending on homebuilding — always contracts, while residential investment almost always declines (2001 was the lone exception). And, bad news, residential investment has been contracting for five of the last six quarters. When it comes to the drop in homebuilding investment, there is some possibility of a false signal. However, there are some important distinctions between then and now that make this current decrease more concerning. There are reasons to assume that the slowdown in residential construction might matter a little more for the broader outlook than it did before. Indeed, a crude analysis suggests that more layoffs could be on the way for residential construction jobs. As of August 2025, the ratio of people employed in residential construction to housing permits stands at 2.5, the highest level since 2012. This ratio is about 10% higher than its average in 2024, meaning there is likely a large pool of construction workers waiting around to do something. There's no need to hold onto workers who are not doing anything. To return this ratio to its 2024 average, assuming the number of new monthly permits issued stays steady, implies a decline of 304,000 jobs. Even if this is even half-right, it's still a significant headwind, considering private employment is running at just 30,000 a month to begin with. In my client meetings, the pushback to these concerns typically goes like this: AI is booming, stocks are up, and wealthy consumers are still doing well. I really believe those three bright spots are, at their core, a single story. And even as this asset-driven boom has marched on, that has not kept broader labor market conditions from continuing to worsen. So, if you're banking on the consumer to simply hold everything up, you might be late to catch a more material slowdown in the economy. Neil Dutta is head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research.

Athletes on TikTok have posted videos about how "mum and dad are fighting," referring to how two of the biggest names in the fitness sphere have clashed, and how it might impact their user experience. Holly Brooks, an LA-based fitness influencer, joked that while the internet was invested in the Taylor Swift-Charlie XCX drama, from Swift's newly released album, "there's other drama going on on the internet." "Mum and Dad are fighting — Strava and Garmin have fallen out," she said in her video, which has been viewed more than half a million times as of press time. If they go through, changes to Garmin and Strava's partnerships will come at an inconvenient time. The turnout for these races is huge. Another TikTok user, Rebecca, who posts videos of her runs, also commented on the Strava-Garmin dispute. "When Garmin is going to stop uploading data to Strava on November 1st and that's literally the date of your marathon you've been training for your big PR for," she wrote in the caption of her video, which has over 600,000 views as of press time. In the lawsuit, Strava's lawyers said Garmin, which makes fitness watches and wearables, developed heatmap tracking services that rivaled its own, violating a 2015 "Master Cooperation Agreement" between the two companies. In a Reddit post on October 2, Strava's product chief, Matt Salazar, also commented on Garmin's new guidelines, which note that apps using Garmin device-sourced data must display the tech company's logo clearly. He said Garmin had given Strava until November 1 to comply with its new guidelines, or risk "stopping all Garmin activities from being uploaded to Strava." These new guidelines actively degrade your user experience on Strava," Salazar said in the Reddit post. Garmin, a Kansas-based corporation, saw its stock price rise by over 50% in the past year. Strava, a private company, has 150 million users in more than 185 countries, per its website. It works on a freemium model, providing basic features for free and charging for advanced features like route suggestion and training plans.</p>
