                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Institutional capital is quietly turning to Bitcoin (BTC-USD)and this time, it's not through miners or ETFs. Bermuda-based Meanwhile, a life insurer that writes policies entirely in Bitcoin, has raised $82 million from a powerhouse roster including Apollo (NYSE:APO), Northwestern Mutual, Pantera Capital, Stillmark, Bain Capital, and Haun Ventures. Founded in 2023, the firm lends clients' Bitcoin to large, regulated financial institutions instead of speculating on price. CEO Zac Townsend said Meanwhile is now one of the largest lenders of Bitcoin in the world at duration, meaning over longer time periods rather than short-term trades. What makes Meanwhile stand out is how it blends traditional insurance design with the tax efficiency and autonomy of digital assets. Townsend described the firm as an institutional private credit player, not a hedge fund, positioning its Bitcoin-denominated policies as a bridge between crypto liquidity and old-world finance. This is such an institutional year for Bitcoin, he said, adding that demand is now coming from life insurers and retirement platforms seeking regulated, audited crypto exposure. The latest round follows a $40 million Series A announced just six months ago, led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, bringing total capital raised to over $120 million. Townsend declined to share a new valuation but said the funds will help expand institutional servicing capacity. Bain Capital's Stefan Cohen said the timing couldn't be better. As Bitcoin evolves into a more mature collateral asset, he noted, investors will increasingly want financial productslike life insuranceexpressed not in fiat, but in Bitcoin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India plans to roll out an RBI-backed digital currency for faster, safer, and transparent payments while limiting private crypto use. The RBI is a state-backed initiative designed to make transactions faster, safer and more transparent. Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal announced the move during his recent visit to Qatar. He explained that the project will be supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and will work as a reliable alternative to cash-based payments. The central bank has long been skeptical about privately issued cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. RBI officials have warned that unregulated assets pose risks to financial stability and investor safety. While the government has not banned crypto trading, it discourages its use by imposing strict rules and heavy taxes. India's new RBI digital currency aims to be a regulated alternative. Goyal noted that the system's traceability can also help prevent illegal activities like money laundering. Despite India's role in crypto adoption, the government has made it clear that private cryptocurrencies will remain under tight restrictions. Moreover, Investors cannot offset losses from crypto against other forms of income. This heavy taxation, combined with strong anti–money laundering rules, has limited mainstream adoption. Several users have even reported bank account freezes linked to peer-to-peer crypto transactions. RBI's focus on its new digital currency shows its intention to provide a safer, compliant digital payment option while keeping privately issued tokens on the sidelines. This initial rollout targeted wholesale transactions between banks and aimed to reduce interbank settlement costs. A new pilot for deposit tokenisation is also set to begin soon, using the wholesale CBDC as its foundational layer. Goyal noted that, unlike stablecoins, which are often tied to private issuers or specific assets, India's RBI digital currency will rely on direct central bank backing. He says that this difference will enhance trust and set the cryptocurrency up as a secure alternative for daily transactions. The Indian government has repeatedly said it neither encourages nor outright bans crypto. “People can trade crypto at their own risk,” Goyal stated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin slipped today, retreating from a record high as the U.S. government shutdown entered its seventh day. Bitcoin edged down to the $121,000 range, and remains below Monday's all-time peak of $126,296, per Bitbio data. Gold, meanwhile, continued its historic rally, briefly topping $4,000 per ounce overnight, with futures trading at $3,980 early Tuesday, reflecting a 50% gain for the year. Analysts say Bitcoin's recent correction — from its all-time high down to around $122,000 — is healthy and may be setting the stage for further gains. “Overall, dips are for buying,” said market analyst Mags on X, noting that a daily close above $123,300 could trigger additional upside. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin's relative strength index has risen from 44 to 66 over the past week, signaling growing market confidence. Glassnode also noted that bitcoin futures open interest surged as traders added longs during the breakout to new highs. The current pullback is testing these positions, and watching where buyers step in will reveal if support levels can attract renewed demand. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, suggested last week that Bitcoin could reach $135,000 soon and possibly $200,000 by year-end if current conditions persist. As mentioned earlier, gold continues its surge, supported by central bank purchases, dollar weakness, and expectations of future Fed easing. Investors appear to be positioning for an extended period of policy uncertainty, with both bitcoin and traditional safe havens benefiting from market jitters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology is currently witnessing a historic moment as gold-backed crypto tokens have surged past an unprecedented $3 billion in market capitalization. This remarkable milestone coincides with a record-breaking rally in physical gold, which on October 7, 2025, briefly topped $4,007 per ounce for the first time ever. The dual surge underscores a profound shift in investor sentiment, driven by escalating global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, pushing both institutional and retail investors towards the perceived safety of precious metals, now increasingly accessible through digital assets. This convergence highlights a growing appetite for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a novel blend of gold's enduring stability with the liquidity and transparency of blockchain. While traditional safe-haven assets typically attract demand during turbulent times, the rapid ascent of tokenized gold suggests a new paradigm for hedging against inflation and market volatility, presenting both significant opportunities and complex challenges for the broader financial ecosystem. The market capitalization for tokenized gold has reached a staggering $3.02 billion, with reports indicating it briefly touched $3.04 billion, marking a significant leap from previous highs. Other tokens like Kinesis Gold (KAU) and Quorium (QGOLD) have also experienced substantial increases, with all four major tokens seeing their value rise by 40% or more over the past 12 months. This surge is not merely speculative; trading volumes for PAXG and XAUT have spiked dramatically, with monthly turnover for both exceeding $3.2 billion in September, reflecting robust demand. The primary drivers behind this digital gold rush are multifaceted. Investors are increasingly seeking stable alternatives amidst a backdrop of global economic uncertainty, persistent inflation concerns, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and Taiwan. The advantages of tokenization are also playing a crucial role, offering fractional ownership that makes gold more accessible and affordable to a wider range of investors. Furthermore, these digital assets eliminate the logistical concerns of physical storage and security, provide increased liquidity with 24/7 trading, and offer enhanced transparency through blockchain technology, effectively combining gold's traditional stability with crypto's technological efficiencies. The broader trend of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which has seen its market capitalization reach $21.6 billion, provides a fertile ground for the continued expansion of gold-backed tokens. Simultaneously, the physical gold market is experiencing an unprecedented rally. In India, MCX gold futures also reached a new record of ₹1,20,900 per 10 grams. This rally is fueled by a confluence of global factors including heightened geopolitical tensions, concerns over global economic stability, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has amplified fiscal stability worries. Aggressive gold purchases by global central banks, driven by strategic diversification away from dollar-denominated assets and de-dollarization efforts, have also provided consistent support, with central banks acquiring over 1,000 tons of gold in 2024 for the third consecutive year. The persistent inflation concerns and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts further enhance gold's appeal as a non-yielding asset, while a weakening U.S. dollar makes the metal more attractive to international buyers. Gold, and by extension gold-backed tokens, are serving as crucial hedges against market volatility and inflation, driving a notable shift in investor sentiment towards safety. Companies at the forefront of tokenized gold issuance are clear beneficiaries, experiencing substantial growth in market share and trading volume. Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of Tether Gold (XAUT), and Paxos Trust Company (PAXG), are seeing their platforms gain significant traction, validating their early bets on real-world asset tokenization. Their ability to provide a liquid, accessible, and transparent digital representation of gold positions them as key players in this evolving financial landscape. This trend could also benefit blockchain infrastructure providers and crypto exchanges that list these tokens, as increased trading activity translates into higher fees and greater network utilization. Similarly, precious metals Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE Arca: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE Arca: IAU) are experiencing significant inflows, reflecting increased investor demand for convenient exposure to gold without the complexities of physical ownership. These traditional avenues remain popular, even as digital alternatives gain prominence. Traditional gold custodians and vaulting services might face increasing competition from tokenized solutions if the market continues its shift towards digital ownership, although the physical gold still needs to be stored somewhere. The rise of gold-backed tokens could also subtly impact the demand dynamics for fiat-backed stablecoins, as investors seeking stability might diversify into commodity-backed digital assets. The long-term success of tokenized gold relies on robust regulatory frameworks and continued investor trust, which will be crucial for all stakeholders. The surge in gold-backed crypto tokens and the accompanying gold rally signify more than just a fleeting market event; they point to a fundamental shift in broader industry trends and global financial dynamics. This phenomenon is a powerful testament to the burgeoning Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization movement, where tangible assets are brought onto the blockchain, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. The success of gold-backed tokens is likely to catalyze the tokenization of other commodities, real estate, and even intellectual property, creating a more interconnected and efficient global asset market. This trend could significantly impact decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offering them more stable and diversified collateral options beyond native cryptocurrencies. While some may view tokenized assets as a threat, many are likely to explore integration, offering hybrid products that combine the security of traditional banking with the efficiencies of blockchain. This could lead to partnerships between financial giants and blockchain technology firms, accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Furthermore, the strong central bank buying of physical gold, driven by de-dollarization efforts, underscores a significant geopolitical trend. Nations are strategically diversifying their reserves away from the U.S. dollar, seeking to reduce reliance on a single currency and mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations and sanctions. Issues such as investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and the legal status of underlying assets need to be addressed comprehensively. The lack of consistent global regulation poses challenges and risks, but also presents an opportunity for jurisdictions that adopt progressive and clear frameworks to become hubs for RWA tokenization. Historically, gold has always been a safe haven during times of crisis. However, the integration of blockchain technology adds a new dimension, potentially making this era of gold appreciation unique in its accessibility and global reach, blurring the lines between traditional and digital asset markets. In the short term, the ongoing global economic uncertainties, persistent inflation, and geopolitical tensions are likely to sustain demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. The U.S. government shutdown, if prolonged, will further fuel this demand by eroding confidence in fiscal stability. Expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, making non-yielding assets like gold more attractive, are also a significant near-term driver. However, some analysts warn of "extremely overbought" conditions for gold, exceeding levels seen at the 2011 peak, which could signal a risk of significant correction if market sentiment shifts or if there's a resolution to current crises. This will necessitate strategic pivots from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain companies. This creates significant market opportunities for innovators in blockchain technology, security solutions, and regulatory compliance, as the infrastructure for a robust tokenized asset ecosystem continues to evolve. Potential scenarios range from a sustained, albeit volatile, rally in gold prices, propelled by ongoing global instability and central bank diversification, to periods of consolidation or correction if economic conditions stabilize or if a coordinated global regulatory framework introduces new complexities. Investors should watch for further regulatory clarity, technological advancements in blockchain security, and the continued adoption of RWA tokenization by major financial players, as these factors will shape the future of this evolving market. The continued aggressive buying by central banks, coupled with persistent inflation concerns and anticipated monetary policy shifts, will provide a strong underlying support for gold prices. However, the market should also be prepared for potential volatility and corrections, especially given the rapid ascent and "overbought" conditions reported by some analysts. The long-term trajectory appears bullish for tokenized assets, as they offer unique advantages in terms of fractional ownership, liquidity, and ease of transfer, making gold more democratized than ever before. For investors, the message is clear: gold, in both its physical and tokenized forms, continues to serve as a critical portfolio diversifier and a hedge against uncertainty. Investors should closely monitor global geopolitical developments, central bank policies, and the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto's quest to imbue shareholder protections for tokens A little-known privacy project, Umbra, launched its initial coin offering (ICO) on Solana yesterday. As I write this, Umbra is already 1169% oversubscribed over its $750K raise target. A lot has already been written on the intersection of crypto and futarchy by people smarter than me, but here's the gist: Futarchy is the simple idea that governance should be decided by markets, rather than “one man, one vote” democratic rules, or DAO token voting. If you believe Donald Trump will spur economic growth more than Joe Biden, buying “Pass Trump” shares will get him elected if enough traders buy it past a set threshold. Or if you believe Facebook spending $50 billion on investments in the metaverse will not improve Meta's stock price, then do the opposite and buy “Fail” shares. The key difference is that with futarchy, actual outcomes are influenced by how markets “vote.” This radical idea was popularized by the libertarian economist Robin Hanson and has existed for years as a topic of nerdy fascination in technolibertarian circles. (Hanson, incidentally, was also responsible for advancing many of crypto's major innovations, like automated market makers and prediction markets.) For some time, DAOs like Drift, Sanctum and Marinade have experimented with piecemeal futarchy governance using MetaDAO's core protocol. By launching on MetaDAO's ICO launchpad, teams like Umbra in effect bind its entire governance to a futarchy model from day one. This can change, but only if markets vote on it to pass. Secondly, the team agrees to subject its treasury and all intellectual property — domain names, Discord and Twitter accounts, brand names — to ownership under a DAO LLC legal entity headquartered in the Marshall Islands, executed by MetaDAO themselves. This ensures that whatever happens onchain is legally binding in the real world. The first criterion primarily serves to align long-term incentives between founders and tokenholders, avoiding situations where founding teams have quietly abandoned projects with huge controlled allocations. Most founders want control for obvious reasons and I would like to give them as much control as possible while still maintaining the properties that make tokens unruggable,” Proph3t tells me. In return for binding their hands to a futarchy-based governance model, founding teams can signal legitimacy by advertising their tokens as protected by traditional “shareholder protections”. But whether or not you believe these protections are robust depends on whether you believe market forces can make the right governance decisions. In April, mtnCapital ran the first ICO on MetaDAO's futarchy launchpad, raising ~$5.7 million USDC. That decision was made by tokenholders, as opposed to the mtnCapital investment team that could have quietly abandoned the project, or conjure an endless string of amorphous reasons for why their strategy “needed more time”. Futarchy isn't a guarantee that the business will succeed; it serves as a safeguard against the kinds of plutocratic rent-seeking that DAOs have been plagued with for years. That is set to change in the near future with MetaDAO taking a 25 bps take-rate on its futarchy AMM. Updated 10/7/25 at 1:35 pm ET to correct a typo in Umbra's raise target.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto rally took a pause on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$111,480.33 quickly pulling back from record highs above $126,000 as analysts pointed to signs of crypto rally overheating, at least in the short run. If the price action in bitcoin appears familiar, that's because it is. Despite a 31% gain year-to-date, bitcoin has given bulls very little chance to bask in their wins. Each record high has seemingly been met with a quick and viscous sell-off. July's first move above $123,000 was met with about a 10% decline over the following few days. Derivatives market and ETF inflows also got overheated, said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. The surge was driven by widespread long positioning betting on higher prices without a clear macro catalyst, laying the ground for a pullback. "Historically, similar bursts in exposure have often coincided with local tops, and the current setup suggests a temporarily overheated market with elevated risk of short-term consolidation," Lunde said. He now believes the neutral rate should stand at 0.5%. Miran's comments suggest that long-term forces shaping the U.S. economy are changing. A smaller labor pool could limit growth, while rising fiscal pressures might keep the Fed's balancing act between inflation and employment more complex. His remarks come as policymakers debate how much room the central bank has to cut rates without reigniting price pressures. Miran also noted that economic growth in the first half of the year was weaker than anticipated, weighed down by uncertainty over trade and tax policy. But Miran struck a more positive tone for the months ahead, saying much of that uncertainty has now cleared. “With clearer policy signals, I expect a steadier pace of growth,” he said. The broad pullback in crypto prices is hitting the related stocks, led by a 7% decline in Strategy (MSTR) and a 4% loss for Coinbase (COIN). Combined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025 The crypto broke through multiple support levels on high volume.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retail investors only gained access once the tokens were available for public trading. To address this disparity in crypto token sales, Kraken Launch offers retail crypto access to upcoming ICO projects with the same level of fairness and transparency as institutional players. By democratizing crypto fundraising, Kraken ensures that ICO participation is accessible to committed investors, not just organizations with substantial capital. As an innovative ICO participation platform, Kraken Launch is built on a few foundational principles. Kraken Launch, through an exclusive Legion partnership, is built on smarter fundraising technology that emphasizes regulatory compliance and investor responsibility. It integrates the Legion Score, a merit-based model that ensures presale token allocations are distributed to participants who actively support projects. Legion's advantage is that it helps projects distribute tokens during early fundraising rounds to a select group of users. The Legion Score helps teams gain token holders based on social activity, on-chain activity, and community contributions, as a portion of every token sale is reserved for investors based on merit score. Together with Legion, Kraken Launch creates a win-win scenario for retail investors and crypto project teams. “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. O'Connor also noted that Legion's technology could reshape future capital formation, suggesting that “the next Figma or Reddit may choose to launch directly to its community onchain rather than through a traditional IPO.” Other platforms typically use a more centralized structure when offering presale tokens. Additionally, Kraken is known for its long-standing regulatory compliance, which aligns with Legion's compliance-first approach. Both presale investors and ICO project teams can be confident that their fundraising efforts adhere to clear regulatory frameworks. In partnership with Legion, Kraken has taken another step toward empowering individual investors by providing fair and transparent ICO participation.

Nations are currently competing to harness the power of artificial intelligence and digitalisation. For the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan, it's also a means to branch out from its raw materials-based economy, a model which cannot last forever. The country has made digitalisation and AI development the centrepiece of its national strategy, which Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced in his September public address. “I have set the strategically important task of transforming Kazakhstan into a fully-fledged digital country within three years,” he stated. Another bold step for Kazakhstan is a proposed law on artificial intelligence, which regulates 'high-risk' systems and mandates the labelling of AI-generated content. “We should not let ethical norms fall behind this rapid evolution,” Tokayev warned at the recent United Nations General Assembly, aligning Kazakhstan's stance with the European Union's approach to responsible AI. At the same time, Astana is experimenting with digital finance. Another way Kazakhstan aims to position itself as the digital hub of Eurasia is by introducing a focus on AI in education. The Alem.ai International Centre for Artificial Intelligence, launched on 2 October, will spearhead this transition by designing AI tools for policymaking, data analysis and forecasting. Kazakhstan's digital transformation also carries a geopolitical weight. Positioned between China, Russia, and Europe, the country is balancing partnerships while asserting digital sovereignty — welcoming Western data firms, cooperating with Chinese researchers, and nurturing its own AI ecosystem. This multi-vector approach mirrors Astana's broader foreign policy and places Kazakhstan among a small group of nations embedding AI into their institutional fabric. The challenge now is to turn bold reforms into tangible progress that strengthens competitiveness without losing control of the rapid technological shift.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The main driver behind this milestone appears to be ongoing whale accumulation. Their appetite for HYPER tokens has become a defining trend over the past week, showing growing conviction among deep-pocketed investors. This steady buying indicates that whales see something potentially massive in Bitcoin Hyper, and these successive purchases and visible FOMO suggest expectations of a much larger move ahead – especially once the project moves past the presale stage. For retail investors, on-chain whale accumulation offers a clear signal that current prices may represent one of the most favorable entry points. Over the past seven days, Bitcoin Hyper has continued to break milestones at a rapid pace. From $18.8M on September 29, the project has crossed $19M, $20M, $21M, and finally $22M by Monday. That translates to $3.3M in new funding within a single week. Each of these jumps has been fueled by large-scale investors joining the trend. Soon after, two more whales collectively acquired 25.65M HYPER valued at $333,000. Those who typically move with deeper insight and data are positioning early for what could become one of the most influential projects shaping Bitcoin's next phase, particularly in the development of hybrid Layer-2 applications that combine Solana's speed with Bitcoin's security. When a network prioritizes security and decentralization, it often sacrifices scalability. Ethereum has made significant progress toward solving this issue through Layer-2 solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, which enhance scalability while maintaining Ethereum's base-layer security. However, most of these networks still rely on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which is designed for broad compatibility but is limited by its sequential transaction processing. For applications to truly perform at scale, they need speed, efficiency, and high throughput – exactly the kind of environment that can be built once Bitcoin Hyper is fully deployed. Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which processes multiple transactions simultaneously, Bitcoin Hyper is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, far beyond the EVM's sequential limits. That's where Bitcoin Hyper's architecture stands out – its execution layer is fast, but it remains anchored to the Bitcoin base chain, the most decentralized and secure network in existence. This combination is why Bitcoin Hyper is often described as bringing together the best of both worlds, and it's a major reason investors are paying such close attention to its growth. The new generation of applications that could emerge from Bitcoin Hyper may arrive quickly, especially since its development tools are already familiar to most blockchain engineers. If adoption gains traction, it could lead to a significant portion of Bitcoin's supply being locked within the Canonical Bridge, effectively reducing circulation and potentially increasing the value of BTC held outside it. A wrapped version of BTC circulates across the new Bitcoin Hyper applications, serving as the medium of exchange within its DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) environments. As that wrapped BTC moves through these platforms, it creates utility-based demand for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an actively used asset within a connected on-chain economy. HYPER powers gas fees, staking, and governance, ensuring the ecosystem functions seamlessly as activity expands. With everything Bitcoin Hyper is building, it's no wonder the presale continues to gain strong traction. That scenario looks increasingly likely given how much has been raised in just seven days. But as funding accelerates, it's worth remembering that this early phase won't last forever – once the target is hit, the presale will close. While there's still time to secure HYPER at presale prices, investors can purchase directly through the official Bitcoin Hyper website using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FCA, Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) are joining together to tackle misleading advertising and inadequate information provided by some claims management companies (CMCs) and law firms working on motor finance claims, and the risk that excessive fees are charged to clients. Alison Walters, director, consumer finance, at the FCA, yesterday said: “Misleading advertising and inadequate disclosure have meant that people are signing contracts with some firms without the facts. “The risks and issues facing consumers in this area of the market are unprecedented, and we are using all the levers at our disposal to protect consumers, identify poor practices and hold law firms to account.” Two FCA regulated CMCs have agreed to change their exit fee policies. The FCA's increased proactive monitoring has led to the removal or amendment of more than 740 misleading adverts by FCA regulated CMCs since January 2024. Concerns include unrealistic claims about success rates and the value of potential compensation. Research shows 4 in 10 people don't know they can receive motor finance compensation without using a CMC or law firm. Since January 2025, the ICO has received over 230,000 complaints via the spam reporting service regarding unsolicited and unlawful direct marketing practices linked to motor finance claims. In response, the ICO has multiple investigations ongoing and is actively considering further regulatory action against several organisations. The ASA is also reviewing advertising practices in this sector. Consumers who believe they have been misled by advertising, signed up without their consent, charged unreasonable fees, had their data mishandled, or otherwise feel they have been treated unfairly by a CMC or law firm should first complain to the firm. If dissatisfied with the response, they should take their complaint to the Claims Management OmbudsmanLink is external or Legal OmbudsmanLink is external. To support the public, the SRA has also published guidance on motor finance claimsLink is external, and on no-win, no-fee agreementsLink is external. Individuals concerned about direct marketing practices or those wishing to make a complaint, are encouraged to do so via the ICO websiteLink is external. Daniel Pugh has been sentenced to 7 years and 6 months in prison for running a £1.3m Ponzi scheme, following a prosecution brought by the FCA. An individual has been convicted for breaching the Data Protection Act, but acquitted of fraud and unauthorised business offences, following a prosecution brought by the FCA. Motor insurers have changed their settlement and compensation practices after the FCA found some insurers had short-changed customers on stolen or written off vehicle claims. The FCA is launching a £1 million campaign, letting motor finance customers know they don't need to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm to access an industry-wide compensation scheme the regulator is proposing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India warns regulating crypto could legitimize the sector and pose systemic risks to its financial system. India has made clear it is not interested in joining the global wave of pro-crypto regulation. Union Minister Piyush Goyal reiterated this week that the government neither prohibits nor promotes cryptocurrencies but will continue to heavily tax them. Receive up to $100,000 worth of exclusive gifts for newcomers upon registration. Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit “We don't encourage it because we don't want anybody to be stuck at some point with a cryptocurrency with no backing and nobody at the backend.” Goyal's remarks highlight India's deliberate divergence from other major economies. Across Asia, countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are accelerating crypto adoption through licensing regimes, clear rules for stablecoins, and tax incentives designed to attract global capital. India, by contrast, continues to discourage investment in crypto while positioning its CBDC as the only legitimate digital alternative. India's CBDC push also comes as the West retreats from central bank digital currency pilots. In the U.S., lawmakers have moved to ban a digital dollar outright. In Europe, the digital euro has faced pushback over privacy concerns. Goyal argued that the digital rupee would be easier, faster, and traceable, framing it as a modern replacement for cash rather than a speculative asset. As neighbors build frameworks to attract crypto firms and integrate digital assets into traditional finance, India's insistence on sidelining the crypto industry could leave its markets—and investors—at a disadvantage.</p>

The data reflects growing confidence in Ethereum as a yield-generating asset and the continued institutionalization of its market infrastructure. The surge in ETF inflows in recent months has coincided with public companies such as BitMine and SharpLink adding ETH to their balance sheets — a trend often compared to the Bitcoin treasury movement led by Strategy. On Monday, SharpLink said it has seen its unrealized profits surge past $900 million since launching its ETH treasury strategy in early June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This surge has brought the cryptocurrency close to its all-time high, prompting a new wave of bullish predictions. Market analyst Mags on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighted a key milestone for the Ethereum price: after 1,146 days of price consolidation, the market's second-largest cryptocurrency finally broke through the critical $4,000 level. Historically, Ethereum made three attempts to surpass this threshold, encountering setbacks each time. Macroeconomic factors also play a significant role in Ethereum's potential for further gains. Analysts at CryptoQuant note that the US M2 money supply has entered a renewed expansion phase, hitting a record high of approximately $22.2 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) was the first to reflect this increase, soaring by over 130% since 2022 and showing a strong correlation with M2 growth of around 0.9. However, on-chain data compiled by CryptoQuant indicates that this gap may be narrowing. Notably, Ethereum's exchange reserves have decreased to roughly 16.1 million ETH, a drop of more than 25% since 2022. This suggests a structural decline in selling pressure, as netflows to exchanges remain consistently negative, indicating that ETH is being withdrawn for self-custody. Additionally, the Coinbase Premium Index has turned positive, signaling renewed interest from US institutional investors. CryptoQuant analysts assert this pattern appears to be re-emerging, hinting that the remainder of the year could see a shift away from a Bitcoin-centric market toward one driven by Ethereum and other altcoins. If global liquidity continues to expand and the trend of outflows from exchanges persists, the Ethereum price may align more closely with M2 growth, entering a new phase of revaluation. In such a scenario, ETH's prospect of reaching $10,000 becomes increasingly possible, the analysts further added. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows on Monday, their biggest day since early November 2024, when Donald Trump was elected President of the US. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States clocked their second-biggest day of inflows in history as Bitcoin notched a new record high on Monday. The bumper day for the ETFs, which coincided with Bitcoin's new all-time high of over $126,000, brings October's total inflow to $3.47 billion across just four trading days, according to CoinGlass. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have cumulatively raked in around $60 billion since their launch, Bloomberg's ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Monday on X. Related: BlackRock chases Bitcoin yield in latest ETF as a ‘sequel' to IBIT There were minor inflows for Invesco, WisdomTree, and Franklin's funds. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is on the verge of surpassing $100 billion in assets under management, observed Nova Dius President Nate Geraci on Tuesday. According to the official website, IBIT has an AUM of almost $98.5 billion in Bitcoin and cash, and it holds 783,767 BTC. The world's largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, took more than 2,000 days to hit that mark, and IBIT is about to do it in under 450 days, said Geraci.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India to Roll Out RBI-Linked Digital Currency Amid Dismissal of Crypto With 'No Backing' The minister clarified that while India hasn't imposed an outright ban on crypto without central government backing, authorities are taxing them heavily to discourage use, “because we don't want anybody to be stuck at some point with a cryptocurrency that has no backing and nobody at the backend." Goyal's announcement comes as India, Pakistan, and Vietnam lead global crypto activity, according to Chainalysis's 2025 Global Adoption Index, which shows the Asia-Pacific region recording a year-over-year growth in transaction volume from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion. Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that "Goyal's explicit claim simply reiterates that the government continues to see a CBDC as a core plank of its fintech strategy." "The reference to 'backed by RBI guarantee' is substantial and not rhetorical as it seeks to contrast the state-issued digital currency as having superior legitimacy and security compared to 'unbacked' cryptos," Kapoor said, calling out “speculative tokens, meme coins, or ephemeral DeFi constructs lacking anchoring assets.” He said India is likely to adopt “a hybrid regulatory framework” combining monetary and securities oversight, requiring crypto issuers to hold “verifiable fiat or commodity reserves in regulated custody and undergo regular third-party audits.” "India's plan for an RBI-backed digital rupee shows clear intent to merge trust with technology, similar to a state-guaranteed stablecoin,” Monica Jasuja, chief expansion and innovation officer at Emerging Payments Association Asia, told Decrypt. She said that if India backs an RBI-issued digital rupee over private stablecoins, investors may see it as “a safer but narrower play,” with “confidence shifting toward compliance-aligned ventures” and away from speculative, crypto-native projects. However, industry observers have recently warned that regulatory uncertainty has created a bureaucratic stalemate, with an estimated 80-85% of India's top crypto talent already relocated internationally, while the country struggles to establish clear frameworks for private cryptocurrencies. The industry has also, for some time, viewed central bank digital currencies with a degree of skepticism, arguing that they move away from crypto's core thesis by handing the monetary reins to a centralized authority operating on permissioned blockchains. "How will India deal with foreign stablecoins or cross-border token flows that don't meet its 'asset-backed' rules?"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Toda Corporation, JTB Corp. and Fujitsu Limited today announced that they will carry out a field trial for “ECHIZEN Quest,” a tourism digital transformation (DX) project utilizing NFTs, in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. Echizen City in Fukui Prefecture anticipates a significant increase in tourism, including international visitors, due to improved accessibility such as the extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen. In 2024, JTB implemented a program set in Echizen City where Fujitsu employees proposed new tourism experiences leveraging NFTs after learning about local resources and challenges.Since 2023, Fujitsu and JTB have been jointly researching tourism DX services for affluent international visitors. Participants will delve into the creation of traditional items such as washi (traditional Japanese paper), uchihamono (hand-forged metal goods, particularly knives and tools), tansu (portable storage chests), lacquerware, and pottery, as well as modern industries like eyewear and textiles. Upon completing each experience, visitors will receive a unique NFT, depicting Murasaki Shikibu (historical Japanese novelist) serving as digital proof of their engagement. This NFT can be redeemed for local support or souvenirs. Designed for future expansion, the project aims to integrate these NFTs with a dedicated regional currency or point system, offering holders exclusive benefits like discounts and unique event access. Looking ahead, Fujitsu plans to expand this model to other regions in Japan as a case study for protecting traditional culture and revitalizing local communities through digital technology. Embeds images, audio, and video of various content into coins, offering them as a cashless payment "electronic currency." This technology utilizes blockchain, is collectible, and can host advertisements (Fujitsu patented).
