                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena. icate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with abundance variations of many orders of magnitude. I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar ‚Äúmetasocieties.‚Äù The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a ‚Äúhaystack.‚Äù Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Beings, Ilana Masad's elegant and ambitious sophomore novel, a queer archivist becomes captivated by two files from the 1960s: the case of Betty and Barney Hill‚Äîthe first widely documented alien abductees‚Äîand the letters of Phyllis, a lesbian science fiction writer navigating an underground queer scene. As the archivist pieces together their stories, Masad blends meticulously well-researched history with lyrical invention, weaving a braided narrative that asks with urgency and tenderness: are any of us ever truly alone? United by a profound sense of alienation, the characters shimmer with richly drawn humanity. The Hills, an interracial couple already marginalized before they became known for their UFO claims, ache for people to believe them. Meanwhile, as Phyllis searches for love at a time when being gay was illegal, she aches for someone to believe in her. And the archivist, that gentle, nameless narrator, follows their stories until their own begins to surface, tying the strands together in a way that's as satisfying as it is mysterious. Like all the best science fiction, where genre becomes a means of exploring feelings rather than technology, Beings shines not by demanding belief in aliens, but by showing what it means that the characters believe. At a time when we're constantly faced with issues of belief versus fact, it's a poignant meditation on why we tell ourselves certain stories, and what those stories say about us. The result is a beautifully written and wholly original work of speculative fiction. Below, my conversation with Masad about Beings. I'm always curious about how an author's vision for their novel changes as they work on it. I knew from the start that the novel was going to be about the first alien abductees, but I also knew that I couldn't write about them in isolation. Essentially, in that third narrative, I set out to write about the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when everything was still very uncertain for many of us‚Äîwe didn't know how long we'd need to be staying inside or away from other people, we didn't know how the disease spread, we didn't know whether we were witnessing the start of our extinction. I tried to zero in on the smallest of moments, to remember the way that time felt like molasses in some ways but then hours would go by and you'd realize your hand was locked around your phone like a robot claw. Unfortunately, during the process of trying to sell the book, it became clear that there was a lot of discomfort with that aspect of the narrative in particular. To be fair, the book was also very long because all three parts were equal in length. So I ended up revamping that third strand. I had a rule for myself when I was writing the new character, that each section of theirs could be only a page or so. I was thinking of Leni Zumas's Red Clocks, how that book, which has several narratives occurring in tandem, also features these very short bursts that come from the perspective of a polar explorer from the 19th century. The Archivist sections are nothing like those, really, but still, how I felt reading Zumas's short chapters from that perspective really stuck with me. But you also give them a queer love interest. This might say more about me than about them, to be honest, but one of the joys of being queer, to me, is having little crushes on people all the time. In the original version of the Archivist character, there was an actual implied love story, and when I wrote them into the person they are now, I wanted to retain at least an element of that. I think having crushes can be really nice. It can remind you that you have a body that can reach out, that you have a nervous system capable of excitement as well as anxiety or stress or anger or ennui. By giving the Archivist a crush, I think I was trying to draw them out into the world a little bit more. I learned so much during the research! Listening to Making Gay History, Eric Marcus's podcast, was a revelation in that I got to hear the actual voices of so many people who lived through this time. I suppose what surprised me most in the research was just how familiar so much of the interpersonal dynamics were. People are people are people, regardless of when and where we are, and I know that intellectually, but reading about or listening to the little dramas of queer folks' lives in the 1960s, whether they were about relationships or activism or editorial power struggles really made me feel it. Specifically, I was shocked‚Äîand probably shouldn't have been‚Äîto find people writing about the Hills from later years who were so clearly sexist and so clearly just thought that Betty Hill especially was hysterical or excitable, despite the fact that Barney in his own words tells his psychiatrist (this is in the transcripts of their sessions) that she was actually the opposite of that. But the other connecting threads are more thematic. When I first learned about the Hills' public trajectory‚Äîthat, essentially, we know what we know about them only because someone got hold of a recording they didn't know was being made of them and then wrote a sensationalist five-part story about them literally in the week leading up to Halloween‚Äîthe word ‚Äúouted‚Äù came to mind. Their address was printed in the newspaper, because that was common practice at the time; similarly, when queer people were arrested at gay and lesbian bars or accused of ‚Äúsolicitation‚Äù or whatnot, their names and often their addresses and places of work would be printed in the paper too. Then, too, there's the mental illness aspect. When a couple of normal people claim to have been aboard an alien spaceship‚Äîmost people would assume they were insane, right? And, in the present-day sections, the Archivist struggles with both mental and physical illnesses, although I deliberately don't name them‚Äînot because I'm trying to obfuscate in this case, but because I'm trying to focus, as in the other threads, less on what you call something, and rather on what it's like to experience it. I think that helped in terms of my unconscious (or whatever you call the mysterious thing that's happening when you're making things up as you go) doing that work of creating the connective tissue. What first intrigued me about them was how they were both these totally regular people who hadn't sought out attention for what they went through. I was definitely You're Wrong About-pilled by the time I learned about them, so I was already thinking about how the stories we tell about famous or infamous people‚Äîand how we tell those stories in the media‚Äîhave so much to do with what our society is like at the time of the telling. But the Hills were also an interracial couple at a time when marrying someone outside your race was illegal in a bunch of states still; they were civil servants, and also civil rights activists. As a result, I knew from pretty early on in the process that I was going to try to do something kind of impossible: I was going to try to tell their story as accurately as I could, using their archives, the book they had written about them, and the book Betty Hill's niece wrote years later‚Ä¶ And at the same time, I was going to acknowledge from the start that I absolutely couldn't tell their story accurately at all because any story you tell about another person is also a story about you, about your reactions to that person, about your imagined version of that person. Reading My Autobiography of Carson McCullers by Jenn Shapland had really cracked open that idea for me. Real people who already told their story in the ways they chose after being outed as abductees without their permission. I found them so full of life. How did you approach embodying a queer woman's interiority, set in the 1960s? I think Phyllis is a lot of people's favorite character. I did a lot of research, of course‚ÄîI read books like Sex and the Single Girl by Helen Gurley Brown to try to see how young women's lives were being described and imagined by someone like her. I watched romantic comedies from the 1950s and 60s. I read about queer women from her day. I listened to a lot of Eric Marcus's Making Gay History podcast. And of course I did research into silly little things like whether there were hold buttons on office phones in the 1960s. But ultimately, I just tried to feel my way into who she was: a teenager who grew up on a small farm in a small town, who fell in love with her best friend, who read science fiction to escape the ways her life felt small at the time, and who literally escaped her home and ended up trying to make a life for herself in a big city she'd never been to before. And, like other characters in this novel, her aloneness was key to figuring her out, especially early in the book. There's a metaphor across the book about otherness and alienation ‚Äî through literal alien encounters and queerness that's pushed to the margins of society, plus the politics of interracial relationships. But are there also actual aliens here? Ok, so that's not exactly a yes. I think some days I believe there were aliens, yes, of course there were, and other days I believe that no, that's so silly, of course there weren't aliens. When a belief fluctuates like that, it feels hard to hang onto any which way, and so I've sort of receded from this question of my personal belief into a place where I've realized what I do or don't believe doesn't matter. Am I right to guess that the archive in the book is based on Brooklyn's Lesbian Herstory Archives? An earlier version of the novel's archive was very much directly based on the LHA, yes, cozy couches and brownstone setting and all, but the archive that's in the book as it is now is based more on what I've found to be the much more common kind of archive, which is to say, it's less romantic, much more library-cum-office. But yes, it's still inspired by the LHA as well as The History Project, Boston's queer archive, in terms of the way these archives are quite open to a range of materials and focus on queer people. I really love archives and libraries‚Äîthe former are often housed within the latter‚Äîbecause of how they're these repositories of history, but often messier and more complex than what gets distilled into narrative form in books or documentaries. I love how much humanity can be found in them. I mean, I've never been anti-aliens, but doing the research for this book made me both fascinated by the idea of them, and utterly infuriated by the way imagining aliens can be and is used in ways that harm human beings (so many alien conspiracy theories are racist, antisemitic, and/or remove agency and innovation from various ancient‚Äîand largely nonwhite‚Äîcivilizations). So I have a complicated relationship with aliens in terms of how they exist in our IRL imaginations, and I also love love love the ways aliens can be used in sci-fi as metaphors and imagined others who are often more like us than we're comfortable with. In what ways have you changed as an author over the course of two novels? It felt completely different for so many reasons, but mostly because although looking at both novels now from a distance I can see how they share certain themes‚Äîconnections across generations, say; the obsession with someone dead about whom you can only learn so much‚Äîthey are such different books in terms of style and plot and structure. All My Mother's Lovers also came to me much more easily‚Äîit wasn't easy, per se, nothing is really easy to write, but it sure was easier than Beings. Writing Beings felt like pulling my insides out at times. I think that every book I have written and every book I will write will likely feel completely different and will likely require me learning how to write a novel all over again. And I'm sure there's something that's different, be it just my age, or the fact that having published one book I have a wholly different kind of anxiety about publishing my second (and had a wholly different anxiety about writing it too). But I don't know how to quantify it or see it‚ÄîI'm too close. Can you recommend other great queer sci fi for curious readers? Also, some of these have written straight up SF, some are more broad or speculative, but in terms of contemporary writers, I really enjoy Charlie Jane Anders, Rivers Solomon, Marisa Crane, Annalee Newitz, and N. K. Jemisin. While Ursula K. Le Guin wasn't queer as far as I know, I do think The Left Hand of Darkness is a queer masterpiece. Beings is on sale now wherever fine books are sold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guy Pearce made headlines last year with his performance in The Brutalist, which was strong enough to earn him his first Oscar nomination. Less than a year after his Academy Award collaboration with Adrien Brody, Pearce is back with a new supernatural Western that just got an exciting update. After debuting in select theaters this weekend, Killing Faith has earned a respectable 85% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This comes from only 13 reviews at the time of writing, so it is subject to change. Rotten Tomatoes has also yet to issue an audience score, considering there have been fewer than 50 reviews on the Popcornmeter. The film has received a glowing review from legendary horror author Stephen King, who attended an early screening last month and shared his thoughts on his personal X account. He described the film as a ‚Äúquasi-supernatural Western that has echoes of Cormac McCarthy. Killing Faith also has a higher Rotten Tomatoes score (85%) than The Shining (84%). In addition to Pearce, Pullman, and Wise, Killing Faith also stars Raoul Max Trujillo, who was recently seen in the DCEU's Blue Beetle movie as one of the main villains. Crowley previously made his directorial debut in 2016 on Middle Man, the crime thriller starring Jim O'Heir that's streaming for free on Tubi. Earlier this year, King also delivered The Monkey and The Life of Chuck, which both earned critical acclaim, even if they failed to deliver outstanding box office results. Check out the official trailer for Killing Faith above and stay tuned to Collider for more updates and coverage of the film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vladimir Putin has turned another year older, but wild conspiracies have long insisted he's on the brink of death, battling a secret illness, or has already died but his passing was hidden in an elaborate Kremlin coverup. An ongoing theory about Putin alleged he actually died following a medical emergency in 2023 ‚Äì and the Kremlin has used "body doubles" to hide his death. Western and Russian Intelligence sources claimed Putin suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at 8:42 PM Moscow time on October 26, 2023, at age 71 following a long battle with cancer at his presidential palace in Valdai. A CIA insider alleged: "The rumor is that the body doubles are kept locked away, so no one ever sees two of them at once. Despite insiders' claims, reports of Putin's death have long been denied by the 73-year-old's spokespersons. Putin's alleged deteriorating health has been at the center of other conspiracy theories. Leaked emails from an alleged Russian spy in 2022 claimed Putin had been diagnosed with cancer and Parkinson's. One email read: "I can confirm he has been diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson's disease, but it's already progressing. This fact will be denied in every possible way and hidden." The email continued: "Putin is regularly stuffed with all kinds of heavy steroids and innovative painkilling injections to stop the spread of pancreatic cancer he was recently diagnosed with. "In his close circle, there are rumors that in addition to pancreatic cancer, which is gradually spreading, Putin also has prostate cancer." Rumors about Putin's failing health have swirled for years, dating back to 2005 when notable Western media outlets hypothesized the ex-KGB agent had suffered a stroke. A decade years later, it was widely reported Putin may have been seriously ill from complications related to botched plastic surgery. In 2017, famed Russian historian and political analyst Valery Solovei claimed the despot was suffering from Parkinson's disease or leprosy and would imminently resign, though of course he remains in office nearly 10 years later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Not because it looks like a flying saucer (though it totally does), but because spotting a lenticular cloud anywhere near Houston is incredibly rare! Lenticular clouds are those smooth, lens-shaped formations that look like stacked pancakes, or sometimes, a UFO hovering in place. They form when stable, moist air flows over mountains and creates standing waves in the atmosphere. Years ago, I snapped the photo below in Seattle, Washington, it was the first time I'd ever seen a lenticular cloud. We don't exactly have mountains to work with, so seeing a cloud like this here is a true treat! Lenticular clouds form when stable air is forced to rise and sink in a standing wave, usually when steady winds blow across a mountain or ridge. When I worked in Los Angeles, my colleague Kim Baldonado sent me this stunning photo of a lenticular cloud over the mountains near Palm Springs, California. It's easy to see why people joke that these look like flying saucers. This one could've come straight out of a sci-fi movie! Back here in Houston, seeing a cloud like this is almost unheard of, but not impossible. Our flat coastal landscape just doesn't have the kind of mountains that help form the strong, stationary waves needed for lenticular clouds. Years ago, someone sent me an incredible photo of one that had formed right over a downtown Houston building. The photo below is one I took in 2022 at my son's football game.

Words matter when it comes to reporting UFOS, says Cabinet's science advisor Dr. Mona Nemer in an internal memo obtained by Blacklock's Reporter under Access To Information.

The doctor, who is paid $393,000 yearly, said ridicule and skepticism about what she prefers to call ‚Äúunidentified aerial phenomenon‚Äù are discouraging Canadians from reporting suspicious activity.

‚ÄúTerminology can help promote greater transparency, credibility and acceptance of research in professional, scientific and public communities,‚Äù Nemer wrote in the censored 28-page report.

‚ÄúThe shift in terminology from UFOs to ‚Äòunidentified aerial phenomenon' has the potential to reduce the stigma historically associated with UFOs.‚Äù

The July 17, 2024, Report Of The Sky Canada Project said anecdotes of suspicious aircraft ‚Äúwere often met with skepticism and ridicule, leading to negative perceptions and arbitrary judgments being cast.‚Äù

Skepticism was ‚Äúdiscouraging witnesses from coming forward and hindering scientific inquiry,‚Äù said the report without elaborating.

Nemer launched the Sky Canada Project two years ago to compile UFO data after all other federal agencies dropped UFO investigations in 1995.

‚ÄúDoes extraterrestrial life exist?‚Äù asked a Sky Canada Project report circulated by Nemer's office.

‚ÄúNo sign of extraterrestrial life has been detected to date. However, most scientists consider it only a matter of time before it is discovered.‚Äù

Nemer, a biochemist, assigned seven employees to her Sky Canada Project at an undisclosed cost.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In West Virginia, the mountains are rich with folklore and dotted with sites time has left behind. These haunted hollows are united by their dark, whispered histories and their inclusion on the West Virginia Paranormal Trail, a curated collection of the state's most spine-tingling destinations. ‚ÄúWe are so excited to bring back the Paranormal Trail this fall, featuring four new mysterious stops for travelers to explore,‚Äù West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said in a statement shared with Travel + Leisure. From stunning color to one-of-a-kind experiences, I have a feeling this autumn will be one of the best we've ever had.‚Äù Meanwhile, flickering lights and unexplained footsteps are the norm at Carnegie Hall in Lewisburg, another new site on the trail. And in the Greenbrier Valley Theatre, a 19th century murder and spectral testimony remains one of Appalachia's most haunting legends. The final new addition to the paranormal trail may be the most fascinating: Seneca Caverns in Riverton has long been prominent in local lore due to its role as a gathering place and ceremonial space for the Seneca, an Indigenous group. Other stops on the trail include a visit to a now-closed penitentiary known for riots and more than 90 executions along with a Gothic-style asylum that became severely overcrowded and remains haunted by patients and staff. The best way to experience West Virginia's paranormal trail is by registering online for a free digital passport. Read the original article on Travel & Leisure</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOPKINSVILLE, KY (CHRISTIAN COUNTY NOW) ‚Äì Hopkinsville is fully embracing the city's connection to paranormal history with the first ever GoblinCon UFO & Paranormal Expo on Oct. 17-18. The small town of Kelly tucked in northern Christian County got its claim to fame after five adults and seven children reported seeing small alien creatures attacking their farmhouse on Aug. 21, 1955. This encounter has inspired documentaries, several investigations by ufologists, remaining one of the most well documented alien encounters in the United States. On the anniversary this year, Hopkinsville held an Alien Invasion Day to celebrate this fun bit of local history, continuing on through the expo. Visit Hopkinsville is hosting this large-scale event at The Bruce, inviting in over 70 vendors, paranormal experts, people from the film industry, and enthusiasts to share their knowledge and experience with the community. All things paranormal will be covered at the expo with speakers, panels, and workshops held every hour. The two-day schedule will cover topics like bigfoot, the Bell Witch Legend, ghost hunting, Mothman, UFO activity, and cryptid hunting. There will also be a cosplay contest for all ages, with trophies awarded to two winners in each age group for best paranormal inspired costume. Along with the vendors, the GoblinCon arcade will also be set up, with over 20 free games available for visitors to play. VIP packages include exclusive experiences like a meet and greet at The Knight House in Hopkinsville. Daynnah Carmona is a reporter for ChristianCountyNow.com. Charlie Powell marks a decade of ownership at Holiday Burgers with a remodel of the interior. With students coming through for over 100 years, all past alumni are invited for the final Christian County vs Hopkinsville High School football game. Downtown Trick or Treat is set for Halloween this year in Hopkinsville.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pub in Northumberland announced that it was rescheduling an event due to ‚Äúunforeseen circumstances.‚Äù The kicker? Apparently, the psychic didn't pick up on these unanticipated disruptions. The Snowy Owl in Cramlington shared the hilarious announcement on their Instagram page, stating: ‚ÄúSorry for any inconvenience caused we are having to rearrange our stand up physic [sic] night from Monday 6th October. It will now be taken place on Monday 3rd November at 6:30pm.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's happened!‚Äù he wrote on X with a screenshot of the Instagram post. ‚ÄúI'm surprised they didn't see it coming, does the psychic powers only work sometimes during the day,‚Äù one person quipped on X. The Snowy Owl pub has just less than 1,000 followers on Instagram. Its website labels the establishment as ‚Äúa country pub in Cramlington.‚Äù As for their food, well, there are mixed reviews online, so you might want to consult your psychic to know whether a satisfying meal is in your future. And while the psychic might not be in, you can at least enjoy the atmosphere of luscious gardens and crackling log fires.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a trope that just won't die‚Äîand has reared its head in recent months. It's Candace Owens blaming the Jewish state for Charlie Kirk's death, or Glenn Greenwald arguing that America is supporting Ukraine in order to advance Israeli interests. Or take my recent podcast guest, Dave Smith, blaming Israel for getting America embroiled in the Iraq War. Chances are they won't have heard of Dave Smith, who is a comedian. But Smith has recently emerged as an influential voice on foreign policy, far better known to younger Americans than old-fashioned journalists and veteran talking heads. Thanks to appearances on, among many others, Joe Rogan's podcast and Piers Morgan's show, he has amassed a large following‚Äîand earned a reputation as an effective debater. Debating skills, however, should not be confused with substantial arguments. And Smith is sorely lacking in the latter department. I recently had Smith on my podcast, Conversations with Coleman, for a three-and-a-half-hour deep dive into his views on jihadism, the Iraq War, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and Iran's nuclear ambitions. In a nutshell, Smith believes that America has become a nefarious empire whose foreign policy decisions are largely determined by what Israel wants us to do, rather than by what we believe is good for us and the world. In his view, our enemies are rarely acting out of their own malevolent ideologies; they are merely reacting to our imperialist provocations. The clearest example of this shtick in action is Smith's argument that America invaded Iraq because Israeli interests manipulated us into it‚Äîa theory he has advanced several times on Rogan's show (including in his debate with Douglas Murray), and which he reprised in our own conversation. Well, when he is not conveying outright misinformation, his modus operandi is to cite obscure and unimportant documents that few people have heard of, exaggerate their importance, and ignore mountains of evidence that directly contradict his theories. In an age where podcasts have replaced television news and influencers have replaced experts, it is important not to dismiss people simply because they don't possess the traditional credentials. We must meet the challenge of the modern information age on its own terms, which means rolling up our sleeves and showing the conspiracy theorists exactly why they're wrong‚Äîusing hard evidence. Listen to Coleman's conversation with Dave Smith here‚Äîor watch it here: Let's start with that mountain of evidence Smith overlooks, when he says Israel manipulated America into going to war in Iraq. According to TheWashington Post, Sharon's visit came on the heels of a diplomatic blitz wherein a ‚Äúseries of Israeli leaders‚Äù had ‚Äúcarried that message to Washington.‚Äù That means they were outspent by the dentistry lobby. Yossi Alpher, former senior adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, wrote an article entitled ‚ÄúSharon Warned Bush,‚Äù in which he explained that ‚Äúsometime prior to March 2003,‚Äù Sharon ‚Äúadvised Bush not to occupy Iraq.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn terms of culture and tradition,‚Äù Sharon reportedly told Bush, ‚Äúthe Arab world is not built for democratization‚Äù‚Äîhardly words of encouragement. If you squint at these things in just the right light and ignore everything else, you can paint a misleading picture of Israeli manipulation. But once they understood that we were going to war, come hell or high water, they weren't going to get on the wrong side of the president of the United States.‚Äù But when Smith advances his ‚ÄúIsrael got us into Iraq‚Äù theory on podcasts, he rarely acknowledges the evidence that contradicts his view. If you squint at these things in just the right light and ignore everything else, you can paint a misleading picture of Israeli manipulation. Netanyahu, who was a private citizen and former prime minister at the time, gave testimony in support of the Iraq invasion in Congress. But as I explained to him on the podcast, the testimony occurred after Bush had already decided to go into Iraq. Bush announced his decision to invade Iraq in a meeting with all of his principals on September 7, 2002, according to then‚ÄìNational Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who was in the room. What Netanyahu, who was not even prime minister, said in public after the decision was made cannot have had more weight than what the actual prime minister said to Bush when the president was still deciding. An important pillar of Smith's theory is that the neoconservatives used ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction‚Äù (WMD) as a false pretext for the Iraq War, when in reality they wanted regime change in Iraq because it would help Israel. in the '90s, when the neocons admitted they wanted to overthrow Saddam Hussein, they never said it was because he had nuclear weapons. They said he was a problem for Israel in the region. The very first time they advocated overthrowing Saddam was in 1998, via an open letter to President Bill Clinton. Smith's other go-to source for ‚Äúwhat the neocons said pre-9/11‚Äù is the Clean Break memo, a policy document written in 1996 by a group of pro-Israel American neoconservatives led by Richard Perle. Smith often misrepresents this document as proof that the neocons admitted they wanted to overthrow Saddam in order to help Israel. Though not primarily about Iraq, the document's brief mention of Saddam reads as follows: Israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back Syria. This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq‚Äîan important Israeli strategic objective in its own right‚Äîas a means of foiling Syria's regional ambitions. For Dave Smith, this passage is the smoking gun. But a closer look at the Clean Break memo reveals that, although it may have shaped Netanyahu's thinking (or simply mirrored it), it could not have been important vis-√†-vis America's Iraq policy. ‚ÄúWere the Hashemites to control Iraq,‚Äù it explains, ‚Äúthey could use their influence over Najf to help Israel wean the south Lebanese Shia away from Hizballah, Iran, and Syria.‚Äù Not only did we not restore the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq, there is nothing in the public record to suggest that we even considered it. What Smith has done here is plucked one sentence out of its original context and twisted its meaning to fit his desired narrative. The second memo Smith relies on is even flimsier, because it doesn't exist in the public record at all, and nobody who read it has ever come forward and relayed its contents. According to Clark's book Winning Modern Wars and public interviews, just after 9/11 someone at the Pentagon told him in casual conversation about a memo that revealed an American five-year plan to do regime change in seven countries in a specific order: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finally Iran. The first thing to note is that we executed or backed regime change only in two of the seven countries (Iraq and Somalia) during Bush's presidency. And in three of the seven countries (Lebanon, Sudan, and Iran) we never did regime change at all, let alone within the allotted time horizon. Meanwhile, we did do regime change in countries not on the list like Liberia, where our intervention ended a bloody civil war and likely saved tens of thousands of lives. Any way you slice it, the supposed ‚Äúplan‚Äù outlined in this memo clearly wasn't carried out. During the Bush administration, Donald Rumsfeld ran the Pentagon, and his memos were derisively called ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù because he would write 20 to 60 per day, and they would pile up on people's desks like snow. And Richard Clarke, who worked with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, recalls that she was told to ignore his memos. Smith has never produced evidence that this particular Pentagon memo was anything other than Rumsfeld's thoughts of the hour. There's another plank to Smith's theory: He points to the idea that American organizations which lobby for Israel were a key villain in the story of how we got into Iraq. While it's true that the Israel lobby mostly supported the Iraq War, it's absurd to think that their influence was anywhere near big enough to tip the scales. During Bush's presidency, $17 million was spent by domestic organizations lobbying Congress on Israel, according to OpenSecrets.org. To put that in perspective, the cigarette company Philip Morris spent about $200 million over the same time span. And even with all that money, Philip Morris was unable to prevent Congress from passing the federal tax hike on cigarettes in 2009. During Obama's presidency, according to the same source, pro-Israel domestic organizations spent a total of $30.2 million lobbying the Hill. That means they were outspent by the dentistry lobby, which shelled out $32.8 million over the same time span. Aside from noting that the Israel lobby is about 100 times smaller than the big lobbies, there is the further question: If the Israel lobby is so powerful, how come it can't get America to do favors much smaller than a full war? In her memoir, Condoleezza Rice recalls the story of President Bush's 2002 Palestine speech. In the speech, Bush planned to call for eventual creation of a Palestinian state. But crucially, Bush was going to call it ‚ÄúPalestine.‚Äù Rice writes that when she informed Danny Ayalon, the Israeli ambassador to America, of this, he objected: ‚ÄúHe can't do that,‚Äù Danny protested. I said that the President had made a decision. When he called back, Danny asked if we could call it ‚ÄúNew Palestine.‚Äù I replied that ‚ÄúNew Palestine‚Äù sounded dumb and that the President wouldn't accept any change in the language. ‚ÄúAnd Danny, don't lobby the Hill,‚Äù I said. In other words, the Israelis couldn't get Bush to add one little word to his Palestine speech in 2002. They couldn't get Bush to mount a campaign against Syria's admission to the UN security council in 2002. They couldn't get Bush to bomb Syria's nuclear facilities in 2007. Yet we are supposed to believe that a country with the size and population of New Jersey, which couldn't get America to do any one of these smaller favors, somehow got us to fight an entire war‚Äîand they accomplished all of this with a lobbying budget the same size as Big Dentistry? The American security establishment, for good and for ill, makes its own choices‚Äîand in the end, it must answer to one authority and one authority only: the American people. But this idea that Israel made us do it is just one shard in a wider ecosystem where anti-Israel propaganda goes down smoothly and where misinformation isn't cross-examined; it's rewarded. Loose claims congeal into conspiracy theories with remarkable speed. If we want a politics tethered to reality, we have to resist that gravitational pull: Demand sources, distinguish performance from analysis, and refuse to let style masquerade as substance. Dave Smith likes the sound of his own voice. Coleman, I don't know who want ask you to talk to an inconsequential gnat, but I don't intend to waste three hours of my life on his drivel, even for you.</p>

Hope to see you at Music Matters Live.‚Äù With new music on the way and shows lined up across the world, PSYCHIC FEVER continue to prove that their energy, brotherhood, and fan connection are what make them one of J-pop's most promising global acts.</p>
