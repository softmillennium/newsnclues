The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) remains disconnected from the Ukrainian electricity grid and without external power for two weeks, creating an increasingly "risky" situation,  experts told the Kyiv Independent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin referenced the crisis at the ZNPP, which is under Russian control, in his Oct. 2 remarks at the Valdai International Discussion Club,  again blaming Ukraine for the outage, despite evidence to the contrary, and threatening retaliatory strikes on Ukrainian nuclear power plants. 

Beyond the escalating rhetoric, experts indicate that the danger at the plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, is real. 

Ukraine on Oct. 6 condemned recent attacks near the ZNPP, blaming them on Russia. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its team heard "several rounds of incoming and outgoing shelling from near the site."

Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom warned that the diesel generators powering the plant are designed only for short-term emergency use and are not meant to sustain the plant's operational needs for an extended period. A shutdown of these generators could result in a loss of control over the facility's nuclear safety systems. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant as "critical" on Sept. 30. Diesel generators are now supplying power to the plant, but one has already failed, he said.

Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil/environmental engineering, industrial and systems engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California, also confirmed that diesel generators "are not designed to be run in such a sustained period of time."


"No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything."
    

"It's a risky situation because emergency generators are big machines, and they could easily break down. They are reliable, but at the same time, (require) a high-maintenance type of machinery due to their wear and tear," Meshkati said.

"I would not be surprised if some of them break down after this length of period of being in operation," he added.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the situation is further complicated by Russia's failure to carry out scheduled repairs and maintenance, which increases the risk of diesel generator failure and threatens a shutdown of the nuclear fuel cooling system and failure of critical safety systems. This could lead to a nuclear or radiation accident.

"The potential consequences of the failure of safety systems at the ZNPP will be transboundary and pose a danger not only to Ukraine but also to many European countries," a spokesperson said.

"No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything," the spokesperson added.

The ZNPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The six reactors were shut down a month after Moscow's occupation, but the facility still requires electricity to maintain cooling and prevent a nuclear incident.

Russian troops reportedly struck a power line on Sept. 23, severing the plant's connection to Ukraine's electrical grid. This marks the 10th and longest blackout at the plant since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

While Russian state media blame Ukraine for the strike, Greenpeace Ukraine published an investigation on Oct. 1, saying that there is no evidence of any military strikes around the pylons and power line network at the ZNPP. Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Vande Putte told the Kyiv Independent that Russia can repair the line "in a matter of hours."

"But they don't do that. They created the crisis, and they want to manage it as a political strategy. It's a very precise sabotage," Vande Putte said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 1 social post that "Russia is deliberately creating the threat of radiation incidents, taking advantage, unfortunately, of the weak position of the IAEA and its director, Rafael Grossi, as well as the distraction of global attention."

Zelensky's statements came after a Russian attack on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast, which caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 1.

While ZNPP "is not going to blow up tomorrow," the situation is serious in a long-term perspective, Vande Putte said.  

"They (Russians) can let the crisis get worse. (...) They can move closer and closer to that point over the coming week, and to have that kind of nuclear blackmail. That's their strategy," he added.

Dmytro Orlov, Energodar mayor, who lives in Ukraine-controlled territory, told the Kyiv Independent that at the start of the Russian occupation, the power plant remained fully operational. 

"But they pressured the staff to the point that there was almost no one left to work there," he said. "All the equipment was shut down, is not being repaired, and is deteriorating. And the station has been turned into a military base."

"The nuclear power plant is no longer used as an energy facility, but is used exclusively for military purposes, and the goal is clear — international pressure. The occupiers are doing this (provocations) to use nuclear blackmail against the whole world," Orlov added.

An investigation by the Truth Hounds and Greenpeace Ukraine published on Sept. 24 detailed Rosatom's role in pressuring plant staff,  including torture, "including beatings, electrocution, sexual violence, mock executions, and threats to family members of detainees." Rosatom, the Russian nuclear giant, became ZNPP's operator after the occupation.

The report indicated that 78 staff members were unlawfully detained, while six were "tortured to death."

Meshkati suggests that Russia's actions at the power plant could be a negotiating tactic.

"Nuclear plants are too important to be used as a bargaining chip or for political horse-trading or power plays. They are really too dangerous. If something goes wrong, everybody, the friend and foe, will be hurt equally," Meshkati said.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Oct. 2 that Russia deliberately cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as it's preparing to reconnect the facility to its own energy system.

Greenpeace Ukraine published a report on Sept. 27 that used satellite imagery and Rosatom's reports indicating  that Russia wants to restart one of the reactors, and reconnect the grid to the occupied territories and eventually to the Kremlin.

Vande Putte also suggests that Russia's motivation is based "not so much for electricity reasons, but for military and political reasons."

It's the way for them to say clearly "this is Russian territory, it's our nuclear power plant," Vande Putte said.

In a statement issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), chief Rafael Grossi said that the U.N. agency is "in constant contact with the two sides with the aim to enable the plant's swift re-connection to the electricity grid."

The EU has called on Russia to "immediately cease all military operations around the nuclear plant" and enable the repairs. In a Sept. 30 statement, the bloc's diplomatic service denounced Russian occupation of the plant as illegal and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces.

The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

As Chicago braces for a possible deployment of National Guard troops by President Trump, we speak with Ed Yohnka from the ACLU of Illinois about how the administration's ongoing immigration crackdown is putting communities at risk. For weeks, federal agents with ICE and other agencies have carried out violent immigration arrests across Chicago, including in a high-profile raid on a residential building in which many U.S. citizens were also detained. “There's no emergency,” says Yohnka, who blames the administration for needlessly escalating tensions in Chicago, seemingly in search of excuses for more violence. “And when anybody protests, then that's seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces,” says Yohnka.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: A federal judge in Chicago has refused the Illinois attorney general's request to immediately block the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to the state, instead saying she'll hear arguments on Thursday. This is in contrast to Portland, Oregon, where a federal judge appointed by President Trump did issue a restraining order to stop Trump from sending troops. Illinois Governor Pritzker said Monday he would not back down.

GOV. JB PRITZKER: Since the beginning of this invasion, families have been snatched up off the streets or removed from their homes, zip-tied and detained for hours, including especially U.S. citizens and legal residents of our state. And in the words of CBP chief patrol agent Greg Bovino, they're being chosen by how they look.

AMY GOODMAN: Also on Monday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson announced he had signed an executive order to stop federal immigration agents from using certain city-owned spaces.

MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON: The order establishes ICE-free zones. That means that city property and unwilling private businesses will no longer serve as staging grounds for these raids.

AMY GOODMAN: This comes after an overnight ICE raid on a Chicago apartment complex days ago, when ICE agents, wearing fatigues and carrying guns, rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and zip-tied children and U.S. citizens while carrying out arrests. A neighbor described the terrifying ordeal to ABC 7 Chicago.

EBONI WATSON: They was terrified. The kids was crying. People were screaming. They looked very distraughted. I was out there crying when I seen the little girl come around the corner, because they was bringing the kids out, too, had them zip-tied to each other. That's all I kept asking: Where's the morality? Where's the human? One of them literally laughed. He was standing right here. He said, ‘[bleep] them kids.'”

AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Friday, federal agents handcuffed Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes and briefly detained her when she asked if they had a signed warrant for a man they were trying to detain at a hospital.

JESSIE FUENTES: He has constitutional rights.

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: No. You need to leave.

JESSIE FUENTES: — judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: Turn around. You're impeding. Turn around and leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: Yeah. He is under —

FEDERAL AGENT 1: I am going to arrest you if you do not leave.

FEDERAL AGENT 2: He is under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant?

FEDERAL AGENT 2: You are going to be placed under arrest.

JESSIE FUENTES: Do you have a signed judicial warrant for me?

FEDERAL AGENT 1: You need to leave.

AMY GOODMAN: For those who can't see, the agent then pulled her hands behind her back and handcuffed her. The video was shared in a report by the news outlet Book Club Chicago, which is part of a coalition of Chicago journalists and activists who filed a new lawsuit with the ACLU of Illinois against the Trump administration over a pattern of, quote, “extreme brutality,” unquote, by federal agents during protests at the Broadview ICE detention center in a Chicago suburb. In this CBS News Chicago story, correspondent Asal Rezaei describes how she was attacked while reporting at the ICE jail.

ASAL REZAEI: An ICE agent that was masked pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. He saw that my window was open, and he shot right here. You can see the point of impact right there.

MARISSA SULEK: You can see white powder exploded on the hood of her car, windshield, and even engulfed the inside.

ASAL REZAEI: And I was sitting right there with my window open. A lot of it went inside of my car and on my face. I immediately felt it burning. I started throwing up.

AMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois.

Ed, thanks so much for being with us. There's so much to discuss here, I mean, one lawsuit after another, most recently yesterday, the filing of the lawsuit around the deploying the federalized troops to Chicago. Apparently, Governor Abbott allowed the troops to go from Texas, and they're in Indiana right now. But talk about the judge's ruling and the other lawsuits, as well, that you're a part of.

ED YOHNKA: Sure. So, the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago, as you say, filed a lawsuit yesterday to challenge the federalization of National Guard and deploying them here, for a very simple reason: There's no emergency, and there's no justification for having done — or, for having guards or troops here in the city of Chicago or in the Chicagoland area.

In fact, what we have seen over the last few weeks is the escalation of violence and chaos on behalf of ICE agents, or conducted by ICE agents, everything from, you know, marching up and down in fatigues and pulling families out of parks, marching up and down Michigan Avenue, pulling families out of parks, to, as was described in our lawsuit yesterday with a coalition of legal organizations, you know, taking on what we've seen is, you know, just the indiscriminate firing of projectiles and chemical weapons at the Broadview detention center and — or, processing center, which has become a detention center.

So, what we're seeing, and, you know, in the other clips you played, is just this escalation of violence. And when anybody protests, then that's seized upon by the administration as a claim for the need to bring in further forces. But further forces are just going to escalate tensions here. They're not going to make things better.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ed, could you talk about that, this remarkable raid that occurred last week at an apartment complex that the ICE were claiming that it was a hotbed for Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang? Can you talk about what actually happened there?

ED YOHNKA: Yes. And, you know, Juan, you know how just incredible and, you know, remarkable this is, as a Chicagoan. Last week, what we saw was, in the middle of the night, hundreds of heavily armed ICE agents, you know, masked up, attacked a single apartment building, broke into that building, rappelled off of a Black Hawk helicopter to get to the roof of the building, then proceeded to go through the building and kick down every single door that they could, take whomever they found into custody, and then, as we know, release some of those people hours later because they either had no background, criminal background, they were green card holders, and, in many cases, you know, they were citizens, including zip-tying children, zip-tying children out in the streets of Chicago, separating them from their families and then hauling them away, as well.

You know, this is just — you know, and we have not yet, to this hour, heard any justification or rationalization for why it was that they needed this kind of overwhelming force. There's not been charges brought against anybody. There's been no explanation. There's been no production of a warrant in public to justify why an entire apartment building was attacked. Even if there was a person or set of people in the building that they wanted to try to detain, they didn't need to literally render, you know, a hundred people unhoused because they've created a situation where they can't go back into the building.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And have they — have there been any reports of who was actually detained or where the people are?

ED YOHNKA: No, that's been very difficult to find out, Juan. In fact, you know, our lawyers have spent the last several days trying to talk to people who lived in the building, trying to talk to neighbors and others around there, to see if we can find out where these people were taken to, to see what happened to them, to hear about their experiences firsthand. But the reporting on this is just awful.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about the possibility of President Trump invoking the Insurrection Act, and how rare this is?

ED YOHNKA: It would be incredibly rare, Amy. As you know, the Insurrection Act has been used only a few times in our country's history. And the purposes of the Insurrection Act are in no way, shape or form met in the city of Chicago. There is no invasion here. There is no armed conflict going on. There is no, you know, sabotage to the actions of the federal government.

And in fact, the courts and the government and everyone else is proceeding and operating in the normal fashion. You know, just to make the point, yesterday, government lawyers stood against state lawyers in a federal courthouse and in a federal courtroom to raise the question about whether or not National Guard was available. Police stopped people yesterday in the city of Chicago. ICE continued to make raids in the city of Chicago. There is nothing here that justifies something as extreme as declaring that there is an insurrection, which requires, you know, troops and allowing troops to engage in practices that take them beyond just, quote-unquote, “providing protection” for federal officials.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk, Ed, also about the response of local city officials? There was an extraordinary press conference by Police Superintendent Snelling yesterday, where he said that some — more than 20 Chicago police officers were actually hit with tear gas at Broadview, fired by ICE agents.

ED YOHNKA: Actually, that was at a protest after a person was shot in the Brighton Park neighborhood — 

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Oh, Brighton Park, I'm sorry, yeah.

ED YOHNKA: — on Saturday. CPD responded to that event because of the fact that there was shots fired. There was — you know, people had gathered around. There were people protesting, decrying the fact that ICE had once again shot someone, as we saw here a couple of weeks ago in a traffic stop. And in this instance, you know, CPD showed up to try to assist with crowd control, with clearing the traffic and allowing people to move on, and ICE, instead of letting CPD or any other official do their — other officials do their job, simply began to fire tear gas at the crowd.

This is the same thing, by the way, we've seen in Broadview. Last weekend, the Illinois State Police set up a protection zone at Broadview and tried to sort of create at least some barrier between ICE agents and others. And again, rather than working with local police, ICE just continued to behave in the way that they have for the past few weeks, to go through the crowd when they wanted to, to try to push back the crowd. You know, these are just these kind of bullying, goonish tactics that we're just seeing them do anywhere. And it doesn't matter if they're, you know, trying — if they're pushing back against protesters, against clergy members, against journalists or against the police. They just seem to think that they have the power to act and behave in whatever way they want.

AMY GOODMAN: Ed, we were just showing video put out by the Department of Homeland Security, as you were talking about the Black Hawk helicopter, ICE agents rappelling down from it, armed, automatic weapons, the agents moving into apartments. They're putting it out because, presumably, they think this is good propaganda for them. Can you comment on this, the terror that these families felt, with faces not being obscured?

ED YOHNKA: Let me — thanks, Amy, for giving me the chance to speak to this. And let me start by noting they put out this propaganda reel before they ever explained what the actual rationale for the raid is. So, the most important thing for them was to have HD video of what was happening, not to actually speak to why this happened.

And what you're — you know, what you see in that video, and I think what you hear from members of the community, is a complete terror, a sense of terror that their community, a working-class, Black and Brown community, is being targeted in this way by federal forces using this kind of militarized force. And it is — you know, it's causing, you know, panic and terror and fear all across the community for many. There are people who are not leaving their homes every day out of fear. There are children who are not going to school. You know, restaurants and cafes and stores in some of our neighborhoods are suffering economically as the result of this fact. And all of this is in service of a reckless policy that is not in any way, shape or form making the city of Chicago or the Chicagoland area any more safe.

AMY GOODMAN: Thank you for being with us, Ed Yohnka, ACLU of Illinois director of communications.

Coming up, we go to Gaza as negotiators from Israel and Hamas are indirectly engaged in ceasefire talks. Stay with us.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to include confirmation from the General Staff and additional reporting.

Ukrainian drones struck Russian-occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 6, hitting the Feodosia oil terminal, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Oct. 6.

The terminal, located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, is the largest oil storage facility in Crimea. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces. 

Pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Crimean Wind said the explosion sparked a fire visible from tens of kilometers away, while additional blasts were reported near the Saki and Kacha airfields. 

According to the General Staff, the terminal serves as a multifunctional facility for transferring oil and petroleum products between rail, sea, and road transport. 

Crimean Wind later reported that the facility continues to burn as of Oct. 7, with the blaze now spreading to oil tanks in the northern part of the depot.

Ukrainian forces also struck an ammunition depot belonging to a logistics battalion of Russia's 18th Combined Arms Army in Crimea, though the results of that strike are still being assessed.

Russia's Defense Ministry claimed it had intercepted 251 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 40 over the occupied peninsula.

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims.

Ukraine last struck the Feodosia oil depot in October 2024, prompting Russian-appointed local occupation authorities to declare a state of emergency. 

The strike comes amid Ukraine's intensified campaign against Russian energy infrastructure. 

Fuel shortages have worsened across occupied Crimea and Sevastopol, with around 50% of gas stations halting gasoline sales, Russian business outlet Kommersant reported on Sept. 24.

Citing data from 17,000 gas stations, the outlet said the Southern Federal District — which Russia claims includes occupied Crimea — was among the hardest hit, with over 14% stations suspending fuel sales.

The shortages also follow a string of Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil refineries in August. 

According to the Financial Times, sixteen of Russia's 38 oil refineries have been hit since August 2025, forcing Russian diesel exports to drop to their lowest level since 2020.

"From our point of view, the only people who should be ashamed and should remain silent on the issue of Nord Stream 2 are those who decided to build it," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.



The announcement comes, as Russia stepped up its campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent days.

A train carrying military cargo derailed in Russia's Leningrad Oblast following an explosion early on Oct. 7, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.



Latvia fully closed its airspace along the Russian and Belarusian borders between Sept. 11 and 18, following a series of regional security incidents. Since Sept. 18, restrictions have applied during nighttime hours.

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof about Europe's security and dependence on U.S. support within NATO to deter Russian aggression.



After Russian state media put the blame for the attacks on Ukraine's Armed Forces, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 6 that it was "a deliberate provocation by Russia."

Russian authorities have accused Oleksiy Arestovych of terrorism and spreading "fake news about the Russian army." 



Majoti Sahil Mohamed Hussein, a 22-year-old student from the Indian city of Morbi, allegedly came to Russia to study at a university.

The call is the first publicly reported conversation between the presidents since March. Their relations had seemed to deteriorate since then, as Moscow and Baku clashed over several political and security issues.

The move enables the family of Quinn Schansman, an 18-year-old American passenger killed in the crash, to sue Sberbank under the U.S. anti-terrorism law.

The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

An agent shot a woman after federal officers accused her of driving toward them in the Brighton Park neighborhood.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

An account given in court on Monday by the attorney of a woman who was shot several times by a Border Patrol agent “really makes it sounds like” the agent “tried to murder an anti-ICE protester in Chicago and DHS lied to cover for him,” said one researcher, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, whose agents have descended on the Chicago area in recent weeks and have violently raided homes and assaulted community members there.

Christopher Parente, an attorney for Marimar Martinez, spoke at a hearing Monday at a federal courthouse two days after federal officers accused her of driving toward them in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago.

Parente said body camera footage called the account of federal prosecutors and Border Patrol into question, as it showed a Border Patrol agent saying to Martinez, “Do something, bitch” before pulling over and shooting her at least five times.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“We need a zero tolerance policy for lying by law enforcement,” said Jonathan Cohn, political director of Progressive Mass.

Well I'll be gosh darned, looks like those rascals lied to us againhttps://t.co/VKUxgVZcWz https://t.co/7bgnHxS7NL pic.twitter.com/QXq8kvMkqa

Martinez and another driver, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, were charged Sunday with felony assault of a federal officer, with prosecutors saying they were “aggressively” driving in a “convoy” including several vehicles. The Chicago Sun-Times noted that a statement by DHS after the incident referenced a loaded gun in Martinez's car, which was not mentioned in the charges filed.

In court on Monday, Assistant US Attorney Sean Hennessy told U.S. District Judge Heather McShain that Martinez had a gun in her car but did not brandish it, while Parente said she has a concealed-carry license and a valid firearm.

A video captured by a security camera at a nearby tire shop showed Martinez's Nissan Rogue pulling alongside a Chevy Tahoe driven by Border Patrol agents, who had just conducted an operation in nearby Oak Lawn. A GMC Envoy driven by Ruiz is seen following closely behind the authorities' car. The shooting is not captured on the video.

McShain acknowledged the danger of Martinez and Ruiz's actions but denied a request by the federal government to detain them, pending trial, citing the two US citizens' lack of criminal history and extensive community ties. Martinez works for a school and had several character witnesses write letters to the court on her behalf.

“I think there's a danger to the community, but I don't think it's Ms. Martinez,” said Parente at the hearing.

Roughly 100 community members responded to the shooting Saturday by holding a protest in the area where federal agents fired pepper balls and tear gas at the demonstrators.

The shooting in Brighton Park was one of several recent incidents in which federal agents have violently confronted community members in the Chicago area, following President Donald Trump's deployment of immigration officers as part of what he calls “Operation Midway Blitz.” Over the weekend, Trump announced he was deploying hundreds of members of the National Guard — both from Illinois and other states — to Chicago to support the effort over the objections of rights groups and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

The president and his allies have repeatedly claimed that a federal law enforcement response is necessary in cities including Chicago, Portland, and Washington, DC, even as statistics have shown violent crime is down in the cities and as local authorities have denied that protesters against Trump's mass deportation campaign are causing havoc.

On Monday, officials in Chicago and Illinois sued the Trump administration over its invasion of the city, and a group of protesters and journalists filed a separate suit arguing that federal agents have “shot, gassed, and detained individuals” for exercising their First Amendment rights.

The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump predicted Canada and the United States would ultimately reach a deal over punishing U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods, suggesting some amount of levies would remain in place, and was ambivalent about whether he remains committed to a trilateral trade pact with Mexico as the third partner.

He spoke Tuesday ahead of a working lunch with Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House. 

Mr. Carney left the lunch and got into his motorcade at around 2:32. He did not respond to shouted questions about how the meeting was.

Speaking in front of reporters earlier, Mr. Trump told told Mr. Carney that the U.S. and Canada have a “natural conflict” because the U.S. wants to stop importing cars from Canada.

Still, Mr. Trump said, “we'll probably work that out” and the pair have “come a long way” in recent months.

“We have a natural conflict. We also have mutual love, we have great love for each other, I love Canada,” Mr. Trump said at the start of his meeting with Mr. Carney, the Prime Minister's second at the White House.

“The problem we have is that they want a car company and I want a car company. They want steel and we want steel.”

The President said that on trade “the U.S. was always giving everything to Canada” but Americans now “want to make our own steel” and autos.

President Donald Trump says there's a “natural business conflict” between Canada and the U.S. over trade in cars and steel.

He also jokingly revived his talk of annexing Canada. When Mr. Carney referred to Mr. Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal in Gaza as “in many respects, the most important” peace effort in the world, Mr. Trump interjected.

“The merger of Canada and the United States of America,” the President said, clapping Mr. Carney on the back. “I'm only kidding.”

“That wasn't where I was going,” Mr. Carney replied.

Mr. Trump expressed ambivalence about continuing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is due to be reviewed and possibly renegotiated over the next year. Instead, Mr. Trump said, he might do separate trade deals with Canada and Mexico.

“We can renegotiate and that would be good, or we can just do different deals, we're allowed to do different deals if we want,” Mr. Trump said. “I don't care. I want to make whatever the best deal is for this country, and also very much with Canada in mind.”

Mr. Trump said he thinks the problem with Canada-U.S. trade is that the two countries are geographically close and so Canadian auto and steel production is not limited to domestic demand. He said this isn't as much of a problem for overseas trading partners. “In other countries, they're very far away, and there's no problem.”

Mr. Carney told Mr. Trump that Canada would make an estimated $1-trillion worth of investments in the United States in the next five years, if Canada gets the “deal we expect to get” from the U.S. 

Canadian officials have been working for months to add up all prospective investment that business or government would make in the U.S. in the foreseeable future, copying similar commitments by other U.S. trading partners including the European Union.

The Prime Minister's Office later clarified the investment estimate was in U.S. dollars.

The U.S. President said Washington and Ottawa are “working on formulas” for a deal on autos – a phrase that appears to refer to the idea of a tariff-rate quota on Canadian autos.

Pete Hoekstra, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, last month talked of such an idea. Asked how he saw the future of the Canada-U.S. relationship when it comes to automobiles, Mr. Hoekstra pointed to Mr. Trump's trade deal with Britain as a model – where the U.S. set a 10-per-cent tariff on British autos for the first 100,000 vehicles shipped to the United States each year. U.S. tariffs rise to 27.5 per cent for each car beyond 100,000 units.

The President also revived his longstanding complaints about Canada's supply-management system for dairy and eggs. Asked whether a new USMCA would include tariffs, Mr. Trump said “we're going to have tariff between Canada, you know they have them with us.” He cited dairy tariffs that he said can reach 300 per cent in some cases.

Mr. Trump confirmed that he would work with Ottawa on joining his planned Golden Dome missile defence system.

“One area where we are working very closely is the Golden Dome,” he said. “We'll be working together on a Golden Dome for the two countries.”

Mr. Carney pushed back gently on Mr. Trump's “conflict” language, saying the two countries merely “compete” before rattling of statistics about the amount of business Canada does with the U.S.

“There are areas where we compete and it is in those areas where we have to come to an agreement that works,” he said. “But there are more areas where we are stronger together.”

Otherwise, the Prime Minister was careful to avoid conflict and heaped praise on Mr. Trump as “a transformative president” who had achieved economic success and “unprecedented” peace deals with several countries and was “disabling Iran as a force for terror.”

Mr. Carney picked up on Mr. Trump's contention that his Gaza peace plan will solve a conflict that has lasted “thousands of years.”

“This prospect of peace that you've made possible, Canada stands four-square behind those efforts,” he said.

Mr. Trump returned the compliments and said Canada has “worked hard and they've done a much better job than in the past” on ending fentanyl trafficking across the border, the ostensible reason for some of Mr. Trump's tariffs.

He also promised a deal that Canadians would be happy with.

“I think the people of Canada, they will love us again,” Mr. Trump said. “A lot of them, I think they love us.”

Mr. Trump repeatedly complimented Mr. Carney, including on his election victory.

“He's a great Prime Minister, I mean, he could represent me any time. He is a very good leader, he's a nice man, but he can be nasty, maybe as nasty as anyone,” Mr. Trump said. “He is a world-class leader, he's a man that knows what he wants.” 

Asked why Mr. Trump could not reach a deal with Mr. Carney if he is a great man, the President replied: “Because I want to be a great man, too,” to hoots of laughter from Mr. Carney and both delegations.

Ahead of the meeting, the Prime Minister's Office played down expectations for a trade deal or major breakthrough, and both sides characterized the sit-down as a “working” visit.

Mr. Trump, for his part, described his tariffs as a thundering success when asked whether he was open to changing his position on them in talks with Mr. Carney. The President said the levies had been bringing money into U.S. coffers and putting pressure on companies to leave Canada and other countries and come to the U.S.

“A lot of companies from Canada are moving into the United States, you know, everybody's moving back,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, adding federal officials were finding “billions of dollars that they didn't even know they had” because of the tariffs.

Mr. Trump did not specify which companies are moving to the U.S. as a result of the tariffs.

The tariffs on Canada are part of the President's global trade war, designed to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S. by making it costly to import products from other countries. The policy, however, is also costly for the U.S. as the price of tariffs is paid by American companies importing goods.

Mr. Carney, who won April's election on a pledge to reach a new economic and security deal with the U.S., is under domestic pressure to deliver relief. But the template of trade deals Mr. Trump has struck in recent months with Britain, Vietnam, Japan and other countries has required U.S. trading partners to accept Mr. Trump's tariffs and make other concessions in exchange for not being hit with even higher tariffs. So far, Mr. Carney has resisted striking a similar deal.

Looming over the talks is the coming review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a continental free-trade pact that was meant to avoid tariffs of the sort Mr. Trump has imposed. 

In recent days, the Trump administration has signalled that it might pursue separate trade negotiations with Canada and Mexico rather than keeping the deal trilateral.

“If you look at NAFTA and then USMCA, it's almost like: why did we bundle it all together?” Jamieson Greer, the U.S. Trade Representative, told the Economic Club of New York last week. “We have issues with them, with the Canadians, that are specific to Canada, and issues with the Mexicans are specific to Mexico.”

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has broken with Donald Trump on the issue at the centre of the government shutdown.

The US government shut down on Oct 1 after the Democrats and Republicans were unable to break the deadlock to pass a spending bill.

Democrats have demanded that tax credits introduced in 2021 to make health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans be extended, arguing that their expiration would double what low-and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act pay on their premiums next year.

The Maga firebrand said she was “absolutely disgusted” that health insurance premiums could double when the tax credits expire at the end of the year, and that she refused to play “loyalty games”.

In a lengthy post on X, she wrote: “I'm going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children's insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district.”

Republicans have said these negotiations can take place after a spending bill is passed and have repeatedly claimed that Democrats are trying to expand government subsidised healthcare, also known as Obamacare, to illegal migrants.

Ms Greene made clear she is opposed to extending health care to those without legal status.

“No, I'm not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games. I'm a Republican and won't vote for illegals to have any tax payer-funded healthcare or benefits,” she wrote. “I'm AMERICA ONLY!!!”

She added: “And I'm absolutely disgusted that health insurance premiums will DOUBLE if the tax credits expire this year.”

As the shutdown enters its eighth day on Wednesday, flights have been delayed across the country owing to major airports facing staffing shortages.

Air traffic controllers are considered essential workers, so are required to work without pay during a government shutdown.

On Monday night, 12 federal aviation administration facilities saw personnel shortages, with control towers in Burbank, Phoenix and Denver announcing so-called staffing triggers, according to CNN.

Other airports dealing with understaffing include Newark, New Jersey, Jacksonville, Florida, Chicago, Washington, DC and Indianapolis.

Last time the government shut down in 2019, widespread flight delays caused by controllers calling in sick at high rates brought a swift end to the standoff.

The delays came hours after Sean Duffy, the transport secretary, warned that a federal programme that subsides rural flights would run out of funding by Sunday, further threatening service.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump dubbed the flight backlog “Democrat delays” and accused the opposition of pursuing a “kamikaze” policy by pushing for a government shutdown.

“They're the ones that started it....and it's almost like a kamikaze attack by them,” he told reporters inside the Oval Office. “They have nothing to lose.”

The White House is allegedly seeking to block as many as 750,000 furloughed federal workers from claiming compensation following the government shutdown.

Under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, furloughed government employees have previously been entitled to backpay once a shutdown comes to a close.

However, the Trump administration is allegedly looking at ways to circumvent this, according to Axios.

“Does this law cover all these furloughed employees automatically? The conventional wisdom is: Yes, it does. Our view is: No, it doesn't,” a senior White House official told the news outlet.

If the White House pursues the policy, it would dramatically ramp up pressure on the Democrats to bring the week-long shutdown to an end.

Democrats have so far weathered threats from Russ Vought, the White House budget director, to use the shutdown to implement mass lay-offs.

Mr Trump echoed these threats on Monday, warning that if the shutdown continues, “it could, at some point it will” trigger lay-offs.

After another vote in the Senate on Monday night failed to advance a stopgap spending bill, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said that if there are lay-offs “it falls on Donald Trump's shoulders”.

“He's doing it, not Democrats,” Mr Schumer said. “And the American people know that.”

Officers say woman was in chase ending in ramming border patrol vehicle during Trump's immigration crackdown

The attorney for a woman who was shot by federal agents in Chicago over the weekend after she allegedly rammed a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicle has claimed that body-camera footage captures one of the officers saying: “Do something, bitch,” before opening fire, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

The shooting occurred on Saturday morning in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood, as immigration agents, at the behest of the second Trump administration, have been scouring Illinois's largest city for people to deport.

Federal agents allege that the woman, 30-year-old Marimar Martinez, was involved in a vehicle chase that ended in her ramming a CBP vehicle. Authorities claim that a government vehicle carrying three border protection agents was followed and boxed in by a “convoy of civilian vehicles”, including cars driven by Martinez and another driver, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz.

Both Martinez and Ruiz have been charged with “forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer”, according to the US justice department.

On Monday, after Martinez's attorney disputed the government's portrayal of the case, a judge ordered her and Ruiz released from custody pending trial, ABC7 Chicago reported.

According to the criminal complaint filed in the case, the government says that the convoy of vehicles followed the CBP agents “closely” and pursued them “aggressively”. They claim that Martinez and Ruiz drove into and struck the CBP vehicle, “leading to a temporary loss of control” of the car.

“After being struck and boxed in by the Martinez and Ruiz Vehicles,” prosecutors say an agent exited the vehicle. The complaint alleges that Martinez then drove her car northbound in the direction of the agent, at which point, the agent “proceeded to fire approximately five shots from his service weapon at the driver of the Martinez Vehicle”.

The complaint alleges that Martinez fled the scene and was later found at a repair shop about a mile away. She was transported to hospital and treated for gunshot wounds.

Federal officials with the Department of Homeland Security said Martinez was armed with a semi-automatic weapon at the time of the incident and had allegedly doxed – or published sensitive identifying information about – agents online the week prior. However, the criminal complaint does not mention her being armed.

During a detention hearing on Monday, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that Martinez's defense attorney, Christopher Parente, challenged the government's account of the incident, and claimed that the body-camera footage shows an officer saying to Martinez, “Do something, bitch,” before firing at her.

Parente at the hearing also said that the footage showed the officer driving the vehicle suddenly “turn the wheel to the left” then jump out and “just start shooting”, according to the Chicago Tribune.

“What I do know is – it was Ms Martinez who has seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent, who fired within seconds of getting out of this vehicle,” Parente said, as the Tribune reported.

The body camera footage has not been made public.

At the same hearing, the Chicago Tribune reported, assistant US attorney Sean Hennessy described Martinez and Ruiz's actions as “extremely dangerous and extremely reckless”.

The Tribune reported that Hennessy also said that the body-camera footage also recorded agents saying: “We're getting boxed in! We gotta get out of here! She's going to make contact,” before the car was indeed struck.

According to the Tribune, Hennessy also mentioned in the hearing that Martinez had a loaded gun in her purse at the time of the incident. He reportedly said that she has a concealed-carry permit and acknowledged that she did not brandish the gun during the interaction.

The Trump administration's ramped-up immigration enforcement in Chicago has been met with protests.

Meanwhile, national guard troops from Texas were headed to Illinois after a federal judge declined to immediately block them in the wake of an Illinois lawsuit against the Trump administration.

US district judge April Perry allowed the federal government to continue the troop deployment in Chicago while it responds to Illinois' suit.

Sources say the changes to Social Security are “a priority” for Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought.

A new report suggests that the Trump White House is planning on drastically changing how the Social Security Administration (SSA) calculates whether a person is eligible for disability payments, by eliminating or altering age as a consideration.

A number of factors are taken into account when it comes to disability claims, including a person's work experience, their educational background, and their age, to determine whether or not an individual is capable of shifting to other work. But according to sources speaking with The Washington Post, age may soon be considered less or not at all.

According to three people familiar with the administration's plan, the White House may alter the age threshold to qualify for disability, shifting the current standard of age 50 to age 60. The administration is also contemplating wiping out the age consideration altogether.

It's unclear how many people would be affected by the proposals. A recent analysis considering a 10 percent drop in people who are eligible to receive disability-based disbursements suggested that 750,000 fewer people would receive benefits from the program over the next 10 years, with another 80,000 widows and children who benefit from the program also being detrimentally affected. 

Those sources also said that the new framework was a “priority of Russel Vought,” the current director of the Office of Management and Budget and a co-author of Project 2025, a manifesto of right-wing policy goals that was published during the 2024 presidential race. President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from that document on the campaign trail, but since taking office in January, has reportedly enacted nearly half of its objectives. In recent weeks, he has more openly embraced Project 2025 in public comments.

In response to the report from the Post, a spokesperson for the White House maintained, as Trump himself did during his campaign, that the president “will always protect and defend Social Security.”

Lawmakers and advocates condemned the administration's plan, warning that it would have negative consequences for beneficiaries. 

“This is Phase One of the Republican campaign to force Americans to work into old age to access their earned Social Security benefits, and represents the largest cut to disability insurance in American history,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) said. “Americans with disabilities have worked and paid into Social Security just like everybody else, and they do not deserve the indignity of more bureaucratic water torture to get what they paid for.”

“Americans EARN Social Security disability benefits” by paying into the program “with every paycheck, along with retirement and survivor benefits,” read a Facebook post from Social Security Works, an organization that aims to defend and expand Social Security benefits. “But now, the Trump administration is trying to cut those benefits. They'll do anything to protect billionaires from paying their fair share.”

“This is a cut to the benefits millions of Americans have earned. And we're not going to stand for it — we're going to fight,” the Alliance for Retired Americans wrote on X.

Austrian was killed in paragliding accident in July

56-year-old broke sound barrier during 2012 jump

The paragliding crash that killed extreme athlete Felix Baumgartner in July was caused by human error, an investigating prosecutor said on Tuesday.

Baumgartner, the first skydiver to fall faster than the speed of sound, died in July along Italy's Adriatic coast. He was 56. Witnesses said the flight appeared normal until Baumgartner's paraglider started spinning to the ground, crashing near a hotel swimming pool.

Prosecutor Raffaele Iannella said the investigation found no technical issues with Baumgartner's motorized paraglider.

“He fell into a spiral, and he could not get out. He was unable to do the maneuver that he should have done to exit [the fall],” Iannella told the Associated Press.

The prosecutor will now request that the case be closed, which will require a judge's approval.

Known as “Fearless Felix,” Baumgartner made headlines around the world in 2012 when he became the first skydiver to break the sound barrier. He wore a pressurized suit and jumped from a capsule hoisted more than 24 miles above New Mexico by a giant helium balloon.

The Austrian topped out at 843.6 mph – the equivalent of 1.25 times the speed of sound – during a nine-minute descent. At one point, he went into a potentially dangerous flat spin while still supersonic, spinning for 13 seconds, his crew later said.

“When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble,” he said after landing in New Mexico. “You do not think about breaking records any more, you do not think of about gaining scientific data. The only thing you want is to come back alive.”

Baumgartner, a former Austrian military parachutist, made thousands of jumps from planes, bridges, skyscrapers and landmarks around the world, but denied he took unnecessary risks. “I hate it if someone calls me a thrillseeker or an adrenaline junkie because I am not. I like the whole planning,” he said in 2012.

            Russian regions are dramatically increasing the amount of money they pay to new military recruits as analysts say “ideological” recruitment campaigns are no longer enough to motivate people to fight in Ukraine.
    


            Several regions announced in recent days they would as much as quadruple the sign-up bonuses in a bid to boost their recruitment numbers.
    


            Russia has been suffering enormous casualties in its war on Ukraine, with an estimated 1 million Russian soldiers killed or injured since the start of the full-scale invasion three and half years ago.
    


            Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov made recruitment one of the military's top priorities during a high-level defense meeting in August, stressing that manpower was “key for supporting offensive operations.”
    


Russian advance into Ukraine slowed in September, monitoring group says



            But while Belousov claimed recruitment targets were being met, the independent Russian investigative outlet IStories reported otherwise.
    


            It said that, based on official budget expenditure data, some 37,900 people signed contracts with the defense ministry in the second quarter of 2025 – two-and-a-half times fewer than a year ago.
    


            The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US-based conflict monitor, said that Russian force generation efforts were “increasingly resembling complex business models rather than an ideologically driven recruitment campaign.”
    


            In an analyst note in September, the ISW said Russian authorities and informal recruiters “continue to employ financial incentives, deception, and coercion” to bolster recruitment.
    


            The government of the Tyumen region in Siberia said on Monday that it would pay new recruits a lump sum of 3 million rubles ($36,560), on top of the 400,000 rubles they get from the federal government – as long as the recruits sign up before the end of November.
    


            The new regional payment is a significant bump up from the 1.9 million rubles recruits in Tyumen received until now and the equivalent of three full years' worth of the average salary there, according to Rosstat, the Russian Federal Statistics Service. 



            Similarly, the governor of the Voronezh region in southwestern Russia announced on Telegram last week that the sign-up payment from the region would quadruple to 2.1 million rubles.
    


            The local Voronezh government said that, to receive the payment, recruits don't need to be from the region, as long as it's where they sign the documents.
    


            The Tambov, Krasnodar, Kurgan and Altai regions, and the republic of Tatarstan, also announced significant increases in the payments, which come on top of the monthly salary for contract soldiers fighting in Ukraine.  That starts at roughly 210,000 rubles ($2,600), more than double the average Russian wage.

Republican says she is ‘disgusted' by rising insurance premiums and may defy her party over expired tax credits

US politics live – latest updates

Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has indicated she is willing to negotiate with Democrats over healthcare insurance costs – the central political issue that has kept the US government shut down since 1 October.

Indicating that she is willing to stand against her party on the issue, Greene said Monday night in a post on the social platform X that she's “absolutely disgusted” insurance premiums could double if a system of tax credits dating back to Barack Obama's presidency is allowed to expire at the end of the year.

But the US House member from Georgia, who has previously criticized her fellow Republicans on several key issues, including funding for Ukraine and the war in Gaza, did not have kind words of the Affordable Care Act itself – which took 427 days to pass during Obama's first term and stands as his signature legislation.

“Let's just say as nicely as possible, I'm not a fan,” she wrote. “But I'm going to go against everyone on this issue because when the tax credits expire this year my own adult children's insurance premiums for 2026 are going to DOUBLE, along with all the wonderful families and hard-working people in my district.

“I was not in Congress when all this Obamacare, ‘Affordable Care Act' bullshit started,” Greene wrote. “I got here in 2021. As a matter of fact, the ACA made health insurance UNAFFORDABLE for my family after it was passed, with skyrocketing premiums higher than our house payment.”

Greene, an adherent to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement that has resulted in two presidencies for Donald Trump, said she was prepared to stand against her party on the issue. Republicans maintain that Democrats must allow the government to re-open before they will discuss healthcare concessions.

Greene made it a point to say that she has not changed her mind about opposing free healthcare to immigrants in the US without legal status – although, as Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said recently in an interview with ABC News, “federal law prohibits the use of Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance in any way, shape or form to undocumented immigrants”.

The one big beautiful act passed earlier during Trump's second presidency, meanwhile, ended the eligibility of many types of lawfully present immigrants to access federally funded health coverage for private health insurance.

“I'm not towing the party line on this, or playing loyalty games,” Greene said. “I'm a Republican and won't vote for illegals to have any tax payer funded healthcare or benefits. I'm AMERICA ONLY!!!”

Greene also criticized members of her party for failing to find a solution or prioritize that issue over funding for the Ukraine-Russia war as well as Israel's war in Gaza.

“All our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people!!!” she added. “It is absolutely shameful, disgusting, and traitorous, that our laws and policies screw the American people so much that the government is shut down right now fighting over basic issues like this.”

Greene's turn comes as Trump signaled a possible opening for a deal with Democrats, before appearing to walk it back.

“If we made the right deal, I'd make a deal – sure,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. But Trump later posted on social media that he is happy to work with Democrats on any issue “but first they must allow our government to re-open”.

            The newly-elected mayor of a town in western Germany is in critical condition after a stabbing attack outside her home, local media reported Tuesday.
    


            Iris Staltzer, a 57-year-old mother of two teenagers, was found with life-threatening injuries at around midday local time in the Ruhr city of Herdecke, and has been airlifted to hospital, police told CNN.
    


            Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his government had received news of the “heinous crime.”
    


            “We fear for the life of the mayor-elect, Iris Stalzer, and hope for her full recovery. My thoughts are with her family and loved ones,” Merz said on X.
    


            Stalzer, standing for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), was elected mayor of Herdecke in a runoff vote on September 28. She is due to take office in November.
    


            The city administration in Herdecke said it was in “shock and disbelief,” without providing further details of the attack, which was reported by German tabloid Bild and local public broadcaster WDR. Authorities have not confirmed a motive.
    


            In a later update, police said the investigation is “looking into all possibilities,” and that a family connection to the crime has not been ruled out.
    


            There has been a string of attacks on German politicians in recent years. The country was rocked by the 2019 murder of Walter Lübcke, a local government official who supported the pro-refugee policies of then-Chancellor Angela Merkel. Lübcke was shot dead by a neo-Nazi while smoking a cigarette on the terrace of his house. His attacker is now serving a life sentence.

The US has provided Israel with $21.7 billion in military assistance during the two years of the conflict in Gaza, a new report has said.

The paper by the Costs of War project at Brown University's Watson School of International and Public Affairs was released on Tuesday, the second anniversary of the October 7, 2023 incursion into Israel by Palestinian armed group Hamas, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage.

Israeli airstrikes and a ground offensive in Gaza, launched in response to the attack, have left more than 67,000 people dead and almost 170,000 injured, according to the Palestinian health authorities. Last month, a UN commission described West Jerusalem's actions as “genocide.”

Together with an additional $9.65 to $12.07 billion spent by the Pentagon on military operations in support of Israel in Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East, the overall US investment in the Gaza conflict amounts to between $31.35 and $33.77 billion, the report stated.

The figure, which was based on open source data, did not include tens of billions of dollars worth of arms to be paid for and delivered in the coming years in line with deals earlier agreed between Washington and West Jerusalem, it added.

The US weapons, including combat aircraft, helicopters, missiles and bombs, “have been central to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Police operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and beyond,” the report said.

With their use, Israel “inflicted a devastating humanitarian toll on the people of Gaza,” with more than 10% of the Palestinian enclave's population being killed or injured and at least 5.27 million displaced in Gaza and the wider region, it stressed.

Last week, US President Donald Trump, who has maintained the policy of arming Israel pursued by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, proposed a prisoner swap agreement between West Jerusalem and Hamas, which he claimed should pave the way for ending the conflict.

The militant group reacted to the offer by agreeing to release the remaining hostages, but has so far rejected the call to disarm. Despite halting its advance on Gaza City, the IDF has ignored Trump's demand to immediately end airstrikes across the Palestinian enclave.

BELGRADE, October 7. /TASS/. The European Union will side with US restrictive measures against NIS company and JANAF, the Adriatic oil pipeline operator, will halt feedstock supplies in the near time, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters.

"The Europeans will support US sanctions. I am absolutely confident that [the Croatian company] JANAF will stop oil supplies after some time," he said.

In early January 2025, the US Department of the Treasury introduced sanctions against Russian oil producer Gazprom Neft, its CEO Alexander Dyukov, and against Serbian NIS.

Main production facilities of NIS are in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. Majority shareholders are Gazprom Neft (44.85%) and Serbia (29.87%).

The JANAF oil pipeline links the terminal of the Croatian port of Omisalj with Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia. Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenkovic said earlier that 95% of oil consumed by Serbia are supplied over this pipeline. He also said that Zagreb expects changes in the NIS ownership structure to bring it out of US sanctions and continue cooperation with the JANAF.

MOSCOW, October 7. /TASS/. The importance of Russian President Vladimir Putin's role in the lives of Russians and the world as a whole is hard to overrate, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

"Today, as is known, is his birthday. And, of course, the entire staff of the presidential administration extends their greetings. It is hard to overrate Putin's role in the life of Russian citizens and the fate of the world," the spokesman said.

Vladimir Putin was born on October 7, 1952. Today, he celebrates his 73rd birthday. He usually spends this day working and holding talks with foreign leaders. Several major international summits have been held on this date over the years. In addition, the Russian president traditionally tries to spend time with his family and friends on his birthday.

European arms manufacturer Thales has developed and delivered anti-drone missiles equipped with airburst warheads to Ukraine, Business Insider reported on Oct. 6.

The weapon has a maximum range of 3,000 meters and is designed to counter Shahed-type attack drones that Russia has used extensively since late 2022 in large-scale strikes on Ukrainian cities. 

Thales' new FZ123 warhead is fitted on 70-millimeter missiles and packed with thousands of small steel pellets, which disperse over a 25-meter radius upon detonation of half a kilogram of explosive material. 

The resulting cloud of shrapnel can destroy or severely damage drones flying within range.

Thomas Colinet, Thales Belgium's domain director for vehicles and tactical systems, confirmed that Ukraine had already received shipments and expressed satisfaction with their performance.

"The good thing for us is, if they are asking for more, it means they are happy with it," he said.

Colinet did not specify how many warheads had been delivered, but Thales Belgium reportedly aims to produce around 3,500 missiles by the end of 2025 and expand its annual capacity to 10,000 by 2026.

Missiles equipped with FZ123 warheads are significantly cheaper than traditional anti-aircraft missiles used by Western militaries, though more expensive than interceptor drones. Even Thales' most advanced laser-guided mini-missiles cost no more than 20% of a conventional anti-air missile's price. 

For comparison, the cheapest AIM-7 Sparrow missiles, used by F-16 aircraft, cost about $125,000 each, while Shahed drones are estimated to cost between $500 and $5,000 per unit.

The warhead can also be mounted on unguided 70-millimeter missiles. Thales Belgium currently produces about 30,000 of these per year and could double output to 60,000 by adding a second shift.

The introduction of these systems occurs as Russia's use of Shahed-type drones in Ukraine increases. Anti-drone defenses have become a top priority for Ukraine's national security.

"Ukraine is already using interceptors to shoot down Shaheds and is expanding their production," President Volodymyr Zelensky's office wrote on June 21.

"From our point of view, the only people who should be ashamed and should remain silent on the issue of Nord Stream 2 are those who decided to build it," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.



The announcement comes, as Russia stepped up its campaign against Ukraine's energy infrastructure in recent days.

A train carrying military cargo derailed in Russia's Leningrad Oblast following an explosion early on Oct. 7, a source in Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) told the Kyiv Independent.



Latvia fully closed its airspace along the Russian and Belarusian borders between Sept. 11 and 18, following a series of regional security incidents. Since Sept. 18, restrictions have applied during nighttime hours.

 The Kyiv Independent's Chris York speaks with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof about Europe's security and dependence on U.S. support within NATO to deter Russian aggression.



After Russian state media put the blame for the attacks on Ukraine's Armed Forces, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Oct. 6 that it was "a deliberate provocation by Russia."

Russian authorities have accused Oleksiy Arestovych of terrorism and spreading "fake news about the Russian army." 



Majoti Sahil Mohamed Hussein, a 22-year-old student from the Indian city of Morbi, allegedly came to Russia to study at a university.

The call is the first publicly reported conversation between the presidents since March. Their relations had seemed to deteriorate since then, as Moscow and Baku clashed over several political and security issues.

The move enables the family of Quinn Schansman, an 18-year-old American passenger killed in the crash, to sue Sberbank under the U.S. anti-terrorism law.

The terminal can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

White House memo reported by several US media outlets reveals plan to not guarantee back pay for federal workers who are working through the shutdown

Government workers who have been furloughed since the government shutdown last week may not be entitled to back pay, according to a memo first obtained by Axios.

In a draft, seen by multiple outlets, office of management and budget (OMB) general counsel Mark Paoletta argues that an amendment to the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, which Trump signed during the last government shutdown, doesn't guarantee furloughed workers back pay if Congress hasn't set aside money to compensate them when the government reopens.

The president didn't promise that back pay was a guarantee while taking questions from reporters in the Oval Office today, simply saying that “it depends who we're talking about” when it comes to the White House's position on furloughed workers.

Meanwhile, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have been similarly evasive. Senate majority leader John Thune said today that “the sooner they vote to open up the government, the sooner this becomes a non issue”, while also saying he wasn't familiar on the exact language of the law. For his part, House speaker Mike Johnson said that there is “new legal analysis” that back pay might “not be appropriate or necessary”.

Democratic lawmakers have already hit back against the administration and their colleagues across the aisle. Senator Chris Van Hollen, of Maryland, whose state is home to several thousand federal workers, said any suggestion that paychecks will be withheld is “more fear mongering from a president who wants a blank check for lawlessness”. While congressman Jerry Nadler of New York posted a screenshot on X, and urged the Louisiana Republican to “look at his own website to brush up on what federal law says about federal employees and backpay”. Johnson voted for GEFTA in the last Trump administration, and his website says that “under federal law, employees are entitled to back pay upon the government reopening”.

A short while ago, the prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, left the White House, after his meeting with Donald Trump.

He didn't answer reporters' question about how the meeting went.

Soon, Trump is due to host Edan Alexander, the American-Israeli hostage who was released by Hamas earlier this year.

Texas national guard troops have arrived in the Chicago area, marking an escalation of Donald Trump's crackdown on the city.

Chicago has already seen a ramping up of immigration enforcement in the past few weeks, as well as increasingly violent altercations in the suburb of Broadview, where law enforcement has been filmed deploying teargas and pepper gas against protestors.

The latest military presence comes after April Perry, a US district judge, declined to immediately block troops from entering the city amid a pending lawsuit from the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago against the Trump administration's actions.

But after Perry's ruling, the troops were mobilized on Monday, and multiple outlets, including the Chicago Tribune and New York Times confirmed they were remaining in the Chicago area on Tuesday.

At a press conference on Capitol Hill today, John Thune, the top Senate Republican, said he had not seen the new “legal analysis” that suggests federal workers who have been furloughed due to the government shutdown might not be guaranteed back pay.

“My assumption is that furloughed workers will get back pay,” Thune said. “But the broader question here is, the answer to everything right now is open up the government.”

The Republican senator from South Dakota continued to blame lawmakers across the aisle for the shutdown, now on its seventh day:

This government has been shut down by Chuck Schumer and the senate Democrats and it can open up today, and then every of one of those questions becomes an irrelevant question, because we'll have a functioning government, and everybody will get paid as they should.

In a tense Senate judiciary committee hearing today, lasting more than four hours, attorney general Pam Bondi sparred with Democratic lawmakers as she faced pushback over the justice department's enforcement efforts in Democratic-led cities, her handling of the Epstein investigation, and Trump's weaponizing the Department of Justice (DoJ) to investigate and prosecute his political enemies.

Bondi claimed the department under Trump was “returning to our core mission of fighting real crime”, citing the surge in federal law enforcement activity in Washington DC and Memphis, Tennessee. She also claimed the DOJ was ending the “weaponization of justice”, even as several political adversaries of Trump face federal investigations and prosecutions.

The attorney general frequently parried questions from Democratic lawmakers about her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, a bribery probe into Trump border tsar Tom Homan and the case against former FBI director James Comey by criticizing her questioners in a bold display of partisan political theater – now almost customary when administration officials have testified before congress in recent months.

Throughout the oversight hearing, the attorney general was pressed on the DoJ's reversal on releasing files on sex trafficking investigations into Epstein, a one-time close friend of Trump, Bondi deflected by accusing Democratic senators of accepting campaign donations from an Epstein associate and played down her comments from earlier this year that the “client list” was “sitting” on her desk for review.

Republican lawmakers generally praised Bondi for her leadership. Texas senator Ted Cruz said the attorney general returned the justice department to “its core function”: “enforcing the law and locking up bad guys”. But colleagues across the aisle had a laundry list of concerns, and pushed Bondi on subjects where she proved evasive.

On the bribery allegations against border tsar Tom Homan, Bondi refused to answer questions from Democratic senators, instead saying that DoJ and FBI officials had found Homan did not commit a crime, and launched personal attacks as she fended off follow-ups. “If you worked for me, you would have been fired,” Bondi told the Democratic senator Adam Schiff. “Will you apologize to Donald Trump for trying to impeach him?”

Asked about the legal justification for Trump's moves to deploy national guard troops in US cities, Bondi blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown and said it was jeopardizing public safety. “I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” she told Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee.

Bondi also declined to answer questions about Trump's role in the case against Comey or the arguments by career prosecutors, saying she would not comment on private conversations with the White House or personnel matters. Asked about Trump's social post calling for Comey's prosecution, Bondi said: “I don't think he said anything that he hasn't said for years.”

Bondi's testimony followed months of tumult at the justice department as Trump administration officials challenge longstanding norms meant to insulate investigations from political influence and align the department closely with Trump's agenda. Durbin criticized Bondi for firing career prosecutors and agents who worked on investigations condemned by Trump and scaling back the department's efforts to combat corruption and white-collar crime. He said:

In eight short months, you have fundamentally transformed the justice department and left an enormous stain on American history. It will take decades to recover.

A short while ago, senator Adam Schiff said that the Department of Justice under Pam Bondi's leadership has become Donald Trump's “personal sword and shield to go after his ever growing list of political enemies and to protect himself his allies and associates”.

Schiff is a noted adversary of the president, who served on the House select committee which investigated the Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021.

Bondi snapped back at Schiff today, when she refused to answer questions about the allegations against Tom Homan, the border czar, for accepting $50,000 in bribes prior to Trump taking office: “Deputy attorney general Blanche and [FBI] director Patel said that there was no evidence that Tom Homan committed a crime, yet now you're putting his picture up to slander him.”

“If you worked for me, you would have been fired,” Bondi told the Democratic lawmaker from California. “Will you apologize to Donald Trump for trying to impeach him?”

Per my last post, it's worth noting that House speaker Mike Johnson added that he hasn't spoken to the White House yet, about the possibility of furloughed federal workers not receiving back pay.

Government workers who have been furloughed since the government shutdown last week may not be entitled to back pay, according to a memo first obtained by Axios.

In a draft, seen by multiple outlets, office of management and budget (OMB) general counsel Mark Paoletta argues that an amendment to the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, which Trump signed during the last government shutdown, doesn't guarantee furloughed workers back pay if Congress hasn't set aside money to compensate them when the government reopens.

While congressman Jerry Nadler of New York posted a screenshot on X, and urged the Louisiana Republican to “look at his own website to brush up on what federal law says about federal employees and backpay”. Johnson voted for GEFTA in the last Trump administration, and his website says that “under federal law, employees are entitled to back pay upon the government reopening”.

Trump says his administration plans to eliminate a number of government programs as a result of the ongoing shutdown, adding that he would provide details on job cuts within the next four or five days.

He says he has identified programs to shut down, and he'll be “announcing it pretty soon, but we have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate and permanently eliminate.”

He says the Democrats handed him the opportunity to do so “on a silver platter”.

“I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days, if this keeps going on,” he adds. “It'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back.”

Asked what his message was to Democrats ahead of another short-term spending bill vote, Trump accuses Democrats of a kamikaze attack.

This is like a kamikaze attack. Well, they're the ones that started it … and it's almost like a kamikaze attack by them. You want to know the truth, this is like a kamikaze attack … they have nothing to lose.

Asked by a reporter what guarantees he's giving that Israel won't resume its offensive once it gets the hostages back, Trump stresses that the US has “a lot of power” and says that once they have a deal, the US “is going to do everything possible to make sure everyone adheres to the deal”.

Trump says they could renegotiate the USMCA or they might not, but he wants the best deal for the US and also for Canada.

Trump says the fentanyl crisis is not over, adding that Canada has been doing “a much better job than in the past”.

Trump is again optimistic about the prospect of ending the war in Gaza. “We are very close to making a deal on the Middle East,” he says.

Trump says the US will have tariffs with Canada.

“We will treat Canada fairly,” he says.

Trump says he thinks Canada “will be very happy” with the deal they walk away with.

The US and Canada are “working very closely” on the Golden Dome missile defense system, Trump says.

Asked whether he plans to invoke the Insurrection Act, Trump declines to say whether or not he would but says that it has been invoked before.

“Well, it's been invoked before. As you know, if you look at Chicago, Chicago is a great city where there's a lot of crime, and if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job,” Trump says.

He told reporters yesterday he would consider utilizing the Insurrection Act, a law enacted more than two centuries ago, to sidestep any court rulings restricting his orders to send national guard troops into cities over the objections of local and state officials.

Attorney general Pamela Bondi defended the mass exodus of career officials from the justice department during her testimony on Tuesday.

“Many employees took the fork in the road. DOJ is hiring committed prosecutors who will actually come into the office and work -- and not work remotely,” she said.

While it is accurate that many career employees in the civil rights division did accept a deferred resignation offer, it was only after DOJ officials removed the leadership of their sections, dismissed ongoing cases, and moved attorneys into low-level offices where there wasn't much work to do. It was a clear effort to push people out the door. Justice department officials were so caught off guard by the number of people who chose to leave that they asked some employees to reconsider leaving.

On trade, Trump says the US has a “natural business conflict” with Canada, citing examples of cars and steel.

“We've made some compromise even on steel,” says Trump, repeating that he wants the US to make its own steel and its own cars while also wanting Canada to do well.

He says that in areas where the US and Canada compete, “we have to come to an agreement that works”.

Trump says they will be discussing tariffs.

Wall Street's record-breaking rally is running out of momentum on Tuesday after the price of gold topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time.

The S&P 500 dipped 0.4%, coming off its latest all-time high and heading for its first drop following a seven-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 159 points, or 0.3%, as of noon Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower.

The TSX followed along, and was down nearly 0.7%.

Markets are taking a pause following a rush higher for many investments on hopes that the economy will remain resilient and that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates.

Tesla was one of the heaviest weights on the market and sank 2.5%. That, though, gave back only a portion of its 5.4% leap from Monday, when speculation rose that the electric-vehicle maker may be set to unveil a new product.

Oracle also dragged the market lower. It fell 5.3% after a news report suggested it's making thin profit margins on a key line of business related to artificial-intelligence technology.

The frenzy around AI has been one of the biggest trends guiding Wall Street to record after record recently. It's been so strong that it's raised worries that prices have potentially shot too high across the market.

On Tuesday, IBM rose 2.3% after announcing a partnership that will integrate Anthropic's Claude AI chatbot into some of its software products. Advanced Micro Devices rallied another 4.4% to add to its surge from Monday, when it announced a deal where OpenAI will use its chips to power AI infrastructure. Dell jumped to an early gain of 6% after executives talked up the company's opportunity for growth because of AI at an investment conference, though it later swung to a modest loss.

Much is riding on expectations that the AI investment boom will pay off by making the global economy more productive and driving more growth. Without that increased efficiency, inflation could push higher due to upward pressure coming from the mountains of debt that the U.S. and other governments worldwide are building.

That has optimists on Wall Street buying tech stocks and pessimists buying gold, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie Group.

Investors have traditionally seen gold as offering protection from high inflation. Its price has soared more than 50% this year not only because of governments' huge debt loads but also because of political instability worldwide and expectations for lower interest rates from the Fed.

Investors looking to “hedge” themselves, meanwhile, may be buying both tech stocks and gold, Wizman wrote in a research report.

Elsewhere on Wall Street, Constellation Brands climbed 2.1% after the beer and wine company reported results for the latest quarter that several analysts said were better than they expected. Sales of beer still dropped from a year earlier, though, as CEO Bill Newlands highlighted a “challenging socioeconomic environment that has dampened consumer demand.”

Intercontinental Exchange, the company behind the New York Stock Exchange, added 1.3% after saying it had agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket.

Polymarket offers prediction markets that allow customers to profit from making predictions on events across politics, financial markets and popular culture, such as who will become New York City's next mayor or whether the U.S. government will announce this year that aliens exist.

In Toronto, shares of Trilogy Metals more than tripled after the White House said late Monday that it's taking a 10% equity stake in the Canadian company while allowing the Ambler Road mining project in Alaska to go forward.

President Donald Trump late Monday ordered the approval of a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals used in production of cars, electronics and other technologies. Trilogy is seeking to develop the Ambler site along with an Australian partner, and its stock soared 214%.

In Europe, France's CAC 40 edged up by less than 0.1% a day after slumping due to the latest political upheaval in Paris. France's prime minister abruptly resigned on Monday.

In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.12% from 4.18% late Monday.

PARIS (AP) — UNESCO is slated to have its first director from the Arab world after an Egyptian former tourism and antiquities minister, Khaled el-Anani, was nominated by the agency's executive board Monday.

If confirmed by UNESCO's general assembly next month, el-Anani will inherit an agency reeling from the Trump administration's recent decision to pull the United States out, portending a budget shortfall at the agency best known for its World Heritage sites around the globe.

El-Anani was seen as the front-runner for the position of director-general and won a vote Monday against his only challenger, Firmin Edouard Matoko, an economist from Republic of Congo who promoted schooling in refugee camps.

The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency's 194 member states, is expected to be finalized at a meeting of UNESCO's general assembly in Uzbekistan next month.

In addition to choosing and protecting World Heritage sites and traditions, the Paris-based U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization works to ensure education for girls, promotes Holocaust awareness and funds scientific research in developing countries, among other activities. Outgoing UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay notably led a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated under the Islamic State group.

UNESCO has also long been plagued by accusations of mismanagement and waste.

Trump argues that the agency, which voted in 2011 to admit Palestine as a member, is too politicized and anti-Israel. U.S. supporters of UNESCO, meanwhile, say withdrawing Washington's support allows China to play an outsized role in the world body.

Meanwhile, the vote comes at a time when the whole 80-year-old U.N. system is facing financial challenges and deepening divisions over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

El-Anani, 54, worked as a tour guide through ancient Egyptian sites, earned a doctorate in France and became a famed Egyptologist prior to serving in government. He served as minister of antiquities from 2016 to 2019, then led the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities for two years after the two portfolios were merged.

He is now a university professor, teaching Egyptology in a public university in Cairo.

Arab countries have long wanted to lead UNESCO. The African Union and Arab League are among those that expressed support for his bid.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi welcomed the news, calling the nomination a ‘'historic achievement that shall be added to Egypt's diplomatic and cultural record and to the achievements of the Arab and African peoples.”

During his tenure in government, el-Anani oversaw the start of mega-tourism projects including the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo, the Jewish Temple and multiple ancient discoveries that helped revive the country's battered tourism sector.

El-Anani is expected to focus on UNESCO's cultural programs, and has pledged to continue UNESCO's work to fight antisemitism and religious intolerance. Israel left UNESCO in 2018.

While he has no U.N. experience, his backers say that could help him make tough reform decisions. He has also said he would try to bring the U.S. back into the UNESCO fold.

Firmin Matoko, 69, spent most of his career working for UNESCO, including stints in Rwanda soon after the genocide, during peace negotiations in El Salvador and beyond.

He said he wants UNESCO to focus on technical solutions. He described helping train teachers at a refugee camp in Somalia in the 1990s, and meeting one of them years later after she became education minister.

Both candidates pledged to tap more private sector money to make up for the loss of U.S. and other funding, continuing efforts started under Azoulay.

Immunology is a field attracting global attention, spanning diverse areas from infectious disease treatments to vaccine development and cancer therapy. It is the specialty of Shimon Sakaguchi, 74, a specially appointed professor at the University of Osaka's Immunology Frontier Research Center who won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

The University of Osaka is one of the world's leading centers in the field of immunology. Behind this lies a long history dating back to Tekijuku, a private school of Western learning founded in the Edo period (1603-1867).

The late Edo-period physician Ogata Koan established Tekijuku and Joto-kan, a medical facility for preventing smallpox through vaccination, in Osaka. Vaccination marked the first step in immunology research in Japan.

Six years after Koan's death, in 1869, his second son established a temporary hospital with students, which became the precursor to the University of Osaka's Faculty of Medicine. In 1905, Japan's first specialized department for pulmonary tuberculosis was established within the department of internal medicine as a research hub for tuberculosis, which was ravaging Osaka Prefecture.

In 1962, Yuichi Yamamura, who would later lay the foundation for Japanese immunology research, took up the position of professor. Tuberculosis symptoms were thought at the time to be caused by bacteria eating away at lung tissue and creating cavities, but Yamamura confirmed through animal experiments that cavities formed even when bacteria were killed by heat, pinpointing the involvement of an immune response. Yamamura, who would eventually serve as the University of Osaka's president, strengthened research by appointing numerous outstanding young scholars from both inside and outside the university as professors.

Tadamitsu Kishimoto — one of Yamamura's students who later became president of the university himself — discovered the immune substance Interleukin (IL)-6 that plays a key role in the onset of rheumatoid arthritis. The finding led to groundbreaking therapeutic drug development. Kishimoto highly evaluated Sakaguchi's research and invited him from Kyoto University when he established the University of Osaka Immunology Frontier Research Center.

Sakaguchi's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine marks the first Nobel laureate from among University of Osaka faculty members currently on staff. He graduated from Kyoto University's Faculty of Medicine. He served as Director of the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences, now the Institute for Life and Medical Sciences, at his alma mater.

In 2007, the University of Osaka Immunology Frontier Research Center was selected for the World Premier International Research Center Initiative by the Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Ministry. Sakaguchi decided to move to the University of Osaka, saying, “What matters is how much I can contribute to human medical treatment.” He became a professor at the University of Osaka in 2011.

15:46 JST, October 7, 2025

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli authorities said Monday they deported to Greece and Slovakia another 171 people detained for taking part in a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, including prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.

Israel's foreign ministry posted on X that “the deportees were citizens of Greece, Italy, France, Ireland, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Denmark, Slovakia, Switzerland, Norway, the UK, Serbia, and the United States.” The post included photos of Thunberg and other activists wearing white T-shirts and gray sweatpants.

Thunberg was among dozens of deportees to land in Athens, Greece, on Monday afternoon. Crowds of supporters gathered at the Eleftherios Venizelos international airport and chanted “Free free Palestine!” as activists disembarked.

“That this mission has to exist, it's a shame! It is a shame!” Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly after arriving. “I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story,” she added.

Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens to end their “complicity” with the “genocide” being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza, on the eve of the second anniversary of the war there between Israel and Hamas.

“We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza,” Thunberg said.

The interception of the flotilla led to large-scale demonstrations in cities across the world.

Israeli authorities again rejected mistreatment accusations that have emerged in interviews with activists who were deported to Turkey, Spain and Italy over the weekend. Israel's government has also vehemently denied claims that its offensive in Gaza amounts to genocide, despite a growing number of experts denouncing it as such.

Lubna Tuma, a lawyer with the Adalah association representing more than 470 Global Sumud Flotilla participants who were detained last week as they attempted to break the Israeli siege of Gaza, said 150 people were still held in Israel's Ktziot prison, including Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela. Forty of them were on hunger strike, including many Tunisians.

“Some stated that they prefer that their food go to the people in Gaza,” Tuma said during a briefing on Monday that was broadcast on Adalah's and the flotilla's Instagram accounts. Others were also refusing to drink water “until medical treatment is given to all detainees,” she said.

The association's legal team said the remainder of the activists — including those from countries that don't maintain diplomatic relations with Israel — were expected to be deported on Tuesday.

Adalah lawyers have seen most, but not all, of the activists. Tuma said Israeli authorities have repeatedly violated activists' rights. Tuma said it started with their interception in international waters and continued with their transfer to Israel and detention in a maximum security prison, where Tuma said activists were subject to physical violence and humiliation.

Israeli authorities have strongly rejected the claims, reiterating that the detainees' rights had been respected throughout their detention. Israel's foreign ministry accused one activist of biting a female medical staff member.

Several activists have given testimonies alleging mistreatment by Israeli authorities.

“There was some dehumanizing and violence and shouting,” Roos Ykema, a Dutch member of the flotilla who was deported to Madrid on Sunday, told The Associated Press. “But we got the European treatment,” she added.

North African nationals who were detained told the AP they faced harsher treatment than their European counterparts.

“When I showed my Belgian passport their behavior towards me changed completely,” said Houssem Eddine Rmedi, a dual Tunisian-Belgian citizen.

Others said they weren't so lucky.

“The moment you show your Tunisian, Algerian or Moroccan passport, they start beating you,” said Moroccan activist Ayoub Habraoui, who added that he and others were kept kneeling under the sun for nearly six hours.

South Africa's government said Monday that its citizens would be released and repatriated on Tuesday via Jordan. Several other governments that had citizens taking part in the flotilla have said their embassies in Israel were working closely with Israeli authorities to make sure activists were released and sent home as swiftly as possible.

Major U.S. airports have reported experiencing flight delays amid the shutdown of the federal government.

Secretary of Transport Sean Duffy told reporters on Monday that air traffic control towers were experiencing staffing issues, with an increasing number of air traffic controllers calling in sick since the shutdown began.

 How to Craft Security Guarantees That Kyiv—and Moscow—Will Find Credible

 Samuel Charap and Jeremy Shapiro

In their discussions about ending the war in Ukraine, Americans and Europeans are increasingly focused on providing Kyiv with security guarantees. After over a decade of conflict with Russia, including four years of all-out war, Ukraine understandably does not trust Moscow to abide by any cease-fire. Before Kyiv signs one, it wants assurances from its key partners that if Russia attacks again, Ukraine will not be left to fend for itself.

To meet this demand, some allies have suggested giving Ukraine assurances modeled on NATO's Article 5, which declares that an attack on one NATO country is an attack on all. Others have recommended stationing European troops in the country as a way to give such assurances teeth. But these proposals lack credibility. NATO allies have steadfastly refused to intervene directly in the current war, so any promise they make to fight Russia in a new one is simply not believable. The Kremlin knows this better than anyone, and such bluffs will not deter it.

American and European leaders can provide Ukraine with a real postwar guarantee. But to do so, they will have to stick to promises that are credible. And that means committing to a more intense version of their current behavior in the event that Russia violates a cease-fire deal. In other words, should Moscow attack Ukraine again, the country's allies would reimpose sanctions on Russia, provide new financial support to Kyiv, and offer Ukraine military assistance that goes beyond what they would offer in peacetime. The United States and its allies would codify these pledges into law and create mechanisms that activate them if Russia attacks.

These guarantees, of course, fall short of an Article 5–like pledge. But if combined with peacetime measures that strengthen the Ukrainian military (which will remain Kyiv's primary source of deterrence), they will still affect the Kremlin's calculus. The United States and Europe, then, can help ensure that any renewed aggression is prohibitively costly for Russia, even without directly intervening.

NATO countries have made enormous efforts to help Kyiv resist Moscow's invasion since it began February 2022. Among many other steps, they have levied progressively harsher sanctions on Russia, supplied Ukraine with vital intelligence, and given it sophisticated weapons (including air defenses). But they have consistently declared that they are not willing to go to war with a nuclear power over Ukraine and have refused to send troops. They have also declined to offer Kyiv membership in NATO. And they will not let Ukraine use their weapons in ways that they believe might drag them directly into the fight.

New pledges by a few European countries to deploy troops to Ukraine after a cease-fire agreement might suggest that this approach is shifting. But any “reassurance forces,” as the continent's leaders call them, are unlikely to amount to much. Europe has refused to fight Moscow on Kyiv's behalf in this war, because it is not in the continent's core national security interests to do so. European publics also consistently oppose direct intervention. A deployment of forces after a cease-fire will not alter these realities. If France, the United Kingdom, or any other countries send troops and they come under Russian attack, they might well catch the next train out.

The United States and Europe are not prepared to fight on Ukraine's behalf. Yet they are clearly willing to slap sanctions on Russia and provide Kyiv with offensive arms, financial support, and intelligence. The bilateral security agreements signed in 2024 between Ukraine and its key international partners have already committed multiple NATO members (including Washington) to consistently supply such assistance, both during the war and after it ends. But Ukraine also needs a promise that its partners will dramatically surge support in the event of future Russian aggression, and a structured process to ensure they make good on that pledge. The country's guarantors must signal to Moscow that renewed aggression will be met not just with Ukrainian resistance but with a massive intensification of external support.



Sanctions are the most immediate instrument. As part of any negotiated settlement with Moscow, the United States and Europe will likely agree to relieve some of their economic restrictions. But if Moscow violates the deal, they must again kick Russian banks out of SWIFT (the Europe-based international banking transfer messaging system). They must also reimpose full export controls on dual-use and high-tech goods, renewed bans on its sovereign debt and energy investments, and strict price caps on its oil exports. Ukraine's allies could also pile on sanctions in escalating tiers should Russia continue its aggression. The first tier might freeze any Russian assets held abroad; the second could extend sanctions to shipping, insurance, and commodity trading; and another could impose secondary sanctions on entities in third countries, particularly those enabling Russia's war economy through oil and gas purchases (something that Washington and Europe have not been willing to do in the current war).

Sanctions alone, of course, cannot stop Russia's tanks. For that, Ukraine will need more weaponry. If Moscow agrees to a cease-fire, the United States and Europe would shift away from flooding Ukraine with offensive arms and provide it with weapons that enable a porcupine type of defense-oriented strategy that incorporates air defenses, antitank systems, and drones. If Russia violates the settlement, however, Kyiv's partners would quickly increase the flow of offensive assistance. They will need to pump the country full of longer-range missiles, such as army tactical missile system (ATACMS) from the United States and Storm Shadows from France and the United Kingdom. They will have to accelerate deliveries of combat aircraft, armor, long-range strike drones, and artillery. And they will need to remove current range restrictions and authorize Kyiv to use donated systems against military targets inside Russia, provided those targets are directly linked to the invasion. The sharing of intelligence for targeting Russian forces, suspended in peacetime, would resume.

The last instrument of a credible security guarantee is financial help. War, after all, is as much a test of economic stamina as it is of battlefield performance, and Ukraine will need monetary assistance to stay afloat while fighting. The G-7 states should thus set up a standing Ukraine stabilization fund that can surge aid to Kyiv. If Russia and Ukraine are at peace, the fund would pay for Ukraine's reconstruction and offer macroeconomic assistance. But if Russia resumes its attacks, the fund would disperse large-scale budgetary support and finance military production, allowing Ukraine to keep fighting as long as necessary.

After Russia's full-scale invasion, outside aid to Ukraine was discretionary and often delayed, subject to long political debates. To be effective, these security guarantees cannot be similarly unstable. Instead, they must be applied quickly and automatically. Ukraine's guarantors should therefore set up a clear framework, agreed-on triggers, and financial and legal mechanisms that ensure each state meets its commitments.

Ukraine's allies can accomplish this by codifying some of their commitments into law. Washington, for example, could pass legislation that triggers automatic sanctions against Russia and provides funds for Ukraine in case of renewed Russian aggression. The European Council should enact a similar mechanism. The EU usually requires unanimity to impose sanctions. But there are workarounds—namely, the body's qualified majority clauses—that EU member states can use to reimpose restrictions.

The process of triggering these guarantees should be fast and direct. If Kyiv charges Moscow with violating the cease-fire, the guarantors' foreign ministers should meet within 48 hours to examine Ukraine's claims and pore over intelligence from a variety of sources. Yet unless a majority of the guaranteeing states decide Ukraine is wrong, the snapback must take effect. This system may afford substantial power to Kyiv, but flipping the burden of proof is essential to deterring the Kremlin. Otherwise, Russia might salami-slice its way across the cease-fire line without triggering consequences.

To make sure that Ukraine quickly receives the military support it will need in the event of a renewed Russian assault, the United States and Europe should sign standing contracts with their defense industries to produce the long-range missiles, advanced aircraft, artillery systems, and other weapons necessary to support Kyiv. Ukraine's partners should also pre-position munitions in designated stockpiles in bordering states' territory. Likewise, NATO should make sure training centers in Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom always have room for Ukrainian troops, in case the war resumes and Kyiv needs to get its reserves into fighting shape.

Finally, the United States and Europe must review this system regularly. They should publish a joint report on the state of Ukraine's security, the health of the guarantees, and the readiness of snapback mechanisms once each year. Parliamentary committees in the U.S. Congress, the European Parliament, and various national European legislatures should hold hearings of their own, too. Doing so will help ensure that this system retains its democratic legitimacy—and thus its support.

A security guarantee based on snapback of sanctions, financing, and weapons may not have the grandeur of NATO's Article 5 or the bravado of deploying European forces to Ukraine. But for Kyiv, those are illusions, not real options. Ukrainians should not rely on the United States and Europe to do something in the future that they have repeatedly refused to do for the last ten-plus years.

These measures, by contrast, are credible precisely because NATO has already demonstrated its willingness to take them. They can, in other words, give Ukraine confidence that it will not be abandoned—without inspiring false hope. They can make clear to Russia that an attack will bring automatic punishment. And together with Ukraine's own formidable armed forces (and peacetime provisions of military aid), they can deter the Kremlin and ensure an enduring peace.

President Donald Trump has announced his intent to send National Guard troops to major cities across the United States in an effort to combat criminal activity.

In response, some government officials have alleged that he's exceeding his legal authority by disregarding certain limits Congress placed on his ability to federalize the National Guard.

When the leaders of Canada and the United States hold an in-person meeting, the reason for the get-together and its intended results are normally choreographed and telegraphed well in advance. 

There are no surprises, because the future has already been written. If there's anything to be announced – any actual news – it has already been agreed, down to the last comma and semi-colon.

A heads-of-government meeting is a scripted show. It's not an improv act. Normally.

And then there's Tuesday's sit-down between Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump. Because the host does not do normal, it's unclear what the outcome will be, or even why the PM is there.

The Carney government hasn't clearly signalled what it expects on Tuesday. It has also for weeks been lowering expectations for Canada-U.S. trade talks.

Carney has large and risky job ahead of him on Washington visit, former officials say

What if the PM's trip to the White House yields no change in the tariff status quo? That wouldn't be such a bad outcome. Things could always be worse.

If Ottawa hasn't foreshadowed what Tuesday's news will be, it may be because it has little to share. Months of radio silence on the progress of Canada-U.S. trade negotiations appear to be less about secrecy than faintness of signal.

“May every day be another wonderful secret” is the creepy birthday-card wish for Jeffrey Epstein allegedly penned by Mr. Trump, but politicians with even modestly good news don't normally keep it under wraps. If Ottawa had something positive to tell Canadians on trade, it would be sharing. And oversharing.

The government instead regularly points out that, while Mr. Trump has slapped tariffs on a long list of Canadian goods, the rest of the world is facing even higher and wider levies, making these new U.S. trade walls against Canadian exports the world's least onerous and least bad. 

It's starting to sound like the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, who after his arms are chopped off insists that “it's just a flesh wound.” 

Mr. Carney's oft-repeated pitch – that even now, 85 per cent of Canadian exports to the U.S. are tariff-free – can come across as protesting too much. It nevertheless has the virtue of truth. Canadian trade with the U.S. faces barriers not seen in decades, but this country still has, for now, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The rest of the world is in a worse position. And if the USMCA disappears, we might be, too.

Ford, Pennsylvania governor urge Trump to strike a trade deal in Carney meeting, not bully PM

That's why ragging the puck hasn't been a bad strategy for Canada. The European Union, Britain, Japan and South Korea all signed quick “deals” with the Trump administration – vague commitments that are not legally binding, in which they agreed to accept tariffs on most exports to the U.S., while promising not to retaliate with tariffs of their own. They also pledged, again vaguely, to invest huge sums of money in the U.S. – US$550-billion from Japan, US$600-billion from the EU, US$350-billion from South Korea – as a payoff for the right to continue selling to the Americans.

Should Canada agree to something like that? Not unless and until we have no other choice.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre never misses an opportunity to slam Mr. Carney for his failure to deliver a tariff-lowering trade accord, and fair enough. The job of the Leader of the Opposition is to criticize the government, not empathize with it. But Canada is facing an American leader who believes that free trade is nonsense, that tariffs strengthen his economy while filling his coffers, and that the U.S. can impose this new trade model on the world. And the rest of the world is mostly going along to get along. Canada has limited leverage, no matter who is PM. 

Mr. Trump and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick have said time and again that they don't understand why the U.S. is buying cars, steel or anything else from Canada. Last week, the administration announced new 25-per-cent duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture, with no USMCA exemption. On Monday, Mr. Trump abruptly announced a 25-per-cent tariff on medium and heavy trucks, to take effect on Nov. 1.

Unlike previous U.S. administrations, the Trump White House sees little benefit in lowering trade barriers, and much upside in raising them.

It may, however, be willing to adjust course in the face of pushback from American voters, consumers and industry, all of whom are paying the price for tariffs on Canadian lumber, steel and other products. Hitting Canada with tariffs is not free for Americans. That's Canada's strongest card, and it may yet yield wins.

We can hope for the Trump administration to change course, and there could even be some concessions on Tuesday. But it would be foolish to expect Mr. Trump to begin removing all of his tariffs on Canada. That would constitute a complete reversal of his trade policy.

In the long run, the best hope may be that Mr. Trump becomes so preoccupied with other issues – a war in Gaza that he dreams of parlaying into a Nobel Peace Prize; the continuing shutdown of the U.S. government; his bid to take over everything from the U.S. Federal Reserve to the nation's talk shows – that he mostly forgets about us.

The lawsuit was filed Monday, just as troops prepared to deploy and just hours after a federal judge blocked their deployment to Portland, Oregon.

Protesters confronted law enforcement officers near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, Oregon on Sunday night. Also late Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon at all.

ELWOOD, Ill. (AP) — National Guard members from Texas were at an Army training center in Illinois on Tuesday, the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration's plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders.

The Associated Press saw military personnel in uniforms with the Texas National Guard patch at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, 55 miles (88 kilometers) southwest of Chicago. On Monday, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn't specify where they were going.

There was no immediate comment from the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker. But the Democrat had predicted that Illinois National Guard troops would be activated, along with 400 from Texas.

Pritzker has accused Trump of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told reporters that the administration isn't sharing much information with the city.

“That is what is so difficult about this moment: You have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority,” Johnson said Tuesday.

A federal judge gave the Trump administration two days to respond to a lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago challenging the plan. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The lawsuit says, “these advances in President Trump's long-declared ‘War' on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.”

Trump's bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition has triggered a conflict with blue state governors. In Oregon, a judge over the weekend blocked the Guard's deployment to Portland.




The Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its crackdown on illegal immigration. Officials in Illinois and Oregon, however, say military intervention isn't needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.

Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I'd do that,” Trump said Monday. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” 

The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks has amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

The Chicago mayor signed an executive order Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations. 

Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois is also suing the federal government, accusing it of unleashing a campaign of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in suburban Broadview.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that the First Amendment doesn't protect “rioting.”

In Oregon, the Portland ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when local police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then. In recent weeks, the protests typically drew a couple dozen people — until the deployment was announced. Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility, and federal agents fired tear gas. 

Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years. In Portland, homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared with the same period in 2024, data shows. In Chicago, homicides were down 31% to 278 through August, police data shows.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.

The Republican justices seem eager to kill state bans on anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court broke from its increasingly common practice of deciding important cases without holding an oral argument or even explaining the reasoning of its decision, to hear a case about whether states may ban a practice known as “conversion therapy” — therapy sessions which seek to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity.

About half of the states have laws banning conversion therapy for patients under the age of 18, including Colorado, whose law was before the Court on Tuesday.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Realistically, there was never any chance that this Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 Republican supermajority, would uphold the Colorado law at issue in Chiles v. Salazar. When this Court hears cases that place the interests of queer Americans against the claimed rights of religious conservatives, it consistently rules in favor of the religious right.

That said, two uncertain questions did emerge from the Chiles argument. One is whether the Supreme Court will immediately strike down Colorado's ban on conversion therapy, or whether it will send the case back down to lower courts to apply a test known as “strict scrutiny,” which nearly all laws fail.

The more important question is to what extent the Court will strip state governments of their longstanding power to regulate health care and other professionals, at least when those professionals give dangerous advice to their patients and clients.

The Chiles case turns on two competing theories of the First Amendment. The plaintiff in the case is a therapist represented by a prominent anti-LGBTQ law firm known as the Alliance Defending Freedom. Her lawyer, James Campbell, said at oral argument that she wants to have “full conversations exploring issues of identity and gender,” and that “includes considering chang[ing]” a patient's identity.

He also makes a fairly intuitive argument: Talk therapists talk to their clients. Talking is protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, Colorado cannot prevent her from providing conversion therapy.

Colorado, meanwhile, points to the long history of states regulating the advice that licensed professionals give to their clients. A lawyer cannot tell a client that it is legal to rob banks, for example, even though this bad legal advice is just speech. Similarly, a doctor risks a malpractice suit or professional sanctions if they advise a patient to engage in unhealthy conduct.

Thus, in its brief to the justices, Colorado proposes a legal standard similar to the one used in many professional malpractice cases: The First Amendment permits states to regulate speech between a licensed professional and their client to ensure that the professional's behavior aligns with the accepted standard of care within the profession.

Under that rule, Colorado's ban on conversion therapy is lawful because, as one federal appeals court explained, “every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy.”

None of the six Republican justices appeared to buy the state's argument, however. At least two of them seemed to doubt whether medical expertise is actually something that can be relied upon at all.

In one of the most dramatic moments in the Chiles argument, Justice Samuel Alito compared Colorado's ban on conversion therapy to an infamous Virginia law calling for “feeble minded” individuals to be sterilized. He pressed Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Wells Stevenson on whether the consensus within the medical profession is sometimes “politicized.” And he even quoted his Court's statement in Buck v. Bell (1927) that forced sterilization laws are acceptable because “three generations of imbeciles are enough.”

Just in case there is any doubt, this comparison is facile. Buck involved a woman who was confined in a state-run “Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded” and who was sterilized by order of the government. A law instructing a state to physically mutilate a person that it has incarcerated is a far cry from a law that attempts to ban a practice that mental health professionals widely view as harmful — even though it is true that eugenics was broadly supported by the scientific community in the 1920s.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, however, did raise a more sophisticated version of the “can we really trust health care professionals?” question. As he noted, back in the 1970s “homosexuality” was considered a disorder by the mental health profession. So, under Colorado's proposed rule, which permits states to ban treatments that do not align with the standard of care within a profession, couldn't states have banned therapists from affirming their gay patients' sexual orientations in the 1970s?

Stevenson conceded that they could have back then. And she was right to do so. One uncomfortable consequence of relying on experts is that sometimes experts are wrong. And if you root the law in the consensus among experts, the law will sometimes do harmful things if that consensus is erroneous.

But what is the alternative? Relying on people who don't know what they are talking about?

As even some of the Republican justices conceded, state malpractice laws have long punished licensed professionals who do not meet the standard of care within their profession. And this rule in malpractice cases is widespread for a very good reason. Even if experts aren't right 100 percent of the time, they are correct far more often than they are wrong. And they are far more likely to be correct than lay people.

Significantly, the mental health profession abandoned its erroneous view of homosexuality decades ago.

Unlike Alito and Gorsuch, Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed to accept that malpractice laws are valid during some of her questioning. And even Gorsuch seemed to concede that licensed professionals should be subject to a lawsuit if they offer disastrous advice to a client.

But Gorsuch also tried to distinguish malpractice suits from the Colorado law at issue here by labeling the Colorado law a “prior restraint,” a term that refers to laws that attempt to ban speech before it is uttered. Malpractice suits, by contrast, typically arise after a doctor, lawyer, therapist, or other professional gives substandard advice to a patient or client.

Thus, the Court could potentially decide Chiles relatively narrowly by striking down affirmative bans on conversion therapy, while still allowing patients who are harmed by this discredited treatment to sue their therapists.

For what it is worth, Stevenson argued that it's not clear that Colorado's law actually functions as a prior restraint. The law is only triggered if a patient files a complaint with the state's licensure board, and the board can sanction a therapist much like a judge in a malpractice suit may order a bad therapist to compensate their client. Both of these procedures occur after the substandard care has been provided.

So, even if the Court accepts the distinction between malpractice suits and more precisely drawn bans on professional misconduct like Colorado's, it may find it difficult to police this line in future cases.

One other question that came up is whether the lower courts should be given another chance to look at this law before it is struck down. Ordinarily, when the Supreme Court announces a new legal rule in a case, it “remands” the case to a lower court to determine how to apply the rule to that case. And, in this case, a majority of the justices appeared ready to impose a new rule: Bans on conversion therapy must overcome strict scrutiny.

For a law to survive strict scrutiny, the government must show that it is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” interest. Stevenson argues that, had Colorado known it had to overcome this very difficult test to defend its law, it would have introduced more empirical studies into the record demonstrating why the law is justified. And she said the state should be given a chance to provide that evidence to a lower court before the law is struck down.

But, of the Court's six Republicans, only Barrett appeared open to this argument — though Justice Brett Kavanaugh was silent during the argument. So it's far from clear that there are five votes who would support remanding the case to a lower court. (Notably, Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, asked some questions at the end suggesting that she may be willing to join the Republicans in applying strict scrutiny if they agree to a remand).

This Supreme Court is often sloppy when it hands down decisions that pit the religious right against LGBTQ Americans. So there is a serious risk the justices will hand down a decision that sweeps far beyond conversion therapy. If they interpret the First Amendment to bar any specific restrictions on what professionals can tell their clients, then states could lose the power to prevent doctors from giving dangerous advice to their patients.

Bans on conversion therapy were almost certainly doomed the moment this Supreme Court took an interest in this case. But now, the most important question is whether the Court will concede that medical expertise has some role to play in regulating speech between health providers and patients.

Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on Tuesday.

Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on Tuesday.

The exchange came during Bondi's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with Durbin pressing Bondi to justify the deployment. Bondi refused to detail her communications with the White House regarding the move, but she said the troops are there to protect the residents of Chicago.

"Why do you want to keep this secret?" Durbin asked. "The American people don't know the rationale behind the deployment of National Guard troops in my state. The word is, and I think it's been confirmed by the White House, they are going to transfer Texas National Guard units to the state of Illinois. What's the rationale for that?"

"As you shut down the government — you voted to shut down the government, and you're sitting here — our law enforcement officers aren't being paid. They're out there working to protect you. I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump. And currently, the National Guard are on the way to Chicago. If you're not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will," Bondi responded.

The pair continued to argue as Durbin claimed Trump's budget plan cut funding for certain law enforcement programs in Illinois. Bondi said she would "work with" his office if he named the specific programs.

"Tell me a specific grant that I turned off in Illinois that would help law enforcement, and I will work with you, but you have not done that," Bondi said.

"The National Guard is on the way. Right now, as we speak, so is [FBI Director Kash] Patel and deputy director Todd Blanche. You're sitting here grilling me, and they're on their way to Chicago," she added.

Durbin responded, "It is my job to grill you."

FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed in an X post that he was Chicago bound on Tuesday morning. 

"Chicago will be saved, and this FBI will continue to crush violent crime there, and all around the country. Heading to the Windy City now," Patel wrote.

The exchange between Bondi and Durbin comes just days after Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sued to block Trump from deploying troops to Chicago.

The Democratic governors of California and Illinois are threatening to leave the National Governors Association because of its silence on President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops across state lines despite objections from the receiving states' leaders.

“If we cannot come together, on a bipartisan basis, on this basic principle of state sovereignty, what purpose does the National Governors Association serve?” California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked in a letter to the nation's other governors.

The bipartisan governors' group, founded in 1908, advocates for issues on which governors find common ground and hosts meetings where they can exchange ideas. Separate Democratic and Republican governors' associations take more partisan positions and help finance campaigns. 

Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, contend Trump's troop deployments should be a matter of concern for all governors. But some Republican governors have supported Trump's actions, and the national governors' group has not taken a position. 

“I'm not sure the policy issue of whether the Constitution allows for federal involvement in the state and the National Guard is something that the NGA would want to tackle,” said Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, who co-chairs the organization's task force on emergency management and public health. 

The Democratic governors of Kansas, Michigan and Minnesota already have left the NGA this year. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly said she didn't think the roughly $100,000 annual dues paid by the state were a good investment and encouraged the group to push back against canceled federal grants.




The bipartisan governors' organization is far from the first institution to face division and doubts over how it should respond to sweeping changes in Trump's second term. Since returning to office, Trump has been using executive power in ways that presidents usually don't.

This week, he has attempted to deploy Texas National Guard members to Chicago and California Guard members to Portland, Oregon, to protect federal immigration facilities and personnel amid what Trump describes as out-of-control crime. Democratic officials in those states have sued over the efforts, as has California. So far, judges have blocked the deployment in Oregon but haven't stopped it in Illinois.

Newsom and Pritzker have argued the National Guard deployments are not just a policy difference but an infringement on state sovereignty that must be condemned.

“The credibility of the National Governors Association — and our integrity as state executives — rests on our willingness to apply our principles consistently, regardless of which administration attacks them,” Pritzker said in a letter Monday to Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, the chair of the National Governors Association.

Stitt did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. But he said in a news conference last month that the group should steer clear of areas where there's not a consensus and leave those to the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association.

Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who authorized the call-up of 400 Texas National Guard members, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. On Monday, he posted a cartoon on his X account showing the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York telling Trump, “LEAVE OUR CRIME ALONE.”

The National Governors Association bills itself as a beacon of bipartisanship, which means it stays out of a lot of the thorniest battles. Some topics where governors have found common ground include disaster preparedness, workforce development and expanding broadband access.

Last week, Stitt and NGA vice chair Wes Moore, the Democratic governor of Maryland and a possible 2028 presidential candidate, condemned the then-looming federal government shutdown, calling for dialogue but not a specific policy solution: “We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.”

But no unity has emerged on Trump's immigration and crime-fighting policies.

Kehoe said no one has asked him to sign onto a statement denouncing Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to states against a governor's will. Earlier this year, Kehoe successfully pushed for a state makeover of the St. Louis Police Department oversight board despite the objections of the Democratic mayor, citing crime as justification. 

“Certainly Chicago could use some help,” Kehoe said. “I would hope that Governor Pritzker would welcome help to keep his citizens safe.”

San Francisco political commentator Richie Greenberg discusses the crime statistics in the city, Gov. Gavin Newsom action's on crime and San Francisco Police Department's guidelines for I.C.E . arrests on 'Fox Report.'

A career criminal is asking to swap prison time for a drug-treatment program nearly five years after his New Year's Eve rampage in downtown San Francisco allegedly killed two pedestrians – reigniting fierce debate over California's woke criminal justice practices.

On Friday, Troy McAlister's attorney, Scott Grant, asked the court to grant mental-health and substance-abuse diversion under California Penal Code §1001.36, which could allow McAlister to enter treatment instead of facing decades in prison if Judge Michael Begert rules that he qualifies.

In deep-blue San Francisco, residents rallied to protest what they say would undermine accountability.

"91 felonies, 2 deaths, No more chances," signs read outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice. "Judge Begert chooses politics over public safety. Justice NOW."

The case of McAlister, 50, has long been a lightning rod of restorative justice reform, forcing elected officials to confront whether policies meant to show compassion to offenders put the public at risk.

PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED BLUE STATE DRIVER CHARGED WITH MURDERING SIX PEOPLE IN CRASH: REPORT

The motion has sparked protests outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice, with community members and victims' families calling the diversion request an "insult to justice." Some have even threatened to recall Begert if diversion is granted.

"Troy McAlister has been charged with 91 felonies over the course of his multi-decades career here in San Francisco, and we don't think that someone should be given infinite chances to ultimately correct course," Scotty Jacobs, director of Blueprint for a Better San Francisco, told KTVU-TV. 

"While there's certain people who should be granted diversion and ultimately given the opportunity to rebuild their lives, Troy McAlister has demonstrated that despite being given that opportunity multiple times, he has continued to pose a threat to San Franciscans, and we believe he needs to be in jail."

McAlister was on parole on Dec. 31, 2020, when he allegedly drove a stolen car while intoxicated, ran a red light, and killed Hanako Abe, 27, and Elizabeth Platt, 60. 

BLUE CITY FELON WITH VIOLENT HISTORY ARRESTED IN DEADLY TRAIN PLATFORM STABBING AFTER PAROLE RELEASE: REPORT

McAlister's long rap sheet has become a symbol of the larger question facing San Francisco – whether repeat offenders should get one more chance at rehabilitation or finally face life in prison.

Police said 27-year-old Abe and 60-year-old Platt were killed when McAlister blew through a red light at an intersection driving a stolen car in a "methamphetamine-fueled rampage" after allegedly stealing a cash register and a laptop from a sandwich shop nearby. Police said he got out of the car after the crash and ran into a nearby building, where he was arrested within minutes. 

McAlister is facing a slew of charges, including manslaughter in connection to the crash.

Following the incident, the senseless deaths caused outrage after critics argued he should have been behind bars given his lengthy criminal record. 

McAlister previously served five years in county jail for robbing a market with an airsoft gun. His subsequent arrests while out of parole came for allegedly stealing cars near the Balboa BART Station, bashing down a door of a vacant apartment building claiming the owner gave him permission to use drugs there, and for jumping into a car and grabbing at the driver's pockets until the driver exited the vehicle. 

The district attorney's office never formally filed charges in connection to those offenses.

The tragedy fueled the 2022 recall of District Attorney Chesa Boudin, as critics accused him of being too lenient with repeat offenders. Following the hit-and-run incident of 2020, Boudin said that "hindsight is 20/20."

"I've said from the beginning that hindsight is 20/20," Boudin said after the incident in December 2020. "Every single law enforcement agency that has had contact with Mr. McAlister wishes they had done something different that might have prevented this tragedy, and that certainly includes my office and my staff."

Under current DA Brooke Jenkins, prosecutors are fighting the diversion motion. California Penal Code §1001.36, which was enacted in 2018, allows certain criminals with a diagnosed mental health or substance-use disorder to enter court-supervised treatment instead of facing trial. If the judge finds the disorder contributed to the crime and the defendant doesn't pose a serious public-safety risk, the case can be diverted for up to two years while the person completes treatment. Successful completion can lead to dismissed charges, while failure returns the case to court.

The judge has not yet ruled on whether McAlister is eligible for court-supervised treatment. Fox News Digital has reached out to Boudin, the San Francisco County Superior Court and Grant for comment.

McAlister's case is part of a troubling trend of repeat offenders being released back onto the streets. 

Courtney Boose, 41, is accused of stabbing a 69-year-old man at a Lawrence gas station, and it's far from his first run-in with police. According to Fox 59, records show he's been arrested 99 times over the years for charges ranging from theft to battery, yet he's never served prison time. His latest arrest has sparked outrage among Indianapolis leaders who say his case exposes deep flaws in the criminal justice system's handling of repeat offenders.

            • Attorney General Pam Bondi is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning.
    


            • Bondi has deflected questions from Democrats on a variety of issues. “Senator, I am not going to discuss that with you,” she said to a question about internal DOJ discussions on prosecuting a Trump political opponent. She has also stonewalled Democrats about her handling of the Epstein files and existence of a so-called “client list.”
    


            • The hearing comes after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey by a federal grand jury, an extraordinary escalation in President Donald Trump's effort to prosecute his political enemies.
    


            • She is also being pressed about the legal basis for drone strikes on suspected drug cartels and the Trump administration's push to use the military in US cities.
    


            The White House is pleased so far with Pam Bondi's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, two officials said.
    


            “She's doing great,” one White House official told CNN. “Not only is the AG debunking every single bogus Democrat talking point, but she's highlighting the Democrats' own hypocrisy and they have no response.”
    


            The official specifically pointed out Bondi's exchange with Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, when the AG was asked whether she approved closing an investigation into border czar Tom Homan allegedly accepting a bag of cash from undercover FBI agents.
    


            “The Department of Justice and FBI conducted a thorough review, and they found no evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said. “You are also on video outside the White House protesting with a group called CASA, where Antifa members were. Does that mean you are a member of Antifa?”
    


            Another White House official said the attorney general is “giving a masterclass on how to effectively push back on deranged Democrat lies.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi has repeatedly stonewalled questions from Senate Judiciary Democrats about the many controversies of the second Trump administration and her tenure.
    


            Here are some of the topics she's avoided:
    


Comey indictment and DOJ firings: Bondi repeatedly told senators she wouldn't discuss her conversations with Trump regarding James Comey's recent indictment and refused to answer questions regarding DOJ attorneys who were fired following their work on January 6 cases or for refusing certain prosecutions of anti-Trump figures.
    


Acting at the behest of Trump: In response to questions about whether she considered a social media post from Trump a directive to prosecute several perceived enemies of the president, Bondi replied simply: “Trump is the most transparent president in American history, and I don't think he said anything that he hasn't said for years.”
    


The National Guard: Bondi refused to say whether she had discussed deploying the National Guard with the White House. Because of executive privilege, cabinet officials largely decline to share their conversations with the president without authorization.
    


Jeffrey Epstein: The attorney general repeatedly dodged questions about the so-called “Epstein Files” and Trump's reported friendship with the disgraced financier, often putting the spotlight back on Democrats to explain their own relationships with associates of Epstein.
    


Tom Homan investigation: Bondi stonewalled questions for details about the reports that her department closed an investigation into border czar Tom Homan after he allegedly accepted a bag of cash from undercover FBI agents, testifying that investigators “found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing” and warning Democrats to “look at your facts.”
    


US military strikes on boats in the Caribbean: Democratic Sen. Chris Coons asked Bondi about decision making behind US military strikes on boats traveling off the coast of Venezuela, which the administration has said were “affiliated” with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations. Coons asked how Bondi concluded the strikes were legal. “I'm not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may, or may not, have given or issued at the direction of the President on this matter,” Bondi said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying her deflections and challenging responses possibly represent a “new low” for her position.
    


            “Her apparent strategy is to attack and conceal. Frankly, I've been through close to 15 of these Attorney General accountability hearings, and I have never seen anything close to it in terms of the combativeness, the evasiveness and sometimes deceptiveness,” Blumenthal told reporters outside the hearing. “I think it is possibly a new low for attorneys general testifying before the United States Congress, and I just hope my Republican colleagues will demand more accountability than what we have seen so far.”
    


            “I believe we need legislative reform. We agree on both sides of the aisle that weaponizing justice to target political adversaries, or opponents, or people disliked by the president ought to stop,” he added. “And that's why I've introduced legislation that would provide rights to people who are victims of it. It would provide safeguards against it, and reform of grand juries to make them more transparent and accountable.”
    


            “We need to come together and stop this kind of absolutely venomous, vile attacks on people who legitimately question whether the Department of Justice has been used for political or personal ends,” he said.
    


            Democratic Sen. Chris Coons echoed the sentiment about Bondi's testimony.
    


            “She was fully prepared for, with specific and personal comebacks, accusing various of my colleagues, of challenging their integrity or challenging their basis for their questions in a way I've not ever seen,” said Coons.
    


            During Tuesday's hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for handing down an eight-year sentence to the person who plotted to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following the leaked opinion that later overturned Roe v. Wade.
    


            “My prosecutors did an incredible job on that case,” Bondi said, while noting that the Justice Department had announced they would appeal the sentence, which fell 22 years below the federal guidelines and the minimum sentence prosecutors sought.
    


            Bondi and Republicans have highlighted that the individual, Sophie Roske, is a transgender woman and have argued that the judge unfairly considered this fact when determining her sentence.
    


            “The judge also would not refer to the defendant by his biological name,” Bondi said, adding that the judge voiced concern about Roske's access to gender affirming care.
    


            Roske, who called the police on herself down the street from Kavanaugh's home in Maryland one summer night in 2022, had brought with her a loaded firearm, knife, pepper spray and burglary tools – telling law enforcement she intended to kill the Justice and then herself.
    


            The judge credited Roske for turning herself in and voiced concern that given recent executive orders from President Donald Trump on the treatment of transgender people in custody, prison would be additionally punitive for Roske.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi would not discuss specifics of the Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey last month, but she did defend the effort by arguing the indictment was handed up by a liberal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia.
    


            Asked by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, whether career prosecutors found insufficient evidence to indict Comey, Bondi responded: “I am not going to discuss pending cases because Comey was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia by, I may point out, is one of the most liberal grand juries in the country.”
    


            Comey was charged over allegations he lied to Congress in 2020 testimony about authorizing leaks while he was FBI director.
    


            He was charged by US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan – a Trump loyalist who was appointed after the prior US attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure for not bringing charges against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            Klobuchar asked Bondi about the removal of Siebert – who resigned after President Donald Trump said he wanted Siebert out – but the attorney general would not discuss the matter.
    


            “I'm not going to discuss personnel decisions,” Bondi said.
    


            Bondi was asked about a social media post from President Donald Trump in September, addressed directly to the attorney general, where Trump asked directly why several Democrats and a former federal official had not been prosecuted by the Justice Department.
    


            “They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote. “We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Bondi whether she considered the post “a directive to the Justice Department” to prosecute those individuals, including Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
    


            “President Trump is the most transparent president in American history, and I don't think he said anything that he hasn't said for years,” Bondi said.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi came prepared for challenges from Senate democrats, using quick one-liners and prepared arguments to dodge questions on the Epstein investigation, national guard deployments, and accusations that she has used the Justice Department for political purposes.
    


            The attorney general fended off questions about her firing of senior prosecutors for what Democrats allege were political reasons, saying “the personnel issue that I'm having right now is that all of my agents, all of my lawyers, are…working without a paycheck because your party voted to shut down the federal government.”
    


            As Democratic senators pushed her on President Donald Trump's connections to accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, the attorney general repeatedly claimed that those same Democrats had connections to another alleged associate of Epstein's, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.
    


            She also questioned why Democrats hadn't raised concerns about the Epstein investigation before her term, at one point challenging senators with “did you ask Merrick Garland any of this over the last four years when he sat before you?”
    


            And when Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin pushed Bondi on the legal rationale for sending National Guard troops to Durbin's state against the governor's wishes, the attorney general shot back: “I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump.”
    


            In one exchange during which Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse accused Emil Bove of prosecutorial misconduct during his brief stint as principal associate deputy attorney general, Bondi interrupted Whitehouse to say that his “time has expired.”
    


            After the shocked Democrat regained his time and said the attorney general could answer the question, Bondi was ready: “To correct you for one moment, that would be the Honorable Judge Emil J Bove III to you.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi skirted specific questions about reports that White House border czar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 before the 2024 election over promises of government contracts, stating simply that the investigation was closed.
    


            Bondi repeated her statement that “the investigation of Mr. Homan was subjected to a full review by the FBI agents and DOJ prosecutors.”
    


            Homan has said he has done “nothing criminal” and “nothing illegal.”
    


            “They found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, continued to ask what, exactly, happened to the $50,000 Homan reportedly received.



            “You're welcome to talk to the FBI,” Bondi said.
    


            Bondi turned the repeated questions back on Whitehouse — a tactic she has used throughout the hearing — accusing the senator of working “with dark money groups all the time.”
    


            “The questions here are actually pretty specific,” Whitehouse said. “So having you respond with completely irrelevant far-right internet talking points really is not very helpful here.”
    


            When pushed on the Justice Department's bungled release of records related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Attorney General Pam Bondi quickly tried to  shift the focus to Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin.
    


            “You know Senator Durbin, I find it very interesting that you refused repeated Republican requests to release the Epstein flight logs in 2023 and 2024,” Bondi shot back. “Why did you fight to not disclose the flight logs, Senator Durbin?”
    


            Durbin asked why Bondi had claimed on Fox News in February that the infamous “client list” from Epstein was sitting on her desk to be reviewed but never released such a list.
    


            “Senator Durbin, if you listen to my entire clip on that, I said I had not reviewed it yet, but it was sitting on my desk,” Bondi said, “and I said I had not yet reviewed it.”
    


            “Our memo on Epstein clearly points out that there was no client list,” she added.
    


            Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed over questions about the legal rationale for the Trump administration to send National Guard troops to Durbin's state against the governor's wishes.
    


            Durbin pressed Bondi on her conversations with the White House about consultations before the Guard deployment was approved. Bondi responded she would not disclose conversations with the White House.
    


            “What's the secret? Why do you want to keep this secret?” asked Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The American people don't know the rationale behind the deployment of National Guard troops in my state.”
    


                    “I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump,” Bondi told Durbin.
                





            “Currently the National Guard are on the way to Chicago. If you're not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will,” she added.
    


            Durbin responded that he had asked a “simple question” on the legal rationale for deploying the National Guard and it became “grounds for a personal attack.”
    


            Bondi said later during Durbin's questioning that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and FBI Director Kash Patel were “on the way to Chicago,” too.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi addressed allegations from Republican senators that the Biden administration improperly spied on them, calling it a “betrayal of public trust.”
    


            Senate Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, said Monday that the FBI, as part of special counsel Jack Smith's January 6 investigation, used court orders in 2023 to obtain the phone records of nine GOP lawmakers.
    


            That phone records of some lawmakers were seized in the probe was made public in court documents as Smith's investigation was ongoing, and there is no indication that the Republican senators were targets of the probe.
    


            Still, Bondi accused the FBI of “secretly investigating” Republicans to “take President Trump off the playing field.”
    


            “They were playing politics with law enforcement powers and will go down as a historic betrayal of public trust,” she said. “This is the kind of conduct that shatters the American people's faith in our law enforcement system.”
    


            During his opening statement Tuesday, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi on what he called the unlawful deployment of National Guard members in cities across the US, including most recently Chicago.
    


            “Attorney General, you're focusing on helping President Trump play strongman on television,” Durbin said. “He has illegally deployed troops to Chicago and other American cities and has threatened to send more.”
    


            Durbin highlighted comments from Trump who said such deployments would be the “training grounds for our military” to ‘fight the enemy within.”
    


            “Chicago is not the enemy. Our fellow Americans are not the enemy,” the senator said.
    


            Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley opened the hearing Tuesday by rehashing a series of grievances against the Biden administration and former Justice Department officials.
    


            Grassley, an Iowa Republican, recounted years-old allegations that the FBI improperly investigated whether the Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.
    


            “To our average constituent this is all history,” Grassley said.
    


            He continued, “We're pointing this all out because we can't have this repeated in the United States. … It's time for accountability.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to testify Tuesday on a Justice Department faced with increasing accusations of chaos and politicization.
    


            Bondi is likely to face tough questioning from Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee who have accused the attorney general of using the weight of the department to go after President Donald Trump's perceived enemies.
    


            That accusation came to a head in late September, when the DOJ secured an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime adversary of the president.
    


            But the Comey indictment was only the latest in a series of moves that critics say are political in nature — including an investigation into whether Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee, committed mortgage fraud.
    


            The agency's handling of the so-called “Epstein files” has also caused concerns among some Republican allies of the administration. Lawmakers are still pushing for unreacted documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


            Justice Department officials are participating in long-running efforts by the Trump administration to crackdown on cities it says has high rates of crime.
    


            The efforts are controversial, as many of the cities are run by Democratic elected officials who are opposed to the surge in federal resources from the FBI, the US Marshals, and agents from other law enforcement branches of the DOJ.
    


            Efforts are currently underway in Washington, DC, Chicago, Memphis and Portland. And a similar crackdown took place in Los Angeles over the summer.
    


            Bondi and other top DOJ officials have reported an increased number of arrests in the cities, and say that officials are seizing a large amount of illegal firearms.
    


            Each of the crackdowns are run alongside a major immigration enforcement operation run by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The administration has also deployed the National Guard as part of some of the immigration operations, a move that is being challenged in court.
    


            The handling of the Epstein Files has been a problem for Bondi all year.
    


            After releasing some documents early this year to conservative influencers and promising more, the Justice Department and FBI in July released a memo stating that there was no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was murdered.
    


            Almost immediately, the DOJ and FBI faced fervent pushback from some critics, who accused officials of hiding information about the case. Bondi has stated there are no additional files that can be made public, as many include identifying information of victims or uncharged individuals that legally cannot be made public.
    


            The battle reached Capitol Hill as lawmakers demanded all case files be made available to them for review. The DOJ has since released documents, though most of them were already publicly available.
    


            Lawmakers are still working to get more information on two fronts: a probe is already underway by the House Oversight Committee, and there is an effort by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is seeking to compel the DOJ to release a full, unredacted version of the documents.

Watch live as Attorney General Pam Bondi faces lawmakers at a congressional hearing. The session comes amid growing questions about political influence over a Justice Department that has already criminally charged one of President Donald Trump's longtime foes and is under intense White House pressure to prosecute others.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Pam Bondi repeatedly deflected questions as she sought during a combative congressional hearing on Tuesday to defend herself against growing criticism that she's turning the law enforcement agency into a weapon to seek vengeance against President Donald Trump's political opponents. 

Democrats sought to use the hearing, coming on the heels of the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, to warn of what they view as the politicization of a department that has long prided itself on remaining independent from the White House. 

Bondi brushed aside with seeming disdain questions about her tumultuous tenure, flatly refusing to answer time and again as Democrats pressed her on politically charged investigations, the firings of career prosecutors and other matters. Her refusal to engage on the questions meant little if any fresh insight was offered about her actions and decisions, with Bondi instead opting to respond to Democrats' attacks by echoing conservative claims that President Joe Biden's Justice Department — which brought two criminal cases against Trump — was the one that had been weaponized.

“They were playing politics with law enforcement powers and will go down as a historic betrayal of public trust,” Bondi said of the Biden Justice Department. “This is the kind of conduct that shatters the American people's faith in our law enforcement system. We will work to earn that back every single day.”

The hearing split early along deeply partisan lines, with Republicans repeatedly leaping to her defense to highlight the criminal cases against the president that they say show the institution she inherited was deeply politicized. They pointed to revelations from a day earlier that the FBI had analyzed phone records of several Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, a Democrat. 




“This is an outrage, an unconstitutional breach and ought to be immediately addressed by you and Director Patel,” Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the committee, told Bondi, referring to FBI Director Kash Patel. 

Democrats, meanwhile, accused Bondi of destroying the department's credibility and eroding its longstanding independence from the White House as the Republican president publicly calls for the prosecution of his political foes. 

“What has taken place since January 20th, 2025, would make even President Nixon recoil,” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, said of the president who resigned to avoid being impeached in connection with the Watergate scandal. “This is your legacy, Attorney General Bondi. In eight short months, you fundamentally transformed the Justice Department and left an enormous stain in American history. It will take decades to recover.” 

The hearing marked Bondi's first before the panel since her confirmation hearing last January, when she pledged to not play politics with the Justice Department — a promise Democrats pounced on as they pressed the attorney general on whether she can withstand political pressure from the White House. 

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, reminded Bondi of that commitment and asked her if she thought she had upheld it. Bondi replied that she believed she absolutely had. 

“I pledged that I would end the weaponization also of the Justice Department and that America would once again have a one tier system of justice for all,” Bondi said. “And that is what we are doing.” 

Bondi set the tone for the hearing at the outset, repeatedly snapping with a raised voice at Durbin and deflecting questions from him by pointing to the murder rate in Chicago and asserting that lawmakers from his party were responsible for shutting the government down.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Pam Bondi says she will not allow justice to be weaponized.

“You're sitting here grilling me, and they're on their way to Chicago to keep your state safe,” Bondi said, referring to Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

“Madam Attorney General,” Durbin replied, “it's my job to grill you.”

She refused repeatedly to discuss matters, including a bribery investigation into Trump border czar Tom Homan that was shuttered under the Trump administration. That drew the ire of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, who accused Bondi of responding with “far-right internet talking points.” 

She also declined to say whether she talked to the president about the case against Comey, who was charged last month with lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee when he said he had not authorized anyone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about a particular investigation. His indictment came just days after Trump appeared to publicly implore her on social media to take that action against him and other perceived political enemies.

“This is supposed to be an oversight hearing in which members of Congress can get serious answer to serious questions about the coverup of corruption, about the prosecution of the president's enemies,” Sen. Adam Schiff of California, a Democrat from California, said as Bondi repeatedly interrupted him. “And when will be that the members of this committee on a bipartisan basis demand answers to those questions and refuse to accept personal slander as an answer to those questions?”

Comey is set to make his first court appearance on Wednesday in the case, which was brought despite career prosecutors' reservations about the strength of evidence, after the Trump administration raced install a new prosecutor to secure the charges following the resignation under pressure of the experienced leader of that office.

The Justice Department under Bondi has opened criminal investigations into other vocal critics of the president, including Schiff on accusations of mortgage fraud, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor and current mayoral candidate. They have all denied wrongdoing, as has Comey, and have slammed the investigations as politically motivated.

Portland business owners Loretta Guzman and Amy Nichols react to the idea of deploying National Guard troops to help mitigate the crime crisis in the city.

President Donald Trump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops in U.S. cities after a federal judge blocked his administration from sending National Guard units to Portland.

"I'd do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn't been necessary. But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. 

The 1807 law has not been invoked since the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

"If I had to enact it, I'd do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that. I mean, I want to make sure that people aren't killed. We have to make sure that our cities are safe," he added.

WHAT IS THE INSURRECTION ACT?

The order allows the president to deploy the military to suppress rebellions and enforce federal laws. If invoked, it would grant Trump the authority to federalize the Guard and deploy active duty forces to restore order. It would temporarily override the Posse Comitatus Act, which normally restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. 

"If we don't have to use it, I wouldn't use it," Trump later said on Newsmax, before adding, "If you take a look at what's been going on in Portland, it's been going on for a long time, and that's insurrection. I mean, that's pure insurrection."

The comments came after a federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from deploying California and Texas National Guard troops to Portland's streets amid protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The same court earlier had denied Trump from deploying Oregon's own Guard to the city. 

"Portland's been on fire for years — and not so much saving it," Trump told reporters Monday. "We have to save something else, because I think that's all insurrection. I really think that's really criminal insurrection."

But Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, said there was no evidence recent protests against ICE made the federalized Guard troops necessary.

About 100 National Guard troops had already arrived in Portland to handle increasingly contentious protests outside an ICE facility, and that deployment had been expected to double by the end of the day before the judge issued her order.

California and Oregon had sued over the deployment. 

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller tore into the judge's ruling, calling it "one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen."

"There is no legal distinction between a state volunteering guardsmen to guard the border and volunteering guardsmen to guard a federal immigration facility," Miller said. "Either we have a federal government, a supremacy clause, and a nation, or we don't."

Trump has also ordered Guard troops from other states to deploy to Chicago and Memphis. 

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker suggested Trump was trying to sow unrest so he could deploy the Insurrection Act at a news conference Monday.

"The Trump administration is following a playbook: cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them," Pritzker said. "Why? To create the pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act so that he can send military troops to our city."

During Trump's first administration, the White House floated the possibility of invoking the act in response to George Floyd protests, but ultimately did not.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports after test votes fail in the Senate as Democrats continue holding out for healthcare subsidies.

The Senate remains deadlocked on a path to end the shutdown as it nears its second week, and Republicans' meager support across the aisle to reopen the government may be crumbling.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., needs at least eight Senate Democratic caucus members to join Republicans to reopen the government, given that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has consistently voted against the GOP's bill.

So far, a trio of Democratic caucus members, Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine, have crossed the aisle to reopen the government.

That group has joined Republicans in nearly all five attempts to reopen the government.

But, as time drags on and a deal remains out of reach, at least one is considering changing his vote.

King said ahead of the fifth vote to reopen the government on Monday that he was considering flipping his support of the GOP's bill, and he argued that he needed "more specificity about addressing the problem" of the expiring ObamaCare tax credits.

"I think this problem is urgent, and just saying, as the leader did on Friday, ‘well, we'll have conversations about it,' is not adequate," he said.

King's possible defection comes as Republicans and Democrats engage in low-level conversations on a path out of the shutdown. Those impromptu dialogues have so far not morphed into real negotiations, however.

And the stalemate in the upper chamber has only further solidified both sides' positions.

Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., want a firm deal in place to extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies. Senate Republicans have said that they will negotiate a deal only after the government is reopened and want reforms to the program that they charge has been inflationary and further increased the cost of healthcare for Americans.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has circulated an early plan that includes a discussion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that could be a way out of the shutdown, but so far, it's in its preliminary stages.

"It suggests that there be a conversation on the ACA extension for the premium tax credits after we reopen the government," she said. "But there will be a commitment to having that discussion."

President Donald Trump signaled on Monday that he would be open to a deal on the subsidies, and he said that negotiations with Democrats were ongoing.

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DRAGS INTO WEEKEND AS SENATE DEMOCRATS BLOCK GOP PLAN

However, Schumer pushed back and called Trump's assertion "not true." The top Senate Democrat has also shifted the onus of the shutdown, and lack of negotiations, directly onto House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

"Clearly, at this point, he is the main obstacle," Schumer said on the Senate floor. "So ending this shutdown will require Donald Trump to step in and push Speaker Johnson to negotiate."

Meanwhile, the White House is exerting more pressure on Senate Democrats to cave and reopen the government. A new memo reported by Axios suggested that furloughed federal employees may not have to receive back pay, running counter to a law that Trump signed in 2019 that guaranteed furloughed workers would receive back pay in future shutdowns.

That comes on the heels of a memo from the Office of Management and Budget last month that signaled mass firings beyond the typical furloughs of nonessential federal workers, and it follows the withholding of nearly $30 billion in federal funds for blue cities and states.

Thune argued that "if you're the executive branch of the government, you've got to manage a shutdown."

"At some point, you're going to have to make some decisions about who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, which agencies and departments get priorities and prioritized and which ones don't," Thune said. "I mean, I think that's a fairly standard practice in the event of a government shutdown. Now, hopefully that doesn't affect back pay … but again, it's just that simple: open up the government."

Grant Harrold, who served the reigning monarch, has written a new book, "The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life in Royal Service."

Prince Harry had multiple close encounters with a stalker during his recent trip to the U.K.

Last month, a woman — who is believed to be struggling with mental health issues — was able to come within feet of the Duke of Sussex on two separate occasions, according to The Telegraph. 

The first alleged incident took place on Sept. 9 ahead of the WellChild Awards at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London. According to the outlet, the unnamed woman was able to enter a "secure zone."

According to The Sun, the woman was found hiding in a hotel bathroom 20 minutes before the duke arrived at a charity event. She was evicted from the hotel and allegedly photographed near his car as he arrived. 

One day later, she reportedly came near Harry as he visited the Centre for Blast Injury Studies in west London.

A representative for the Duke of Sussex told Fox News Digital that they "do not comment on security issues."

A security source told Fox News Digital, "These incidents are not uncommon for members of the Royal Family. It differs however, because there was no police presence or close protection — it was left to two staffers from his private office to intervene. This time they got lucky, recognizing the fixated individual. Relying on luck is not a long-term fix."

"He's the son of the King, brother of the heir, fifth in line to the throne and one of the most famous people in the world," the source added. "It feels like there is an inevitable foreboding looming over this whole issue. It seems it is going to take something serious to happen, before the Home Office chooses to intervene and ask the appropriate questions of the secretive boys' club that is the RAVEC board."

Earlier this year, the 41-year-old lost his appeal challenging the U.K. government's decision to strip him of his publicly funded security after he stepped back as a senior royal.

The Duke of Sussex returned to the U.K. on Sept. 8 to support key causes and charities. He also paid tribute to his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the third anniversary of her death, visiting her grave in Windsor and laying flowers.

Sources close to Harry previously told People magazine that Charles, who was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in 2024, was not answering his calls or letters. Royal experts told Fox News Digital that Harry and his brother Prince William, heir to the British throne, are not on speaking terms.

In May of this year, Harry told the BBC that he wanted to reconcile with his family.

"I would love reconciliation with my family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore," Harry told the outlet. "I don't know how much longer my father has."

Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife Meghan Markle stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California. Following their exit, the couple aired their grievances in interviews and documentaries. 

The royal's 2023 memoir, "Spare," which exposes embarrassing details about the House of Windsor and his sibling rivalry, worsened tensions.

'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Sol Wisenberg and Mike Davis discuss U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut temporarily preventing the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Portland.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, who President Donald Trump nominated during his first term, is blocking the commander in chief from deploying National Guard troops in Oregon.

The Senate confirmed her via voice vote in 2019.

Immergut was involved in a probe pertaining to the salacious scandal that indelibly marked President Bill Clinton's White House tenure.

"I was hired by Ken Starr almost five months after Attorney General Reno sought to expand the OIC's authority to investigate whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed justice, or intimidated witnesses in connection with the civil sexual harassment case in Jones v. Clinton," Immergut wrote in response to a question from then-Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in 2018. 

"I was hired to work as a line prosecutor to determine whether there were facts to support or refute those allegations," she noted.

She said that she questioned Lewinsky.

"When Ms. Lewinsky agreed to cooperate with the Office of Independent Counsel, I was asked to be one of the team of prosecutors debriefing her. As I was involved in the debriefings, I was asked to participate in questioning Ms. Lewinsky before the grand jury and take her deposition," she noted in response to another question.

Responding to questions from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Immergut expressed the view that it is not appropriate for lower courts to buck Supreme Court precedent.

Asked whether Roe v. Wade was "settled law," she replied, "Yes" — the nation's high court overturned the controversial abortion ruling in 2022. 

Asked whether the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry is "settled law," she again replied in the affirmative. 

Sen. Feinstein passed away in 2023.

Trump issued a Truth Social post last month in which he declared that he was "directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." 

A document featuring Hegseth's signature noted that "200 members of the Oregon National Guard will be called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days."

But this month, Immergut temporarily blocked the move amid a legal challenge lodged by the State of Oregon and the City of Portland.

"The President's determination was simply untethered to the facts," the judge's opinion and order asserted, declaring that "this Court GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order … and temporarily enjoins Defendants' September 28, 2025, Memorandum ordering the federalization and deployment of Oregon National Guard service members to Portland."

Then she issued a second temporary restraining order that more broadly blocked the administration from deploying any federalized National Guard in the state. 

"Defendants are temporarily enjoined from deploying federalized members of the National Guard in Oregon," the document declared.

'The Will Cain Show' reports former Special Counsel Jack Smith tracked GOP senators' private communications and calls.

The FBI has already terminated employees and abolished the CR-15 squad just one day after it was revealed that several Republicans' private communications and phone calls had been tracked.

FBI Director Kash Patel on Tuesday announced the actions the bureau had taken in response to the revelation of the "baseless monitoring" during the Biden administration and promised more actions to come.

"We are cleaning up a diseased temple three decades in the making — identifying the rot, removing those who weaponized law enforcement for political purposes and those who do not meet the standards of this mission while restoring integrity to the FBI. I promised reform, and I intend to deliver it," Patel said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Patel also posted about it on X, saying, "Transparency is important, and accountability is critical. We promised both, and this is what promises kept looks like… We terminated employees, we abolished the weaponized CR-15 squad, and we initiated an ongoing investigation with more accountability measures ahead."

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino replied to the post and echoed Patel's message, writing, "We promised you transparency and accountability. We will continue to deliver on those promises. You deserve better."

The CR-15 squad was the FBI's Washington Field Office's public corruption unit. The squad helped former special counsel Jack Smith investigate President Donald Trump, according to NBC News, which cited sources familiar with the matter.

On Monday, Fox News Digital learned that Smith allegedly tracked the private communications and phone calls of nearly a dozen Republican senators as part of his investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

Trump reacted to the revelation on Tuesday and slammed Smith in a post on Truth Social that read, "Deranged Jack Smith got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. A real sleazebag!!!"

HAWLEY RIPS JACK SMITH'S ‘BIDEN'S STASI' PROBE, CALLS ALLEGED SPYING ‘ABUSE OF POWER BEYOND WATERGATE'

A document, reviewed by Fox News Digital on Monday, revealed that Smith and his "Arctic Frost" team investigating Jan. 6 were allegedly tracking the phone calls of GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania. 

The document, recently discovered by Patel and exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital, is titled "CAST Assistance" and dated Sept. 27, 2023. "CAST" refers to the FBI's cellular analysis survey team. The case ID is marked in the document as "ARCTIC FROST—Election Law Matters—SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIVE MATTER—CAST."

Additionally, it states the names of the lawmakers and that an FBI special agent on Smith's team "conducted preliminary toll analysis" on the toll records associated with the lawmakers. 

An FBI official told Fox News Digital that Smith and his team tracking the senators were able to see which phone numbers they called, the location the phone call originated and the location where it was received.

A source said the calls were likely in reference to the vote to certify the 2020 election.

A 69-year-old truck driver who was seriously injured in a fight that prosecutors say was started by former NFL quarterback and sports analyst Mark Sanchez is now suing Sanchez and his employer, Fox Corporation, in Indiana state court.

Lawyers for Perry Tole filed the lawsuit Monday seeking an unspecified amount in actual and punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees. The lawsuit accuses Sanchez of instigating a fight with Tole late Saturday night outside a downtown Indianapolis hotel, leading to “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and other injuries and emotional distress. 

Tole also stabbed Sanchez several times in the fight, according to police. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.

A media contact for Fox Corporation did not immediately respond to an email Tuesday seeking comment. Attorneys representing Sanchez in his criminal case declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Attorneys representing Tole in the lawsuit, which requested a trial by jury, did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

Sanchez is facing a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanor charges, for what prosecutors said Monday was a fight over parking.

“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears said at a news conference Monday.




A police affidavit says the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis. Tole's lawsuit said Sanchez entered Tole's truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray. 

When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit.

Sanchez was in Indianapolis for Fox's coverage of Sunday's game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration warned on Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been long-standing policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House.

Trump signed into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 legislation that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund the government.

The move by the Republican administration was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic — a way to pressure lawmakers to reopen the government, now in the seventh day of a shutdown.

“There are some people that don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way,” Trump said during an event at the White House. 

He said back pay “depends on who we're talking about.”

Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices and almost certainly would be met with legal action. 

While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are almost always reimbursed once the government reopens.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

“That should turn up the urgency and the necessity of the Democrats doing the right thing here,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference at the Capitol.




Johnson, a lawyer, said he hadn't fully read the memo but “there are some legal analysts who are saying” that it may not be necessary or appropriate to repay the federal workers.

But Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington blasted the Trump administration as defying the law.

“Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards,” said Murray, who is the ranking lawmaker on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be — federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.”

In a single-page memo from Trump's Office of Management and Budget under Russ Vought, first reported by Axios, the office's general counsel seeks to lay out a legal rationale for no back pay of federal workers. 

The memo explains that while the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 says workers shall be paid after federal funding is restored, it argues the action is not self-executing. Instead, the memo says, repaying the federal workers would have to be part of legislation to reopen the government.

The OMB analysis draws on language familiar to budget experts by suggesting that the 2019 bill created an authorization to pay the federal workers but not the actual appropriation. 

Congress, it says, is able to decide whether it wants to pay the workers or not.

For now, Congress remains at a standstill, with neither side — nor the White House — appearing willing to budge. Democrats are fighting for health care funds to prevent a lapse in federal subsidies that threaten to send insurance rates skyrocketing. Republicans say the issue can be dealt with later.

The lawsuit was filed Monday, just as troops prepared to deploy and just hours after a federal judge blocked their deployment to Portland, Oregon.

CHICAGO (AP) — Officials in Illinois braced Tuesday for the possible arrival of the National Guard while a legal challenge to President Donald Trump's plan to send hundreds of troops to the Chicago area simmers and critics vigorously pan the deployment as an assault on the city.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, has said some 300 of the state's guard troops were to be federalized and sent to Chicago, along with 400 from Texas.

Pritzker accused Trump of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told reporters that the administration isn't sharing much information with the city.

“That is what is so difficult about this moment: You have an administration that is refusing to cooperate with a local authority,” Johnson said Tuesday.

Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday posted a picture on social media showing Texas National Guard members boarding a plane, but he didn't specify where they were going.

A federal judge gave the Trump administration two days to respond to a lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago challenging the plan. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday. The lawsuit says, “these advances in President Trump's long-declared ‘War' on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.”

Trump's bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition has triggered a conflict with blue state governors. In Oregon, a judge over the weekend blocked the Guard's deployment to Portland.

The Trump administration has portrayed the cities as war-ravaged and lawless amid its crackdown on illegal immigration. Officials in Illinois and Oregon, however, say military intervention isn't needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation.




Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I'd do that,” Trump said Monday. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” 

The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks has amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

The Chicago mayor signed an executive order Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations. 

Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois is also suing the federal government, accusing it of unleashing a campaign of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in suburban Broadview.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that the First Amendment doesn't protect “rioting.”

In Oregon, the Portland ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when local police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then. In recent weeks, the protests typically drew a couple dozen people — until the deployment was announced. Over the weekend, larger crowds gathered outside the facility, and federal agents fired tear gas. 

Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years. In Portland, homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared with the same period in 2024, data shows. In Chicago, homicides were down 31% to 278 through August, police data shows.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.

A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.

            Tropical Storm Jerry formed over the central Atlantic Ocean Tuesday and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.
    


            Jerry is the 10th named storm of a late-blooming season that has produced three hurricanes in just over two weeks.
    


            Tropical Storm Jerry has sustained winds of 45 mph as of 11 a.m ET Tuesday. The storm was about 1,300 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward Islands and was moving west.
    


            The storm is likely to track near or north of the northern Leeward islands by later this week as a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. Jerry could bring rain and wind to these islands, depending on its exact track. Tropical storm watches could be issued for parts of the islands by Tuesday night.
    


            Jerry is not expected to be a threat to the mainland United States because a cold front will sweep off the East Coast and help deflect it out to sea.
    


            East Coast cold fronts like these become more common in October, so more worrisome for the US are late-season storms that often form in the Gulf and Caribbean. Since these regions are closer to land, any storms that form have a greater chance to cause dangerous impacts.
    


            There is a low chance a system could try to develop in the southwest Gulf later this week, but of greater interest is a storm-spawning weather pattern that might develop by mid-October.
    


            A broad area of stormy weather is likely to form around that time and rotate around the western Caribbean region, according to an outlook issued last week by Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.
    


            Known as the Central American Gyre, this area of stormy weather and spin is notorious for generating late-season storms. It's too early to know if this weather pattern will produce a storm this October, but forecasters will be monitoring the region deeper into the month.
    


            Four named storms typically form in October and November, but some hurricane seasons can have a stronger finish while others mostly shut off.
    


            The last few years illustrate this year-to-year ebb and flow. Seven storms formed during October and November last season, but just two formed during the same time in 2023.
    


            While there are usually fewer storms at the tail end of the season, recent years show how destructive they can still be.
    


            Hurricane Michael in 2018 was the latest in the season a Category 5 has made landfall in the US after it roared into the Florida Panhandle on October 10. Two years earlier, Hurricane Matthew caused October destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. And maybe most notorious of all:  Hurricane Sandy morphed into a hybrid superstorm in late-October 2012 and walloped the East Coast.
    


            Last year's late-season run began in late-September when Hurricane Helene ravaged the Southeast with its catastrophic flooding and winds. It was punctuated by Hurricane Milton's exceptional burst to Category 5 strength before weakening as it struck the Florida Peninsula in early October.
    


            A similar ramp up of activity in late-September has happened this year after the Atlantic shed the hostile-for-hurricane conditions it had earlier in the month.
    


            After Hurricane Erin rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster in mid-August, the Atlantic mostly went to sleep. Then came a barrage of three hurricanes — Gabrielle, Humberto and Imelda — forming in a two-week-stretch to end September, breaking an unusual quiet spell.
    


            Hurricanes Gabrielle and Humberto also rapidly intensified like Erin. Gabrielle exploded into a strong Category 4, while Humberto became the season's second Category 5.
    


            Still, no hurricanes have made a US landfall this season. If that luck continues through the end of November, it would be first hurricane landfall-free season in a decade.

The Israeli prime minister's unlikely political survival — and the devastating toll of two years of war.

Benjamin Netanyahu has now served as prime minister of Israel longer than anyone in history — three non-consecutive stints over 18 years, or almost a quarter of the time Israel has been an independent country.

And from the beginning, his power has been on the verge of collapse.

About a year into his first term as prime minister, the international press smelled blood in the water. Netanyahu was facing possible indictment over a bribery scandal involving his attorney general — though, as the Washington Post noted in an editorial headlined “Can Mr. Netanyahu hang on?,” he was already “hip-deep in controversy” before that scandal erupted. After an embarrassingly botched assassination attempt targeting Hamas' Khaled Meshal that damaged relations with Israel's most important Arab ally, the Economist dubbed him “Israel's serial bungler.”

While Netanyahu's “easy eloquence” appealed to supporters abroad, particularly American Republicans, the British weekly noted, “as the wayward decisions mount up, his support is starting to dwindle. He is criticised for pursuing cheap popularity, regardless of the consequences; political scandal has swirled around him; the arrogance of his assumption that the Palestinians will in the end accept whatever he offers them is beginning to be questioned.”

A sentence like that could have been written at any point in the last 28 years, including in recent weeks. Polls show Netanyahu's coalition would be out of power if elections were held today. That coalition is itself divided and in danger of falling apart at nearly any time over the contentious issue of military service for the ultra-Orthodox. He is facing potential jail time in a long-running corruption trial, as well as a commission of inquiry over the security failures that led to October 7, the most violent day in Israel's history. Internationally, he's under indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. He evidently takes these charges seriously enough that his flight to the UN General Assembly in New York month took a circuitous route to avoid countries that might enforce the ICC's arrest warrant.

Meanwhile, Netanyahu's signature foreign policy achievement — the Abraham Accords normalization process with Israel's Arab neighbors — has been threatened by both the anger over the carnage in Gaza and Israel's threats to annex the West Bank. Israel itself is increasingly isolated on the world stage, threatened with expulsion from international projects ranging from important scientific research consortiums to the Eurovision song contest.

Then, last week, Netanyahu was effectively strong-armed by President Donald Trump into accepting a peace deal for Gaza that short-circuits a military operation he had already ordered and that undercuts his vow to continue fighting until Hamas is completely eliminated. (Hamas has already agreed to hand over political power but is still negotiating on other parts of the deal, including the crucial question of whether it will give up its weapons.) And yet, despite his initial reluctance, Netanyahu now appears to be embracing the deal, claiming that he had developed the plan in consultation with the US. Whether he knows it or not, the prime minister certainly looks like he was gifted yet another (almost literal) get-out-of-jail-free card by the US president. As Trump reportedly put it himself in a conversation with Netanyahu, “I don't know why you're always so f***ing negative. This is a win. Take it.”

On the verge of a potential end to a war that has killed tens of thousands, including thousands of children, as well as on the anniversary of the worst single day in Israeli history, it might seem reductive or even in poor taste to focus on the political fortunes of one leader.

But to a greater extent than most, this war has been tied to the political fortunes of one leader. It's been widely alleged, with a great deal of reported evidence, that Netanyahu has prolonged the war in order to maintain his grip on power. Accepting a hostage deal that entailed a withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, or left either Hamas or the Palestinian authority in charge of Gaza, would likely have led to a government collapse, elections, likely political defeat, and potential jail time.

Throughout his career, when faced with a seemingly impossible political dilemma with no good choices, Netanyahu's general move has been not to choose at all. So, too, has it been in this case; as the killing continued, Netanyahu waited. And the waiting appears to have paid off.

As of this writing, the success of the peace plan is still an open question, but Netanyahu probably benefits either way. Hamas responded positively, if somewhat noncommittally, to the plan on Friday. Speaking on Saturday, Netanyahu said he was optimistic that Hamas's remaining Israeli hostages would be released in the coming days — “the living and the slain, in one go, with the [Israel Defense Forces] still deployed deep in Gaza.” Securing the hostages' release without removing Israeli troops from Gaza would be about as close to an absolute victory as one could realistically imagine, and the plan is overwhelmingly popular with the Israeli public.

In fact, the language of the plan is vague as to when, if ever, Israeli troops will have to be entirely withdrawn from Gaza. The language on Palestinian statehood is even vaguer; the Palestinian Authority would take power in Gaza only after a period of “reform” that could go on indefinitely.

It's true that Netanyahu's key far-right allies, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, have slammed the plan. Any countenancing of a two-state solution or a role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza is unacceptable to them, no matter how vaguely worded. But both men are currently in positions of enormous power and influence after years in the political wilderness when they were shunned by the mainstream. They're likely to think twice about giving up their current positions.

Even if they do, opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz have enthusiastically backed the Trump peace plan and offered to support Netanyahu's government temporarily if his far-right partners bolt. Both Gantz and Lapid have, in the past, refused to join a Netanyahu-led government, but given the overwhelming public support for the plan, it's not out of the question that could change either.

In any event, Netanyahu can head into Israel's next elections — which are scheduled for October 2026 but could be called sooner — campaigning as the leader who defeated Hamas, brought the hostages home, and bombed Iran's nuclear program too. Yes, Netanyahu may have looked less than Churchillian as he effectively took orders from Trump over the past week, but Israel is one of the few countries where the US president polls well, so that may not be as much of a liability as it would be elsewhere.

On the other hand, if Hamas ultimately balks at releasing its hostages, or tries to stretch on negotiations indefinitely, Trump has indicated he will give Israel carte blanche to “finish the job” in Gaza. In other words, the war would continue.

This would be a catastrophe for Gaza and the remaining hostages and deepen Israel's international isolation, but it would allow Netanyahu to maintain the current status quo. A third, and perhaps most likely, outcome is that Hamas will agree in principle, but the two sides will haggle over the details and implementation, which also amounts to the war continuing.

While this would be a disappointing outcome for Israelis, if Hamas refuses, it will allow the prime minister to make the case — which is likely to be more effective at home than abroad — that he has given the group an opportunity for a diplomatic way out and that the only option left is to continue crushing it by military force.

At this point in his career, Netanyahu is something like this species of shark that will die if they stop swimming. The prime minister has been on trial since 2020 on a variety of corruption charges that could potentially bring up to 10 years jail time. (In Israel, this is not an idle threat: Netanyahu's predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was sentenced to six years in prison on bribery charges after leaving office and served 18 months.)

Meanwhile, a public reckoning for the specific security failures that allowed the October 7 attacks to take place, as well as the years-long policy of permitting the funding of Hamas in Gaza in order to keep Palestinian governance divided, is likely coming for Netanyahu after the war's conclusion. A scathing independent commission last year blasted Netanyahu “for accepting the doctrine of ‘money for quiet,' and utterly ignoring all other perceptions.”

Netanyahu's ability to push back against both processes only works as long as he's prime minister.

There are also the international efforts to hold Netanyahu to account. But two months after fellow International Criminal Court-indictee Vladimir Putin walked the red carpet in Alaska, with the war in Ukraine still raging, it's hard to imagine that Netanyahu's international isolation will be permanent. He may soon be able to fly direct routes to New York again.

The Abraham Accords and Israel's regional normalization process may not be entirely off the rails either. Last year, the New York Times' Thomas Friedman opined that Netanyahu would have to choose between “Rafah or Riyadh” — doubling down on the destruction of Gaza or deepening relations with neighboring powers like Saudi Arabia. With Arab countries taking part ownership of Trump's peace deal, it seems at least possible that he won't have to choose.

This is not to say that all Netanyahu's problems are solved — and Israel's certainly aren't. The criminal trials loom; Netanyahu's victories in next year's elections aren't assured; and the issue of annexation of the West Bank, which the Israeli right is demanding but which both regional governments and, for the moment at least, the Trump administration opposes, will continue to be a dilemma as well the contentious question of Orthodox military service. More consequentially, the brutal war in Gaza has deepened Israel's political isolation. Even if governments may lose interest in sanctioning Israel, it has lost an enormous amount of public support, including among constituencies like American Jews, who were once among its staunchest supporters. Though Netanyahu has made plain his preference for having Trump in office, rather than any Democrat, he has also found this president much more difficult to defy than Barack Obama or Joe Biden. This could pose problems for him down the road.

But if we've learned anything after Netanyahu's two decades in power, it's that, for him, those are problems for another day.

            Suspected Chinese government operatives asked ChatGPT to help write proposal for a tool to conduct large-scale surveillance and to help promote another that allegedly scans social media accounts for “extremist speech,” ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said in a report published Tuesday.
    


            The report sounds the alarm about how a highly coveted artificial intelligence technology can be used to try to make repression more efficient and provides “a rare snapshot into the broader world of authoritarian abuses of AI,” OpenAI said.
    


            The US and China are in an open contest for supremacy in AI technology, each investing billions of dollars in new capabilities. But the new report shows how AI is often used by suspected state actors to carry out relatively mundane tasks, like crunching data or making language more polished, rather any startling new technological achievement.
    


            “There's a push within the People's Republic of China to get better at using artificial intelligence for large-scale things like surveillance and monitoring,” Ben Nimmo, principal investigator at OpenAI, told CNN. “It's not last year that the Chinese Communist Party started surveilling its own population. But now they've heard of AI and they're thinking, oh maybe we can use this to get a little bit better.”
    


            In one case, a ChatGPT user “likely connected to a [Chinese] government entity” asked the AI model to help write a proposal for a tool that analyzes the travel movements and police records of the Uyghur minority and other “high-risk” people, according to the OpenAI report. The US State Department in the first Trump administration accused the Chinese government of genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims, a charge that Beijing vehemently denies.
    


            Another Chinese-speaking user asked ChatGPT for help designing “promotional materials” for a tool that purportedly scans X, Facebook and other social media platforms for political and religious content, the report said. OpenAI said it banned both users.
    


            AI is one of the most high-stakes areas of competition between the US and China, the world's two superpowers. Chinese firm DeepSeek alarmed US officials and investors in January when it presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities but operates at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI's model. That same month, President Donald Trump touted a plan by private firms to invest up to $500 million in AI infrastructure.
    


            Asked about OpenAI's findings, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said: “We oppose groundless attacks and slanders against China.”
    


            China is “rapidly building an AI governance system with distinct national characteristics,” Liu's statement continued. “This approach emphasizes a balance between development and security, featuring innovation, security and inclusiveness. The government has introduced major policy plans and ethical guidelines, as well as laws and regulations on algorithmic services, generative AI, and data security.”
    


            The OpenAI report includes several other examples of just how commonplace AI is in the daily operations of state-backed and criminal hackers, along with other scammers. Suspected Russian, North Korean and Chinese hackers have all used ChatGPT to perform tasks like refining their coding or make the phishing links they send to targets more plausible.
    


            One way state actors are using AI is to improve in areas where they had weaknesses in the past. For instance, Chinese and Russian state actors have often struggled to avoid basic language errors in influence operations on social media.
    


            “Adversaries are using AI to refine existing tradecraft, not to invent new kinds of cyberattacks,” Michael Flossman, another security expert with OpenAI, told reporters.
    


            Meanwhile, scammers very likely based in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar have used OpenAI's models for a range of business tasks, from managing financial accounts to researching criminal penalties for online scams, according to the company.
    


            But an increasing number of would-be victims are using ChatGPT to spot scams before they are victimized. OpenAI estimates that ChatGPT is “being used to identify scams up to three times more often than it is being used for scams.”
    


            CNN asked OpenAI if it was aware of US military or intelligence agencies using ChatGPT for hacking operations. The company did not directly answer the question, instead referring CNN to OpenAI's policy of using AI in support of democracy.
    


            US Cyber Command, the military's offensive and defensive cyber unit, has made clear that it will use AI tools to support its mission. An “AI roadmap” approved by the command pledges to “accelerate adoption and scale capabilities” in artificial intelligence, according to a summary of the roadmap the command provided to CNN.
    


            Cyber Command is still exploring how to use AI in offensive operations, including how to use it to build capabilities to exploit software vulnerabilities in equipment used by foreign targets, former command officials told CNN.

            Audrey Murray is losing sleep over the government shutdown that could soon derail her paychecks.
    


            Murray, 65, has worked as a cleaner at the Smithsonian Museum of American History for nearly three decades. Now she is among the hundreds of thousands of federal government contractors whose livelihoods are being threatened by the political dysfunction in Washington, DC.



            “It's so sad that they think they can play with people's lives,” Murray told CNN while fighting back tears. “Stop this. Stop messing with people. We have families who depend on us.”
    


            Unlike federal employees, contractors typically don't receive backpay when the government reopens from a shutdown. Low-wage service workers, including cleaners, janitors, security guards, cafeteria workers and other staffers who keep buildings operating, are often out of luck.
    


            The Smithsonian Institution, which includes all the Smithsonian museums, plans to go dark after Saturday if the government shutdown continues beyond then, according to its website.
    


            If that happens, Murray worries how she will provide for her three children and grandchildren in Capitol Heights, Maryland.
    


            “I don't know how I'm going to feed my kids or pay my mortgage. It's not about me. I don't care if I don't eat, but I want them to,” said Murray. “I pay my bills and do everything I'm supposed to. But I'm worried and I can't sleep.”
    


            Government shutdowns can create hardships for Americans who rely on government services and for those who work in the federal government.
    


            During a shutdown, federal employees are not paid — even if they are deemed essential — and are required to report to work. Essential workers include those at the Transportation Security Administration who screen passengers and baggage at airports.
    


            However, those federal workers get backpay once the lapse in funding is over. But there is no such obligation for government contract workers, according to legal experts.



            “Not only are they not guaranteed backpay, they rarely — if ever — get it,” said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project (NELP), a nonprofit advocating for an inclusive economy and worker rights.
    


            The problem is that contractors are paid by the federal government for the services they provide, whether that's security work, meal prep or cleaning office buildings. But if there are no services because buildings are shut down, the contractor doesn't get paid.
    


            This is especially painful for lower-wage workers, who often live paycheck-to-paycheck and may have minimal savings for emergencies. Union officials say this problem has an even greater impact on women and people of color, who make up a bigger proportion of the low-wage workforce and often have fewer financial resources to bridge the gap.
    


            Tiara Roberts, a single mom in Maryland with three children, is concerned about how she will get by if her contract job providing security at a Smithsonian museum is derailed by the shutdown.
    


            “This affects me to the extreme. It really triggers me,” said Roberts, whose children include a six-month-old and a 3-year-old. “I have a lot on my plate already, and this is just an added-on stressor.”
    


            Roberts hopes to make ends meet by working as an Uber driver or an Instacart delivery worker.
    


            Nichole Atallah, a partner who specializes in labor and government contracting at the law firm PilieroMazza, said the general rule is that contract workers aren't made whole after a shutdown.
    


            “If you're a cafeteria worker or a janitor, you can't make up that time. It's lost,” Atallah told CNN in a phone interview.
    


            Although employers can decide to pay contract workers despite the shutdown, experts say that's rare when it comes to hourly workers in blue-collar jobs.
    


            Atallah said contract employers  will sometimes work to compensate workers in highly skilled positions who are hurt by the shutdown.
    


            “If I have a more highly skilled person working on contract, I'm more likely to bend over backwards to make sure someone doesn't find another job than I am with a janitor,” Atallah said.
    


            Although there is often a waiting period before someone can apply for unemployment benefits, Atallah urged impacted contract workers who get furloughed to immediately apply because some unemployment systems in the DC area are already strained by federal layoffs.
    


            “They should apply for unemployment as soon as possible so they're first in line if the shutdown lasts,” Atallah said.
    


            The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) estimates that more than half a million employees of federal contractors were without work and not provided backpay during the record-long shutdown of 2018-2019.
    


            A campaign to get backpay for contract workers failed to make headway during that shutdown, which lasted 35 days.
    


            Last week, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced legislation to provide backpay for federal workers who face furloughs and lose income during a shutdown. The bill, called the Fair Pay for Federal Contractors Act, would provide backpay for contract workers, including low-wage service workers for an amount equal to their weekly compensation up to $1,442.
    


            “This is about fairness—contract workers and their families should not miss a paycheck because of a government shutdown they did nothing to cause,” Smith said in a statement about the legislation.
    


            Jamie Contreras, executive vice president at 32BJ SEIU, which represents about 2,400 federally contracted security officers, office cleaners and food service workers, urged the Trump administration and Republicans to avoid “punishing working-class families” in this shutdown.
    


            “For decades, 32BJ's federally contracted janitors and security officers have done the hard and important work to keep key federal government buildings safe and clean,” Contreras said. “Many are single mothers and the sole providers for their families who were forced to rely on public assistance to survive and fell further behind on bills during previous shutdowns.”
    


            White House spokesman Kush Desai declined to say whether the Trump administration supports paying federal contract workers who get furloughed during the shutdown.
    


            “American contract workers are another casualty of the Democrats' needless and destructive government shutdown,” Desai said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Maria Madonado, a single mother of three who lives in New Carrolton, Maryland, told CNN through a translator that her work as a contracted cleaner at the IRS headquarters is being impacted by the shutdown. She fears she won't be able to pay her bills.
    


            She said her supervisor told her and her colleagues not to come into work last Thursday due to the shutdown. Then the cleaners were asked to return on Friday because the building was a mess.
    


            Madonado's status this week is unclear.
    


            Madonado, who is from El Salvador and has lived in the United States for 26 years, said it's “not fair” that she won't get paid because “it's not that we're not working because we don't want to.”
    


            Due to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, Madonado — who holds a green card — is reluctant to go on unemployment or apply for other aid out of fear it will hurt her chances of eventually becoming a US citizen.
    


            “It's really strange because you think you're more secure in a government job than in a regular job,” she said. “And today I realized that's not the case.”

Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is now facing a felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury in addition to the misdemeanor charges stemming from a weekend incident in Indianapolis that led to his arrest.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is now facing a felony battery charge for what authorities said Monday was a fight over parking, in addition to the misdemeanor charges that the Fox Sports analyst was already facing from the weekend incident in Indianapolis.

Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears announced the felony charge of battery involving serious bodily injury, which carries a potential sentence of one to six years in prison, during a news conference with Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Chief Chris Bailey. Mears said the investigation is ongoing and that additional charges are possible.

“We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” the prosecutor told reporters.

A police affidavit alleges the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted a 69-year-old truck driver who backed into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis, leading to a confrontation early Saturday outside the vehicle that prompted the driver to pull out a knife to defend himself.

The former New York Jets quarterback was pepper-sprayed and stabbed multiple times during the altercation, according to court records filed Sunday.

It became clear after investigators learned more about the victim's medical condition that the more serious felony charge was warranted, Mears said.




“This was a situation that did not need to occur,” the prosecutor said. “The allegations involve a 38-year-old man becoming involved in an altercation with a 69-year-old man who sustained significant and very severe injuries as a result of that altercation.”

Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, the initial affidavit signed by a police detective said. The truck driver, identified as P.T., had a cut to his left cheek, it said.

Authorities have not said whether the truck driver might also faces charges, but Mears noted that Indiana “has some of the most robust self-defense laws in the nation.”

Sanchez had been scheduled for a hearing Tuesday on the original misdemeanor charges but that was rescheduled to Nov. 4. Sanchez remained hospitalized and was listed in stable condition Monday morning.

One of Sanchez's attorneys, James Voyles, declined to comment on the case.

“This has been a deeply distressing time for everyone involved. Mark and our family are incredibly grateful for the concern, love, and support we've received over the past few days,” Sanchez's brother, Nick, said in a statement released Monday. “Mark remains under medical care for the serious injuries he sustained and is focused on his recovery as the legal process continues. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the first responders and medical staff.”

Mark Sanchez was in Indianapolis for the network's coverage of Sunday's game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders. 

The prosecutor said police are still gathering information and have several outstanding search warrants. He also said surveillance video captured the incident from multiple angles.

“I don't care who you are. I don't care what you do for a living. I don't care where you live,” the police chief said. “If you come into our city, commit violence, we will use all the tools at our disposal to hold you accountable.”

President Donald Trump weighed in late Monday, saying he knew Sanchez “a little bit” and was surprised by the incident.

“I feel bad,” Trump told Newsmax. “He's a nice guy. I don't know what happened.”

Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington. 

He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah's Republican-led Legislature approved a revised congressional map Monday that could give Democrats an improved chance at flipping a seat as they fight to topple the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House. But in a state dominated by Republicans, it remains a long-shot that Democrats could win a district next year. 

Republicans currently hold all four of Utah's House seats. 

In the court-ordered redraw, two districts become slightly competitive for Democrats — one more than the other — but all four still lean Republican. The map places Salt Lake City in a single district that stretches into rural areas, instead of splitting the heavily Democratic city among multiple districts.

Redistricting experts say it's the least competitive proposal lawmakers considered, and likely Republicans' best bet at safeguarding their seats. But Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said he sees “a prime pickup opportunity.”

The districts still must be reviewed by a judge, who is expected to approve a new map by November. 

In August, Judge Dianna Gibson struck down the congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented standards established by voters to ensure districts don't deliberately favor a party, a practice known as gerrymandering.

The mandated redraw comes as President Donald Trump has urged other Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting ahead of the midterm elections to add winnable seats for the party.







Utah's revised map creates some uncertainty in a state that was thought to be a clean sweep for the GOP. Nationally, Democrats need to net three House seats next year to wrest control of the chamber from Republicans, who are trying to buck a historic pattern of the president's party losing seats in the midterms. 

Republican state Sen. Scott Sandall, a co-chair of the Legislature's redistricting committee, said there are a lot of things they would have done differently if not for the time crunch. Still, he thinks the judge will have no reason to reject the map.

After taking public comment on several proposals, Republicans chose to move forward with the least competitive option. Commenters appeared to favor a proposal from Democrats until the Utah Republican Party sent out an email to rally support for the map now approved by lawmakers.

Democratic state Sen. Nate Blouin was scolded by Republican leaders on the Senate floor when he said he thinks it's no coincidence that the map most favorable to Republicans was chosen. Sandall insisted the committee did not consider political data.

A handful of Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the map.

During Monday's special session, Republicans also amended Proposition 4 — a voter-approved ballot initiative from 2018 that sparked the redistricting case — requiring each new district to have a partisan vote share similar to Utah's recent statewide election results. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed it into law later Monday, and the voting rights groups involved in the legal challenge responded with a motion arguing lawmakers were trying “to change the rules of the game.”

Jonathan Cervas, a redistricting expert at Carnegie Mellon University, ran data from past elections in Utah against the redrawn map and found that Democrats would lose every time. That indicates that the map is uncompetitive, he said.

“Although it's not as competitive as I think the plaintiffs would want, I think it's far better than the map that currently exists — a stark improvement,” Cervas said.

The map thrown out by Gibson more significantly divided Salt Lake County — Utah's population center and an island of Democratic support. Before the map was adopted in 2021, one district had traded hands between Democrats and Republicans. All have since elected Republicans by wide margins.

Gibson will now review the map approved by lawmakers and consider alternate proposals from the voting rights groups. If she shoots it down, Cervas anticipates a legal battle over whether the court has authority or an obligation to put in place a map of its own.

If the revised map stands, redistricting analyst Jason Fierman thinks “it's not insurmountable” for Democrats.

“An extremely strong candidate in a blue wave year might be able to possibly break this cycle of Democrats not winning any of these seats,” said Fierman, who has consulted on maps in other states. Former U.S. Rep. Ben McAdams could be one such candidate, he said. “This could really be a ‘game on' moment for Democrats, but it would be challenging.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's latest bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition is triggering a new conflict with blue state governors that is playing out in the courts as Trump envisages a country where armed soldiers patrol U.S. streets.

Trump has already pushed traditional boundaries by using the National Guard domestically, envisioning a muscular role for the U.S. military in targeting illegal immigration and crime in American cities.

His attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon and Texas Guardsmen to Illinois is a sprawling use of presidential power. Next steps in lawsuits filed by Democrat-led states will likely address significant questions of constitutional law, federalism and the separation of powers — setting up a potential collision between the courts and Trump's aggressive use of the National Guard.

At a gathering of military brass last week, Trump called for using U.S. cities as a training ground for troops and warned of an “invasion from within.” To his critics, however, Trump's use of the National Guard amounts to a frightening use of force against Americans.

Speaking with reporters, President Trump was asked if he would invoke the Insurrection Act.

“What will happen when the president loses in court?” said Alex Reinert, a constitutional law expert at the Cardozo School of Law in New York City. “Will he use it as an excuse to act in an even more authoritarian way?”




Rifle-wielding troops on American streets are one of the starkest manifestations of Trump's attempt to expand presidential power, with troops already deployed to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. 

Control over a state's National Guard typically falls to the governor unless units are federalized — as they were in California over the governor's objections. Otherwise, it's up to the governor to decide to deploy Guard members or send them to other states to assist with natural disasters. In D.C., Trump commands the Guard himself.

Local authorities, Trump says, have failed to safeguard communities, giving several Democrat-led cities as examples. He's called Portland “war ravaged” and a “war zone” that is “burning down” and like “living in hell.”

However, the nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws, reflecting America's long-standing belief that law enforcement should remain in civilian hands.

Trump was asked Monday about another law, the Insurrection Act, and said he would be willing to invoke it if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“If I had to enact it — I'd do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up.” He added: “We have to make sure our cities are safe.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that Trump wants to make America's cities safer. 

″You guys are framing this like, ‘The president wants to take over the American cities with the military,'” Leavitt told reporters Monday. “The president wants to help these local leaders who have been completely ineffective in securing their own cities.”

U.S. officials say the decisions to send federalized troops from Texas and California to other states are being made at the highest levels of the Trump administration, bypassing formal Pentagon policy processes that would normally be part of troop deployments.

While this dynamic is not unheard of, one official said, it's typically used in situations like natural disasters where troops need to move out quickly before formal orders and authorizations. The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal situation.

One result is that governors like California's Gavin Newsom and Illinois' JB Pritzker, both Democrats, have become the first to announce troop deployments. Pentagon public affairs officials have struggled to confirm or deny the actions and troop numbers, facing pressure to avoid giving even basic details of military operations and to defer questions to the White House.

The situation is far different from President John F. Kennedy's move to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1963 to integrate the University of Alabama in a standoff with Gov. George Wallace. That is because Trump is ostensibly seeking to use troops to protect federal property and personnel, not to enforce federal civil rights laws passed by Congress, according to William Banks, a Syracuse University law professor and an expert in constitutional law and national security.

The Guard members cannot enforce local laws, block traffic or do “any of the things that police do,” Banks said. “So it's more symbolic than helpful.”

Leaders in Illinois, Oregon and California have sued, while top White House figures blasted a Trump-appointed judge's decision to block the deployment in Portland.

Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, suggested it's the courts that have ignored constitutional limits.

“A district court judge has no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President and Commander-in-Chief from dispatching members of the US military to defend federal lives and property,” Miller posted on X, likening the protests over Trump's immigration policy to “domestic terrorism.”

Judges are not likely to be swayed by the bluster, legal experts say. Instead, they will look at whether Trump's orders violate the Constitution and the federal laws governing how the Guard is used.

Trump's opponents have relied on the court system to slow down his agenda, with the Republican-controlled Congress largely not checking his expansion of power. 

With litigation piling up, Trump officials have shown disdain for judges and decisions they oppose but so far have avoided the direct kind of confrontation that legal experts say could do real harm.

“The potential that they would defy an order from a federal court is very worrisome,” Banks said. “That's our backstop. That's what we have in the United States to keep our democracy on the rails.”

Trump's attempt to deploy California National Guard members to Oregon is a “clear violation of the law” and a flagrant attempt to circumvent the judge's weekend ruling, according to Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on presidential powers.

Goitein, senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, said Americans should be concerned that Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth see deployments in U.S. cities as practice for overseas conflicts.

“What the military is trained to do is to fight and destroy enemies of the United States. The president of the United States wants soldiers to practice this battle training in the streets of American cities,” she wrote on a social media.

President Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that some federal workers who have been furloughed during the government shutdown will not receive back pay after they return to work.

The remark came hours after the circulation of a draft White House memo arguing that federal employees placed on unpaid leave are not guaranteed back pay.

The memo, first reported by Axios and confirmed to NBC News by the White House, appears to clash with the Trump administration's own recent guidance. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, in a shutdown guidance sheet issued last month, stated definitively that furloughed workers would be paid retroactively once the funding lapse ends.

A federal law, which Trump signed after the last government shutdown in 2019, additionally says that furloughed U.S. government employees "shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations."

A White House official told Axios that the administration's view is that that law does not automatically cover furloughed employees' back pay, and that Congress must specifically appropriate those funds.

Trump, when asked at the White House on Tuesday afternoon about back pay for those workers, said, "I would say it depends on who we're talking about."

The Democrats — whom Trump and Republicans blame for the shutdown that is now on Day 7 — "have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy," the president said in the Oval Office alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

"But it really depends on who you're talking about," he said. "For the most part, we're going to take care of our people."

Trump added, "There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way."

When asked why he said some workers should not get their back pay, he said, "Ask the Democrats that question."

The administration's signaling about workers' back pay has been widely viewed as an attempt to ratchet up pressure on Senate Democrats to vote for Republicans' proposal for a stopgap bill that will resume government funding at current levels until late November.

The administration has previously warned that the shutdown will soon lead to thousands of federal workers being permanently laid off, rather than just furloughed, as has been the case in past funding lapses.

Asked Tuesday how many permanent jobs are on the chopping block, Trump said he will be able to say "in four or five days, if this keeps going on."

"It'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back," he added. "But you're going to have a lot closer to a balanced budget, actually."

Democrats have brushed off those threats, arguing that the administration has already been trying to slash the size of the federal workforce since Trump took office again in January.

They want any short-term resolution to include an extension of enhanced premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at year's end. Republicans, who hold a 53-seat majority in the Senate, need at least seven more votes to overcome the chamber's filibuster.

The administration's scrutiny about back pay prompted a fiery response from the American Federation of Government Employees, a major federal workers' union.

"The frivolous argument that federal employees are not guaranteed backpay under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act is an obvious misinterpretation of the law," AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement.

"It is also inconsistent with the Trump administration's own guidance from mere days ago, which clearly and correctly states that furloughed employees will receive retroactive pay for the time they were out of work as quickly as possible once the shutdown is over," he said.

"As we've said before, the livelihoods of the patriotic Americans serving their country in the federal government are not bargaining chips in a political game," Kelley said. "It's long past time for these attacks on federal employees to stop and for Congress to come together, resolve their differences, and end this shutdown."

Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo said that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are "at a bubble," comparing it to the dotcom era.

But one key difference in the market now, he said, is that large companies with "healthy balance sheets" are financing AI businesses.

Bravo's private equity firm boasts more than $181 billion in assets under management as of June, and focuses on buying and selling enterprise tech companies, with a significant chunk of its portfolio invested in cybersecurity.

Bravo told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Tuesday that investors can't value a $50 million annual recurring revenue company at $10 billion.

"That company is going to have to produce a billion dollars in free cash flow to double an investor's money, ultimately," he said. "Even if the product is right, even if the market's right, that's a tall order, managerially."

OpenAI recently finalized a secondary share sale that would value the ChatGPT-maker at $500 billion. The company is projected to make $13 billion in revenue for 2025.

Nvidia recently said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, in part, to help the ChatGPT maker lease its chips and build out supercomputing facilities in the coming years.

Other public companies have soared on AI promises, with Palantir's market cap climbing to $437 billion, putting it among the 20 most valuable publicly traded companies in the U.S., and AppLovin now worth $213 billion.

Even early-stage valuations are massive in AI, with Thinking Machines Lab notching a $12 billion valuation on a $2 billion seed round.

Despite the inflated numbers, Bravo emphasized that there's a "big difference" between the dotcom collapse and the current landscape of AI.

"Now you have some really big companies and some big balance sheets and healthy balance sheets financing this activity, which is different than what happened roughly 25 years ago," he said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told staff that the company will continue to sponsor H-1B visas and cover all associated costs following President Donald Trump's executive order last month that imposed a $100,000 fee on each new application.

Huang reiterated his earlier support for the changes and shared personal reflections on immigration in the internal message, which Business Insider viewed.

"As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we've found in America have profoundly shaped our lives," he wrote. "And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration."

Nvidia declined to comment.

In his message to staff, Huang said "legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas," and that the Trump administration's "recent changes reaffirm this."

Huang previously said on CNBC that he was "glad" to see Trump's executive order. In a subsequent interview on the "BG2 Pod" podcast, he expressed some critiques, saying the changes were a "great start," but that the $100,000 price tag "probably sets the bar a little too high."

Huang also acknowledged another critique in his podcast interview: that the $100,000 fees could have a more significant impact on cash-strapped startups than well-funded tech companies, which can more easily afford them.

The Trump administration said it imposed the rules to encourage more domestic hiring and prevent what it called "abuses" of the H-1B visa system. Critics argue that it could have the opposite effect, leading to increased hiring abroad.

Nvidia is one of the world's most successful companies, with a market capitalization of $4.5 trillion. It's also one of the top sponsors of H-1B visas in the tech industry, with roughly 1,500 approvals in 2025.

Oracle stock slipped 5% on Tuesday after a report from The Information that raised questions about the company's plans to buy billions of Nvidia chips to rent as a cloud provider to clients like OpenAI.

Oracle had 14% gross margins on $900 million in sales in its Nvidia cloud business in the three months ending in August, according to the report, which cited internal documents. That's significantly lower than Oracle's overall gross margin of around 70%.

The report said that Oracle's recent transformation into one of the most important cloud and artificial intelligence companies may run into profitability challenges because of how expensive Nvidia chips are and aggressive pricing on its AI chip rentals.

In September, Oracle said that its backlog of cloud contracts, which it called remaining performance obligations, had jumped 359% in a year. It forecasted $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in 2030, up from just over $10 billion in 2025.

Much of that forecasted revenue is from Oracle's role in the Stargate project, in which the enterprise vendor is working with OpenAI to open five massive data centers filled with AI chips from Nvidia.

A Los Angeles jury late on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from mesothelioma, finding the company liable in the latest lawsuit alleging its baby powder products cause cancer.

The family of Mae Moore, who died in 2021, sued the company the same year, claiming Johnson & Johnson's talc baby powder products contained asbestos fibers that caused her rare cancer. The jury ordered the company to pay $16 million in compensatory damages and $950 million in punitive damages, according to court filings.

The verdict could be reduced on appeal as the U.S. Supreme Court has found that punitive damages should generally be no more than nine times compensatory damages.

Representatives for Johnson & Johnson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company has said its products are safe, do not contain asbestos, and do not cause cancer. J&J stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a cornstarch product.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday stonewalled a question at a Senate Judiciary Committee about who ordered FBI agents to flag any documents that mentioned President Donald Trump during a review this year of investigative files about the late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Sen. Dick Durbin, in a letter in July, mentioned that purported order to FBI agents as he asked the Justice Department about past promises to release the Epstein files and a subsequent decision by Bondi not to do so.

"So, who gave the order to flag records related to President Trump?" Durbin, D-Ill., asked Bondi at Tuesday's Judiciary Committee hearing.

"To flag records which included his name?" Durbin asked.

Boni bristled as she answered, "I'm not going to discuss anything about that with you, senator."

Durbin replied, "Eventually you're going to have to answer for your conduct in this, you won't do it today, but eventually you will."

Durbin, in his letter to the Justice Department, said that in March, hundreds of personnel in the New York field office of the FBI were assigned to review files related to Epstein. 

In that letter, Durbin cited a quote by Trump in 2002 about Epstein, which was published in New York magazine.

"Mr. Trump said of Mr. Epstein, 'I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side,' " Durbin wrote.

Durbin on Tuesday also asked Bondi why, in February, she had said that the so-called Epstein client list was sitting on her desk for her to review, when she eventually said she would not release the Epstein files.

"I said I had not yet reviewed it, and if you see our memo on Epstein, you will see our memo on Epstein  clearly points out that there was no client list," Bondi replied.

That joint Justice Department and FBI memo was released on July 7, months after the review of Epstein file documents.

It concluded that there was no Epstein client list, and supported the long-standing official finding that Epstein died by suicide in a federal jail in Manhattan in 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

The Trump administration, for months, has faced criticism, including by some Republican allies in Congress, for its reneging on promises by Bondi and FBI officials to release the Epstein files.

Some supporters of Trump have refused to believe there was no Epstein client list, which they suspect was a list of powerful or wealthy men who had sexual contact with girls and young women under his control, making those men vulnerable to blackmail or other pressure.

Trump had been friends with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell for years before the two men fell out in the mid-2000s.

Maxwell was convicted in 2022 at a federal trial in New York of charges related to procuring and grooming underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

On Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear Maxwell's appeal of that conviction.

Tesla announced a new version of its full self-driving supervised technology Tuesday morning, but investors are looking for something bigger.

Over the weekend, Elon Musk's company shared a teaser clip featuring a logo-emblazoned, spinning component that could be anything from a wheel cover to a fan or turbine. The clip ended with the numbers "10/7," indicating Tuesday's date for the reveal.

Tesla posted a second clip to X on Sunday showing the outline of a vehicle's headlights in the dark.

Shares climbed 5% Monday as the buzz grew online over what the announcement would be.

Investors expect a reveal of Tesla's stripped-down, lower-cost Model Y,  but are also hoping for updates on the next-generation Roadster that Musk has promised for years.

Or it could be something else.

The company hasn't released a new model vehicle for sale since it began shipping the Cybertruck, its angular unpainted steel pickup, in late 2023.

Musk originally promoted the Cybertruck at an "unveiling" event in 2019, where his demo went awry and he shattered a window. The Cybertuck never achieved the level of popularity of Tesla's Model 3 sedan or Model Y SUVs and has been the subject of at least eight voluntary recalls in the U.S.

With its auto sales in a multi-quarter slump, Tesla has been trying to shift investor attention to its future as a robotics and self-driving car business.

The slump has resulted, in part, from a consumer backlash against Musk, his endorsements of far-right political parties and figures, and his incendiary political rhetoric. But it's also due to an aging lineup and increased competition from companies including Volkswagen and BYD.

In mid-October of last year, Tesla held its invitation-only, "We, Robot" event in Hollywood, where it showed off a low, two-seater Cybercab concept with no steering wheels or pedals. Musk said the driverless car would cost about $30,000.

As of the company's second-quarter earnings call, it was not yet in production.

At an event in late 2017, Musk promised Tesla would make a next-generation Roadster, but the vehicle has never moved into production. In 2021, Musk promised the Roadster would be able to "fly," and last year he said the elusive sports car was being redesigned in collaboration with SpaceX, his aerospace and defense contractor.

Musk has been promising to turn existing Tesla EVs into robotaxis with a software update for about a decade.

The company currently has human safety drivers in its Robotaxi-branded test and fleet vehicles, unlike robotaxi rivals like Alphabet's Waymo and Baidu's Apollo Go.

In the realm of humanoid robots, Musk has said Tesla's Optimus robots will be capable of factory work or babysitting your kids, but they've yet to hit the market. Meanwhile, competitors like Agility Robotics and Unitree are already selling bipedal, humanoid robots.

Following a brutal first quarter that saw Tesla lose 36% of its value, the stock has been on a tear, jumping 40% in the third quarter. It's now up 12% for the year. That stock price increase was aided by Musk, who purchased about $1 billion of Tesla stock himself in mid-September.

Qualcomm wants to get closer to robot makers.

The company said Tuesday that it's acquiring Arduino, an electronics maker whose inexpensive programmable circuit boards and computers are common in hardware startups and robotics labs for prototyping.

Qualcomm didn't announce a price for the transaction, but said the Italy-based company would become an independent subsidiary.

The deal gives Qualcomm direct access to the tinkerers, hobbyists and companies at the lowest levels of the robotics industry. Arduino products can't be used to build commercial products but, with chips preinstalled, they're popular for testing out a new idea or proving a concept.

Qualcomm hopes that Arduino can help it gain loyalty and legitimacy among startups and builders as robots and other devices increasingly need more powerful chips for artificial intelligence. When some of those experiments become products, Qualcomm wants to sell them its chips commercially.

"You start to move towards prototyping, proof of concepts, and once you're ready, you can go commercial, which is something we are obviously very familiar with," said Nakul Duggal, Qualcomm's general manager for automotive, industrial, and embedded Internet of Things, or IoT, in an interview.

Qualcomm is also seeking to diversify its revenue away from a concentration in mobile chips and modems as the smartphone market stalls and as Apple starts to move to its own modem chips.

Still, in the most recent quarter, Qualcomm's IoT business, which includes many of its current chips that can be used for industrial or robotics products, and its automotive business accounted for a combined 30% of overall revenue from chip sales.

To date, it's been difficult for smaller developers to get access to Qualcomm chips because they typically get sold in large quantities to established enterprises. Rival Nvidia, however, has sold developer kits for its robot chips that can be directly purchased from retailers for as little as $249, and has said that robotics is the company's biggest growth opportunity after AI.

Duggal said Qualcomm purchased two other companies in the past year, Foundries.io and Edge Impulse, in an effort to become more essential to robotics developers. He added that Qualcomm hopes to eventually help power humanoid robots, which are similar to self-driving cars in how much AI computing power they require.

Tuesday's announcement said Arduino will, for the first time, release a board with a Qualcomm chip. It's called the Uno Q and, priced at $45 to $55, comes equipped with a Qualcomm Dragonwing QRB2210 processor.

Qualcomm's chip can run Linux, along with Arduino software, and can even do computer vision, which deciphers what a camera sees and translates it into software.

Current Arduino boards, which use lighter processors called microcontrollers, aren't powerful enough to do a lot of cutting-edge AI. Those boards use chips from companies including STMicroelectronics, Renesas Electronics, Microchip and NXP Semiconductors. Qualcomm will continue to sell those chips through Arduino.

That's part of Qualcomm's plan to not make any significant changes to Arduino's operations, management or its developer community.

"My success criteria is that the Arduino ecosystem doesn't even feel that there is any change in ownership here," Duggal said.

Shares of Dell Technologies climbed 5% Tuesday after the company increased its long-term revenue and profit growth expectations in a meeting with analysts.

The computer maker said it now expects annual revenue to expand between 7% and 9%, an increase from its prior forecast of 3% to 4%.

For the full year, it now expects diluted earnings per share to grow at least 15%, compared with its previous expectations for growth of 8% or higher. 

Dell said it was raising its guidance as it capitalizes on "the unprecedented pace of change in technology," particularly in artificial intelligence. 

"Customers are hungry for AI and the compute, storage and networking we provide to deploy intelligence at scale," CEO Michael Dell said in a statement. "We're successfully translating that demand into growth and strong cash flow that we've largely returned to shareholders."

The company added that its engineering, deployment, ecosystem and other services "position it as the AI infrastructure solutions leader."

Dell also reiterated its third-quarter and fiscal 2026 forecasts. The company said in its latest earnings report in August that it plans to ship $20 billion of AI servers in its fiscal 2026, double what it sold last year.

Dell is one of Nvidia's key customers. Dell buys chips from the AI leader and builds computers around them, which it sells to end-users such as CoreWeave, a cloud service, and Elon Musk's AI startup xAI.

Rivian made a name for itself when it unveiled one of the first electric pickup trucks, the R1T, in 2018. It followed that up with an SUV built off the same platform, the R1S, and has since built a passionate fan base around a brand that celebrates adventure and the outdoors.

Now it's preparing for its next chapter with the R2, a smaller spin on the R1S SUV, and the R3, a rally-inspired hatchback.

"A lot of people were surprised on R3" Rivian Chief Design Officer Jeff Hammoud told CNBC. "It's not something that I think a lot of people would have guessed that Rivian would have done … and that was the key thing we were trying to show, we're not pigeonholed to one form factor." 

The new vehicles, which were unveiled in March of last year, are part of Rivian's strategy to reach a broader market for its electric vehicles, which currently start upwards of $70,000. 

The R2, which the company says will start around $45,000, is expected to go into production by the end of this year at the company's Normal, Illinois, manufacturing facility. 

"While R1 was designed through addition, we had to look at R2 through subtraction," Hammoud said. "What are the things we can remove or take away, but still keep the ethos of the product and the brand?"

The R2 and R3 are coming on the heels of a tough time for the automaker. 

Weak demand, higher costs and the U.S. cancelling the EV credit could spell trouble for Rivian. But that hasn't stopped the company from breaking ground on a new $5 billion factory in Georgia, where the next generation vehicles will be built.

"We're first launching R2 at our facility in Illinois, but this is really the site where we'll scale global production. We're building this into a 400,000 unit plant," Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC's Phil LeBeau at the plant's construction site in September.

CNBC got rare access inside Rivian's design lab in Irvine, California, to see how the company shapes its distinctive vehicles. We see how the EV maker approaches design for its adventure-driven EV lineup, which includes the backstory on how it conceived its iconic headlights, a choice that provoked mixed reactions when first unveiled.

"They were controversial," recalls John Voelcker, contributing editor at Car and Driver. "It took a while for people to get over it. I think it was smart in that it's harder to make your truck distinctive. So a front end that immediately is like no one else is probably a good thing."

Watch the video to learn about Rivian's approach to design and its plans to expand its brand of adventure-themed EVs.

Employment growth was essentially flat in September, according to data from investment giant Carlyle that seeks to fill in data gaps created by the government shutdown.

The firm said its proprietary data showed job growth of just 17,000 for the month, which would be even less than the 22,000 gain in August reflected in Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

With the BLS shuttered and data releases suspended until the impasse between congressional Republicans and Democrats is resolved, Wall Street firms are rushing to provide alternative measures to paint a picture of where the U.S. economy is heading.

Carlyle's data jibes somewhat with other releases showing little hiring growth.

Last week, payrolls processing firm ADP reported a loss of 32,000 jobs in the private sector, though that included a reduction stemming from adjustments to BLS revisions.

Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported last week that while layoffs declined in September, the level of planned hiring for firms hit its lowest since 2009, when the economy was still feeling the impact from the global financial crisis.

To be sure, while Carlyle's data showed anemic payroll gains, other economic indicators painted a brighter picture.

The firm said underlying gross domestic product growth was running at a 2.7% annualized pace in September while business investment accelerated 4.8% on a three-month average annual rate. Carlyle also reported that consumer prices for energy declined 3.8% while services excluding shelter, a key Federal Reserve data point, rose 3.3%.

Carlyle said it derived its data from its "expansive global portfolio" that includes 277 companies, 694 real estate investments and 730,000 employees.

Though the firm saw weaker employment data, Goldman Sachs recently said its "underlying job growth" tracker indicated a gain of 80,000 positions in September. Goldman also reported that the labor market is loosening, meaning there are more workers than jobs, to levels not seen in 10 years.

A New York Fed survey released Monday indicated ongoing concern with the state of the labor market.

The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations for September showed that the share of those expecting the unemployment rate to be higher a year from now rose to 41.1%, up 2 percentage points from the prior month. Also, the mean probability of losing one's job in the next year increased to 14.9%, up 0.4 percentage point.

However, the perceived probability of being able to find a job in three months after losing one's current position rose to 47.4%, up from a series low 44.9% in August.

Shares of New York Stock Exchange parent, Intercontinental Exchange, rose more than 1% after the company announced it took a $2 billion stake in prediction markets platform Polymarket.

The deal values Polymarket at approximately $8 billion, both companies said in a release.

"There are opportunities across markets which ICE together with Polymarket can uniquely serve and we are excited about where this investment can take us," Intercontinental Exchange CEO Jeffrey Sprecher said in a statement.

The deal comes as prediction markets become more mainstream, with Polymarket rival Kalshi enjoying sharp trading volume increases thanks to the implementation of sports-related contracts. Prediction markets industry revenue may climb to $8 billion by 2030 as it takes market share from the sports gambling industry, according to analysis by Piper Sandler.

Polymarket, earlier this year, also secured an investment from 1789 Capital, which is backed by Donald Trump Jr. The company was also greenlit last month to launch in the U.S.

Polymarket founder and CEO Shayne Coplan wrote that," by combining ICE's institutional scale and credibility with Polymarket's consumer savvy, we will be able to deliver world-class products for the modern investor."

The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

"My first strike was January 28th, 2013, at 6:49 in the morning," Tanner Yackley told Business Insider's Maggie Cai in a recent interview. "It ended up being a cave in the middle of nowhere, and there was a handful of people there that they wanted us to take out," he said.

Yackley enlisted in the US Air Force in 2010 at age 18 and was discharged in 2018. See an extended interview with him for BI's video series "Authorized Account" below:

Recalling that first strike, he said, "Every thought that was going through my mind was all about the technical aspects of the employment, you know, of shooting that weapon. There wasn't much as far as being able to stop and think, 'Wow, I'm about to take a life.'"

During his time in the Air Force, Yackley said he logged over 3,000 combat hours as a drone sensor operator. Based in the US as a staff sergeant, he spent most of his time controlling drones on the other side of the world through real-time video footage on a screen.

People often have this misconception that the job is similar to a video game, but nothing could be further from the truth, Yackley said.

"You're making life or death calls every single day," he said, adding that, "There's not a single game in the world that can prep you for what you're going to do, and the decisions that you're going to have to make, and the high-caliber level that you're going to have to operate at."

"Back in 2013, I didn't have a clue what it was doing or how it was changing me," Yackley said.

The US Air Force did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

After years on the job, Yackley was burned out. "At that point, my body was just tapped, and I couldn't do that work anymore."

It wasn't just the nature of the work that took a toll; it was also the demanding schedule. Yackley was on a team that worked 24 hours around the clock, divided into three groups, each working 8-hour shifts.

To ensure that no one group was on the midnight shift for too long, each group rotated to a new shift every seven weeks. Yackley was on this rotating shift schedule for years.

"The shift work in itself was just grueling," Yackley said. He started to recognize when he was about to rotate to a new shift. "I would start staying up later and later and later," he said, which disrupted his sleeping patterns and ability to get a full night's rest.

An estimated 64.3% of active-duty servicemembers do not get the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, according to the DOD's most recently available Health Related Behaviors Survey, published in 2018. And studies have found that sleep deprivation increases the risk of PTSD, which Yackley said he has.

"To be frank, being a drone operator, you know, it's taken a toll on me in my life, and my family, my relationships," Yackley said.

"It's difficult for me to maintain relationships. It's difficult for me to maintain friend circles. It's difficult for me to talk to family about it, because unless somebody actually sat in that box and did the job, they don't understand. They can try to, but most of the time it ends up doing more harm than good — trying to relate to it instead of just being supportive in the moment," he added.

In May, Yackley founded the organization Remote Warrior to help spread awareness about drone operators' mental health.

Yackley said that he never disagreed with an order and that he's proud of the work he did. "They were still targets at the end of the day. They were still doing bad things."

A stated goal of President Donald Trump's ambitious tariff policy was to reduce the United States' trade deficits around the world, but at least one has ballooned this year: the travel trade deficit.

A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more goods and services than it exports. When it comes to travel, that means when Americans are spending more money on travel abroad than international visitors are spending in the United States.

According to the US Travel Association's travel forecast released last week, the travel trade deficit for 2025 was on track to be nearly $70 billion, as international visitors have pulled back on visiting the United States.

Travel is a major export for the United States. While exports are often thought of as physical products that are shipped abroad, such as crude oil or cars, they also include services produced domestically and consumed by foreigners. For instance, a French national's five-night stay at a hotel in New York is considered a service export, since it brings money into the country from a non-resident.

Historically, the industry has produced a trade surplus, meaning that foreigners spent more visiting the United States than Americans spent abroad on travel. But at the same time that international inbound travel has declined, the number of Americans traveling abroad has continued to increase.

In April, after international travel to the United States experienced a decline, the US Travel Association said the country was running at a $50 billion travel trade deficit, marking "a sharp reversal from our historical surplus in travel exports." In 2022, the United States had a $3.5 billion travel trade surplus, according to data from the US Department of Commerce.

The recent US Travel Association's travel forecast also said the number of international arrivals to the United States was expected to decline by 6.3% in 2025 compared to 2024, marking the first decline in inbound travel since 2020. Visitor spending was expected to decline by 3.2%.

The US Travel Association said the decline in visitors from Canada was the primary driver of the decrease. Some Canadians began boycotting travel to the United States earlier this year in response to Trump's tariffs and comments about making the neighbor to the north the 51st state.

In August, the number of Canadians returning to the country from the United States by car was down nearly 34% compared to the same month a year prior, according to data from the Canadian government. United States border towns and business owners recently told Business Insider they are feeling the economic impact of fewer Canadian visitors.

There are a couple of major travel events coming up next year that could help reverse the decline in international visitors to the United States: the FIFA World Cup and celebrations for America's 250th birthday. The US Travel Association said it expects international visitation to resume growth as a result of these events.

However, it also said the United States is at risk of further deterring international visitors due to "potential increases in visa fees, extended wait times for visa applications and renewals, and negative sentiment towards the U.S. in key markets."

In this article

Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged more than 225% on Tuesday, shortly after the White House said it would take a 10% stake in the Canadian company.

The White House on Monday announced a partnership with Trilogy Metals as part of a push to unlock domestic supplies of copper and other critical minerals in the Ambler mining district in Alaska.

The partnership included a $35.6 million investment, which makes the U.S. government a 10% shareholder in Trilogy Metals.

Trilogy Metals welcomed Trump's decision to grant permits to enable the development of critical minerals in Alaska, saying the Ambler mining district is "home to some of the world's richest known copper-dominant polymetallic deposits."

The company said in a statement that Trump's order, which reverses the Biden administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, "reflects a renewed federal commitment to responsible resource development in Alaska and highlights the Ambler Road as critical infrastructure under federal policy."

It added that the move would help to secure domestic supply chains for minerals including copper, cobalt, zinc and lead, highlighting the importance of these resources in energy infrastructure, defense technologies and manufacturing.

Opponents of the long-debated Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road through the Alaskan wilderness, have said it will harm landscapes that support local communities and wildlife.

China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, producing nearly 70% of the world's supply of rare earths from mines and processing almost 90%, which means it is importing these materials from other countries and refining them.

Western officials have repeatedly flagged Beijing's supply chain dominance as a strategic challenge, particularly given that critical mineral demand is expected to grow exponentially, as the clean energy transition picks up pace.

When Sriram Krishnan, a senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, appeared onstage at an event in Washington last month, he listed the Trump administration's priorities for advancing the AI revolution.

At the top of the list? More construction.

"Let's make sure we build our infrastructure," Krishnan said. "'Build, baby, build' is what we tell people."

That rallying cry is echoing across Silicon Valley. Executives at Meta say they expect to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure, including massive data centers, through 2028. OpenAI and Oracle have announced plans to put $500 billion into a data center project dubbed Stargate, while Amazon plans to spend more than $30 billion on capital expenditures, or capex, in each of the next two quarters.

The problem: The business case for AI remains untested, and it's unclear whether the revenue from AI products will justify the ever-growing spending. If it does, it could push the economy onto a higher growth curve and transform entire industries. If it doesn't, the fallout could reshape the economy — from stock market crashes to communities left with vast, vacant data centers.

Earlier this year, Business Insider published an investigation into the data center industry, creating the most comprehensive map to date of where data centers are in the US. The investigation found 1,240 data centers in America already built or approved for construction at the end of 2024, an almost fourfold increase since 2010. The data didn't include any projects that received permits this year.

This year, four of the five biggest energy users from our tally, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google, could spend an estimated $320 billion on capex, primarily for AI infrastructure, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. That's more than the GDP of Finland and just shy of the total revenue ExxonMobil earned in 2024.

The scale of the investment is sparking concerns about a bubble and the potential for a pop that could bring the stock market crashing down from record heights.

So far, the concerns haven't spooked investors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 19% this year, with Nvidia, the world's largest company by market capitalization, Google, and Microsoft all up more than 25%. Oracle has seen its stock rise 75% this year.

The money spent this year on AI infrastructure and software has contributed more to GDP growth than consumer spending, according to Renaissance Macro Research's reading of Bureau of Economic Analysis data.

It's a construction boom unlike any in living memory, transforming landscapes, drawing on scarce water resources, and taxing America's already strained electricity grid. The sheer ambition has drawn comparisons to the Apollo space program, the interstate highway system of the mid-1900s, and the fiber-optic bust around the turn of this century that left miles of "dark fiber."

Sarah Friar, OpenAI's finance chief, recently underscored the size of the industry's goals, when she spoke on the sidelines of a Goldman Sachs conference in September. AI spending, she said, wasn't like the 19th-century railroad system — it was like the early days of it.

"A lot of people have compared the AI era to things like the railway build-out, because it is a very capital-intensive build-out," Friar told Yahoo Finance. "I think we are just beginning. We've maybe laid some track from New York to Baltimore, but we're ultimately going to blanket the US, and ultimately blanket the world."

If the bet pays off, the returns could make the money sunk into data centers seem small. The data-center boom would become the foundation of the next tech cycle, letting Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and others rent out intelligence the way they rent cloud storage now. AI agents and custom models could form the basis of steady, high-margin subscription products.

If it doesn't pay off? Look no further than the railroads. Overinvestment in rail lines, including the Transcontinental Railroad, sparked not one but two banking crises in the latter half of the 1800s. The industry struggled with overspending, eventually leaving investors and the banks that had backed them with heavy losses.

Despite the investment, the business case for AI is still untested.

The AI infrastructure boom is built on a fundamental assumption about how machines learn best. The approach involves feeding massive amounts of data into large language models, which then look for patterns, or signals, buried in the noise. To improve, the theory goes, the models must ingest and analyze increasing amounts of data, which requires more and more computing power.

That need for scale has shaped the competitive landscape. If better models depend on more computing power, the obvious next step is to secure as much of it as possible. And that means more data centers — large warehouses filled with graphics processing units, or GPUs, that handle the complex computations required.

In a recent blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman imagined what might be possible if AI systems had virtually unlimited computing power. AI could cure cancer or give every student on Earth a personalized tutor. "If we are limited by compute," he wrote, "we'll have to choose which one to prioritize; no one wants to make that choice, so let's go build."

Gary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus of psychology and neural science and a vocal critic of Silicon Valley's approach to developing AI, has argued against the strategy that building bigger is better. Marcus has repeatedly argued that the fundamental theory driving Big Tech companies to build computing capacity, the scaling laws, is wrong.

"The meaning of the word scaling has been greatly devalued," Marcus wrote. "'Scaling' used to mean 'I can predict pretty much exactly how well a given LLM will do, by knowing the size of its database and the amount of compute being used to train it, and those increases will be exponential." Not anymore, he wrote.

OpenAI's August launch of GPT-5, its latest model, underscored Marcus' skepticism, as many perceived it as an incremental step and a challenge to the idea that adding more computing power makes better models. The leading language models still make simple mistakes, or hallucinations, that hurt their reliability. The problem persists even as companies have poured exponentially more computing power into training them, according to Bain & Company.

Big-spending corporations have yet to show meaningful results aided by AI, several studies have concluded. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a report this summer suggesting 95% of early corporate AI initiatives had yet to deliver a return. Tech stocks briefly slumped on the report, among other reasons.

Researchers at BetterUp Labs and the Stanford Social Media Lab coined the term "workslop" to describe the substandard AI-assisted product that more and more employees are producing. Because the models still lack accuracy and nuance, the task of fact-checking and cleaning the output falls to colleagues. Writing in the Harvard Business Review, the researchers said 40% of the 1,150 workers they surveyed reported having received "workslop" from colleagues over the past month.

With its utility still in question, it's not clear when or if the revenue to come from AI products will justify its spending. Bain estimates that by 2030, annual capex spending will be $500 billion to meet the industry's computing needs. To justify that, companies would need to generate $2 trillion in annual revenue, Bain said. That's about $800 billion more than companies can save by using AI to make sales, marketing, customer support, and R&D more efficient. In other words, the consulting firm concluded, the industry will come up short unless it can find new products or services to sell.

In September, Friar, OpenAI's CFO, said the company will triple revenue this year to about $13 billion. That same month, the company agreed to pay Oracle an average of $60 billion a year for data center capacity — nearly five times more than it expects to bring in.

McKinsey & Company acknowledged, in an April report about capex spending, the difficult position the industry is in: Spend too little and risk missing out on a technology that may be one of the most transformative in history. Spend too much and risk wasting tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.

"The stakes are high," McKinsey wrote in the report. "Overinvesting in data center infrastructure risks stranding assets, while underinvesting means falling behind."

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it more bluntly when he admitted how much money he was prepared to waste to win the AI arms race. "If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate," Zuckerberg told a podcast interviewer. At the same time, he underscored the risk of losing out if productive AI usage gains traction.

"I actually think the risk is higher on the other side," he said.

A quarter of a century ago, a similar pattern emerged when firms rushed to lay the backbone of the emerging internet. Companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing spent tens of billions of dollars in the five years through 2001 laying fiber optic cables and installing other networking capabilities, only to crash the following year when the dot-com bust led lenders who had financed the construction to demand their money.

Shareholders in the companies leading the fiber-optic build-out lost $2 trillion in value, while 500,000 workers lost their jobs, according to analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution. While the fiber optic cable was eventually put to use, largely by the streaming video revolution pioneered by Netflix, many of the companies that laid it weren't around to see it.

Like fiber optic cables and the railroads of an earlier era, data center construction and the purchase of GPUs are being financed by Wall Street.

Some of the money is coming through familiar channels. Oracle recently sold $18 billion worth of bonds to finance its data center expansion plans, while data center upstart CoreWeave, which went public in March, has tapped the public debt and equity markets to the tune of $25 billion since last year to fund its own expansion.

Increasingly, companies are also turning to less traditional lenders. Meta recently raised $29 billion for its latest data center project from firms including the Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. The deal allowed Meta to raise billions without having to report the full amount on its balance sheet.

When Meta CFO Susan Li was asked about the company's plans for non-traditional financing methods at a recent conference, she said the company had built its own data centers for most of its history. Now, she said, as "the ambition of our infrastructure capacity unfolds ahead of us, it kind of dwarfs what we've built before, and we need to be sort of more expansive in the way that we are thinking about this."

Other data center developers are using the securitized bond markets to keep the boom going. Once a project is built and leased, they're turning the leasing revenue into bonds and selling to investors eager to be part of the AI boom. That frees up more money to put into future projects and fuels the spending, even if demand for mature data center projects starts to wane, said Paul Kedrosky, a financial blogger and advisor to hedge funds who recently wrote about the development.

"Developers build data centers, lease access to hyperscalers, and then package the rental income into bonds. Proceeds are recycled into the next round of construction," Kedrosky wrote on his website. "In short: the structured-credit world, not the real estate equity one, now finances the data-center boom."

Increasingly, Silicon Valley itself is helping to finance the boom. In September, Nvidia agreed to invest $100 billion into OpenAI to help with its data center build-out, with the expectation that OpenAI would turn around and use the money to purchase Nvidia's GPUs for its data centers. Microsoft invested in OpenAI early, and OpenAI used the money to rent out Microsoft's computing capacity. On Monday, chipmaker AMD announced that OpenAI has agreed to buy GPUs to power as many as 6 gigawatts of computing capacity in return for a warrant that would give OpenAI a 10% stake in the chipmaker if it hits certain milestones.

"This partnership is a major step in building the compute capacity needed to realize AI's full potential," Altman said in the statement announcing the deal.

The circular flow of money is yet another element of the AI infrastructure bet that underscores its scale, as well as its risks. If the hype around AI proves fleeting — if more computing power doesn't equate to better models, or the industry can't find more ways to make more money — the interlocking investments could magnify the fallout.

Even proponents of AI say the math is daunting.

"We are bullish on this in a big way," said David Crawford, the chairman of Bain's technology practice. "The point we were trying to make is that it's expensive."

A favorite adage of economists, market watchers, and financial journalists alike is that the American consumer is the engine of the US economy. If spending is not slowing, the thinking goes, the economy and labor market will be fine. It's true that consumer spending represents a significant share of the economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of the country's GDP.

The truism is inspiring optimism about the economy's current trajectory, given the recent strength of retail sales and other data on how people are spending their money. I think the causality here is backward. A consumer slowdown is never the precipitating cause of an economic slump. Usually, consumption falls after employment materially cracks. When Americans stop spending, by that time, it's already too late.

While Americans continue to spend their way through their troubles, it may not prevent an economic slump from taking hold.

The notion that consumer spending can save the country from a recession contradicts several historical trends. For starters, consumption has managed to grow modestly in previous economic slumps. In several of the post-World War II recessions — 1948, 1970, 1982, and 2001 — real consumption expanded during the downturn. In other words, during those recessions, the best that spending could do was to help economic conditions from deteriorating further, cushioning the blow rather than preventing it altogether. In other periods of negative growth, consumption declined substantially, so that on average, its contribution to GDP during recessions is close to zero.

Next, consumption has never declined before an economic slump; it's always happened after the economy began to go into the tank. Therefore, the growth in recent quarters does not look especially unusual. Assuming tracking estimates for the current quarter end up in the ballpark, average annualized growth in real consumer spending is expected to run at about 2.2% in the first two quarters of 2025. This is slightly slower than consumption growth in the two-quarter period preceding each of the last three recessions, but it's hardly out of the ordinary.

Let's deepen this analysis by breaking out the various types of major spending: durable goods, such as washing machines and TVs; nondurable goods like T-shirts and groceries; and services, encompassing everything from restaurants to movie tickets. Prior to previous recessions, the most common signal from these categories was Americans cutting back on big-ticket durables rather than cutting spending in service industries. As our figure shows, going back over the past 11 cycles, people decreased their expenditures on durable goods in the two quarters preceding the recession just over half the time. And during recessions, durable goods spending tends to fall while spending on services holds up. So far this year, spending on durables has been about flat. At the very least, this suggests a degree of caution among Americans when it comes to making big-ticket spending decisions that could portend more trouble coming down the line.

One confounding variable, of course, is the degree to which President Donald Trump's herky-jerky tariff announcements are influencing the data, creating a push and pull in consumer behavior regarding durables. The threat of tariffs may have prompted people to pull forward activity, making big purchases before anticipated price hikes, while the hope for tariff removals might cause consumers to wait it out. On the other hand, the big story in the first half of this year has been the slowing of services spending, which is likely less sensitive to tariff news. This suggests that if you're waiting for the consumer to make a call about a turn in the business cycle, you're likely waiting too long. The recession red light is already lit by the time consumption contracts, and sometimes it does not fall at all.

The better indicator to watch, if you were trying to anticipate a recession, is the labor market. While consumer spending has been doing quite well in recent years, the job market has been cooling. In 2023 and 2024, real personal consumption expenditures expanded 3.0% and 3.1%, respectively. Despite this, the unemployment rate rose by 0.3 percentage points in each of those two years. So far this year, the unemployment rate is on track to increase by another 0.3 percentage points.

Key areas of the jobs market appear to be slowing. First, the bulk of recent job growth has been in industries that are not correlated with the economic cycle, such as healthcare. And even in those still-expanding sectors, growth has been slowing lately. If that trend continues, it's hard to see what other industries will be able to pick up the slack. Second, areas of the job market that follow the ups and downs of the broader economy — specifically, goods-producing jobs — have already been contracting. Third, despite "loose" financial conditions, such as a rising stock market and falling interest rates, which are generally thought to be supportive of hiring, labor markets have now reached a point where the level of unemployment exceeds the number of job vacancies.

If consumption is the end-all and be-all of employment ("sell more stuff, hire more people"), why has the labor market slowed to begin with? There are clearly other areas of the economy that determine the strength in the labor market than just consumption.

The state of business investment is another reliable indicator of a recession. During a recession, nonresidential business investment — which excludes spending on homebuilding — always contracts, while residential investment almost always declines (2001 was the lone exception). Moreover, in the two quarters before a recession, the contribution of residential investment to GDP growth is negative (again, with the recession that followed the 2001 tech bubble being an exception) while the contribution of nonresidential business investment tends to be positive. To the extent any one sector provides a tell, it's the homebuilders. And, bad news, residential investment has been contracting for five of the last six quarters.

When it comes to the drop in homebuilding investment, there is some possibility of a false signal. In fact, this is not the first time residential investment has declined in the post-COVID era. In 2022, as an example, there was a notable decline in residential investment. However, there are some important distinctions between then and now that make this current decrease more concerning.

There are reasons to assume that the slowdown in residential construction might matter a little more for the broader outlook than it did before. Indeed, a crude analysis suggests that more layoffs could be on the way for residential construction jobs. As of August 2025, the ratio of people employed in residential construction to housing permits stands at 2.5, the highest level since 2012. This ratio is about 10% higher than its average in 2024, meaning there is likely a large pool of construction workers waiting around to do something. There's no need to hold onto workers who are not doing anything. To return this ratio to its 2024 average, assuming the number of new monthly permits issued stays steady, implies a decline of 304,000 jobs. Spreading this over the year implies a decline of 25,000 jobs a month. Even if this is even half-right, it's still a significant headwind, considering private employment is running at just 30,000 a month to begin with.

In my client meetings, the pushback to these concerns typically goes like this: AI is booming, stocks are up, and wealthy consumers are still doing well. I really believe those three bright spots are, at their core, a single story. And even as this asset-driven boom has marched on, that has not kept broader labor market conditions from continuing to worsen. So, if you're banking on the consumer to simply hold everything up, you might be late to catch a more material slowdown in the economy. It's better to be prepared than surprised.

Strava and Garmin are having a fallout, and athletes on TikTok are not happy about "mum and dad fighting."

Strava, a San Francisco-based fitness tracking app, filed a lawsuit against tech company Garmin in a Colorado court on September 30, accusing the latter of patent infringement and a breach of contract.

Social media has not taken the fallout well. Athletes on TikTok have posted videos about how "mum and dad are fighting," referring to how two of the biggest names in the fitness sphere have clashed, and how it might impact their user experience.

Holly Brooks, an LA-based fitness influencer, joked that while the internet was invested in the Taylor Swift-Charlie XCX drama, from Swift's newly released album, "there's other drama going on on the internet."

"Mum and Dad are fighting — Strava and Garmin have fallen out," she said in her video, which has been viewed more than half a million times as of press time.

If they go through, changes to Garmin and Strava's partnerships will come at an inconvenient time. Some of the country's biggest races, such as the November New York City Marathon, are scheduled in the fall.

The turnout for these races is huge. The 2024 NYC marathon drew over 55,500 participants.

"If, like me, you run with a Garmin but you track everything on Strava, you will no longer be able to do that," Brooks said. "You'll be forced to use the Garmin app, because they're not going to connect anymore."

"Strava and Garmin please kiss and make up," she added in the caption of her TikTok.

Another TikTok user, Rebecca, who posts videos of her runs, also commented on the Strava-Garmin dispute.

"When Garmin is going to stop uploading data to Strava on November 1st and that's literally the date of your marathon you've been training for your big PR for," she wrote in the caption of her video, which has over 600,000 views as of press time.

In the lawsuit, Strava's lawyers said Garmin, which makes fitness watches and wearables, developed heatmap tracking services that rivaled its own, violating a 2015 "Master Cooperation Agreement" between the two companies.

In a Reddit post on October 2, Strava's product chief, Matt Salazar, also commented on Garmin's new guidelines, which note that apps using Garmin device-sourced data must display the tech company's logo clearly.

He said Garmin had given Strava until November 1 to comply with its new guidelines, or risk "stopping all Garmin activities from being uploaded to Strava."

"We consider this blatant advertising. These new guidelines actively degrade your user experience on Strava," Salazar said in the Reddit post.

Garmin, a Kansas-based corporation, saw its stock price rise by over 50% in the past year.

In the second quarter of 2025, it reported revenues of $1.81 billion, a 20% increase from the same period the year before. Of this, $605 million came from sales of fitness products.

Strava, a private company, has 150 million users in more than 185 countries, per its website. It works on a freemium model, providing basic features for free and charging for advanced features like route suggestion and training plans.

Representatives for Strava and Garmin did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

BEIJING — The World Bank on Tuesday raised its 2025 growth forecast for China as part of an overall boost in projections for East Asia and the Pacific, after a summer that saw U.S. tariff-led uncertainty rock the global economy.

The World Bank now projects China's economy to expand by 4.8%, compared with 4% predicted in April. The new forecast is closer to China's official target of around 5% growth in gross domestic product in 2025.

The economists did not provide a specific reason for the change in forecast from April, but noted that China's economy has benefited from government support that could fade next year.

Trade tensions between China and the U.S. escalated in April, temporarily sending U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports to well over 100% before the two countries reached a trade truce — now in effect until mid-November. For now, U.S. tariffs on China are 57.6%, more than double where they were at the start of the year.

China ramped up stimulus in late 2024 and has maintained targeted consumer trade-in programs this year to support retail sales. The country's exports, a major driver of its growth, have continued to rise so far this year, as shipments to Southeast Asia and Europe have offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. Businesses ramping up orders ahead of higher tariffs have also helped support China's exports.

Growth in exports helped China offset drags on domestic growth such as the ongoing real estate slump and tepid consumer spending. But that momentum is expected to slow.

The World Bank projects China's GDP growth to ease to 4.2% in 2026, partly due to slower exports growth. Economists also anticipate that Beijing will tone down stimulus to keep public debt levels from rising too quickly, while China's overall economic growth slows compared with its rapid expansion in past years.

China's retail sales rose just 3.4% in August from a year ago, missing analysts' expectations. Investment in real estate fell further, down by 12.9% for the first eight months of the year, versus a 12% drop for the first seven months.

Preliminary figures for the eight-day "Golden Week" holiday that wraps up Wednesday also pointed to sluggish consumer spending.

While average daily domestic passenger trips rose 5.4% year-on-year to 296 million for the Oct. 1 to 5 period, that growth was much slower than the 7.9% seen during the May 1 to 5 public holiday, Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report Monday, citing official data.

"Actual consumption growth could be even weaker than the data suggest," Lu said, noting that due to the agrarian calendar, this year's Golden Week combined what have typically been two public holidays.

Oct. 1 is China's National Day, while a traditional Mid-Autumn Festival fell on Oct. 6 this year, versus Sept. 17 last year. As a result, China's Golden Week ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year, versus Oct. 1 to 7 last year.

The economists pointed out that one out of every seven young people in China is unemployed, while the country faces challenges from technological disruption and an aging population. The World Bank also noted that startups in China only increase employment fourfold, versus sevenfold in the U.S., highlighting that a differentiating factor was the presence of state-owned enterprises in China versus North America.

A decline in China's GDP by 1 percentage point lowers growth in the rest of developing East Asia and Pacific by 0.3 percentage points, according to World Bank estimates. With the China GDP upgrade, the region is expected to expand by 4.8% this year, versus 4% forecast earlier this year, according to the World Bank.

In June, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for 2025 to 2.3%, largely due to trade uncertainty, noting it would be the slowest expansion since 2008, excluding global recessions.

Taylor Swift says her fiancé, Travis Kelce, is a key reason she's not interested in performing at the Super Bowl.

Swift was promoting her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," on "The Tonight Show." She was playing a game where she debunked rumors about herself with host Jimmy Fallon. One such rumor was that Swift had turned down an offer to perform at the halftime show because the National Football League wouldn't let her own the rights to her performance footage.

"Jay-Z has always been very good to me. Our teams are really close. They sometimes will call and say, 'How does she feel about, you know?' And that's not like an official offer or like a conference room conversation," Swift told Fallon in an interview that aired on Monday night.

Jay-Z's entertainment label, Roc Nation, has produced the Super Bowl halftime shows since 2019, when it teamed up with the NFL.

Last month, Roc Nation, the NFL, and Apple Music announced that Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny would headline the next Super Bowl halftime show in February 2026.

Swift said on "The Tonight Show" that the main reason she didn't want to perform was because she wanted to concentrate fully on supporting Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.

Kelce has seen three Super Bowl wins in 2020, 2023, and 2024 with the Kansas City Chiefs.

"We are always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field. That is violent chess, that is gladiators without swords, that is dangerous," Swift said of her team's exchanges with Jay-Z.

Swift announced her engagement to Kelce in August. The couple has been dating since 2023.

"The whole season, I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field. Can you imagine if he's like out there, every single week, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I'm like, 'I wonder what my choreo should be?'" Swift told Fallon.

"This has nothing to do with Travis. He would love for me to do it, I'm just too locked in," she added.

Representatives for Swift and Roc Nation did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Swift has never headlined a Super Bowl halftime show, though multiple media outlets reported that she has turned down offers to do so several times.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in an interview on NBC's "Today" show last month that Swift could "maybe" perform at next year's Super Bowl.

"We would always love to have Taylor play. She is a special, special talent, and obviously she would be welcome at any time," he said.

French President Emmanuel Macron is confronting another massive political headache following the shock resignation of his Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu — after just 27 days in office.

The former defense minister and longtime ally resigned on Monday before he'd even laid out his fledgling government's plans, saying he was unable to lead the center-right minority government after talks with rival parties signalled that they were unwilling to compromise over their respective budget and policy demands.

"Each political party is behaving as if they have their own majority in parliament," Lecornu said, and the "conditions were not fulfilled" to stay in office, according to comments translated by France 24.

The crisis France finds itself in is largely of Macron's making, with the president confidently dissolving parliament last year in order to bring "clarity" to France's divided National Assembly.

The inconclusive elections that followed brought anything but, with both the right and left winning consecutive rounds of voting, leading to a power struggle and political deadlock that has continued ever since. Macron, unwilling to cede government leadership to either side, instead appointed loyalists to lead minority governments but these have proven vulnerable to no-confidence motions from rival parties.

Lecornu's short-lived government was the third to have failed after the ill-fated administrations of Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou. What they have in common is that they've all struggled to reach agreements with other parties over the state budget, and particularly over the spending cuts and tax rises seen as necessary to rein in France's budget deficit of 5.8% of its gross domestic product in 2024.

In a surprise twist on Monday evening, Macron gave Lecornu another 48 hours for "final discussions" with rival parties to try to break the impasse. Lecornu wrote on X that he will report to the president on Wednesday evening on any potential breakthrough "so that he can draw all the necessary conclusions."

Macron now faces the unenviable task of deciding what to do next with no option likely to be attractive to the beleaguered president, who has repeatedly said he would not resign, a move that would trigger a new presidential election that's currently not due to take place until 2027.

He could choose another prime minister — France's sixth in less than two years — but choosing one not from his own political stable will be an uncomfortable and unedifying prospect for Macron, who has repeatedly picked loyalists to lead government in the last year.

Or he can dissolve parliament and hold new parliamentary elections. That option won't appeal either as Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration National Rally party is currently leading voter polls, seen with around 32% of the vote compared to the 25% of the vote being held by left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front.

Macron is seen as unlikely to choose to resign, analysts say. "It's too dangerous for him to do the right thing and he's unwilling, of course, to step down from power," Douglas Yates, professor of Political Science at INSEAD, told CNBC on Monday.

"The one thing I can say with security today is that Macron is not going to announce his own resignation and so it would seem that the easiest thing to do would be to name another prime minister, which he does like I change shirts, and if the new PM doesn't last a long time, he could name another one. And that would be to play his institutional advantage."

Yates did not believe Macron would call fresh elections "because the last time he did that it was so catastrophic" and any new polls would again reflect the polarized nature of politics in France, with a chasm between far left and far right voters. "People would abandon his party and vote with their hearts, either left or right," Yates added.

There is speculation that Macron could take the plunge and nominate a PM who is not an ally from his own centrist political backyard, with a pick from the center-left Socialist Party a possibility.

There is little chance Macron would opt for a candidate from either the far-left France Unbowed party or far-right National Rally, with both parties on Monday calling for Macron's dismissal.

"So far he's chosen the wrong person, and by choosing people from the center, he's alienated the left and the right," Yates said.

"I think he would do better by throwing some fresh meat to the center-left who could help him constitute a government and possibly avoid a motion of censure, so I think a Socialist would probably be the most acceptable, or even one of the Greens' candidates," Yates said.

While political paralysis continues in Paris, the 2026 budget remains in limbo, and economists say it's increasingly likely that this year's budget is rolled into next year as a stop-gap measure.

Deutsche Bank's Yacine Rouimi on Monday said that if the government collapsed, as it has now, then France would likely operate under a special law, "maintaining spending near the 2025 framework, with the deficit landing around 5.0–5.4 % of GDP."

"It's not impossible that we'll see fresh elections soon," Rouimi said.

If Macron does opt to choose a new prime minister from a different party, such as the Socialist Party, that could mean reforms or spending cuts that were tabled by previous administrations, and which failed, could be sliced and slimmed down further.

Macron "may appoint a prime minister from the centre-left (or even the far right). However, this would likely open the door to some painful reversals of his previous pro-growth structural reforms (such as the increase in the pension age) and fiscal slippage," Salomon Fiedler, economisst at Berenberg Bank, noted in emailed comments on Monday.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe says his company has a different view on LiDAR and its relevance to achieving autonomous driving than Tesla.

"Our view is that it's definitely beneficial, and our approach to sensors has been that we need to rapidly build our foundation model as fast as possible," Scaringe told The Verge's "Decoder" podcast in an episode that aired Monday.

Scaringe told guest host and journalist Joanna Stern that there is a "real benefit" and that he "wouldn't rule out" including it in a self-driving vehicle's multi-sensor system.

The debate over LiDAR started during an earlier development period, when the models being run had trouble processing inputs from different sensors and cameras, he added.

"Now, what's happened is that we no longer run the models like that. So the models benefit from the maximum amount of information on the front of the model," Scaringe said.

"The cost of LiDAR used to be tens of thousands of dollars. It's now low, a couple of hundred bucks," he added. "It's a really great sensor that can do things that cameras can't."

Representatives for Scaringe at Rivian did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Scaringe's view differs from that of Elon Musk, who has repeatedly criticized LiDAR systems.

In August, Musk said in an X post that using LiDAR and radar alongside cameras results in "sensor contention."

"This sensor ambiguity causes increased, not decreased, risk. That's why Waymos can't drive on highways," Musk said on X on August 25, referencing the robotaxi service owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet.

Waymo's self-driving vehicles use a multi-sensor system comprising LiDAR, radar, and cameras to perceive their environment.

Tesla is instead betting its hopes on a vision-only system that relies on cameras, Musk said at Tesla's "Autonomy Day" in 2019.

"In cars, it's friggin stupid. It's expensive and unnecessary. Once you solve vision, it's worthless," Musk added.

Scaringe isn't the only auto executive who disagrees with Musk on LiDAR. In June, Ford CEO Jim Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival that LiDAR was "mission critical" for achieving autonomous driving.

Farley said LiDAR would be more effective than cameras when driving in places with bright sunlight. While the camera "will be completely blinded" by the sun, the LiDAR system will still be able to monitor its surroundings, he added.

"People trust Ford, and when you have a brand like Ford, when there's a new technology, you have to be really careful," he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Girik Malik, an applied scientist at Amazon Web Services. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.

When I completed my Ph.D. in AI at Northeastern University in 2023, the AI job market was a world away from the red-hot AI talent war Big Tech companies are waging now.

I secured a job as an applied scientist at Amazon after interning there in the summer of 2022. This was before the company implemented a hiring freeze for the rest of that year.

Today, a top-flight AI researcher with a Ph.D. could see themselves scoring a million-dollar payday from companies like Meta. That said, the road to earning a Ph.D. isn't easy.

It demands lots of discipline and motivation. In fact, during one of my semesters, I was so caught up with coursework and research that I barely had time to eat. I ended up creating a simple stew and eating it week after week for the entire school term. It was just that hard.

That's on top of the time taken. A Ph.D. candidate could spend about five years trying to complete it. That time could have been spent gaining practical experience in the working world.

There's still a lot of value to be gained from getting a Ph.D. in AI.

Of course, you could try to self-learn about the field through on-the-job training. You might even get to build some products yourself. But if you want to shape the future of AI, you need to do a Ph.D.

Going through the process of getting a Ph.D. will make your learning process a lot more structured and precise. That has become very important now, given how competitive AI research has become.

Just 10 to 15 years ago, a small change or tweak to a model would produce different results that could land you in a prestigious journal or an invitation to a high-level conference. That's no longer the case.

The bar has become much higher. You need to conduct more experiments, and you need to demonstrate results that generalize well across a wide variety of problems.

Some believe AI is progressing so rapidly that it may be too late to enter the field through the Ph.D. route. Detractors believe that all the innovations and breakthroughs in AI might be discovered by the time you graduate.

I disagree with that view. A Ph.D. in AI will be just as, if not more, relevant 50 years from now. This is because AI will become ubiquitous in our daily lives. They could be embedded in almost any code we write and the systems around us. You will need more, not fewer, people who can understand and work with AI.

AI systems aren't perfect. Their algorithms might break in the future, and when that happens, you will need people who understand AI at a fundamental level to come in and fix it. That's probably going to be someone who holds a Ph.D. in it.

It's like owning a car. It can be a perfectly nice car, but you will still need to train mechanics to fix it when it breaks down. We didn't stop teaching mechanical and automotive engineering just because we can make better cars. The same goes for AI.

I highly recommend doing internships during the summer breaks in between your Ph.D. studies. This matters even if you intend to stay in academia.

In my case, I did three internships, with the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft, and Amazon. I managed to obtain return offers from Microsoft and Amazon.

The best part about working in the industry is the easy access you get to data and compute.

In a university setting, you are often competing with five to six Ph.D. students to use a computing cluster. And even if you can run your algorithm, it is ultimately based on a limited dataset running on limited hardware. That algorithm may not work if you scale it up.

So take full advantage of those internships. The internships I did forced me to go beyond the textbook and solve complex problems.

One challenge I faced at my first internship at Bosch was getting my neural network to train on a large-scale dataset. For instance, I could have a massive dataset with over 2 million videos. That was at a far larger scale than I was used to at my university.

Dealing with that problem helped give me the skills to solve other infrastructure-related problems I encountered later on in my Ph.D. and my career.

Earning a Ph.D. in AI could open doors for you, but I would caution those pursuing it for the money. If somebody wants to pay you a few million dollars to work at their company, they will screen and filter candidates more aggressively.

If you can sustain that level of motivation for the five to six years it takes to complete your Ph.D., then go for it. I would, however, suggest applying that motivation elsewhere because you could achieve just as much in other areas.

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Katie and Alan Donegan, who retired at 35 and 40, respectively. The couple is originally from the UK and has been nomadic since 2020. The essay has been edited for length and clarity.

Alan: Katie and I retired in 2019 and have been running financial independence workshops around the world since. One of our biggest time commitments is a free 10-week course that we run each year as we travel, teaching people the basics of saving and investing. Katie: When you're on your journey to financial independence and early retirement, there are all these booby traps. Some are set up by companies, and some by society.

Here are five traps we've fallen into ourselves or continue to see people fall for all the time.

Katie: One common mistake people fall into is not making investment decisions themselves. This comes from a fear of getting it wrong and thinking, "I don't know what I'm talking about."

Instead of learning, they just hire professional advisors, which they don't need. It's a double whammy because these advisors charge high fees and also put your money into overly conservative investments like bonds alone.

Alan: Even a 1% fee paid to a professional can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, which means delaying your financial independence. Katie originally invested with a very high-fee advisor. We worked it out later and realized that if we hadn't switched to low-cost index funds, we would be over a million British pounds worse off.

Alan: A lot of people confuse speculation with investing. Investing is buying an asset that creates a return, such as a rental property or a stock from a business that is trading.

Speculation is buying something with the hopes that you can sell it for more later. There is a big trend of buying whiskeys, or people going crazy about buying Lego. They just pray that prices go up but some of these items cost money to store and look after. So it really is a gamble.

If you buy Apple stock, there are thousands of employees, stores everywhere, and people buying and producing the phones. You've got a trading business, whereas whiskey does nothing.

Katie: People say things like, "The stock market is too high, I'm scared to invest. The stock market is too low, I'm scared to invest." People will take anything that is happening and use it as a reason to time the market and procrastinate their investing.

Alan: This means your money doesn't get invested, and in general, you lose out if your money's not invested. People read headlines about market crashes and forget that there will still be trading companies that will still make money, because people still need to buy things like vegetables.

Katie: There's a phrase that goes "time in the market is better than timing the market." Of course, there's going to be lucky moments where you could have timed it differently, but you can't know that.

Katie: Investing is not entertainment. Once you have found your index funds and automated your investments, go to the cinema, go out, and live your life.

In the financial independence community, it's called the boring middle, where the work is done, and the only thing left to do is wait. This is when people are tempted to check their portfolios constantly and lose sleep.

But the boring middle is when you do the fun stuff — working on your health and your happiness so that when you do have that financial freedom, you're a well-adjusted, healthy human who can do something useful with all your free time.

Alan: Many people tell us that investing in an index fund yields average returns. We say average returns are amazing because they're actually better than 90% of other investments.

But people don't like getting average returns or don't want to be average people. So they run after outperformance, chase all these terms like alpha and beta, and get really into picking stocks, which in general always leads to underperformance. So, for us, we keep repeating, "average is extraordinary."

Katie: This is more common among people who discover financial independence in their 40s or 50s. They try to make up for lost time by making huge, risky investments like meme stocks, crypto, or other crazy investments that they think will produce outsize returns.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Carey Bentley, 35, the CEO of Lifehack Method. It's been edited for length and clarity.

A decade ago, I was deep in the corporate grind of brand management in Los Angeles. This meant long hours, endless meetings, and constant stress. I worked 12-hour days, chasing approvals, but I felt unfulfilled.

With an autoimmune condition that flares under stress, a vacation to Steamboat Springs, Colorado — where my phone wouldn't stop pinging — was the breaking point.

I launched a side business while I was still working for my company. It was originally supposed to be a stand-alone course to teach people about productivity. As interest in the program increased, I realized my husband and I could do this full-time if we put all our energy into it.

After some research, I discovered that travel could actually cost less than life in LA. Instead of quitting outright, I negotiated a remote consulting role with my company, giving me the freedom to move abroad with my husband, Demir.

In June 2016, we sold everything, left LA, and moved to Ubud, Bali, with just three carry-ons.

There, we discovered an entrepreneurial community, a slower pace, and a more sustainable lifestyle. It was the reset we needed.

My husband and I wanted to build a business that would allow us to live fully, work smarter, and help others do the same. That's how the Lifehack Method was born — coaching professionals to achieve more without burning out.

In the early days, Demir was up at 4 a.m. for global calls while I ran digital marketing. It was intense, but we thrived on testing, listening, and refining. Bali's culture of balance shaped our company's philosophy. People we met in Bali didn't work all day; they made time for family, community, and themselves.

Coming from a corporate world obsessed with hustle, this was a radical shift. We integrated that mindset into our work with clients, helping them create schedules that protected their health and allowed room for joy. While living in Bali, we even had time to take side trips to India, Singapore, Japan, and Thailand.

Settling into our new home was an adventure in itself. Getting around meant navigating chaotic streets on scooters, and the humidity hit like a wall. Rainstorms were a daily surprise, so we always had ponchos ready. But the rewards included great food, daily coffee rituals, and a perfectly unhurried pace of life.

As our company grew, the Asia-US time difference became harder to manage. In 2019, we chose to relocate to Medellín, Colombia. It was a place we hadn't explored before, but one that aligned better with our US-based clients. Leaving Bali was bittersweet, but Medellín quickly won us over with its modern amenities and family-focused culture. It was easy to feel at home.

We welcomed our first daughter in 2019, followed by two more in 2022 and 2024. The Colombian healthcare system was exceptional, and the at-home support we received was beyond what we would have found in the US.

We couldn't have asked for a better environment to raise our children. Our kids were learning Spanish, immersed in two vibrant cultures. Our community — both local and expat — was a lifeline.

As our family grew, we wanted to be closer to our aging parents.

Last October, we moved back to the US and settled in a walkable, rural community outside Atlanta. Life here is faster than our years abroad, but it's given us the chance to build a village around our children. Long-term, we hope to return overseas — likely Asia or Europe once the kids are older.

We'd been taught that the American way was best, but living in Indonesia and Colombia forced us to reconsider everything we thought we knew.

My advice to anyone considering leaving corporate life to start a business abroad is simple: Build a financial runway, validate your idea, and choose a place where the cost of living allows you to thrive.

Institutional capital is quietly turning to Bitcoin (BTC-USD)and this time, it's not through miners or ETFs. Bermuda-based Meanwhile, a life insurer that writes policies entirely in Bitcoin, has raised $82 million from a powerhouse roster including Apollo (NYSE:APO), Northwestern Mutual, Pantera Capital, Stillmark, Bain Capital, and Haun Ventures. Founded in 2023, the firm lends clients' Bitcoin to large, regulated financial institutions instead of speculating on price. CEO Zac Townsend said Meanwhile is now one of the largest lenders of Bitcoin in the world at duration, meaning over longer time periods rather than short-term trades.

What makes Meanwhile stand out is how it blends traditional insurance design with the tax efficiency and autonomy of digital assets. Policyholders can borrow up to 90% of their Bitcoin value after two yearstax-freewhile resetting the asset's cost basis to sidestep capital gains on future sales. Townsend described the firm as an institutional private credit player, not a hedge fund, positioning its Bitcoin-denominated policies as a bridge between crypto liquidity and old-world finance. This is such an institutional year for Bitcoin, he said, adding that demand is now coming from life insurers and retirement platforms seeking regulated, audited crypto exposure.

The latest round follows a $40 million Series A announced just six months ago, led by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, bringing total capital raised to over $120 million. Townsend declined to share a new valuation but said the funds will help expand institutional servicing capacity. Bain Capital's Stefan Cohen said the timing couldn't be better. As Bitcoin evolves into a more mature collateral asset, he noted, investors will increasingly want financial productslike life insuranceexpressed not in fiat, but in Bitcoin. Meanwhile's rise could mark the start of a new asset class: Bitcoin-based financial protection for a digital wealth generation.

A new platform named CruTrade has launched a secondary marketplace for fine wine on the Avalanche blockchain. Announced from London on Oct. 7, 2025, the marketplace allows collectors to trade tokenized bottles of wine peer-to-peer. The platform's standout feature is a commitment to return 25% of every trading fee to the original wine producers.

CruTrade is built upon the foundation of Crurated, an existing members-only digital wine club. Crurated sources wine directly from producers, then creates a non-fungible token (NFT) for each bottle to certify its origin and track its history on the blockchain.

According to an announcement from AVAX, this system ensures transparent provenance. It allows users to trade the NFTs instantly. At the same time, the physical wine remains secure in Crurated's specialized storage facility in Burgundy.

The company aims to address a broken system in the secondary wine market. Traditionally, resellers face high fees, logistical challenges, and the risk of bottle spoilage during shipping. For collectors, verifying a wine's provenance can be difficult, making the market susceptible to fraud. CruTrade bypasses these issues by tokenizing the bottles, enabling secure and efficient trading. This approach is part of a larger movement toward tokenizing real-world assets, reflecting growing RWA market trends across traditional finance.

The marketplace launches with exclusive access to Crurated's inventory, which is valued at over $60 million. This existing collection provides immediate liquidity and many options for collectors from day one.

John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, commented on the launch, highlighting its potential to bring more real-world use cases to the blockchain. Integrating the Avalanche network was a strategic choice, leveraging the blockchain's capabilities for fast and low-cost transactions. This decision reflects growing investor confidence in Avalanche, which has been attracting various projects.

The launch further diversifies Avalanche's growing ecosystem, which includes projects ranging from gaming to decentralized finance and even national stablecoins. CruTrade offers a compelling example of how blockchain technology can refine established luxury markets by creating a fairer economic model that benefits creators.

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 7th, 2025, Chainwire

Blockpass, the identity verification and compliance service for blockchain and beyond, is excited to announce the launch of its new and improved On-Chain KYC 2.0. With the adoption of crypto growing rapidly, Blockpass has created a flexible, powerful solution for blockchain identity verification and attestation which doesn't compromise on privacy or security.

Blockpass, the Safe Network for Crypto, has pioneered reusable identities and crypto-native KYC/AML solutions. Its turnkey suite of compliance tools is designed to lower onboarding costs, automate remediation, prove humanity and protect against malicious actors, fraudulent activities, bots, and AI. Businesses can set up services quickly, test them for free, and start verifying users. With around one million verified identity profiles, Blockpass facilitates instant onboarding, and to date over a thousand businesses have taken advantage of this opportunity to benefit from Blockpass' compliant network.

With the addition now of On-Chain KYC 2.0, businesses are empowered to create verified, reusable digital identities for users, both on the blockchain through on-chain attestations, or off the blockchain through zero-knowledge proofs. By working with existing attestation services on a range of blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana, users don't have to worry about building or maintaining their own smart contracts, but instead gain access to single solution that focuses on interoperability, and simplifies the integration process for their dApp or platform with the existing ecosystem.

Through this system, businesses are protected from having to handle or store the personal data of end-users. Instead, through Blockpass' privacy-centric checks, they are able to rely on the verification result or ‘attestation' that they issue, being accurate and true. With customisable elements that include identity document verification, accredited investor status, geographical residency, AML and sanctions checks, age requirements, and expiry dates, On-Chain KYC 2.0 enables safe and seamless ongoing monitoring, and a reputation that only strengthens over time.
		



With the new capabilities that On-Chain KYC 2.0 offers, Blockpass continues to help the world navigate the developing landscape of crypto regulations whilst adhering to the strictest privacy measures possible. As blockchain and crypto expand in scope and adoption, Blockpass will continue to put out new and updated services that keep people on all sides of the ecosystem safe.

Blockpass offers a comprehensive, cost-effective suite of KYC, KYB, and AML compliance solutions for Web3. Built by compliance and crypto experts, our tools lower onboarding costs, automate processes, and protect against fraud. Our core products include our groundbreaking On-Chain KYC 2.0 for verified, reusable digital identities via on-chain attestations and zero-knowledge proofs, the Advanced KYC Bot for automated onboarding, Unhosted Wallet KYC for wallet ownership certification, and Travel Rule Hub for fulfilling crypto transfer regulation.

We also provide specialized solutions like Launchpad KYC for crypto platforms servicing multiple token offerings, SAFT KYC for private token sales, and Node Sale KYC to verify node participants and prevent fraud. Our Outsourcing services offer expert personnel for compliance management. With a network of more than a million pre-verified crypto investors and more than three thousand crypto VCs, businesses can achieve instant onboarding and accelerate growth.

India plans to roll out an RBI-backed digital currency for faster, safer, and transparent payments while limiting private crypto use.

 

India is preparing to roll out its RBI digital currency. The RBI is a state-backed initiative designed to make transactions faster, safer and more transparent.

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal announced the move during his recent visit to Qatar. He explained that the project will be supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and will work as a reliable alternative to cash-based payments.

The central bank has long been skeptical about privately issued cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. RBI officials have warned that unregulated assets pose risks to financial stability and investor safety.

Goyal emphasised that India does not support digital currencies that lack sovereign backing or real asset support.

While the government has not banned crypto trading, it discourages its use by imposing strict rules and heavy taxes.

India's new RBI digital currency aims to be a regulated alternative. It will be faster to use than traditional banking systems and will reduce reliance on paper-based transactions. Goyal noted that the system's traceability can also help prevent illegal activities like money laundering.

Despite India's role in crypto adoption, the government has made it clear that private cryptocurrencies will remain under tight restrictions.

Profits from crypto trading or transfers are taxed at a flat 30% with a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on transactions above specified thresholds. Moreover, Investors cannot offset losses from crypto against other forms of income.

This heavy taxation, combined with strong anti–money laundering rules, has limited mainstream adoption. Several users have even reported bank account freezes linked to peer-to-peer crypto transactions.

RBI's focus on its new digital currency shows its intention to provide a safer, compliant digital payment option while keeping privately issued tokens on the sidelines.

India's central bank launched its first pilot of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the digital rupee, in late 2022. This initial rollout targeted wholesale transactions between banks and aimed to reduce interbank settlement costs.

Building on this, the RBI now plans to introduce the digital rupee to retail users and expand its applications. A new pilot for deposit tokenisation is also set to begin soon, using the wholesale CBDC as its foundational layer.

Goyal noted that, unlike stablecoins, which are often tied to private issuers or specific assets, India's RBI digital currency will rely on direct central bank backing. 

He says that this difference will enhance trust and set the cryptocurrency up as a secure alternative for daily transactions.

The Indian government has repeatedly said it neither encourages nor outright bans crypto. Instead, it is merely “tough” on the sector.

“People can trade crypto at their own risk,” Goyal stated. “If there is no buyer tomorrow, there is no guarantee of value. The government doesn't encourage or discourage it. We only tax it.”

This stance shows the government's caution toward digital assets. Officials argue that proper regulation could give private cryptocurrencies recognition similar to legal tender, which they aim to avoid.

Bitcoin edged down to the $122,000 range, and remains below Monday's all-time peak of $126,296

Bitcoin slipped today, retreating from a record high as the U.S. government shutdown entered its seventh day. Bitcoin edged down to the $121,000 range, and remains below Monday's all-time peak of $126,296, per Bitbio data.

Despite the minor pullback, Bitcoin has surged roughly 30% since the start of the year and is up about 9% over the past week.

Gold, meanwhile, continued its historic rally, briefly topping $4,000 per ounce overnight, with futures trading at $3,980 early Tuesday, reflecting a 50% gain for the year.

At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $122,096. 

Markets appear largely unfazed by the shutdown, even after the Senate failed to pass a Republican bill on Monday to reopen government operations.

Analysts say Bitcoin's recent correction — from its all-time high down to around $122,000 — is healthy and may be setting the stage for further gains. The $120,000 level currently acts as key support, while resistance is seen near $135,000. 

“Overall, dips are for buying,” said market analyst Mags on X, noting that a daily close above $123,300 could trigger additional upside. 

Onchain data underscores strong buying momentum. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin's relative strength index has risen from 44 to 66 over the past week, signaling growing market confidence. 

Glassnode also noted that bitcoin futures open interest surged as traders added longs during the breakout to new highs. The current pullback is testing these positions, and watching where buyers step in will reveal if support levels can attract renewed demand.

The ongoing U.S. fiscal impasse may be further fueling demand for perceived safe-haven assets. 

Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, suggested last week that Bitcoin could reach $135,000 soon and possibly $200,000 by year-end if current conditions persist. 

As mentioned earlier, gold continues its surge, supported by central bank purchases, dollar weakness, and expectations of future Fed easing. 

Investors appear to be positioning for an extended period of policy uncertainty, with both bitcoin and traditional safe havens benefiting from market jitters.

The intersection of traditional finance and cutting-edge blockchain technology is currently witnessing a historic moment as gold-backed crypto tokens have surged past an unprecedented $3 billion in market capitalization. This remarkable milestone coincides with a record-breaking rally in physical gold, which on October 7, 2025, briefly topped $4,007 per ounce for the first time ever. The dual surge underscores a profound shift in investor sentiment, driven by escalating global economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, pushing both institutional and retail investors towards the perceived safety of precious metals, now increasingly accessible through digital assets.

This convergence highlights a growing appetite for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering a novel blend of gold's enduring stability with the liquidity and transparency of blockchain. While traditional safe-haven assets typically attract demand during turbulent times, the rapid ascent of tokenized gold suggests a new paradigm for hedging against inflation and market volatility, presenting both significant opportunities and complex challenges for the broader financial ecosystem.

The market capitalization for tokenized gold has reached a staggering $3.02 billion, with reports indicating it briefly touched $3.04 billion, marking a significant leap from previous highs. This impressive growth is largely dominated by key players such as Tether Gold (XAUT) and Paxos Gold (PAXG), which together command approximately 89% of the tokenized gold market. XAUT's market cap is nearing $1.5 billion, while PAXG stands at about $1.19 billion. Other tokens like Kinesis Gold (KAU) and Quorium (QGOLD) have also experienced substantial increases, with all four major tokens seeing their value rise by 40% or more over the past 12 months. This surge is not merely speculative; trading volumes for PAXG and XAUT have spiked dramatically, with monthly turnover for both exceeding $3.2 billion in September, reflecting robust demand.

The primary drivers behind this digital gold rush are multifaceted. Investors are increasingly seeking stable alternatives amidst a backdrop of global economic uncertainty, persistent inflation concerns, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and Taiwan. The advantages of tokenization are also playing a crucial role, offering fractional ownership that makes gold more accessible and affordable to a wider range of investors. Furthermore, these digital assets eliminate the logistical concerns of physical storage and security, provide increased liquidity with 24/7 trading, and offer enhanced transparency through blockchain technology, effectively combining gold's traditional stability with crypto's technological efficiencies. The broader trend of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which has seen its market capitalization reach $21.6 billion, provides a fertile ground for the continued expansion of gold-backed tokens.

Simultaneously, the physical gold market is experiencing an unprecedented rally. On October 7, 2025, spot gold briefly touched an all-time high of $4,007 per ounce in international markets, trading consistently around $3,960-$3,993 per ounce. This marks an astonishing climb of nearly 50-51% since the beginning of 2025, positioning it as gold's best year since 1979. In India, MCX gold futures also reached a new record of ₹1,20,900 per 10 grams. This rally is fueled by a confluence of global factors including heightened geopolitical tensions, concerns over global economic stability, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which has amplified fiscal stability worries. Aggressive gold purchases by global central banks, driven by strategic diversification away from dollar-denominated assets and de-dollarization efforts, have also provided consistent support, with central banks acquiring over 1,000 tons of gold in 2024 for the third consecutive year. The persistent inflation concerns and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts further enhance gold's appeal as a non-yielding asset, while a weakening U.S. dollar makes the metal more attractive to international buyers.

The immediate implications for financial markets are significant. This dual surge signifies a convergence of traditional and digital finance, creating new trading opportunities and asset classes. Gold, and by extension gold-backed tokens, are serving as crucial hedges against market volatility and inflation, driving a notable shift in investor sentiment towards safety. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin (BTC-USD) also reaching a new all-time high of $126,200, gold has outperformed the leading cryptocurrency in 2025, indicating a preference for the traditional safe-haven asset in the current turbulent environment. However, investors must also be aware of the inherent risks associated with gold-backed tokens, including the potential for issuer bankruptcy, theft or loss of the underlying gold, and hacking risks inherent to blockchain technology, in addition to the natural price fluctuations of gold itself.

The unprecedented surge in both physical gold and gold-backed crypto tokens is reshaping the fortunes of various public companies and market sectors. Companies at the forefront of tokenized gold issuance are clear beneficiaries, experiencing substantial growth in market share and trading volume. Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of Tether Gold (XAUT), and Paxos Trust Company (PAXG), are seeing their platforms gain significant traction, validating their early bets on real-world asset tokenization. Their ability to provide a liquid, accessible, and transparent digital representation of gold positions them as key players in this evolving financial landscape. Other token issuers like Kinesis Money (KAU) and Quorium (QGOLD) are also expanding their user base and asset under management. This trend could also benefit blockchain infrastructure providers and crypto exchanges that list these tokens, as increased trading activity translates into higher fees and greater network utilization.

Traditional gold mining companies and precious metals investment vehicles are also riding the wave of record gold prices. Major gold miners such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE: AEM) are likely to see improved revenue and profitability margins, assuming their production costs remain stable. Higher gold prices typically boost their earnings, potentially leading to increased dividends or share buybacks, which are attractive to investors. Similarly, precious metals Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) like SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE Arca: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE Arca: IAU) are experiencing significant inflows, reflecting increased investor demand for convenient exposure to gold without the complexities of physical ownership. These traditional avenues remain popular, even as digital alternatives gain prominence.

However, the landscape presents challenges for some. Traditional gold custodians and vaulting services might face increasing competition from tokenized solutions if the market continues its shift towards digital ownership, although the physical gold still needs to be stored somewhere. The rise of gold-backed tokens could also subtly impact the demand dynamics for fiat-backed stablecoins, as investors seeking stability might diversify into commodity-backed digital assets. Furthermore, for companies heavily invested in traditional financial instruments or those without a clear strategy for engaging with digital assets, there's a risk of being left behind in a rapidly evolving market. The long-term success of tokenized gold relies on robust regulatory frameworks and continued investor trust, which will be crucial for all stakeholders.

The surge in gold-backed crypto tokens and the accompanying gold rally signify more than just a fleeting market event; they point to a fundamental shift in broader industry trends and global financial dynamics. This phenomenon is a powerful testament to the burgeoning Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization movement, where tangible assets are brought onto the blockchain, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. The success of gold-backed tokens is likely to catalyze the tokenization of other commodities, real estate, and even intellectual property, creating a more interconnected and efficient global asset market. This trend could significantly impact decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, offering them more stable and diversified collateral options beyond native cryptocurrencies.

The ripple effects extend to traditional finance, compelling established institutions to re-evaluate their strategies. While some may view tokenized assets as a threat, many are likely to explore integration, offering hybrid products that combine the security of traditional banking with the efficiencies of blockchain. This could lead to partnerships between financial giants and blockchain technology firms, accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital assets. Furthermore, the strong central bank buying of physical gold, driven by de-dollarization efforts, underscores a significant geopolitical trend. Nations are strategically diversifying their reserves away from the U.S. dollar, seeking to reduce reliance on a single currency and mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations and sanctions. Gold, in both its physical and tokenized forms, plays a pivotal role in this global macroeconomic recalibration.

Regulatory and policy implications are paramount. As tokenized assets gain traction, governments and financial regulators worldwide will face increasing pressure to establish clear guidelines and frameworks. Issues such as investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and the legal status of underlying assets need to be addressed comprehensively. The lack of consistent global regulation poses challenges and risks, but also presents an opportunity for jurisdictions that adopt progressive and clear frameworks to become hubs for RWA tokenization. Historically, gold has always been a safe haven during times of crisis. The current rally, reminiscent of the 2011 peak and the 1979 surge, highlights its enduring appeal. However, the integration of blockchain technology adds a new dimension, potentially making this era of gold appreciation unique in its accessibility and global reach, blurring the lines between traditional and digital asset markets.

Looking ahead, the trajectory of gold-backed crypto tokens and the physical gold market is poised for continued dynamism, albeit with inherent volatility. In the short term, the ongoing global economic uncertainties, persistent inflation, and geopolitical tensions are likely to sustain demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. The U.S. government shutdown, if prolonged, will further fuel this demand by eroding confidence in fiscal stability. Expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, making non-yielding assets like gold more attractive, are also a significant near-term driver. We can anticipate continued high trading volumes for tokenized gold and sustained central bank buying, providing a strong floor for prices. However, some analysts warn of "extremely overbought" conditions for gold, exceeding levels seen at the 2011 peak, which could signal a risk of significant correction if market sentiment shifts or if there's a resolution to current crises.

In the long term, the growth of gold-backed crypto tokens is likely to continue, driven by the broader trend of RWA tokenization. This will necessitate strategic pivots from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain companies. Traditional banks and asset managers may need to develop their own tokenized gold products or partner with existing issuers to remain competitive. Crypto exchanges and DeFi platforms will likely expand their offerings to include more compliant and regulated RWA tokens, attracting a wider institutional investor base. This creates significant market opportunities for innovators in blockchain technology, security solutions, and regulatory compliance, as the infrastructure for a robust tokenized asset ecosystem continues to evolve.

Potential scenarios range from a sustained, albeit volatile, rally in gold prices, propelled by ongoing global instability and central bank diversification, to periods of consolidation or correction if economic conditions stabilize or if a coordinated global regulatory framework introduces new complexities. A key challenge will be ensuring the underlying gold reserves are verifiable and secure, maintaining investor trust in the tokenized assets. Market opportunities will emerge for new investment products that combine the features of both traditional and digital finance, offering enhanced liquidity and accessibility. Investors should watch for further regulatory clarity, technological advancements in blockchain security, and the continued adoption of RWA tokenization by major financial players, as these factors will shape the future of this evolving market.

The recent surge in gold-backed crypto tokens past $3 billion, amidst a record-breaking rally in physical gold to over $4,000 per ounce, marks a pivotal moment in financial history. This event underscores a powerful convergence of traditional safe-haven investing with the innovative capabilities of blockchain technology. Key takeaways include the growing investor demand for accessible, liquid, and transparent alternatives to traditional assets during periods of heightened global uncertainty, and the increasing validation of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization as a viable and impactful financial trend. The dual rally highlights profound anxieties about the global economic order, geopolitical stability, and the future of fiat currencies, prompting a significant flight to safety across both physical and digital gold markets.

Moving forward, the market for gold and gold-backed tokens is likely to remain highly dynamic and influenced by macroeconomic factors. The continued aggressive buying by central banks, coupled with persistent inflation concerns and anticipated monetary policy shifts, will provide a strong underlying support for gold prices. However, the market should also be prepared for potential volatility and corrections, especially given the rapid ascent and "overbought" conditions reported by some analysts. The long-term trajectory appears bullish for tokenized assets, as they offer unique advantages in terms of fractional ownership, liquidity, and ease of transfer, making gold more democratized than ever before.

For investors, the message is clear: gold, in both its physical and tokenized forms, continues to serve as a critical portfolio diversifier and a hedge against uncertainty. While the allure of high returns is present, a balanced approach that considers the inherent risks of both the gold market and blockchain technology is essential. Investors should closely monitor global geopolitical developments, central bank policies, and the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. The coming months will likely see further innovation in RWA tokenization, potentially expanding beyond gold to other commodities and assets, creating new avenues for investment and wealth preservation in an increasingly digitized and uncertain world.

Crypto's quest to imbue shareholder protections for tokens

Manbetta/Shutterstock and Adobe modified by Blockworks

This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.

A little-known privacy project, Umbra, launched its initial coin offering (ICO) on Solana yesterday.

As I write this, Umbra is already 1169% oversubscribed over its $750K raise target.



The real story here isn't Umbra — it's the infrastructure that's powering its sale: MetaDAO's “Unruggable ICO” futarchy launchpad.

A lot has already been written on the intersection of crypto and futarchy by people smarter than me, but here's the gist: Futarchy is the simple idea that governance should be decided by markets, rather than “one man, one vote” democratic rules, or DAO token voting.

If you believe Donald Trump will spur economic growth more than Joe Biden, buying “Pass Trump” shares will get him elected if enough traders buy it past a set threshold.

Or if you believe Facebook spending $50 billion on investments in the metaverse will not improve Meta's stock price, then do the opposite and buy “Fail” shares.

Futarchy markets work similarly to prediction markets: They channel the wisdom of markets by requiring participants put their money where their mouth is. The key difference is that with futarchy, actual outcomes are influenced by how markets “vote.”

This radical idea was popularized by the libertarian economist Robin Hanson and has existed for years as a topic of nerdy fascination in technolibertarian circles. 

(Hanson, incidentally, was also responsible for advancing many of crypto's major innovations, like automated market makers and prediction markets.)

For some time, DAOs like Drift, Sanctum and Marinade have experimented with piecemeal futarchy governance using MetaDAO's core protocol.

The ongoing Umbra ICO is taking place on a relatively newer MetaDAO product, its futarchy-powered ICO launchpad.



By launching on MetaDAO's ICO launchpad, teams like Umbra in effect bind its entire governance to a futarchy model from day one.

The incentive for existing DAOs to adopt futarchy isn't strong, which is why MetaDAO is now targeting founders from day one, MetaDAO's pseudonymous co-founder Proph3t tells me.

This entails limiting the founding team's powers in ways that would be considered abnormal in the real world.

For one, teams have to commit to a set budget allowance. Umbra, for instance, is agreeing to lock in to a $34K monthly budget. This can change, but only if markets vote on it to pass.

Secondly, the team agrees to subject its treasury and all intellectual property — domain names, Discord and Twitter accounts, brand names — to ownership under a DAO LLC legal entity headquartered in the Marshall Islands, executed by MetaDAO themselves. This ensures that whatever happens onchain is legally binding in the real world.

The first criterion primarily serves to align long-term incentives between founders and tokenholders, avoiding situations where founding teams have quietly abandoned projects with huge controlled allocations.

The second avoids crypto's notorious token equity mismatch problem, where revenues are directed to equity holders rather than tokens.

“I'm not in love with governance. I see it as a tool to solve a specific problem. Most founders want control for obvious reasons and I would like to give them as much control as possible while still maintaining the properties that make tokens unruggable,” Proph3t tells me.

In return for binding their hands to a futarchy-based governance model, founding teams can signal legitimacy by advertising their tokens as protected by traditional “shareholder protections”.

But whether or not you believe these protections are robust depends on whether you believe market forces can make the right governance decisions.

Are they? Take the example of the mtnCapital investment fund.

In April, mtnCapital ran the first ICO on MetaDAO's futarchy launchpad, raising ~$5.7 million USDC. The fund's performance eventually underperformed, so DAO members took it upon themselves to vote on a proposal to unwind the fund and return monies to MTN tokenholders in September.



That decision was made by tokenholders, as opposed to the mtnCapital investment team that could have quietly abandoned the project, or conjure an endless string of amorphous reasons for why their strategy “needed more time”.

Futarchy isn't a guarantee that the business will succeed; it serves as a safeguard against the kinds of plutocratic rent-seeking that DAOs have been plagued with for years.

The META token, which has seen a speculative pump of 191% in the last month, currently receives no value accrual.

That is set to change in the near future with MetaDAO taking a 25 bps take-rate on its futarchy AMM.

This will work similarly to how memecoins launch from launchpads to a DEX, Proph3t tells me.

The crypto rally took a pause on Tuesday with bitcoin BTC$111,480.33 quickly pulling back from record highs above $126,000 as analysts pointed to signs of crypto rally overheating, at least in the short run.

BTC plunged below $122,000, erasing the past three days of gains and trading 2.4% lower in the 24 hours. The selloff rippled across the crypto market, with XRP$2.8211, DOGE$0.2316, ADA$0.7842 and AVAX$28.57 down 5%-7% during the period.

If the price action in bitcoin appears familiar, that's because it is. Despite a 31% gain year-to-date, bitcoin has given bulls very little chance to bask in their wins. Each record high has seemingly been met with a quick and viscous sell-off. Consider the first run to $109,000 just ahead of the Trump inauguration in January. That reversed lower to $100,000 in hours and to $75,000 within three months.

July's first move above $123,000 was met with about a 10% decline over the following few days. And similar surge above $120,000 in mid-August presaged  about a 15% plunge in ensuing days.

The declines this time around came after bitcoin's near-vertical 16% pump off the late September lows below $109,000.

Jean-David Péquignot, CCO of options marketplace Deribit, projected in a Monday report that BTC could revisit the $118,000-$120,000 zone shaking out traders who missed the lows and joined the rally late. If that pullback happens, he said, would offer a buying opportunity as technicals and the macro environment aligns for BTC to run higher above $130,000 through the last quarter of the year.

Derivatives market and ETF inflows also got overheated, said Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. He noted that the past week marked the strongest BTC accumulation of the year, with a combined 63,083 BTC (worth roughly $.7 7billion) added across U.S. ETFs, CME and perpetual futures, surpassing the May peak. The surge was driven by widespread long positioning betting on higher prices without a clear macro catalyst, laying the ground for a pullback.

"Historically, similar bursts in exposure have often coincided with local tops, and the current setup suggests a temporarily overheated market with elevated risk of short-term consolidation," Lunde said.

Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran — a recent Trump appointee — said Tuesday his view of the neutral interest rate has shifted “from one end of the range to the other,” during a discussion at the Managed Funds Association Policy Outlook 2025. He now believes the neutral rate should stand at 0.5%. Miran pointed to tighter immigration restrictions and evolving expectations about the federal deficit as the main factors behind his reassessment.



Miran's comments suggest that long-term forces shaping the U.S. economy are changing. A smaller labor pool could limit growth, while rising fiscal pressures might keep the Fed's balancing act between inflation and employment more complex. His remarks come as policymakers debate how much room the central bank has to cut rates without reigniting price pressures.



Fed officials meet at the end of this month to decide about a possible further rate cut, however, without critical data coming from the government as the shutdown continues.



Miran also noted that economic growth in the first half of the year was weaker than anticipated, weighed down by uncertainty over trade and tax policy. But Miran struck a more positive tone for the months ahead, saying much of that uncertainty has now cleared. “With clearer policy signals, I expect a steadier pace of growth,” he said.

Crypto stocks suffer

The broad pullback in crypto prices is hitting the related stocks, led by a 7% decline in Strategy (MSTR) and a 4% loss for Coinbase (COIN). Ether ETH$4,005.03 treasury companies Bitmine Immersion (BMNR) and Sharplink Gaming (SBET)  are down 3% and 7%, respectively.

BItcoin miners are mostly in the red, led by MARA Holdings falling 4% and Riot Platforms (RIOT) 3%. Hut 8 (HUT) is lower by 2%.

Kraken has partnered with the most advanced crypto fundraising platform, Legion, to launch a new crypto token sales platform for retail investors. The launchpad, called Kraken Launch, increases retail access to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and rewards the most dedicated community members.

Historically, early access to ICOs and new crypto projects was limited to venture capital funds and institutional investors. Retail investors only gained access once the tokens were available for public trading. This imbalance placed everyday crypto users at a disadvantage, while institutions received earlier fundraising allocations at lower token prices.

To address this disparity in crypto token sales, Kraken Launch offers retail crypto access to upcoming ICO projects with the same level of fairness and transparency as institutional players. By democratizing crypto fundraising, Kraken ensures that ICO participation is accessible to committed investors, not just organizations with substantial capital.

As an innovative ICO participation platform, Kraken Launch is built on a few foundational principles. Let's break each of them down.

Kraken Launch, through an exclusive Legion partnership, is built on smarter fundraising technology that emphasizes regulatory compliance and investor responsibility. It integrates the Legion Score, a merit-based model that ensures presale token allocations are distributed to participants who actively support projects.

Legion's advantage is that it helps projects distribute tokens during early fundraising rounds to a select group of users. The Legion Score helps teams gain token holders based on social activity, on-chain activity, and community contributions, as a portion of every token sale is reserved for investors based on merit score.

The best crypto presales on Legion will be simultaneously featured on both Kraken Launch and the Legion platform. After the projects are launched, their tokens will be available for trading on the Kraken exchange.

Together with Legion, Kraken Launch creates a win-win scenario for retail investors and crypto project teams. Let's break down the benefits for both parties.

In an article by Kraken, Brett McLain, Head of Payments and Blockchain at Kraken, said that the exchange's partnership with Legion is building stronger foundations for Web3. 

“Together with Legion, we're scaling a product that democratizes token sales and aligns communities with builders,” McLain mentioned. “It's not just better fundraising, it's better infrastructure for the next generation of finance.”

Legion's co-founder, Matt O'Connor, shared a similar perspective on the collaboration. “Crypto gave us the tools to rebuild capital markets from first principles. This partnership combines Legion's approach to regulation and merit-based access with Kraken's global distribution, compliance infrastructure, and deep liquidity.”

O'Connor also noted that Legion's technology could reshape future capital formation, suggesting that “the next Figma or Reddit may choose to launch directly to its community onchain rather than through a traditional IPO.”

Kraken Launch offers distinct advantages compared to some of the top launchpad platforms, such as KuCoin Spotlight and Binance Launchpad. For one, Kraken Launch's dual sale model that integrates its exchange with Legion's on-chain token sale. Other platforms typically use a more centralized structure when offering presale tokens.

Additionally, Kraken is known for its long-standing regulatory compliance, which aligns with Legion's compliance-first approach. Both presale investors and ICO project teams can be confident that their fundraising efforts adhere to clear regulatory frameworks.

Finally, Kraken Launch reserves a greater token allocation for active contributors, resulting in more committed token holders who are more likely to support the project and its long-term sustainability. 

Retail investors can get started with Kraken Launch by:

In partnership with Legion, Kraken has taken another step toward empowering individual investors by providing fair and transparent ICO participation. Kraken Launch combines security, regulatory compliance, and merit-based participation to ensure that crypto token sales are no longer exclusive to just VCs and insiders.

Nations are currently competing to harness the power of artificial intelligence and digitalisation. China and the United States are at the forefront of the race, while the European Union is more heavily focused on ethical regulation and digital rights.

For emerging economies, entering the race signals an attempt to shift the global power dynamics in their favour, seeking to narrow the development gap. 

For the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan, it's also a means to branch out from its raw materials-based economy, a model which cannot last forever.

The country has made digitalisation and AI development the centrepiece of its national strategy, which Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced in his September public address. 

“I have set the strategically important task of transforming Kazakhstan into a fully-fledged digital country within three years,” he stated. 

To support the strategy, the president announced the creation of the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development, which will oversee the integration of AI across key sectors of the economy and restructure governance around AI principles. 

Astana is also drafting a Digital Code, designed to organise digital governance and ensure data protection. 

Another bold step for Kazakhstan is a proposed law on artificial intelligence, which regulates 'high-risk' systems and mandates the labelling of AI-generated content. 

Crucially, the legislation gives regulators the authority to suspend harmful AI applications.

“We should not let ethical norms fall behind this rapid evolution,” Tokayev warned at the recent United Nations General Assembly, aligning Kazakhstan's stance with the European Union's approach to responsible AI.

Kazakhstan's ambitions go beyond regulation, as it plans on transforming the financial sector and public services as well.

The country already boasts some of the region's most advanced digital public services, with over 92% available online and cashless transactions making up the vast majority of payments.

The country now wants to move from e-Gov to AI-Gov — embedding machine learning into governance itself. 

At the same time, Astana is experimenting with digital finance. The government is expanding the use of its national digital currency, digital tenge, which is already being used to finance projects from the National Fund. 

“Now is the time to scale up the use of the digital tenge within the national and local budgets, as well as in the budgets of state holdings,” Tokayev said in his September address. 

In the same speech, Tokayev announced the establishment of the State Digital Assets Fund, which will serve as the reserve for crypto and digital assets.

Another way Kazakhstan aims to position itself as the digital hub of Eurasia is by introducing a focus on AI in education.  

For this, President Tokayev announced the creation of an AI research university, which should prepare the future generation of specialists capable of supporting Kazakhstan through its digital transformation. 

The Alem.ai International Centre for Artificial Intelligence, launched on 2 October, will spearhead this transition by designing AI tools for policymaking, data analysis and forecasting.  

This summer, the country also launched Central Asia's most powerful supercomputer, with a second one on the way. The machine will power the country's e-government services and support AI model training. 

Kazakhstan's digital transformation also carries a geopolitical weight. Positioned between China, Russia, and Europe, the country is balancing partnerships while asserting digital sovereignty — welcoming Western data firms, cooperating with Chinese researchers, and nurturing its own AI ecosystem.  

This multi-vector approach mirrors Astana's broader foreign policy and places Kazakhstan among a small group of nations embedding AI into their institutional fabric.  

The challenge now is to turn bold reforms into tangible progress that strengthens competitiveness without losing control of the rapid technological shift.

Fact checked

By Sam Cooling

 From topping $21M just over the weekend, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 chain, has already crossed the $22M funding milestone as of Monday.

The main driver behind this milestone appears to be ongoing whale accumulation. Their appetite for HYPER tokens has become a defining trend over the past week, showing growing conviction among deep-pocketed investors.

This steady buying indicates that whales see something potentially massive in Bitcoin Hyper, and these successive purchases and visible FOMO suggest expectations of a much larger move ahead – especially once the project moves past the presale stage.

For retail investors, on-chain whale accumulation offers a clear signal that current prices may represent one of the most favorable entry points.

At the moment, HYPER is available for purchase at $0.013075 per token, with the current presale round set to close in under 29 hours, or once the $22.4M target is reached, whichever comes first. 

The price was $0.013065 just yesterday, which means another price increase could arrive within hours.

Over the past seven days, Bitcoin Hyper has continued to break milestones at a rapid pace. From $18.8M on September 29, the project has crossed $19M, $20M, $21M, and finally $22M by Monday. That translates to $3.3M in new funding within a single week.

Each of these jumps has been fueled by large-scale investors joining the trend. Last week, one whale purchased 24.6M HYPER worth $327,000. Soon after, two more whales collectively acquired 25.65M HYPER valued at $333,000.

Over the weekend, another massive buy came in – 42.2M HYPER worth $560,000 – followed by Monday's headline purchase when Bitcoin Hyper stood at $21.6 million in funding. The same whale, linked to address 0xDd00D150C7a38aA26b590De42e31C7086F494669, added another 20M HYPER to their stack worth $273,000.

All of these points point to a clear pattern. Those who typically move with deeper insight and data are positioning early for what could become one of the most influential projects shaping Bitcoin's next phase, particularly in the development of hybrid Layer-2 applications that combine Solana's speed with Bitcoin's security.

The biggest challenge in blockchain design comes from the trade-offs between security, decentralization, and speed. When a network prioritizes security and decentralization, it often sacrifices scalability. On the other hand, when it pursues speed and high throughput, it tends to compromise some decentralization or security.

Ethereum has made significant progress toward solving this issue through Layer-2 solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum, and zkSync, which enhance scalability while maintaining Ethereum's base-layer security. However, most of these networks still rely on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which is designed for broad compatibility but is limited by its sequential transaction processing.

For applications to truly perform at scale, they need speed, efficiency, and high throughput – exactly the kind of environment that can be built once Bitcoin Hyper is fully deployed. 

Running on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which processes multiple transactions simultaneously, Bitcoin Hyper is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second, far beyond the EVM's sequential limits.

Throughput, however, means little without security. That's where Bitcoin Hyper's architecture stands out – its execution layer is fast, but it remains anchored to the Bitcoin base chain, the most decentralized and secure network in existence.

This combination is why Bitcoin Hyper is often described as bringing together the best of both worlds, and it's a major reason investors are paying such close attention to its growth.

The new generation of applications that could emerge from Bitcoin Hyper may arrive quickly, especially since its development tools are already familiar to most blockchain engineers. Developers can build using Rust-based SDKs and APIs, similar to those used on Solana, which shortens the learning curve and speeds up deployment.

If adoption gains traction, it could lead to a significant portion of Bitcoin's supply being locked within the Canonical Bridge, effectively reducing circulation and potentially increasing the value of BTC held outside it.

What makes this setup unique is that the Bitcoin locked in the bridge isn't idle. A wrapped version of BTC circulates across the new Bitcoin Hyper applications, serving as the medium of exchange within its DeFi, gaming, and real-world asset (RWA) environments. 

As that wrapped BTC moves through these platforms, it creates utility-based demand for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an actively used asset within a connected on-chain economy.

Even a small share of Bitcoin's supply entering Bitcoin Hyper would represent substantial value – just 1% could amount to tens of billions of dollars as BTC advances toward $130,000.

In this setup, investors are accumulating HYPER, often referring to it as “Bitcoin 2.0”, since the token is directly connected to the network's growth. HYPER powers gas fees, staking, and governance, ensuring the ecosystem functions seamlessly as activity expands.

That connection between Bitcoin's liquidity and Bitcoin Hyper's design explains why outlets such as 99Bitcoins, Cryptonews, and influencers like CryptoTV and Cilinix Crypto are covering Bitcoin Hyper and discussing its potential to replicate the kind of early-stage gains Bitcoin once delivered.



With everything Bitcoin Hyper is building, it's no wonder the presale continues to gain strong traction. The question now is whether it can reach $23M by the end of the week.

That scenario looks increasingly likely given how much has been raised in just seven days. But as funding accelerates, it's worth remembering that this early phase won't last forever – once the target is hit, the presale will close.

While there's still time to secure HYPER at presale prices, investors can purchase directly through the official Bitcoin Hyper website using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

New holders can also stake immediately through Bitcoin Hyper's native protocol, currently offering a 53% APY with already nearly 1 billion HYPER staked.

For the smoothest experience, Best Wallet – one of the best crypto wallets in the market – lists HYPER under its Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to buy, track, and claim once live.

The FCA, Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) are joining together to tackle misleading advertising and inadequate information provided by some claims management companies (CMCs) and law firms working on motor finance claims, and the risk that excessive fees are charged to clients.

Alison Walters, director, consumer finance, at the FCA, yesterday said:

“Misleading advertising and inadequate disclosure have meant that people are signing contracts with some firms without the facts. When they try to exit, they face high fees. We're acting where we see bad practice and, through our own advertising, we're ensuring consumers can make informed choices.”

Paul Philip, chief executive of the SRA, yesterday said:

“The risks and issues facing consumers in this area of the market are unprecedented, and we are using all the levers at our disposal to protect consumers, identify poor practices and hold law firms to account.”

Using powers under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and, for the first time, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024, the FCA, working closely with the SRA, has required 9 law firms to provide information about their exit fees. Two FCA regulated CMCs have agreed to change their exit fee policies.

Two others have agreed not to take on clients or to advertise until they're able to show the FCA they comply with FCA rules. We're expecting to write to FCA regulated CMCs involved in motor finance claims this week to reiterate our expectations.  

The FCA's increased proactive monitoring has led to the removal or amendment of more than 740 misleading adverts by FCA regulated CMCs since January 2024. This number increased significantly following the Johnson judgment. Concerns include unrealistic claims about success rates and the value of potential compensation.

The FCA has launched a £1m ad campaign to make people aware they don't need to use a CMC or law firm to seek motor finance compensation, and that they stand to lose a chunk of any compensation they're owed if they choose to. Research shows 4 in 10 people don't know they can receive motor finance compensation without using a CMC or law firm. The campaign will run online and on radio.

The SRA is investigating 76 law firms involved in high-volume claims and has closed five firms to protect the public. Its recent Thematic Review set out the key issues, and it has made clear its expectations on termination fees. The FCA and SRA continue to work closely, given that many FCA regulated CMCs refer motor finance claims to law firms.

Since January 2025, the ICO has received over 230,000 complaints via the spam reporting service regarding unsolicited and unlawful direct marketing practices linked to motor finance claims. In response, the ICO has multiple investigations ongoing and is actively considering further regulatory action against several organisations.

The ASA is also reviewing advertising practices in this sector.

Consumer guidance

Consumers who believe they have been misled by advertising, signed up without their consent, charged unreasonable fees, had their data mishandled, or otherwise feel they have been treated unfairly by a CMC or law firm should first complain to the firm. If dissatisfied with the response, they should take their complaint to the Claims Management OmbudsmanLink is external or Legal OmbudsmanLink is external.

To support the public, the SRA has also published guidance on motor finance claimsLink is external, and on no-win, no-fee agreementsLink is external.

Individuals concerned about direct marketing practices or those wishing to make a complaint, are encouraged to do so via the ICO websiteLink is external. They can also report spam text messages to the ICO by forwarding the message for free to 7726 (which spells out SPAM).

Notes to Editors

 

Daniel Pugh has been sentenced to 7 years and 6 months in prison for running a £1.3m Ponzi scheme, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.

An individual has been convicted for breaching the Data Protection Act, but acquitted of fraud and unauthorised business offences, following a prosecution brought by the FCA.

Motor insurers have changed their settlement and compensation practices after the FCA found some insurers had short-changed customers on stolen or written off vehicle claims. 

The ribbon was cut on a new banking hub in Monmouth, Wales, marking the first anniversary of the FCA's access to cash rules. 

The FCA is seeking feedback on proposals on the minimum standards crypto firms will need to comply with.

The FCA is launching a £1 million campaign, letting motor finance customers know they don't need to use a claims management company (CMC) or law firm to access an industry-wide compensation scheme the regulator is proposing.

Key Takeaways

India has made clear it is not interested in joining the global wave of pro-crypto regulation.

Union Minister Piyush Goyal reiterated this week that the government neither prohibits nor promotes cryptocurrencies but will continue to heavily tax them.

Instead, India is placing its bets squarely on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) digital rupee.

“As far as cryptocurrency, which the Central Government does not back, we are taxing it heavily, while there is no ban,” Goyal said.  “We don't encourage it because we don't want anybody to be stuck at some point with a cryptocurrency with no backing and nobody at the backend.”

Goyal's remarks highlight India's deliberate divergence from other major economies.

While the U.S. has introduced the GENIUS Act to create a stablecoin framework, and the EU's MiCA regime is now in effect, India remains hesitant to even outline a regulatory structure for private digital assets.

Across Asia, countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan are accelerating crypto adoption through licensing regimes, clear rules for stablecoins, and tax incentives designed to attract global capital.

India, by contrast, continues to discourage investment in crypto while positioning its CBDC as the only legitimate digital alternative.

India's CBDC push also comes as the West retreats from central bank digital currency pilots. 

In the U.S., lawmakers have moved to ban a digital dollar outright. In Europe, the digital euro has faced pushback over privacy concerns.

However, New Delhi remains committed to its path. Goyal argued that the digital rupee would be easier, faster, and traceable, framing it as a modern replacement for cash rather than a speculative asset.

The approach risks making India an outlier in the region's fast-changing financial landscape.

As neighbors build frameworks to attract crypto firms and integrate digital assets into traditional finance, India's insistence on sidelining the crypto industry could leave its markets—and investors—at a disadvantage.

Whether the digital rupee can deliver the efficiencies promised remains to be seen.

What's clear is that, while much of the world is laying the groundwork for a crypto-powered financial future, India is choosing to chart its own course with state-backed money.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Institutional and corporate accumulation of Ethereum has reached a milestone, with treasury companies and spot exchange-traded funds collectively holding more than 10% of ETH's total supply.

According to data from StrategicETHReserve, the combined holdings have climbed to 12.48 million ETH, representing 10.31% of Ethereum's supply. 

Specifically, Ethereum treasury companies collectively hold around 5.66 million ETH, equivalent to 4.68% of supply. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs hold roughly 6.81 million ETH, or 5.63% of the total.



The data reflects growing confidence in Ethereum as a yield-generating asset and the continued institutionalization of its market infrastructure. The surge in ETF inflows in recent months has coincided with public companies such as BitMine and SharpLink adding ETH to their balance sheets — a trend often compared to the Bitcoin treasury movement led by Strategy.

In October, U.S. spot ether ETFs recorded $621.4 million in monthly net inflows, compared to inflows of $285.7 million in September and $3.9 billion in August, according to SoSoValue data.

On Monday, SharpLink said it has seen its unrealized profits surge past $900 million since launching its ETH treasury strategy in early June.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

India plans to double down on its central bank digital currency, Union Minister Piyush Goyal said on Monday at a government event in Doha, while reiterating the government's discouragement of cryptocurrencies.

According to an ANI news agency report, Goyal explained that the planned digital currency backed by the Reserve Bank of India aims to simplify transactions, reduce paper consumption, and enable faster, more traceable payments compared to traditional banking systems. The RBI has been piloting its CBDC, known as the digital rupee, since late 2022.

"Our idea is that this will only make it easier to transact. It will also reduce paper consumption and will be faster to transact than the banking system. But it will also have traceability," he said, according to the report.

The move signals the country's continued preference for state-backed digital money over private cryptocurrencies.

The minister noted that while India has not banned cryptocurrencies lacking central government backing, they are subject to heavy taxation to discourage their use. Reuters reported in September, citing a government document, that India is leaning against introducing comprehensive crypto legislation, arguing that regulating the asset class would effectively grant it "legitimacy."

India leads crypto adoption globally, with Asia Pacific solidifying its role as the global hub of grassroots crypto activity, according to a September Chainalysis report. India topped the global rankings for the second consecutive year, notably surpassing other countries in every criterion, including value received from retail centralized services, institutional services, and DeFi, the report stated.

The Ethereum price has recently demonstrated significant momentum, leading the altcoin market with a significant 13% increase over the past week. This surge has brought the cryptocurrency close to its all-time high, prompting a new wave of bullish predictions.

Analysts Forecast Further Gains

Market analyst Mags on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighted a key milestone for the Ethereum price: after 1,146 days of price consolidation, the market's second-largest cryptocurrency finally broke through the critical $4,000 level. 

Historically, Ethereum made three attempts to surpass this threshold, encountering setbacks each time. However, in August, the fourth attempt proved successful, and the token has been consolidating above the $4,000 mark for several months.

While there was a momentary setback when the price dipped to $3,800, bullish sentiment quickly returned, pushing the Ethereum price back above the $4,000 level and initiating a robust V-shaped recovery. 

This technical pattern, according to the analyst, is highly bullish for the leading altcoin, with Mags suggesting that the next upward leg could target a new record price for ETH of $7,331, also aligning with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level.

Potential Ethereum Price Surge To $10,000

Macroeconomic factors also play a significant role in Ethereum's potential for further gains. Analysts at CryptoQuant note that the US M2 money supply has entered a renewed expansion phase, hitting a record high of approximately $22.2 trillion. 

Bitcoin (BTC) was the first to reflect this increase, soaring by over 130% since 2022 and showing a strong correlation with M2 growth of around 0.9. By contrast, the Ethereum price performance has lagged behind, rising by just around 15% during the same period, a phenomenon dubbed “liquidity lag” by the analysts.

However, on-chain data compiled by CryptoQuant indicates that this gap may be narrowing. Notably, Ethereum's exchange reserves have decreased to roughly 16.1 million ETH, a drop of more than 25% since 2022. 

This suggests a structural decline in selling pressure, as netflows to exchanges remain consistently negative, indicating that ETH is being withdrawn for self-custody. Additionally, the Coinbase Premium Index has turned positive, signaling renewed interest from US institutional investors.

Past cycles have shown the Ethereum price tends to trail Bitcoin during the initial stages of monetary easing cycles. Yet, as Bitcoin's dominance dips below 60%, capital often rotates into the altcoin market, leading to a rise in the ETH/BTC ratio. 

CryptoQuant analysts assert this pattern appears to be re-emerging, hinting that the remainder of the year could see a shift away from a Bitcoin-centric market toward one driven by Ethereum and other altcoins.

If global liquidity continues to expand and the trend of outflows from exchanges persists, the Ethereum price may align more closely with M2 growth, entering a new phase of revaluation. In such a scenario, ETH's prospect of reaching $10,000 becomes increasingly possible, the analysts further added.

 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows on Monday, their biggest day since early November 2024, when Donald Trump was elected President of the US. 

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States clocked their second-biggest day of inflows in history as Bitcoin notched a new record high on Monday. 

The 11 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a cumulative $1.18 billion in inflows on the day, second only to Nov. 7, 2024, when the ETFs raked in $1.37 billion after Donald Trump won the election to become the next President of the United States.

The bumper day for the ETFs, which coincided with Bitcoin's new all-time high of over $126,000, brings October's total inflow to $3.47 billion across just four trading days, according to CoinGlass. 

Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have cumulatively raked in around $60 billion since their launch, Bloomberg's ETF analyst James Seyffart said on Monday on X. 

The massive demand for Bitcoin ETPs underscores the significant influence of institutional investors in this bull market, with retail investors reportedly still on the sidelines. 

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw the lion's share of the inflows with a whopping $967 million entering the product on Monday. The ETF has brought in $2.6 billion in inflows since the beginning of October.

The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) recorded an inflow of $112 million, the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) had $60 million, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) recorded $30 million. There were minor inflows for Invesco, WisdomTree, and Franklin's funds. 

The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is on the verge of surpassing $100 billion in assets under management, observed Nova Dius President Nate Geraci on Tuesday. 

According to the official website, IBIT has an AUM of almost $98.5 billion in Bitcoin and cash, and it holds 783,767 BTC. 

The world's largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, took more than 2,000 days to hit that mark, and IBIT is about to do it in under 450 days, said Geraci. Only 18 of over 4,500 trading ETFs have over $100 billion in AUM, he added.

India will introduce a digital currency backed by the Reserve Bank of India as part of a broader strategy to discourage private cryptocurrencies lacking sovereign or asset backing, Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal announced on Monday.

The "RBI-guaranteed" digital currency aims to simplify transactions, reduce paper consumption, and enable faster, traceable payments compared to traditional banking systems, Goyal said during discussions in Doha on Monday, according to an ANI report. 

The minister clarified that while India hasn't imposed an outright ban on crypto without central government backing, authorities are taxing them heavily to discourage use, “because we don't want anybody to be stuck at some point with a cryptocurrency that has no backing and nobody at the backend."

Goyal's announcement comes as India, Pakistan, and Vietnam lead global crypto activity, according to Chainalysis's 2025 Global Adoption Index, which shows the Asia-Pacific region recording a year-over-year growth in transaction volume from $1.4 trillion to $2.36 trillion.

Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that "Goyal's explicit claim simply reiterates that the government continues to see a CBDC as a core plank of its fintech strategy."

"The reference to 'backed by RBI guarantee' is substantial and not rhetorical as it seeks to contrast the state-issued digital currency as having superior legitimacy and security compared to 'unbacked' cryptos," Kapoor said, calling out “speculative tokens, meme coins, or ephemeral DeFi constructs lacking anchoring assets.”

He said India is likely to adopt “a hybrid regulatory framework” combining monetary and securities oversight, requiring crypto issuers to hold “verifiable fiat or commodity reserves in regulated custody and undergo regular third-party audits.”

The minister's remarks mark “a clear pivot toward stricter oversight,” Kapoor added, signaling India's shift from a “tax-and-tolerate” approach to “a tiered compliance regime that favors regulated, asset-backed tokens over volatile, unbacked ones.”

"India's plan for an RBI-backed digital rupee shows clear intent to merge trust with technology, similar to a state-guaranteed stablecoin,” Monica Jasuja, chief expansion and innovation officer at Emerging Payments Association Asia, told Decrypt.

"It signals confidence in regulated digital money over speculation, and for fintechs, the message is clear—build with the state, not outside it," Jasuja added.

She said that if India backs an RBI-issued digital rupee over private stablecoins, investors may see it as “a safer but narrower play,” with “confidence shifting toward compliance-aligned ventures” and away from speculative, crypto-native projects.

The RBI has already piloted the digital rupee in both retail and wholesale segments, giving India a head start in CBDC implementation. 

However, industry observers have recently warned that regulatory uncertainty has created a bureaucratic stalemate, with an estimated 80-85% of India's top crypto talent already relocated internationally, while the country struggles to establish clear frameworks for private cryptocurrencies.

The industry has also, for some time, viewed central bank digital currencies with a degree of skepticism, arguing that they move away from crypto's core thesis by handing the monetary reins to a centralized authority operating on permissioned blockchains.

"A lot needs to be addressed," Kapoor said, questioning how India intends to "calibrate privacy versus surveillance in a CBDC and in 'approved' token classes" to maintain user trust.

"Will the regulatory burden for token issuers be low enough to permit real competition, or will it favor incumbents?" he said. "How will India deal with foreign stablecoins or cross-border token flows that don't meet its 'asset-backed' rules?"

 Gold futures reached $4,000 per ounce for the first time amid surging demand for safe-haven assets. Analysts predict Bitcoin will follow suit. 

Gold prices have come within a few dollars of a milestone all-time high of $4,000 as investors escape to safe-haven assets — a trend that also looks bullish for Bitcoin. 

Prices for futures for gold tapped $4,000 per ounce for the first time early on Tuesday morning, while spot prices reached an all-time high of $3,976, according to TradingView.

“Gold is at a new record high,” observed goldbug and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Tuesday. “This is a clear warning that current Fed policy is wrong,” he added, calling for the US central bank to “reverse course immediately,” and raise interest rates.

Gold has had a stellar run this year, surging more than 50% since Jan. 1 amid escalating geopolitical tensions, trade tariff concerns, global inflation, and the debasement of fiat currencies. 

It has outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) over the same period, with the world's premier digital asset gaining just 33.5%. However, Bitcoin prices have followed gold, albeit with a lag, which could bode well for a massive end-of-year rally. 

“Gold's all-time high shows investors' demand for scarce assets. From here, we believe Bitcoin will be the better-performing asset of the two,” Apollo Capital's Henrik Andersson told Cointelegraph on Tuesday. 

“Gold hitting $4K is just another confirmation of the same dynamic supporting BTC,” added Justin d'Anethan, head of partnerships at crypto private markets firm Arctic Digital.

The move is more of a “mutual confirmation,” with both assets reacting to the same concerns: unchecked US deficits, softening dollar credibility, and rising geopolitical hedging, he said, adding:  

Bitcoin is lagging gold and the global M2 money supply, and “should adjust,” said analyst James Bull on X.

Last week, analyst and trader Ted Pillows said Bitcoin has been highly correlated with gold with an eight-week lag. 

With gold hitting new highs, Bitcoin will follow, he said, adding, “Maybe we could see another correction, but overall Q4 will be big for Bitcoin.”

Last week, Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin had resumed its correlation with gold, as both were nearing or had reached all-time highs. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of just over $126,000 during late trading on Monday. 

Litespark co-founder and CEO, and former head of PayPal, David Marcus, compared the two assets, saying on Monday that if Bitcoin were valued like gold, it would be worth $1.3 million.

PRESS RELEASE

Kawasaki and Tokyo, Japan, October 7, 2025

Toda Corporation, JTB Corp. and Fujitsu Limited today announced that they will carry out a field trial for “ECHIZEN Quest,” a tourism digital transformation (DX) project utilizing NFTs, in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, Japan. The field trial will run from November 2025 to the end of January and the project aims to increase the number of international tourists visiting Japan.

Echizen City in Fukui Prefecture anticipates a significant increase in tourism, including international visitors, due to improved accessibility such as the extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen. This initiative aims to revitalize the region by enhancing the quality of tourism experiences and expanding the visitor base and the number of supporters who actively engage with the region.Toda Corporation signed a public-private partnership agreement with Echizen City in 2021, promoting the smart city concept around the Hokuriku Shinkansen Echizen-Takefu Station. The company has focused on urban development and enhanced marketing driven by tourism, and has been engaged in demonstration experiments, such as investigating tourist behavior and transportation issues during local events [1].JTB launched its “GLOCAL Sustainability Project (GSP)” [2] in 2021 with the aim of solving regional challenges and creating new businesses. In 2024, JTB implemented a program set in Echizen City where Fujitsu employees proposed new tourism experiences leveraging NFTs after learning about local resources and challenges.Since 2023, Fujitsu and JTB have been jointly researching tourism DX services for affluent international visitors. As part of this collaboration, they have explored applying a digital currency leveraging NFT technology [3] for regional revitalization.With these activities converging around the same period, the three companies decided to collaborate and launch ECHIZEN Quest as a joint project to promote the region's appeal to the world.

● Toda Corporation: Overall project management and smart city infrastructure development● JTB Corp.: Tourism product planning, development, and promotion● Fujitsu Limited:  NFT issuance and provision of digital currency technology

ECHIZEN Quest engages visitors in a series of hands-on experiences across Echizen City's vibrant craft studios. Participants will delve into the creation of traditional items such as washi (traditional Japanese paper), uchihamono (hand-forged metal goods, particularly knives and tools), tansu (portable storage chests), lacquerware, and pottery, as well as modern industries like eyewear and textiles. Upon completing each experience, visitors will receive a unique NFT, depicting Murasaki Shikibu (historical Japanese novelist) serving as digital proof of their engagement. This NFT can be redeemed for local support or souvenirs. Designed for future expansion, the project aims to integrate these NFTs with a dedicated regional currency or point system, offering holders exclusive benefits like discounts and unique event access. This encourages participants to explore Echizen City with a sense of adventure, fostering a deeper understanding and affection for its local culture.

Looking ahead, Fujitsu plans to expand this model to other regions in Japan as a case study for protecting traditional culture and revitalizing local communities through digital technology.

Embeds images, audio, and video of various content into coins, offering them as a cashless payment "electronic currency." This technology utilizes blockchain, is collectible, and can host advertisements (Fujitsu patented).

The two figures were caught discussing death-defying science while walking with the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. Did the world's most notorious rulers just unlock eternal life?



Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

For some communist and authoritarian leaders, “term limits” are more or less dictated by how long they can manage to live. But what if these politicians weren't bound by the constraints of a typical human lifespan? A recent conversation caught on a hot mic between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping suggests these infamous rulers really could achieve immortality—and that it could be right around the corner.

“Biotechnology is continuously developing,” Putin's translator said in Chinese at a military parade held in Beijing, China, earlier this week. He later continued, “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.”

Xi responded, “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”

North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un accompanied Putin and Xi at the parade, though it's unclear whether the conversation was being translated for him as well. The state-run CCTV broadcast livestreamed the discussion to billions of people, including several U.S. media outlets. 

So, is anything stopping these notorious figures from ruling forever? While Putin and Xi make it seem like achieving immortality is closer than ever, the science suggests otherwise. 

For starters, donating organs for medical treatment alone is hard, and it's not because there aren't enough donors. In fact, thousands of organs are wasted every year after surgeons decline them in hopes of obtaining younger samples. For the same reason, 13 patients on the transplant waitlist die each day on average, according to the U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration, so it's hard to imagine further straining an already overwhelmed system.

Despite the transplant pipeline's difficulties, longevity enthusiasts are still optimistic, and conducting new research on how organ transplants—even unconventional ones—could extend the average lifespan beyond what was ever before thought possible. 

Five years ago, for instance, a team from the Yale School of Medicine managed to revive a slaughterhouse pig's brain after it was deprived of oxygen for four hours. Using a resuscitation machine called BrainEx, the team pumped preservative agents and drugs into the brain. Miraculously, the brain cells began producing proteins, and the neurons displayed signs of metabolic activity, both of which are basic cellular functions that make your body's control center run. 

For those seeking immortality, this may seem promising. If the transplant list for “living” organs is so long, the next best thing must be to revive dead ones. But unfortunately, it's not that simple.

While the pig's brain was undergoing necessary cellular processes, it was far from alive, let alone conscious, according to researchers. So it seems like the possibility of using resuscitated organs to extend the human lifespan is dead on arrival—literally. 

Still other researchers are avoiding the need to find organs at all—dead or alive—by making their own. The authors of one 2025 article published in MIT Technology Review argue for the creation of “bodyoids,” or spare body parts made of immature stem cells. The bodyoids would be cultured using methods that prevent brain development, so the organic blobs wouldn't be capable of feeling pain, nor be conscious of their Frankenstein fate. Still, growing spare parts remains somewhat of a sci-fi dream. Researchers say it's out of the realm of possibility—at least for now. 

Ironically, both Putin and Xi are at the ripe age of 72. So it makes sense why the two leaders would begin obsessing over what comes next—even if that means experimental transplant treatments to extend their lives. However, it seems immortality is just out of reach for even the world's most powerful figures.

The familial statue mixed together different styles of craftsmanship in a way never before seen in ancient Egyptian culture.

Here's what you will learn when you read this story:

Archaeologists discovered a 4,300-year-old limestone sculpture may offer unique insight into the artistic history of ancient Egypt. Known as the “family statue,” it was likely initially found by looters centuries ago, only to be tossed aside and eventually buried under layers of sand. It was rediscovered in 2021 during excavations at Gisr El-Mudir in Saqqara, and now, famed archaeologists Zahi Hawass and Sarah Abdoh have analyzed the find, publishing a study on the piece in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. That study illustrated for the first time just how crucial the statue could be to understanding ancient Egyptian craftsmanship. The statue can be seen here.

The statue depicts a man standing with his left foot forward (likely as a sign of strength) wearing a wig and kilt, and boasting a toned torso. A woman, who experts presume to be his wife, is shown on a smaller scale, kneeling and clinging to his right leg; she is also wearing a wig and a simple dress. To the male figure's left side, a young girl (likely the man's daughter) stands in the bas-relief sculpture style holding a goose in one hand and her presumed-father's leg in the other. 

Hawass wrote on his website that the Gisr El-Mudir family statue offers a singular example of craftsmanship from the Old Kingdom's fifth dynasty. “Unlike any other extant family statue, all members, except the daughter, are rendered in full three-dimensionality,” he wrote. “The daughter, meanwhile, is articulated in high relief—a sculptural technique rarely encountered in Old Kingdom statuary.”

The hybrid style of the sculpture represents a distinct artistic experiment from 4,300 years ago—one that might fill a gap in the chronology of Egyptian sculptural techniques. The high relief style is typically attributed to the more recent Ptolemaic period, but the Gisr El-Mudir example “demonstrates a mastery of high relief” much earlier in the historic timeline.

Adding an extra layer of intrigue to the statue, it wasn't found in a tomb or a chapel, the study authors wrote. Found under a layer of sand, the statue was instead near a false door with the name “Messi.” In ancient Egyptian funerary practice, a false door offered a symbolic way for a deceased's soul to travel between the worlds of the living and the dead. 

“The presence of this feature, in combination with the family grouping of the statue,” Hawass wrote, “strongly indicates an underlying ideology centered on the perpetuation of familial bonds in the afterlife, paralleling their relationships in life. The absence of inscriptions within the tomb further emphasizes the reliance on visual, rather than textural, communication of status and ritual.” 

Take, for instance, the inclusion of a goose in the daughter's hands. This element adds a domestic aspect to the statue that coincides with what's regularly seen drawn on tomb walls of the period. This emphasizes the importance of daily life in the family, and the reunion they expected in the afterlife. The goose could also represent the family's hope for prosperity—and sustenance—in the afterlife.  

Hawass wrote that the statue offers a fresh perspective on sculpture styling in ancient Egypt—one that requires a new look at how Old Kingdom artisans crafted their work. This once-discarded family portrait might just reshape our understanding of art in the ancient world.

South Africa's Coast Is Rising—And Scientists Have a New Explanation Why

Human water management contributes to sinking land across the globe, and it may also be responsible for an unexpected rise

By Avery Schuyler Nunn edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Land rising along South Africa's coast may be closely tied to humans' use of water.

For decades geologists thought the slow rise of South Africa's southern coast was driven by forces deep below—buoyant plumes of molten rock ascending through Earth's mantle and heaving the crust upward over millions of years. But now satellite data and precise GPS measurements are tilting such assumptions off their axis. A study in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth suggests this land rise may have less to do with deep tectonic forces and more to do with missing groundwater just under our feet.

Human activity has long been depleting South Africa's groundwater. In 2018, after grappling with severe droughts for years, the country came close to a full-blown water emergency when Cape Town was nearly the world's first major city to literally run out of water—a scenario dubbed “Day Zero.” For several months that year the city's residents faced the very real prospect of having to regularly queue for critically limited water supplies, an outcome staved off only by timely rainfall and intensive water-saving campaigns. The extreme shortage resulted from a combination of climate change and unsustainable water use, which drained surface reservoirs and placed mounting pressure on aquifers across the region.

The recent study hypothesizes that the ground, once compressed by the sheer weight of the surface water and groundwater above it, is now expanding like a foam mattress relieved of pressure. Using GPS and satellite gravity data from between 2000 and 2021, the researchers detected a roughly six-millimeter rise in the land surface—a shift that coincides with humans' depletion of South Africa's water reserves and periods of drought.

“Sometimes the first explanation isn't necessarily the right one,” says University of Bonn geodesist Christian Mielke, the study's lead author. “Perhaps it isn't plate tectonics after all.”

That misunderstanding, not necessarily the rising land itself, may be the most striking thing about South Africa's situation. What was once chalked up to the slow churning of Earth's mysterious and inaccessible interior may instead reflect human activity, especially our management—or mismanagement—of water.

“The presence of water, either as ice and snow on the land surface or as groundwater below, and the removal of that water are intimately tied to the deformation of the ground's surface,” says Stanford University geophysicist Rosemary Knight. In most places around the globe, this process usually leads to sinking, called land subsidence, to fill the gap.

But in South Africa, the new study suggests, that tie between water and land movement shows up in a surprising way. During the rainy season, rivers and reservoirs fill, adding weight that presses the crust down. In the dry months, much of that water either evaporates or gets pumped away, and the land rebounds upward. Over time the long-term loss of groundwater tips the balance toward uplift rather than sinking.

This “seasonal breathing” is the giveaway that the cause is probably not solely a mantle plume. If molten rock were pushing upward, the motion would be steady, not tied to rainfall cycles. The expansion, if verified, could be yet another example of the ways human water use is reshaping the planet.

From 1945 to 1970 more than 13,000 square kilometers of California's San Joaquin Valley, once hailed as a “land of milk and honey” for Dust Bowl migrants, sank by at least 30 centimeters—and in some places by nearly nine meters. The San Joaquin sinking has only sped up since then, and parts of the valley drop more than 30 centimeters a year during severe droughts. On average, the pace has accelerated by 70 percent from the mid-20th century.

Something similar is happening to the Chesapeake Bay, which, with its sweeping estuaries and lush tidal wetlands, is one of the U.S. East Coast's most ecologically significant regions. Here land subsidence—driven by both groundwater extraction from aquifers and the lingering effects of ancient glacial shifts—is accelerating flood risk and relative sea-level rise. Satellite data, tide gauge records and projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest that by 2100 the combination of subsidence and sea-level rise could inundate up to 1,100 square kilometers of the Chesapeake Bay's coastline.

Mielke notes that such findings highlight the complexity of the planet's response to human-induced environmental change. The consequences are still gradually being uncovered, and the implications may be profound. As climate change accelerates, land movements could exacerbate other challenges, especially in coastal areas with rising seas.

To monitor such hidden shifts on a global scale, scientists use the GRACE satellite mission (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) to detect changes in Earth's mass by measuring minuscule variations in gravity. Because water has weight, depleting or replenishing groundwater subtly alters the planet's gravitational field, which GRACE can detect from orbit.

Knight and other researchers are looking for ways to keep land from shifting on such a vast scale by maintaining a careful balance. “Basically you get subsidence when water out exceeds water in,” Knight says. “And for water in, the term that's used is ‘recharge.'”

Some recharge happens naturally as rain or snowmelt soaks into the soil, but this precipitation isn't enough to offset decades of groundwater extraction and current demand. That's why places such as California are now turning to managed aquifer recharge: strategically spreading excess surface water (such as winter floodwaters) across land where it can percolate into the ground and rebuild depleted reserves, or injecting water directly into aquifers. Estimates suggest there is space underground for a total amount of water 30 times the volume of California's Shasta Lake, enough to begin reversing the land's descent.

As Knight puts it, the solution can't be about just cutting back on groundwater pumping. It must involve replenishment: restoring water to the ground from which it was drawn.

Consumption of sweeteners and sweetness enhancers (S&SEs) is a popular strategy to reduce sugar intake, but the role of S&SEs in body weight regulation and gut microbiota composition remains debated. Here, we show that S&SEs in a healthy diet support weight loss maintenance and beneficial gut microbiota shifts in adults with overweight or obesity. In this multi-centre, randomized, controlled trial, we included 341 adults and 38 children with overweight or obesity. Adults followed a 2-month low-energy diet for ≥5% weight loss, followed by a 10-month healthy ad libitum diet with <10% energy from sugars. One group replaced sugar-rich products with S&SE products (S&SEs group), while the other did not (sugar group). Primary outcomes included changes in body weight and gut microbiota composition at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included changes in cardiometabolic parameters. The S&SEs group, compared to the sugar group, maintained greater weight loss at 1 year (1.6 ± 0.7 kg, P = 0.029) and exhibited distinct gut microbiota shifts, with increased short-chain fatty acid and methane-producing taxa (q ≤ 0.05). No significant differences were observed in cardiometabolic markers or in children. Overall, our findings indicate that prolonged consumption of S&SEs in a healthy diet is a safe strategy for obesity management. ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT04226911.

The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased globally, raising the risk of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)1,2. A shift towards a Westernized diet (high in saturated fat and added sugar, low in dietary fibre) has been proposed to be a key contributor to the development of obesity-related cardiometabolic complications3. Added sugar, in particular, increases dietary energy density, which may lead to greater energy intake and the development of obesity.

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) strongly recommended that free sugar intake should be less than 10% of total energy intake (E%) and preferably even less than 5 E% as a conditional recommendation4. The latter is still not being fulfilled by large parts of the global population, including Denmark, Greece, Spain and the Netherlands5,6,7,8,9. One common strategy to reduce sugar intake is replacing it with S&SEs. Consequently, the worldwide consumption of foods and beverages containing S&SEs has substantially increased over recent years10.

Although S&SEs are generally considered safe, their long-term effects on cardiometabolic health remain debated. Cohort studies have raised concerns about potential risks, prompting the WHO to issue a conditional recommendation against using non-sugar sweeteners for weight control or reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases4,11,12. Nevertheless, observational evidence is not in line with data from short-term studies13,14, and the limited number of long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown neutral or beneficial effects, including modest weight loss and no negative impact on T2D or CVD risk markers13,14. Like the WHO, the overall review conclusions seem to depend on which evidence the authors choose to cite and emphasize15.

Another emerging concern is the potential impact of S&SEs on gut microbiota composition. Some studies suggest that S&SEs may alter the gut microbiota, potentially affecting metabolic health13. A previous study14 demonstrated a link between saccharin-induced alterations in the gut microbiota and glucose intolerance in mice. In addition, in a small post hoc human trial, they showed that supplementation of saccharin (5 mg kg−1 day−1) for 1 week increased glycaemic response, which was associated with microbiota alterations in a small group of study participants clustered as ‘responders', while no response was found in the other participants (‘non-responders')14. The poor glycaemic response in the ‘responders' was replicated in mice upon faecal transplantation. Interestingly, the microbiota composition of responders was distinct before saccharin exposure, suggesting individual variability in response to S&SEs and the potential for the gut microbiome to predict susceptibility. The same group later exhibited person-specific gut microbiome shifts related to altered glycaemic responses following 2 weeks of S&SE supplementation at doses lower than the acceptable daily intake compared to sachet-contained vehicle glucose or no supplement16. However, other studies14 and a crossover RCT found no effect of saccharin, sucralose or aspartame on gut microbiota or glucose regulation after 2 weeks in healthy individuals14,15. A recent cohort study linked sugar-sweetened beverage intake to gut microbiota changes and metabolites associated with diabetes risk17. These conflicting results highlight the controversy in the current evidence. Controlled, long-term studies are needed to directly assess the impact of replacing sugar with S&SEs on microbiota and metabolic outcomes.

Although the inclusion of S&SEs in sugar-reduced diets may assist in sustaining weight loss by improving palatability and adherence, the long-term effects of S&SE intake on the gut microbiota and their potential influence on cardiometabolic health and safety remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this RCT in the SWEET project (‘Sweeteners and sweetness enhancers: prolonged effects on health, obesity and safety') was to assess the effect of combined and prolonged use of S&SEs (in both foods and drinks)—as part of a healthy sugar-reduced ad libitum diet—on weight loss maintenance, cardiometabolic risk factors and gut microbiota composition in adults with overweight or obesity. In children with overweight or obesity, the trial focused on weight control and cardiometabolic outcomes18.

We reasoned that the inclusion of S&SEs in foods and drinks would increase the palatability of the diet and thereby compliance with the recommendations for a healthy sugar-reduced diet, resulting in improved control of body weight and related risk factors, with no effect on gut microbiota or other safety concerns associated with their long-term use compared with a diet excluding S&SEs. The primary outcomes were 1-year changes in body weight and gut microbiota composition in adults. Secondary outcomes included 1-year changes in risk factors for T2D and CVD, body mass index (BMI)-for-age z-score in children, intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content, the occurrence of (serious) adverse events (AEs), gastrointestinal symptoms and use of concomitant medication in adults with overweight or obesity.

In total, 341 adults and 38 children were included, and 203 adults and 22 children (60% and 58%) completed the 1-year trial. The number of participants in each intervention group is shown in Fig. 1. The most common causes for dropout were either personal reasons or unknown. All explanations for dropout and exclusion can be found in Extended Data Table 1. This trial was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, we encountered obstacles such as disrupted participant follow-up, increased dropout rates and logistical challenges related to travel restrictions and safety protocols. For the analysis of gut microbiota composition, a subgroup of 137 adults was included (Copenhagen, n = 26; Pamplona, n = 26; Harokopio, n = 25; Maastricht, n = 60).

Flow chart of participant enrollment, allocation, and follow-up in the study. A total of 868 individuals were pre-screened, with 379 randomized into two groups: the sugar group (n = 189) and the S&SEs group (n = 190). The figure shows exclusions, dropouts, and the number of adults and children completing each study visit (CID1–CID4) at baseline (M0), weight loss (WL)/weight stability (WS) (M2), mid-weight maintenance (WM) (M6), and after weight maintenance (M12), including the adult microbiota subgroup.

The baseline visit (month 0, M0) was completed by 95% of the included adults (median (Q1–Q3) age, 47 years (40–50 years), 71% female; Table 1). The majority (95% of the adults and 92% of the children) had citizenship in the country in which the trial was conducted, and 3.4% of the adults and 14% of the children reported that they belonged to a minority group (self-reported). The 277 adults who completed the weight loss period lost 10.1 ± 3.6 kg (mean ± s.d.) with no difference between the groups (Extended Data Table 2). The participant characteristics after the weight loss period (M2) are shown in Table 1.

For children, 95% of the included participants completed the baseline visit (median (Q1–Q3) age 10 years (9–11 years), 61% girls; Supplementary Table 1). The 28 children who completed M2 and had a parent who achieved ≥5% weight loss tended to lose weight (−0.5 ± 0.14 kg, P = 0.07) and increase height (1.2 ± 0.8 cm, P < 0.0001), resulting in a 0.19 ± 0.18 reduction in BMI-for-age z-score (P < 0.0001). The changes in body weight (mean ± s.d., sugar group, −0.6 ± 1.6 kg versus S&SEs group, −0.4 ± 1.2 kg), height (sugar group, 1.4 ± 0.8 cm versus S&SEs group, 1.0 ± 0.7 cm) and BMI-for-age z-score (sugar group, −0.22 ± 0.20 versus S&SEs group, −0.17 ± 0.14) did not differ between the groups (P = 0.65, P = 0.31 and P = 0.66, respectively) (Supplementary Table 1). Waist and hip circumferences were also reduced (mean ± s.d., 1.2 ± 2.5 cm, P = 0.02 and −1.3 ± 3.4 cm, P = 0.047, respectively) with no differences between groups (P > 0.05). No other changes were observed at M2 (Supplementary Table 1).

The adults' body weight over time (in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population) is shown in Fig. 2. The 1-year change in adult body weight (M12 − M0) was −6.4 ± 6.5 kg (mean ± s.d.) for the whole ITT population. A similar lowering of body weight (−6.3 ± 7.2 kg) was observed for completers (Extended Data Fig. 1b). For the ITT population (last observation carried forward), the S&SEs group maintained a 1.6 ± 0.7 kg larger weight loss (mean ± s.e.m., P = 0.03) than the sugar group (Table 2). For completers, the difference was similar but not significant (1.7 ± 1.0 kg, P = 0.08) (Table 2). An interaction between time and intervention group was observed (P = 0.0002), with the sugar group weighing more than the S&SEs group at M4 (1.0 ± 0.5 kg, P = 0.04), M6 (1.6 ± 0.5 kg, P = 0.002), M9 (2.1 ± 0.6 kg, P = 0.0002) and M12 (1.7 ± 0.5 kg, P = 0.002). Imputation of missing body weight values for the ITT population based on the same model showed that the S&SEs group maintained a 1.8 ± 0.7 kg larger weight loss (mean ± s.e.m.) (P = 0.01) than the sugar group (Table 2).

For the 74 adult participants who dropped out after successful weight loss, missing data are imputed by the last observation carried forward. Body weight was measured in the fasting state except at months 0.5, 1, 4 and 9. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using ANCOVA linear mixed models. Interaction time × group: P < 0.0001. Post hoc analyses: groups differ *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Error bars, s.e.m.

Source data

Per-protocol analyses were carried out using the compliance scores (Table 2 and Extended Data Table 3). Results for participants scoring at least two points resulted in similar weight differences between groups as the ITT and completers analyses. However, by increased dietary compliance, the weight difference between groups increased (participants scoring three or four points). In both cases, the S&SEs group had the largest weight loss maintenance (Table 2).

The clinical characteristics of the subgroup analysed for gut microbiota (n = 137) were comparable to those of the total adult population (n = 341) (Supplementary Table 2). Consistent with the findings in all adults of the total study population, the gut microbiota subgroup showed significantly lower body weight regain in the S&SEs group compared to the sugar group over 1 year (3.4 ± 0.7 kg versus 5.6 ± 0.8 kg, P = 0.016) (Supplementary Table 2).

The trends in alpha diversity change over time was not different between groups (Supplementary Fig. 1). We observed a significant interaction between overall microbiota composition change in time and intervention group (PERMANOVA, time × group interaction, P < 0.005) (Fig. 3). A total of 46 taxa exhibited differential trends in relative abundance over time between the groups (Extended Data Fig. 2).

The first two constraint axes are plotted, and the amount of variation captured by an axis is displayed in parentheses after the axis name. Individual samples are represented by points; the shape corresponds to the collection time point (CID) and the colour corresponds to the intervention group; samples from the same individual but different CIDs are connected by a line. Black arrows show the direction and relative size of the variables' influence on ordination. The significance of the interaction between time and group was tested with PERMANOVA, and results for each distance are indicated.

The distinct shift in microbial communities between groups over time revealed increased overall abundance of multiple short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing genera in the S&SEs group, including Megasphaera, Megamonas, Dialister, Catenibacterium, Eubacterium eligens, Lachnospiraceae ND3007, Prevotella, Alloprevotella, Porphyromonas, Butyricimonas, Oscillospira, Eubacterium siraeum and CAG:56 (Fig. 4a–j,m,o–p and Extended Data Fig. 2). In line with this finding, higher abundances of SCFA-producing families were observed in the S&SEs group for Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaceae and Porophyromonadaceae (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). Additionally, higher abundances for other SCFA-producing families were found in the S&SEs group compared to the sugar group (Peptococcaceae, Actinomycetaceae, Peptostreptococcales, Tissierellales and Clostridia vadinBB60; Supplementary Fig. 2d–g). Only three genera—Saccharimonadales, Candidatus Competibacter and Clostridium sensu stricto 1—exhibited lower abundance in the S&SEs group compared to the sugar group (Fig. 4k,l,n), corresponding to the lower abundance of Saccharimonadales and Competibacteraceae at the family level (Supplementary Fig. 2h,i).

The y axis shows CSS normalized and log-transformed read counts (abundance), and the x axis indicates time (month). Coloured by intervention groups, straight lines indicate the fit of a simple linear regression with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The lines signify the mean of each group, with dashed lines and squares denoting the S&SEs group and solid lines and dots for the sugar group. Statistical importance of differences in trends between groups was tested with linear mixed-effect models as implemented in LinDa; outcomes are indicated above. P values adjusted using false discovery rate.

Additionally, among the most strongly affected genera with a higher abundance in the S&SEs group was Methanolobus, a methane (CH4)-producing genus (Fig. 4q). This pattern was also observed for Methanosarcinacea at the family level (Supplementary Fig. 2j). Several taxa, such as Megasphaera, Catenibacterium and Methanolobus, were different between groups at baseline. However, the outcomes remained the same, and the observed pattern aligns closely with taxa that showed no differences at the baseline.

Pathway analyses executed by PICRUSt2 MetaCyc pathways showed that in the S&SE group, methanogenesis (METHANOGENESIS-PWY, coenzyme F430 biosynthesis (PWY-5196), methyl-coenzyme M oxidation to CO2 I (PWY-5209), superpathway of methanogenesis (PWY-6830), tetrahydromethanopterin biosynthesis (PWY-6148)) was upregulated, reflecting enhanced CH4-producing potential (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). In line with the increased abundance of SCFA-producing taxa, SCFA fermentation pathways are potentially upregulated (notably acetate, P341-PWY, PWY-5517, 5532, 6344, 6328, 6185, 5392). Additionally, aromatic compound degradation (PWY-5430, PWY-6185) and l-arabinose degradation (PWY-5517) also show upregulation, suggesting higher breakdown of complex plant-derived compounds and carbohydrates. Finally, compounds related to aromatic amino acids (chorismate), vitamin biosynthesis and cofactor production (PWY-6160, PWY-6165, PWY-5507) are upregulated. Downregulated pathways in the S&SE group highlight a reduction in photosynthesis (chlorophyll biosynthesis), polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis (for example, linoleate biosynthesis, PWY-5995) and phospholipid remodelling (PWY-7409).

Analysis of the microbiota patterns in responders and non-responders was done by random forest analysis. This analysis showed that change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight regain after weight loss in the S&SEs group but not in the sugar group could be predicted with a degree of confidence (Extended Data Fig. 4). With reasonable accuracy, baseline microbiota composition (M0) classified individuals that did not change or decreased HbA1c during weight maintenance (WM) (responders) versus those that showed an increase in HbA1c (aea under the curve (AUC), 0.76; Fig. 5). Furthermore, microbial composition after weight loss (M2) gave a weaker but reasonable prediction of the extent of body weight regain (AUC, 0.69), indicating the presence of detectable differences in microbiota composition between responders and non-responders. Notably, microbiota composition after weight loss (M2) performed considerably worse in predicting change in HbA1c (AUC, 0.62) than at baseline. Taxa significantly contributing to the classification of HbA1c with microbial composition at baseline included Petrotoga, SH_PL14, Acetobacter, CAG:56, Faecalibacterium and Desulfotomaculales. At M2, the key taxa were Rothia, TMX7 and Flavonifractor (Fig. 5). For body weight classification with microbial composition at M2, important taxa included Turicibacter, Family_XIII_AD3011, Eisenbergiella and Hungatella.

Facet labels indicate the index used to define responders or non-responders and the CID from which samples were used to build the model. ROC curve colours indicate the nature of the response variable used: green for the original definition of responders or non-responders, and red for a randomly assigned definition. b, Genera that significantly contributed to the classifications shown in a. If a genus was not taxonomically assigned, the lowest assigned taxonomic level was used as the name, preceded by a capital letter indicating the taxonomic rank. The x axis shows each taxon's numeric contribution to classification, and the y axis lists the corresponding taxa. Facet labels indicate the classification group (Resp, responders; NonResp, non-responders) for which contribution was measured, or the mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) for the model overall. Bar colour reflects significance (P value); grey bars indicate no significant contribution. P values were estimated with a permutation test as implemented in the rfPermute package with no adjustment for multiple testing.

In the total RCT (n = 341), Bristol stool scale (BSS) values were collected on all clinical investigation days (CIDs). No differences in BSS scores were observed between groups at the different time points. Both the S&SEs and sugar groups experienced more constipation or harder lumps after weight loss (M2), based on the decrease in BSS score (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively) with a shift towards types one and two (Supplementary Fig. 3a). During the WM period, BSS scores increased in the S&SEs group (M2 versus M12, P = 0.014), with the most substantial difference observed between M2 (after weight loss) and M6 (P = 0.023) with a shift towards more normal stool types (types three and four) (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). For the sugar group, no differences in BSS scores were observed during the WM period (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Overall, changes over time as well as differences between groups were minor.

For both adults and children, total sugars constituted 15 E% at baseline (M0) (Supplementary Table 4). Large variability was observed for food groups at M0, and intake was not normally distributed, especially for S&SE-containing foods. Data on added sugar intake was only available from the Danish nutritional software (n = 52) and showed that adults in the S&SEs group reduced E% of added sugar by 3.4 ± 1.2 percentage points more than the sugar group (P = 0.05). For all adults, total sugar intake was reduced by 12.0 ± 5.5 g day−1 (P = 0.03) (2.4 ± 0.9 percentage points, P = 0.01) more in the S&SEs group than the sugar group. No other differences were observed for adults or children (Supplementary Table 4).

Both adults and children reduced their total intake of sugar-rich products by 142 ± 240 g day−1 (mean ± s.d.) (P < 0.0001) and 163 ± 187 g day−1 (P = 0.008), respectively. For adults, the S&SEs group had a 107 ± 31 g day−1 larger reduction in sugar-rich products than the sugar group (P = 0.0007), whereas no differences between groups were observed for children (P = 0.36). For S&SE-containing products, adults reduced the total amount of S&SE products in the sugar group and increased it in the S&SE group (difference of 229 ± 36 g day−1, P < 0.0001). For children, the difference of 237 ± 110 g day−1 between groups tended to differ but was not significant (P = 0.07) (Supplementary Table 4). For adults, the differences between groups were mainly explained by consumption of beverages, milk, sugar, honey or jam and candy (Supplementary Table 5). Data for other products can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

In the subgroup for microbiota analyses, data on energy intake, S&SE intake, added sugar intake and urinary S&SE excretion patterns reflected the total study population (Supplementary Table 6).

Change in urinary nitrogen excretion (reflecting protein intake) at M6 and M12 was similar in both groups. Likewise, there were no differences in excretion of glucose, sucrose and fructose. Biomarkers of S&SE intake, except Steviol acyl glucuronide, increased in the S&SE group and decreased in the sugar group (P < 0.001 at M12). The 1-year change in excretion was generally larger than the change at M6 (Extended Data Table 4).

In addition, no differences between groups in a subgroup at Maastricht were found in physical activity, including sedentary time, moderate or vigorous physical activity and step count (all P ≥ 0.1) (Supplementary Table 7).

For adult completers, the S&SEs group had a larger reduction in BMI, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) at M6 than the sugar group (Table 3). At M12, however, only hip circumference was significantly more reduced in the S&SEs group (1.8 ± 0.8 cm) than the sugar group (P = 0.04), whereas total cholesterol, BMI and waist circumference tended to differ (P ≤ 0.1). Otherwise, no differences were observed (Table 3). Similarly, no differences in risk markers for T2D and CVD were found between groups in the subgroup for the gut microbiota analysis (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the 1-year change in IHL content during the WM period, determined in a subgroup at Maastricht (n = 27), remained similar between the S&SEs and sugar groups (1.0 ± 0.8% versus 0.4 ± 0.2%, respectively; P = 0.213) (Table 3).

Between M0 and M12, the BMI-for-age z-score of the children decreased by 0.30 ± 0.39 (P = 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 4), with no differences between groups (sugar group, −0.25 ± 0.38 versus S&SEs group, −0.34 ± 0.41, P = 0.48) (Supplementary Table 8). There were also no differences in other outcomes (all P ≥ 0.18) (Supplementary Table 8).

Nine serious AEs were reported during the WM period, of which five were in the sugar group and four were in the S&SEs group (Extended Data Table 5). The serious AEs in the sugar group included a surgical procedure unrelated to the intervention, a shoulder lesion caused by an accident, postoperative ileus unrelated to the intervention and angina pectoris, in which the participants recovered without further consequences. Furthermore, one participant in the sugar group was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. In the S&SEs group, the serious AEs included laparoscopic cholecystectomy, diverticulitis and pulmonary embolism, in which the participants recovered without further consequences. Additionally, one participant in the S&SEs group reported a serious AE, involving an illness of which no specific details were disclosed and was not presumed to be serious.

During the WM period, the number of reported AEs was higher in the S&SEs group than in the sugar group, of which the S&SEs group was found to be a predictor (P = 0.047) (Extended Data Table 5). In addition, the number of AEs related to gastrointestinal symptoms was higher in the S&SEs group than in the sugar group (P = 0.026) (Extended Data Table 5). More specifically, the S&SEs group reported more abdominal pain or cramps (P = 0.012), loose stools (P = 0.014) and excess intestinal gas (P = 0.002).

For concomitant medications, the use of S&SEs did not result in a differential use of total concomitant medication (P = 0.775) (Supplementary Table 9). Only for hormonal agents was the amount of reported concomitant medication lower in the S&SEs group, and the S&SEs group was found to be a predictor (P = 0.035). However, when analysing the type of hormonal agents separately, no differences were found between groups in reported glucocorticoids, sex hormones or thyroid drugs (P = 0.649, P = 0.491 and P = 1.000, respectively).

A slightly better weight loss maintenance at 1 year was observed in adults consuming S&SE products compared with those who did not (sugar group), both in the context of healthy diets low in added sugars. The improved weight loss maintenance was accompanied by altered gut microbiota composition, with a higher abundance of SCFA-producing and CH4-producing bacterial taxa in the S&SEs group. Furthermore, the S&SE diet led to significantly larger decreases in BMI, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C and non-HDL-C at 6 months and in hip circumference after 1 year. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate long-term beneficial health impacts of S&SE intake in adults with overweight or obesity.

Both groups maintained a large weight loss after 1 year, with the S&SEs group achieving a 1.6 kg greater weight loss. Participants reduced sugar intake twice as much in the S&SEs group, suggesting that replacing sugar with S&SEs supports WM better. The combined scoring system also demonstrated that the highest level of dietary compliance resulted in the largest weight difference (3.8 kg), suggesting that more consistent adherence could further amplify the observed differences after 1 year, making the results more clinically relevant. Our trial demonstrated almost twice as large a difference in body weight compared to the systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) of the WHO, in which an average weight loss of 0.71 kg with S&SEs was reported. The WHO SRMA, however, included studies with different durations and control groups, and the main effect was driven by interventions comparing S&SEs with added sugar as the control, whereas the present trial used a healthy sugar-reduced diet as the control. Consistently, most clinical studies or meta-analyses reported no effects or even beneficial effects of S&SEs on body weight control19,20. Notably, the recommendations of the WHO SRMA were conditional, meaning that the assessment panel was less confident regarding their judgement and that the link between S&SEs and disease outcomes might be confounded by baseline characteristics of participants and complicated patterns of S&SEs use. Therefore, reverse causality and the influence of other lifestyle factors are probably in the population-based studies upon which the recommendations were mainly based21. To support this idea, a recent substitution analysis of prospective cohort studies found that intake of S&SE beverages was associated with a reduction in body weight, incidence of obesity, coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality compared with sugar-sweetened beverages and was no different than water when the influence of reverse causality and residual confounding was mitigated22.

As previously mentioned, different conclusions in prior studies and reviews could arise from differences in the choice of comparator, such as a control contributing with (for example, sugar) or without energy (for example, water)23,24. Recently, the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DSNG) of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) addressed the limitations of previous SRMAs25. In their SRMA, they found that S&SE-sweetened beverages reduced body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors24 and were associated with reductions in both risk of obesity and CVD outcomes22 when replacing sugar-sweetened beverages. This analysis and the critiques on joint analyses of energy and non-energy comparators led to the second WHO-commissioned SRMA, which included the intended replacement of energy-containing sugars with low and no-energy sweeteners. The present trial aimed to meet the previous critiques both in terms of trial duration (1 year) and choice of comparator26,27,28.

In the present trial, significant reductions in some CVD risk markers were observed at M6 in the S&SEs group compared with the sugar group, but these did not last until M12. Fading compliance and/or a decreased number of participants in the last part of the trial might explain this difference. Still, urinary excretion of S&SEs was significantly higher in the S&SEs group versus the sugar group at M12, so the lack of significant differences is probably a result of the lower number of participants. We observed no effects of the S&SE diet on risk markers for T2D and CVD, including IHL content, upon 10 months of S&SE intake. Therefore, our findings from our 1-year intervention study are consistent with those from the WHO SRMA on short-term RCTs29, and together, these data do not support the notion of potential undesirable health effects with long-term use of S&SEs4.

Previous short-term RCTs (1–12 weeks) have indicated AEs of S&SEs on glycaemic response, which was driven by alterations in gut microbial composition and functionality; however, the data are not consistent14,16,30. In the current trial, distinct shifts in gut microbiota composition were observed in a subgroup of the S&SEs group, characterized by a higher abundance of taxa associated with SCFA and CH4 production. Additionally, pathway analysis inferred by PICRUSt2 MetaCyc pathways confirmed an increase in methanogenesis, and potentially in fermentation and SCFA production, among other pathways. SCFAs are known to promote beneficial health effects, such as increased energy expenditure through enhanced lipid oxidation and improved satiety by modulating gut–brain signalling through incretins31. Therefore, SCFAs may prevent and/or counteract obesity and associated cardiometabolic risk factors. Additionally, microbial composition at baseline and/or after initial weight loss can classify with reasonable accuracy variation in body weight regain as well as changes in HbA1c. This is in line with previous studies indicating that there may be responders and non-responders to S&SEs intervention driven by their microbiota composition14,16. Overall, our trial indicates a shift towards saccharolytic fermentation (SCFA-producing taxa) in the S&SEs group, which may have contributed to the positive effects on body weight maintenance.

Interestingly, the higher abundance in Methanolobus, known for its ability to generate CH4 as a metabolic byproduct, in the S&SEs group was accompanied by more gastrointestinal symptoms. Increased levels of CH4 may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms by inhibiting gastrointestinal motility, potentially causing slow-transit constipation and related issues like abdominal pain32,33. Additionally, some S&SEs, such as sugar alcohols (for example, sorbitol, xylitol and mannitol), are incompletely absorbed in the small intestine, reaching the colon where they act as osmotic laxatives13,34,35. The osmotic effects, however, vary between different S&SEs, influencing the type and severity of symptoms36. Whether the experienced gastrointestinal symptoms translate into a substantial clinical burden remains to be determined. Additionally, the amount of reported concomitant medication use was not affected by long-term S&SE intake.

A strength of the present RCT is the investigation of the long-term (10 months) effects of S&SEs compared to no S&SEs on weight loss maintenance in the context of an ad libitum, low-sugar, healthy diet, whereas most previous studies have investigated single S&SEs37 and only a few included both foods and drinks38,39. Furthermore, longer-term studies (≥6 months) are scarce. In addition, the effect of 10 months of S&SE intake on the human gut microbiome was investigated for the first time in a real-life, controlled setting. Another important aspect of this study is the examination of the long-term effects of S&SEs on IHL content, the occurrence of (serious) AEs and gastrointestinal symptoms and the use of concomitant medication. Moreover, this multi-centre RCT included participants from northern, central, southern and south-eastern Europe, providing a comprehensive representation across diverse geographic locations in Europe. In addition, this study reflects realistic consumption patterns and dosages of various S&SEs in locally available products. Finally, the inclusion of urinary biomarkers to assess dietary compliance further strengthens the results and supports the dietary intake data. Although participants were recruited from diverse European regions with varying dietary habits, the use of standardized dietary guidance and objective compliance measures (that is, urinary biomarkers) increases confidence that cultural differences had limited impact on adherence and outcomes.

However, this study had limitations. The dropout rate was higher than expected (40% versus 30%), which resulted in a lower number of completers than required for 90% power. However, with 203 completers, the power for a 1-year change in weight loss was 86%, which can be deemed satisfactory. Furthermore, results on energy intake should be interpreted cautiously owing to underreporting, with baseline intake about 25% lower than the estimated energy need, as previously observed40. The same caveat applies to the children's results, which should be interpreted with caution because of the limited sample size and suboptimal compliance. Moreover, the absence of direct measurements of SCFAs may have limited our ability to fully interpret the metabolic implications of the observed microbial shifts. Further detailed analysis of the functionality of the microbiota by metagenomic analysis or analysis of microbial metabolites, in addition to the current taxonomic classification and prediction of functionality, as done by PICRUSt2 MetaCyc pathways, would have provided more mechanistic insights into the link between changes in gut microbiota compositions and changes in clinical parameters. Future research is warranted to investigate the effects of long-term intake of S&SEs on human gut microbial functionality, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of long-term physiological effects in humans.

In conclusion, the present RCT showed that compared to adults consuming drinks and foods without S&SEs, those who included S&SEs in a healthy, ad libitum, sugar-reduced diet exhibited improved 1-year weight loss maintenance and gut microbiota composition (in terms of a higher abundance of SCFA-producing and CH4-producing bacterial taxa) without affecting cardiometabolic health markers. Moreover, based on initial microbial composition or composition directly after weight loss, we can classify with reasonable accuracy the extent of body weight regain or change in HbA1c, suggesting a significant contribution of the altered microbiota composition to weight loss maintenance. The personalized microbiota composition-related effect on HbA1c and body weight during WM warrants further mechanistic deepening to better understand the clinical implications.

This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04226911), was approved by national ethical committees (protocols and amendments) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was monitored for Good Clinical Practice compliance by the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network, as described previously18. All participants provided written informed consent.

The SWEET trial was a two-armed parallel group RCT conducted at four intervention sites: Athens (Harokopio University of Athens, Greece), Copenhagen (University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Maastricht (Maastricht University, the Netherlands) and Pamplona (University of Navarra, Spain), effectively covering northern, central, southern and south-eastern Europe.

The 1-year RCT consisted of an initial 2-month weight loss period followed by a 10-month, randomized, two-armed parallel WM period. The full 1-year trial on which the majority of outcomes are reported (months M0–M12) comprises the combined periods and is thus termed WM. For adults, the goal was first to achieve a weight loss of ≥5% of the initial weight and second, to maintain their new body weight. For children, the first goal was to achieve weight stability and second, to maintain their BMI-for-age z-score. CIDs were carried out at baseline (M0), after weight loss and weight stability (M2) and twice during WM (M6 and M12).

In total, 341 adults and 38 children were included in the trial (Fig. 1). The analysis of gut microbiota composition was done in a subgroup of 137 adult completers. Participants were enrolled between June 2020 and October 2021. The recruitment procedure and all inclusion and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere18. In brief, 18–65-year-old men and women (self-reported sex) with BMI ≥ 25 kg m−2 and 6–12-year-old boys and girls (self-reported sex) with a BMI-for-age of >85th percentile were included. Children were included in a family setting with at least one recruited parent. Participants were required to have a regular consumption of sugar-containing or sugar-sweetened products. Adult participants were excluded at screening if, for example, they had been surgically treated for obesity, were taking medication affecting body weight, had been diagnosed with diabetes, had a fasting glucose >7.0 mmol l−1 or had systolic blood pressure of >160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of >100 mmHg. Children were excluded if, for example, they performed >10 h of intensive physical training per week, had self-reported eating disorders, were diagnosed with diabetes or used medication that affected their body weight. All adults received low-energy diet products free of charge. Participants in Copenhagen, Pamplona and Athens did not receive reimbursement for their participation; travel expenses and financial compensation were provided for participants in Maastricht.

The trial lasted 1 year for each participant. The first CID (M0) was on 24 August 2020, and the last participant's final visit (M12) was on 6 October 2022. During the initial 2-month period, adults—regardless of randomization—received the low-energy diet (Cambridge Weight Plan). For children, weight stability should be achieved by following the dietary recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics on the prevention, assessment and treatment of overweight and obesity18. All participants were randomly allocated to one of two diet groups in a 1:1 ratio by a site-specific, computerized randomization list created by a person in Copenhagen not involved in the RCT. Stratification was done by sex, age (<40 or ≥40 years) and BMI (<30 or ≥30 kg m−2) in blocks of four. Each household, including children, was randomized to the same intervention group determined by the oldest member of the household. If there was more than one eligible child per household, it was still the randomization group of the oldest adult participant that determined the child allocation.

Although randomization was done after inclusion (at screening), it was not revealed to the participants before completion of the 2-month weight loss or weight stability period. The two ad libitum intervention diets were a healthy diet with <10 E% added sugar, allowing foods and drinks with all types of S&SE products commercially available (S&SEs group), and a healthy diet with <10 E% added sugar, not allowing S&SE products (sugar group). The maximum allowed sugar intake was calculated individually at M2 and recalculated at M6 and then converted to a simple trial-specific unit system (one unit = 10 g sugar). The participants received their maximum unit intake and lists with sugar-rich products, including the unit content. Lists were divided into different categories; for example, drinks, breakfast or desserts. The lists also provided a corresponding product with S&SEs (similar in weight or volume; details described elsewhere18). For the S&SEs group, the aim was to replace as many sugar-containing products as possible with S&SEs products, whereas S&SEs products were not allowed in the sugar group. S&SEs included high-potency sweeteners (for example, aspartame, acesulfame-K, saccharin, thaumatin, neotame, stevia glycosides), polyols (for example, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol), slowly digestible carbohydrates (for example, sucromalt, isomaltulose) and sweet fibres or oligosaccharides (inulin-type oligosaccharides). Owing to the characteristics of the trial, blinding was not possible, but all efforts to blind trial staff taking measurements and doing statistical analyses were made. During the intervention period, participants were supervised by dieticians at least every third month. The goal for adults was to maintain weight loss, and for children, the goal was to maintain BMI-for-age z-score. Further reduction in body weight or BMI-for-age z-score was allowed if the participant was compliant with the intervention.

Data were collected according to common standard operating procedures, which were used in all intervention sites. Most data were collected at the CIDs after ≥10 h of overnight fast. All data were stored in a central data hub in Copenhagen, from which pseudo-anonymized data can be requested until 2032 through a data-sharing contract. As of 2032, fully anonymized data can be transferred.

Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale, with participants wearing underwear or light clothes. Fasting body weight was measured at screening and CIDs, but fasting was not required at other visits.

Participants were selected based on whether they completed the full intervention and whether faecal spot samples were available at all time points. The participants were stratified based on age, sex and centre. Faecal spot samples were collected and immediately frozen (−20 °C) at home by the participants before all CIDs. At CIDs, the faecal spot samples were stored at −80 °C at the intervention sites. Barcoded amplicons from the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA genes (341 F, 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′; 785 R, 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) were generated using the Illumina two-step PCR protocol, and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with the paired-end (2×) 300 bp protocol (Nextera XT index kit). After each PCR step, the products were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit), the size of the PCR products was checked on a fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and concentration was quantified by fluorometric analysis (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit). For genomic DNA isolation, QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kits (Qiagen) were used. All outcomes were determined at M0, M2, M6 and M12. Stool consistency was assessed using BSS for each sample41.

Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry and body composition, risk factors for T2D and CVD, IHL content, the occurrence of (serious) AEs, gastrointestinal symptoms and use of concomitant medication in adults with overweight or obesity.

The methods for measuring anthropometry (BMI, waist and hip circumference) and body composition (fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass and computed visceral adipose tissue (CoreScan software; Encore v.17.0) using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) have been extensively described elsewhere18.

Risk factors for T2D include elevated levels of glucose, insulin and HbA1c; for CVD, risk factors include high cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure. During CIDs, fasting venous blood samples were drawn. Whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes for HbA1c analysis and immediately stored locally at −80 °C. Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes for analyses of lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C) and insulin. Whole blood samples with fluoride were collected for glucose analysis, with EDTA for CCK, GLP-1 and EDTA plus aprotinin for ghrelin analysis. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (serum or plasma) samples were aliquoted and stored locally at −80 °C until shipment to the central lab at Bioiatriki (Athens). Glucose concentration was measured by the enzymatic Hexokinase/G-6-PD method (Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit 07P55, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser (a clinical chemistry analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for glucose, from mg dl−1 to mmol l−1, was applied by multiplying by 0.0555. Insulin concentration was measured by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Alinity i Insulin Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity i analyser (immunoassay analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for insulin, from µIU ml−1 to pmol l−1, was applied by multiplying by 6. HbA1c was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Haemoglobin A1c Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser, clinical chemistry (Abbott). One participant had results below the lower detection limit during two CIDs. These latter results were reported as 5.0%. Total cholesterol was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Cholesterol Reagent kit (Abbott)), and LDL-C and HDL-C were measured by liquid (Alinity c Direct LDL Reagent kit) and accelerator (Alinity c Ultra HDL Reagent kit) selective detergent methods, respectively (both Abbott). All cholesterol concentrations were analysed using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for cholesterol (total, LDL and HDL), from mg dl−1 to mmol l−1, was applied by multiplying by 0.02586. Triglycerides were measured by a glycerol phosphate oxidase method (Alinity c Triglyceride Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for triglycerides, from mg dl−1 to mmol l−1, was applied by multiplying by 0.01129. CCK was measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay method (RayBio Human CCK Enzyme Immunoassay kit, RayBiotech) using a BioTek Quant analyser (BioTek Instruments). Two participants had results above the range of quantification (4,000 pg ml−1) during two CIDs, and their CCK results were reported as 4,000 pg ml−1.

IHL content was analysed in a subgroup (n = 27) of adults at Maastricht (S&SEs group, n = 15; sugar group, n = 12). Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was performed using a 3T MR system (Achieva 3T-X Philips Healthcare) at M0, M2 and M12. A 32-channel sense cardiac/torso coil (Philips Healthcare) was used, and a 30 × 30 × 30 mm voxel was placed in the lower hepatic lobe. The STEAM (repetition time, 4,500 ms; echo time, 20 ms; number of signal averages, 128) sequence was used, as described previously42,43. VAPOR water suppression was applied, and an additional water reference scan was obtained (number of signal averages, 16). A custom-written MATLAB script (MATLAB 2014b, The MathWorks) was used to post-process the spectra. Phasing, frequency alignment and eddy current correction were all performed on spectra before signal averaging. CH2 resonance, as a percentage of the sum of CH2 + H2O resonances (CH2/(CH2 + water)), was used as a parameter of IHL content.

Any experienced (serious) AEs or changes in medication use were registered during the CIDs. During the WM period, the participants were asked, regardless of intervention, directly about AEs potentially related to the consumption of S&SEs, including gastrointestinal symptoms and headache.

Subjective appetite sensations over the last 7 days were reported in a questionnaire delivery platform on-site or at home within ±7 days of each CID. The participants answered five questions: (1) how strong was your desire to eat savoury foods; (2) how strong was your desire to eat sweet foods; (3) how satiated have you felt; (4) how hungry have you felt; and (5) how full have you felt? All questions were developed in English and translated into the local language at each site. A visual analogue scale with extremes anchored at each end (0, not at all; 100, extremely) was used. Depending on the device that was used, lines were not necessarily 10 cm long, but the rating was presented as a percentage; for example, a mark at 4 cm on an 8 cm line would correspond to 50%.

To assess compliance, participants completed 4-day weighed records of all foods and drinks (three weekdays and one weekend day) at M0 and M12. Only records of a minimum of 3 days were deemed valid and used for further analysis. Daily average intake of energy and macronutrients was calculated by national dietary software at the four intervention sites. In Copenhagen, all information from food records was manually entered into the software programme DankostPro44. This software is based on the official Danish national food composition database (v.4) developed by the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark45. In Maastricht, food intake data were analysed by the Eetmeter food diary and analysis tool (Voedingscentrum). In Harokopio, food intake data were analysed with Nutritionist V diet analysis software (v.2.1, 1999; First Databank), extensively amended to include traditional Greek foods and recipes, as described in the Food Composition Tables and Composition of Greek Cooked Food and Dishes46. Furthermore, the database was updated with nutritional information of processed foods provided by independent research institutes, food companies and fast-food chains. In Pamplona, food records were manually entered in the online application Nutrium (Nutrium.com), which is based on two food databases (BEDCA & CESNID from Spain and the US Department of Agriculture).

Furthermore, intake (g) of products with sugar and S&SEs and the corresponding units were estimated. Products of interest are described elsewhere18. As an objective measure, 24 h urine samples were collected at M0, M6 and M12. The urine samples were weighed and volumes registered (Maastricht, Harokopio and Pamplona) or calculated from the urinary density (Copenhagen). If urinary volume was not registered, urinary weight was divided by 1.0165 g ml−1 (M0, n = 7; M6, n = 0; M12, n = 2). Urinary biomarkers of S&SEs (acesulfame-K, saccharin, sucralose, cyclamate and steviol glucuronide) as well as glucose, fructose and sucrose were analysed by ultra-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry47. Preparation and analyses followed procedures described elsewhere47 and were conducted at Wageningen University. After correction for dilution, urinary concentrations (ng ml−1) were multiplied by 24 h urine volume and converted to daily excretions (mg day−1). Urinary urea concentration was analysed locally and converted to daily urinary nitrogen excretion (g day−1) by multiplying urea excretion (g day−1) by 0.4664. At Copenhagen and Maastricht, urea was measured by an enzymatic UV test (colourimetry) (ABX Pentra Urea CP, Horiba ABX) using an ABX Pentra 400. At Harokopio, urea was measured by an enzymatic colourimetric (Urease) Alinity c Urea Nitrogen Reagent kit (Abbott Laboratories). At Pamplona, urea was measured by an enzymatic kinetic test (COBAS 8000, Roche Diagnostics).

For the per-protocol population, participants' compliance was estimated using points (minimum zero points and maximum four points) in relation to four criteria: intake of sugar units and S&SE units and urinary excretion of S&SEs at M6 and at M12. In three out of the four criteria, 75% of the group with the highest (>Q1) or lowest (<Q3) value—depending on the outcome assessed—received one point, and the remaining 25% received no points. Extended Table 6 shows Q1, median and Q3 for the four compliance criteria for each group, including the cut-point for receiving compliance points.

Physical activity was measured in a subgroup at Maastricht for seven consecutive days at M0, M6 and M12 using a triaxial accelerometer (activPAL 3TM micro, PAL Technologies). The activPAL was attached to the anterior thigh of the participants and measured posture allocation, step count and 24 h physical activity, distinguishing between sleeping time, low-to-moderate physical activity (time spent standing or walking <100 steps per min), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (time spent walking ≥100 steps per min or cycling) and sedentary time (time spent sitting or lying down).

Sample size calculation was based on body weight results from a previous trial48. It was estimated that a mean difference of 1.5 kg, with a s.d. of ±3.5 kg, 90% power and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, would require 231 completers. With an estimated dropout of 30%, a minimum of 330 adult participants should be included (approximately 25% per intervention site). The sample size for the 1-year change in gut microbiota required a minimum of 100 participants (n = 50 per intervention group) and was based on a calculation taking into account ~10% change in 20 of the 50 most abundant operational taxonomic units with an alpha of <0.05%. According to this calculation, a total of 40 participants would be enough to detect compositional changes. Furthermore, considering previous work49 in which n = 75 was used to determine differences in beta-diversity, the estimated number of n = 100 participants in our statistical power calculation would indeed be sufficient. No power calculation was performed for the children; hence, the analyses of BMI z-scores were exploratory only.

Statistical analyses were conducted in R (v.4.3.1). Baseline characteristics before (M0) and after weight loss or weight stability (M2) are presented as medians (Q1–Q3), and changes at M2 and M12 are presented as unadjusted mean ± s.d. Differences between groups are presented as adjusted mean ± s.e.m. Given that randomization was completed at M0 (that is, 2 months before the 10-month intervention period was initiated), differences in the participant characteristics between groups after weight loss or weight stability (M2) and in changes during the 2-month period (M2–M0) were analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for sex, age, baseline body weight and site. Sex was included as a covariate, given that we know from previous studies that different outcomes can vary between men and women50. The trial was not powered to analyse data from men and women separately.

Change in body weight was calculated as the difference between M0 and M12 (M12 − M0). For the primary ITT analysis, the population was defined as all randomized participants who obtained the required ≥5% weight loss at M2. For the ITT analysis, missing data (that is, body weight at M12) were imputed as the last observation carried forward. The analysis of differences between the groups was conducted using an ANCOVA linear mixed model, with individual change in body weight as the response, and intervention group, baseline body weight, age, sex and site as fixed effects. Additionally, a complete-case analysis (all dropouts omitted) and a per-protocol analysis (only compliant participants defined by the point scoring system) were analysed with the same ANCOVA model. Finally, adult body weight was analysed with the inclusion of all visits (time points) as a linear mixed-effect model with repeated measurements. This analysis had body weight as the response variable and included the fixed effects time-intervention interaction, age, sex and baseline body weight. Site and participants were included as random effects. If there was a significant interaction, post hoc tests were conducted with the R extension package ‘emmeans' to calculate the estimated marginal mean and s.e.m. at each time point for comparison of the groups. This model was also used to impute missing body weight values for post hoc ITT analyses. For secondary outcomes on continuous data, the main analysis compared the 6-month and 12-month mean changes between the treatment groups by use of the ANCOVA linear mixed model defined above, without imputation of missing values (that is, complete-case analyses). All models were graphically checked by residual plots and quantile–quantile plots to assess model assumptions, mainly the normality assumption, and when relevant, transformed (for example, by logarithm). Furthermore, Poisson regression analysis was used to analyse the predictive effect of group intervention on reported AEs and concomitant medications.

The complete microbiota data processing and analysis pipeline is available at https://github.com/AlexanderUm/SWEET_microbiome. Running the pipeline with the corresponding data will reproduce all of the presented microbiota analysis results and figures. In short, raw reads were preprocessed with the CASAVA pipeline (v.1.8.3) and the Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2; v.2023.9.1) platform. Demultiplexed reads were de-noised into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with the DADA2 plug-in51 and were taxonomically annotated with the Naive Bayes classifier trained on the SILVA (v.138) database52. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the FastTree algorithm and MAFFT alignment. PICRUSt2 (ref. 53) was used to infer metabolic pathways using default settings, and the unstratified MetaCyc pathways abundance table was used for further pathways analysis. Phylogenetic tree, taxonomic, pathways abundance and ASV tables were imported in the R statistical and programming environment (v.4.3.2)54 using the qiime2R package55. For data transformation and visualization, the R packages tidyverse56, ggvegan57, cowplot58, broom59, ComplexHeatmap60, circlize61 and RColorBrewer62 were used. Before further analysis, ASVs with fewer than 50 reads across all samples and those taxonomically assigned to mitochondria or chloroplasts or to kingdoms other than Bacteria or Archaea, as well as those not assigned to any phylum, were removed from the dataset. An appropriate normalization of ASV counts, as specified below, was applied in correspondence with the performed analysis or visualization.

Microbial alpha diversity metrics (Chao1, observed species, Shannon and Simpson indexes) were calculated, and a linear mixed-effects regression analysis (LMM) was performed as implemented in the MicrobiomeStat63 R package for all indexes except observed species. For observed species, a generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) for a Poisson distribution (log link function) was performed using the lme4 package64. Alpha diversity metrics were calculated using the unfiltered ASV table rarefied at even depth (40k). The LMM and GLMM used intervention group (main effect), time of sampling (M0, M2, M6 and M12) (time variable), intervention centre (adjustment variable) as fixed effects and subject ID as the random effect.

Differences in overall microbial composition between intervention groups were assessed using distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) followed by an ANOVA-like permutation test (PERMANOVA) as implemented in the vegan65 R package. The following model was used for dbRDA: DistanceMatrix ~ Time × IntervetionGroup + Condition(Country). The PERMANOVA was performed with 999 permutations and by model terms. Dissimilarity distances (Jaccard, Bray–Curtis, unweighted and weighted UniFrac) for dbRDA were calculated as implemented in the phyloseq66 R package from the ASV count table with total-sum scaling and log2-transformed count.

Differences in individual taxa and metabolic pathway abundance trends over time between intervention groups were tested using the LinDA method as implemented in the MicrobiomeStat R package. Differential abundance was assessed at the genus and family taxonomic levels; in addition, inferred MetaCyc pathways and default count normalization implemented in LinDA was used. Before differential abundance analysis, features with prevalence less than 50% were removed from the dataset. The P values calculated for the LMM were adjusted for multiple testing with false discovery rate correction, and q values less than or equal to 0.1 were considered significant. The LMM model used for differential abundance analysis was identical to the model used for analysis of alpha diversity trends.

Responders and non-responders were identified based on body weight regain (WM index = (weight at CID4 − weight at CID2)/(weight at CID1 – weight at CID2)) or changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose during the WM period (CID4 – CID2)67 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Microbial composition at each CID was then used to predict the response with a random forest. For classification, genera with a minimum prevalence of 50% in any treatment group were normalized using total-sum-scaling and then log2-transformed. The random forest model was built as implemented in the randomForest package68 and validated using the caret69 package. The random forest models were built with 1,999 trees, and the number of variables per split (mtry) was set to the default. Classification accuracy was assessed with 25 times repeated fivefold cross-validation as implemented in the caret package, and AUC was estimated. As additional validation, the response variable was permuted, and the accuracy of the corresponding random forest model was estimated. This process was repeated ten times, and the results were compared with the original model. The significance of the feature's contribution to the classification model was evaluated using the permutation approach (199 permutations) as implemented in the rfPermute70 package. The pROC70 package was used to build ROC curves.

M.D.P. and L.K. co-authored and edited the manuscript. M.D.P., J.J.A.J.B., S.S.H.A., S.N.-C. and K.R. performed the measurements and collected the data. A.U. analysed and generated the gut microbiome data and results. M.D.P. and L.K. analysed and generated all other data and results. J.J.A.J.B. and M.M.S. conducted faecal sample preparations before analysis and monitored the microbiome analysis. M.D.P., L.K., J.J.A.J.B., M.M.S., A.U., T.C.A.M., G.H.G., A.R. and E.E.B. evaluated the results. The SWEET EU-project was initiated by J.C.G.H., A.R. and J.H. The protocol for the SWEET intervention trial was written by L.K., A.R. and Y.M., with contributions from E.E.B., G.H.G. and J.A.M. A.R., Y.M., E.E.B. and J.A.M. are principal investigators at the four intervention sites, where M.D.P., J.J.A.J.B., M.M.S., A.U., L.K., S.S.H.A., S.N.-C., K.R., T.C.A. and G.H.G. are co-investigators. E.J.M.F., T.L., H.M., G.F. and C.E.H. were responsible for specific methods, platforms or analyses, and M.dA. is responsible for monitoring of the trial. A.R. and E.E.B. had the primary responsibility for the final content. All authors reviewed the manuscript and approved the final version.

a, Violin plots of body weight regain, fasting glucose, and HbA1c indices during the weight maintenance phase (CID4 – CID2), with participants in the Sugar and S&SEs groups classified as responders or non-responders. Body weight regain was reflected in a weight maintenance index = (weight at CID4 – weight at CID2)/(weight at CID1 – weight at CID2)). For body weight regain (left panel) and fasting glucose (middle panel), participants were split into five tertiles within both S&SEs and Sugar group. For HbA1c, participants with a shift above zero were considered non-responders; the rest were considered responders (right panel). The colour of the dots corresponds to the placement of a participant into the response (Resp), non-response (NonResp) group, or exclusion from the further analysis (NA). b, Boxplot of 1-y change in body weight (kg) of the completers in each of the intervention groups in adults. c, Boxplot of BMI-for-age (z-score) of completers in each intervention group in children. 1B; completers n = 203. Abbreviations: S&SEs, sweeteners and sweetness enhancers.

Source data

Heat map of microbial genera (rows) CSS normalized and log2 transformed abundance per sample with significant different abundance trends over time between the intervention groups.

Source data

Colored by intervention groups straight lines indicate the fit of a simple linear regression with corresponding 95% confidence intervals: red lines for the S&SEs group and blue lines for the Sugar group. The black lines signify the mean of each group, with dashed lines and squares denoting the S&SEs group and solid lines and dots for the Sugar group. Statistical importance of differences in trends between groups was tested with linear mixed effect models as implemented in LinDa and outcomes are indicated above. P-values adjusted using False Discovery Rate.

Source data

(A) Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves based on Random Forest classification of responders and non-responders, (B) Dot plots of the Area under the curve (AUC) based on Random Forest classification of responders and non-responders Responder and non-responders were defined by changes in HbA1c, fasting glucose, or weight maintenance index (as indicated in grid row names), (A)Treatment group and CID are indicated in the grid column names (B) CID is indicated in the grid columns names and treatment group in the x-axis labels The colour of ROC curves or dots corresponds to the order of the response variable used to build the prediction model: green - original definition of the responders/non-responders; red – definition of the responders/non-responders is random.

From short scripts to vast simulations of Earth's climate, protein structures or even the cosmos, it is hard to imagine scientific research without software. Scientists use software code in myriad ways — to plan experiments; to record, organize, analyse, visualize and archive data; to control scientific instruments, and more.

Why it's worth making computational methods easy to use

Why it's worth making computational methods easy to use

But software evolves. Most open-source software used in research is refined both iteratively and collectively, and has no published ‘version of record'. Updates can target various versions and releases, meaning that each aspect of the software — the project as a whole, a specific version or a single file — can require a different way to refer to it. This creates confusion.

And so software comes with a double bind: like data, it supports the findings of a study and should be preserved and published. Yet it should also remain available and supported, and possibly be improved, over time. Scholars, librarians, research institutions and funding agencies are wrestling with how to reconcile these two requirements.

Recent efforts to do this1 have focused on adapting a set of principles initially developed2 to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). But this approach relies on tracking data, archiving them and making metadata available. For software, it would create a large administrative burden that would have to be sustained for decades. That would be disproportionately time-consuming to those who maintain and improve software — and whose efforts are already underappreciated. Imagine, for example, maintaining a software package that has tens of contributors (which is not rare). Each release and version requires a new upload to an archive, with updates to the metadata, author list, dependencies (any other software required for programs to run), interoperability (which other programs it can work with) and more. Some programs have a weekly or even daily release cycle, making the FAIR approach impractical.

Researchers must be able to publish a piece of software without the need for lengthy bureaucratic procedures to identify rights holders, choose an open licence and protect intellectual property.

‘Open source' AI isn't truly open — here's how researchers can reclaim the term

‘Open source' AI isn't truly open — here's how researchers can reclaim the term

As researchers and engineers with expertise in software development in various scientific domains — ranging from computer science to neuroscience, physics and chemistry — we have recently proposed an approach called ‘CODE beyond FAIR' that outlines how software can be better handled, shared and maintained. Here, we outline recommendations for two groups: the scholars who develop software (see Supplementary information (SI), Table S1), and the research institutions, funders, libraries and publishers that use it (see SI, Table S2). Our recommendations are based on our collaborative experience in developing open-source software, but also draw from the work of free and open-source software (FOSS) communities. These have long experience of project governance, funding, recognizing individual contributions and training future contributors.

Sharing the code that has been used to reach a paper's conclusions is important for research integrity and reproducibility, but practices vary widely among research communities. Permissive licences, which let others use and modify software with few restrictions, are increasingly common, particularly in computer science, mathematics and physics, yet most software is still not published at all.

Platforms exist to share code, such as GitHub or GitLab, and to archive it, such as in the repositories Zenodo or Software Heritage, which can capture the whole history of a project3.

All researchers should know how to share and deposit code. That needn't mean that all scientists must spend time and resources keeping abreast of this fast-paced field. Finding the right level of expertise to ensure that researchers know how to document, share and archive code in their field is crucial.

Why NASA and federal agencies are declaring this the Year of Open Science

One way to improve matters is to train all PhD students from all scientific disciplines in the basics of software engineering during the first year or so of their postgraduate research careers. Institutions must embed this in all scientific curricula. Several universities, including Stanford and Harvard in the United States and Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, already offer (and in some cases, require) at least one introductory programming or computational-thinking course — even for degrees that are not scientific or technical.

International training organizations exist that teach data and computational skills to wide audiences with basic or no knowledge of software development. For example, the Neuromatch Academy for global neuroscience education — co-founded by computational neuroscientists Dan Goodman and Konrad Körding during the COVID-19 pandemic4 — reported having supported more than 2,000 students from more than 100 countries through online training in 2024. And The Carpentries, founded in 1998 by Greg Wilson to improve the computational skills of researchers5, has facilitated or organized almost 4,800 workshops in more than 70 countries so far. These courses range from basic computational skills (such as in the programming languages Shell, R and Python, and version control) to advanced concepts (statistics and machine learning) as well as discipline-specific advanced skills.

To increase the uptake of good practices, publishers should mandate the sharing and archiving of code at the time of publication. It is as simple as clicking a button on the Software Heritage or GitHub platforms. GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, has become the de facto international hub for code sharing.

Institutions should support efforts to connect portals to ensure adequate cross-referencing between different projects and versions, such as those in the European Open Science Cloud research-support platform.

Spatial transcriptomics offers unique opportunities to define the spatial organization of tissues and organs, such as the mouse brain. We address a key bottleneck in the analysis of organ-scale spatial transcriptomic data by establishing a workflow for self-supervised spatial domain detection that is scalable to multimillion-cell datasets. This workflow uses a self-supervised framework for learning latent representations of tissue spatial domains or niches. We use an encoder-decoder architecture, which we named CellTransformer, to hierarchically learn higher-order tissue features from lower-level cellular and molecular statistical patterns. Coupling our representation learning workflow with minibatched GPU-accelerated clustering algorithms allows us to scale to multi-million cell MERFISH datasets where other methods cannot. CellTransformer is effective at integrating cells across tissue sections, identifying domains highly similar to ones in existing ontologies such as Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) while allowing discovery of hundreds of uncataloged areas with minimal loss of domain spatial coherence. CellTransformer domains recapitulate previous neuroanatomical studies of areas in the subiculum and superior colliculus and characterize putatively uncataloged subregions in subcortical areas, which currently lack subregion annotation. CellTransformer is also capable of domain discovery in whole-brain Slide-seqV2 datasets. Our workflows enable complex multi-animal analyses, achieving nearly perfect consistency of up to 100 spatial domains in a dataset of four individual mice with nine million cells across more than 200 tissue sections. CellTransformer advances the state of the art for spatial transcriptomics by providing a performant solution for the detection of fine-grained tissue domains from spatial transcriptomics data.

Hierarchical spatial organization is ubiquitous in tissue and organ biology. Systematic, high-dimensional phenotypic measurements of this organization, generated through experimental tools such as spatial transcriptomics, multiplex immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, are also becoming increasingly available as large, open datasets. However, transforming this abundance of data into a useful representation can be difficult, even for fields with a wealth of prior knowledge, such as neuroanatomy.

Datasets such as the Allen Brain Cell Whole Mouse Brain (ABC-WMB) Atlas1,2,3, a multi-million cell single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) atlas, provide unprecedented opportunities to investigate whether computational tools can help biologists understand spatial cellular and molecular organization. However, the size of these datasets presents computational challenges for existing methods. Existing methods for spatial niche or spatial domain detection often operate on the entire dataset at once, for example, a tissue-section-wide cell by gene matrix. This precludes scale-up to large multi-section datasets as most systems do not have the GPU memory required to load multiple sections of data or store intermediary representations such as pairwise distance matrices4,5,6, particularly as datasets scale into the millions or tens of millions of cells. Some methods rely on Gaussian processes, which feature a costly cubic computational scaling in the number of observations7. Other more scalable methods are limited in capturing granular structure, integration across tissue sections, or require significant neuroanatomical prior knowledge to manually audit, cluster, and hyperparameter tune for domain discovery workflows8,9,10.

Our method, CellTransformer, implements a robust representation learning and clustering workflow to discover spatial niches at scale by representing not tissue sections but subgraphs that represent individual cellular neighborhoods. We describe an innovative strategy to induce the encoder of an encoder-decoder transformer to aggregate useful information into a neighborhood representation token. This occurs by training the model to condition cell-type specific gene expression predictions using this neighborhood context token. The model thus learns to predict the expression of cell types in arbitrary cell neighborhoods. This representation allows for recovery of important anatomically plausible spatial domains while remaining computationally efficient.

We evaluate CellTransformer on using the ABC-WMB dataset (3.9 million cells collected with a 500 gene MERFISH panel)1 demonstrating its effectiveness in producing completely data-driven spatial domains of the mouse brain by comparing the results to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3)11. CCF is a consensus hand-drawn 3D reference space compiled from a large multimodal data corpus. Annotations feature labels at three levels of coarseness (from 25 regions at coarse-grain to 670 at fine-grain), which we use to show that CellTransformer excels at identifying spatial domains that are spatially coherent and biologically relevant. CellTransformer domains reproduce known regional architecture observed in targeted studies of the subiculum and in the superior colliculus superficial layers. Beyond the 670 regions currently annotated in ABC-WMB, we show our workflow produces meaningful data-driven domains in regions that currently lack subregion annotation. As examples, we focus on data-driven subdomains we define in superior colliculus and midbrain reticular nucleus.

We also demonstrate CellTransformer's strength in integrating domains across animals, leveraging a separate whole-brain dataset within ABC-WMB12 comprising 6.5 million cells distributed across four animals and 239 sections and with a separate gene panel with 1129 genes. We find that CellTransformer produces consistent subregions across all 5 animals (1 coronal and 4 sagittal), suggesting a successful integration across animals with heterogeneous measurements. Notably, we also find that identified domains are highly consistent across animals. This work demonstrates that large-scale data-driven discovery of domains at CCF-like resolution can be based on spatial transcriptomics data. Finally, we show that our framework can perform domain detection in a different spatial transcriptomics modality, Slide-seqV2, using a whole-brain dataset of cellularly deconvoluted results13.

CellTransformer is a graph transformer14 neural network that is trained to learn latent representations of cell neighborhoods by conditioning single-cell gene expression predictions on neighborhood spatial context. We define a cellular neighborhood as any cells within a user-specified distance cutoff in microns away from a reference or center cell. As input, our model requires the gene expression profiles and cell type classifications for cells in a neighborhood and outputs a latent variable representation for that neighborhood. One of the principal operations in a transformer is the self-attention operation, which computes a feature update based on pairwise interactions between elements in a sequence, which are referred to as tokens (here, cells). Accordingly, one interpretation of our model is of learning an arbitrary and dynamic pairwise interaction graph among cells.

Restricting this graph to a small neighborhood subgraph of the whole-tissue-section graph has benefits for both computational resource usage and biological interpretability. We interpret the size of the neighborhood as a constraint on the physical distance at which statistical correlations between the observed cells and their gene expression profiles can be directly captured. Truncating neighborhoods using a fixed spatial threshold instead of choosing a fixed number of neighbors also allows the network to account for the varying density of cells in space. Accordingly, our framework incorporates a notion of both cytoarchitecture (relative density and proximity) and molecular variation (cell type and RNA-level variation) in the data.

We designed a self-supervised training scheme requiring only cell-type labels, which many large-scale studies make available via scRNA-seq atlas reference mapping1,12. We model cellular neighborhoods as sets of cell tokens that are within a box of fixed size centered around a reference cell and use them to predict the observed gene expression of the cell at the center of the neighborhood. We refer to this cell as the reference cell (indicated by “cell R” in Fig. 1a). Cell tokens are generated by composing cell-type and gene expression information (Methods). After encoding with a series of transformer layers (where cells are only allowed to attend to each other if they are in the same neighborhood), these tokens are then aggregated using a learned pooling operation to produce a single token representation of the entire tissue context. The model receives a new mask token representing the reference cell's type, which is used to predict its gene expression following the operation of several transformer decoder layers (Fig. 1b; note that the point cloud displayed is for illustration purposes only). Importantly, during this process, only the mask token and the neighborhood representation can attend to each other. This operation captures a hierarchical encoding and decoding process where low-level information (gene and cell type) is produced at the cell token level and aggregated into a high-level representation. This high-level representation is then used to conduct the reverse decoding process (prediction of gene expression from cell type and tissue context information). This construction resembles that of masked language models14 and masked autoencoders15,16, where masked predictions are generated based on a conditioning signal (position encodings). In our model, position-based conditioning is replaced by cell type conditioning, similarly to the NCEM17 model. However, unlike masked prediction models such as NCEM17, we aggregate information across tokens (cells) in a cellular neighborhood using a learned pooling, which strongly bottlenecks the information distributed across the tokens prior to masked cell prediction.

a During training, a single cell is drawn (we denote this the reference cell, highlighted in red). We extract the reference cell's spatial neighbors and partition the group into a masked reference cell and its observed spatial neighbors. b Initially, the model encoder receives information about each cell and projects those features to d-dimensional latent variable space. Note that the latent variable point cloud shown is merely for illustration purposes and does not correspond to the actual CellTransformer latent space. Features interact across cells (tokens) through the self-attention mechanism. These per-cell representations and an extra token acting as a register token are then aggregated into a single vector representation, which we refer to as the neighborhood representation. This representation is concatenated to a mask token which is cell type-specific and chosen to represent the type of the reference cell. A shallow transformer decoder (dotted lines) further refines these representations and then a linear projection is used to output parameters of a negative binomial distribution modeling of the MERFISH probe counts for the reference cell. c Once the model is trained, we compute embeddings (one for each neighborhood/reference-cell pairing) and concatenate these embeddings within the tissue section datasets and across tissue sections. Concatenating embeddings across tissue sections produces region discovery at organ level. We then cluster these embeddings using k-means to discover tissue domains across sections.

At test time, we extract this neighborhood representation for each cell and use k-means clustering to identify discrete spatial domains (Fig. 1c). We will use the term spatial domain to refer to the output of clustering on embeddings and cluster to refer to single-cell clusters transferred from the ABC-WMB single-cell taxonomy. We emphasize that the input embedding matrix for k-means is constructed by concatenating all cells across the dataset across tissue sections. Since minibatching is used during training (unlike methods such as STAligner and GraphST), for generating embeddings, and during k-means (using cuml for GPU-acceleration), overall computational costs of our algorithm are limited in principle only by the memory required for storage of cellular neighborhoods rather than entire sections or datasets.

The ABC-WMB spatial transcriptomics dataset contains data from five mouse brains1,12. One animal was processed by the Allen Institute for Brain Science with a 500 gene MERFISH panel and 53 coronal sections (Yao et al.)1 The remaining four other animals, generated in Zhang et al.11. were collected with a 1129 gene panel. Sections from two of these animals (“Zhuang 1”, 147 sections; and “Zhuang 2”, 66 sections) were sampled coronally. The other two animals in the dataset (“Zhuang 3”, 23 sections; and “Zhuang 4”, 3 sections) were sampled sagittally.

We first trained CellTransformer on the Allen 1 dataset. A visualization of the loss curve (negative log-likelihood) showed a clear plateau (Supplementary Fig. 1). We then clustered these embeddings using k-means. We emphasize that to generate spatial domains across the brain, all k-means clustering in this paper was performed by concatenating cells in the dataset across tissue sections. All further references to visualizations of domains, including those only visualized for a subset of domains, were fit at a given number of domains across the entire dataset. We observed an isolated case where a small number of spatial clusters only in the striatum displayed a non-homogenous spatial patterning that strongly resembled a predominantly astrocytic, Crym+ population described in Ollivier et al. (2024) and have similar gene expression patterns (particularly Crym expression) and spatial organization (See Supplementary Note 1 for a discussion on biological plausibility of these domains and the effect of smoothing, as well as an extensive series of visualizations of the domains at high resolution with and without smoothing). Despite this plausibility, we introduced an optional smoothing step (see Methods) to remove this population to concord with neuroanatomical convention, which typically analyzes spatially contiguous regions. We also visualized the first three principal components (~19.5% variance explained, Supplementary Fig. 2a–c), demonstrating the CellTransformer embeddings produce neuroanatomically reasonable spatial patterns. For example, PC1 and PC2 appear to have the highest magnitude in different cortical layers in the motor and visual areas, whereas PC3 has the highest magnitude in the lamina of the visceral and gustatory areas.

We generated domains at k = 25, 354, and 670, to match the division, structure, and substructure annotations' resolution in CCFv3, displaying domains for four consecutive tissue sections (Fig. 2a). We also provide representative images of spatial clusters across the brain (28/53 sections) at different k in Supplementary Figs. 3–5. Low domain numbers such as k = 25 broadly divide the brain into neuroanatomically plausible patterns, with subregions of striatum (dorsal and ventral marked in Fig. 2a) and cortical layers clearly visible. A comparison of cortical layers across these sections shows that CellTransformer domains at k = 25 are well matched to CCF (Supplementary Fig. 6b) and correctly identify major classes of layers (1, 2/3 4, 5, and 6) across somatosensory and somatomotor cortex. In particular, we point out the excellent correspondence of domains across tissue sections at k = 25 across the entire dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3), with nearly perfect consistency across regions. This suggested that our neighborhood representation method was robust enough to enable integration without modeling of batch or tissue-level covariates.

a Four sequential tissue sections (the inter-section distance is 200 µm) from anterior (first row, corresponding to section 50) to posterior (bottom row, section 47). In the first three columns, each dot is a cell, colored by spatial domain identified by CellTransformer when clustering was conducted with k = 25, 354, and 670 domains (the CCF division, structure, and substructure domain resolutions). Spatial domain labels are depicted with the same colors across sections within the same column. Fourth column shows CCF region registration to the same tissue section. Select regions are annotated with CCF labels. MO motor cortex, SS somatosensory cortex, ACA anterior cingulate, CP caudoputamen, LSX lateral septum, MSX medial septum, VISC visceral cortex, GU gustatory cortex, PIR piriform cortex, OT olfactory tubule, ACB nucleus accumbens, HY hypothalamus. b Single hemisphere images of same tissue sections in (a) domains fit at k = 670, zoomed in on cortical layers of motor cortex (MO) and somatosensory cortex (SS). CCF boundaries are shown in semi-transparent lines, with the boundary between SS and MO outlined in larger black dotted lines. c Spatial homogeneity (see Methods) of domains from different methods including recently published methods CellCharter and SPIRAL. d Proportion of discrete domains by model as compared to CCF at the same resolution. Single-cell level spatial smoothness was averaged over each domain instead of averaged over the entire dataset as in (c). For each CCF annotation level we computed a threshold as the 20th percentile of per-domain spatial smoothness values. We applied this threshold to the distribution of data-driven domains at the same resolution. e Average Pearson correlation (averaging over number of domains and method) of the maximum Pearson correlation between the cell type composition (at subclass level, 338 types) vectors of data-driven regions with CCF ones. f Average Pearson correlation (averaging over number of domains and method) of optimal matched pairs between data-driven and CCF regions, where CCF regions are only allowed to pair with one data-driven region per comparison. Matches fit using linear programming. g Region-by-region Pearson correlation matrix comparing cell type composition vectors from 670 CCF regions (at substructure level) with 670 spatial domains from CellTransformer. The CCF regions are shown on the left with their structure annotations from CCF at division level on the side of the plot. Correlations above 0.9 are shown in bright green to assist in visualization. h Cell type (cluster level) by region matrix for 670 CCF regions at substructure level. i Cell type (cluster level) by region matrix for 670 CellTransformer regions. Rows are normalized to sum to 1 in both (h, i). Colors along x-axis in both (g, h) show cell class annotations from ABC-WMB cell type taxonomy at class level to allow for visualization of composition in terms of known types. Cell types in the “09 CNU-LGE GABA” class are boxed in purple in (h, i) matching their color in the legend. Rows of both (h, i) are grouped using clustering to produce approximately similar structure.

At k = 354, anterior-posterior subdivisions emerge such as the presence of layer 4 in the motor cortex (Fig. 2a, see Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). Historically, the mouse motor cortex was thought to lack a granular layer 418, however recently, MERFISH, transcriptomic and epigenomic studies have confirmed its existence1,18,19. At k = 100 and k = 354, we find a domain corresponding to Layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex which clearly extends to layer 4 in the motor cortex. We also provide a UMAP visualization of the CellTransformer embedding space with cluster labels from k = 354 clustering (Supplementary Fig. 7), demonstrating the observed domain spatial organization can also be recovered in a low-dimensional representation.

At k = 670, the cortical layers identified at lower resolution are further partitioned into superficial, intermediate, and deep strata within several layers. We visualize cortical layers across sections in depth (Fig. 2b), showing CellTransformer not only identifies fine superficial-deep structure within cortical layers but also preserves the boundary between somatosensory and motor cortex (marked in thick black dotted lines in Fig. 2b). Taken together these results showed that CellTransformer robustly describes previously known anatomical structures.

We also examined the caudoputamen at various choices of k. At k = 25, the caudoputamen is one domain, which separates into broad spatially contiguous domains at k = 100. Interestingly, at k = 354 and k = 670, we observe domains that intermingle in a grid-like pattern (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 8) that strongly resembles the Voronoi parcellation established in Hintiryan et al.20 through systematic projection mapping to caudoputamen. Notably, CellTransformer also captures the quadrant pattern in intermediate caudoputamen (sections 52, 50, and 49 in Supplementary Fig. 8), which Hintiryan et al. attributed to the differences in subnetwork reorganization. The correspondence of our transcriptomic domains to the Hintiryan et al. results, which are exclusively based on projection mapping (non-transcriptomic data), suggests the biological relevance of our representation learning workflow.

We compared CellTransformer to several other workflows to capture spatial coherency and multiresolution neuroanatomical annotations in CCF at the division, structure, and substructure levels. For comparison, we used two recent methods, CellCharter21 and SPIRAL22 that are scalable to millions of cells as benchmarks. CellCharter builds spatially informed embeddings for domain detection by concatenating the embeddings across scales, followed by dimensionality reduction and batch correction, while SPIRAL uses graph neural networks for batch effect correction and integration across scales. Additionally, we implemented two machine learning baselines. Gene-expression based domain detection is employed for spatial transcriptomics data analysis and has been shown to be highly successful for brain parecllation23,24,25. Therefore, we conducted k-means clustering on the single-cell MERFISH probe counts. We also employed k-means clustering on cellular neighborhoods (represented as cell type count vectors). Many other GPU-accelerated methods, such as scENVI4, STACI26, spaGCN5, STAligner6, STAGATE27, or GraphST28, cannot be run on datasets that contain millions of cells due to computational constraints (see Methods). One reason is that several of these methods require the instantiation of a dataset-wide pairwise distance matrix between all cells either on GPU or in RAM, which is a prohibitively large matrix (~60TB for ~4 M cells).

To quantify the spatial coherence of domains, we developed a single-cell level spatial homogeneity metric. For each cell, we identified its nearest 100 spatial neighbors. We then quantified the proportion of neighbor cells within the same spatial domain label as the starting cell (Fig. 2c). Ideally, we would expect a high proportion of neighbor cells to be in the same spatial domain as the starting cell. In this comparison of neighborhood spatial smoothness, CellTransformer outperforms CellCharter (58.2% better spatial coherence at 670 domains) and SPIRAL (4091.2%). CellTransformer also outperforms the machine learning baseline based on k-means clustering on cellular neighborhoods (61.9% better spatial coherence at k = 670), as well as the gene expression baseline (419.2% better spatial coherence at k = 670). We also compared versions of CellTransformer domains with and without the optional smoothing step. Both versions perform very similarly, indicating the CellTransformer representation efficiently suppresses high-frequency spatial features and changes relatively little after smoothing with a small bandwidth. For reference, we include the CCF parcellation (dashed purple line) in this comparison to provide an upper bound.

CellTransformer utilizes cell type information in both the encoder and decoder portions of the network. To understand the impact of this choice, we trained two additional variants of CellTransformer, one without cell type information in the decoder and one without cell type information in the encoder and the decoder (only expression). We generated spatial domains from these models' embeddings with smoothing, performed identically as in the base model. These variants perform competitively with the base CellTransformer version. The base model domains were 3.0% more similar to CCF than the model without cell type decoding, and 5.4% more similar than the model without cell type in either the encoder or decoder (Supplementary Fig. 9a). The smoothed and unsmoothed CellTransformer domains were also very similarly spatially smooth (Supplementary Fig. 9b), even when the number of domains was extended to 2000. CellTransformer variants also produced relatively little decrease in spatial smoothness at greater than 1000 domains, whereas CellCharter smoothness sharply declined. Similarly to the CCF comparison, the model without cell type decoding performed better than the model without cell type in both the encoder and decoder. Taken together, these results indicate that cell type conditioning is an important component of the model that increases similarity to CCF and spatial uniformity. This may be because the cell types, which were fit using whole-transcriptome scRNA-seq profiling, implicitly comprise a whole-transcriptome imputation step. However, we also note that the CellTransformer variant without any cell type information still performs better than CellCharter with respect to similarity to CCF and spatial coherence.

In addition to dataset-wide spatial smoothness, we also quantified the proportion of discrete domains (Fig. 2d). To classify a given domain as spatially discrete, we first averaged the single-cell level smoothness values over domains. We then investigated the distribution of per-domain average smoothness (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). CellTransformer's regional smoothness distribution is more similar to CCF than CellCharter, with relatively more highly smooth regions. Additionally, CellTransformer domains with smoothing are more similar to CCF than without. For a given CCF annotation resolution, we then computed a threshold based on the 20th percentile of per-domain averaged CCF smoothness values, which we used to classify a given data-driven domain as discrete or not. This adaptive metric allows us to compare fairly to human annotations at different resolutions. CellTransformer domains fit with and without smoothing both perform well, while for CellCharter, SPIRAL, and the gene expression baselines, discreteness declines significantly at 354 and 670 domains (Fig. 2d). We also computed the proportion of spatially discrete domains for resolutions from 700 to 2000 data-driven domains using the 20th percentile cutoff from the k = 670 CCF annotation level. For CellCharter, the proportion of discrete domains significantly diminishes (Supplementary Fig. 10c), unlike CellTransformer. The unsmoothed CellTransformer embedding workflow was most performant; we reasoned that the isotropic Gaussian smoothing employed may have eroded fine laminar boundaries, despite removing the isolated non-uniform domains discovered in striatum (Supplementary Note 1). We visualized a series of sections comparing domains from the smoothed and unsmoothed CellTransformer embeddings, finding a slight erosion of fine lamina in the cortex (Supplementary Fig. 11) compared with the unsmoothed, consistent with this observation. We also provide visualizations of a larger set of sections in Supplementary Fig. 12. To quantify the similarity of detected domains with CCF annotations, we compared the cell type composition of domains using cell type calls from the ABC-WMB taxonomy. We again chose the subclass cell type level, extracting for each domain and for each method a 338-long cell-type vector. We calculated the Pearson correlation of cell type composition vectors computed using the CCF regional annotations at division (25), structure (354) and substructure (670) levels against those of the various methods at the corresponding number of spatial domains. First, for each data-driven domain, we computed the maximum correlation to any CCF domain at the same CCF annotation resolution averaging these numbers across domains. CellTransformer outperforms other methods at mid-granularity and fine-granularity (Fig. 2e). In this comparison, several data-driven regions can match the same CCF region, which in the worst case could provide an overly optimistic picture of the correspondence between data-driven domains and CCF. To address this, we conducted a second analysis where only one CCF region could be matched to a given data-driven one. We used linear programming to compute an optimal 1:1 pairing of data-driven regions to CCF ones based on their Pearson correlation. We then averaged correlations across regions (Fig. 2f). CellTransformer is highly performant, showing that increase in correlation is not due to redundant matches to a single area in CCF. Visualization of spatial clusters from CellCharter (Supplementary Figs. 13–14) at k = 670 domains across the brain and in midbrain shows lack of spatial coherence in cortical layers and midbrain, with detected domains distributed in a what appear to be non-biological patterns. This is particularly evident in thalamus and across cortical layers. In contrast, CellTransformer identified spatially coherent domains and uncovered plausible neuroanatomical structures.

Next, we directly compared CCF annotation domains with data-driven domains using normalized mutual information (NMI) and the adjusted Rand index (ARI) (Supplementary Fig. 15). CellTransformer (with and without smoothing) perform significantly better than comparator methods (13.4% higher NMI than CellCharter and 46.7% higher NMI than SPIRAL with smoothed embeddings, 13.5% higher NMI than CellCharter and 46.9% higher NMI than SPIRAL at 670 domains). Registering spatial transcriptomics data to CCF's dense MRIs is significantly challenging. We therefore attribute the overall low magnitude of the ARI and NMI, to potential errors in registration.

To further characterize the similarity of CellTransformer domains with CCF, we plotted the Pearson correlation matrix (Fig. 2g) between cell type composition vectors generated at 670 domains (substructure level in CCF). Block structures with very high correlations (>0.9, shown in bright green) in the matrix clearly show that CellTransformer is able to identify regions that are highly similar with known ones without any labels. We also investigated the correspondence of cell type composition with more granular single-cell annotations, employing the lowest-level single-cell annotations (the “cluster” level, with 5274 cell types, as opposed to the “subclass” level with 338) from ABC-WMB. We observed high similarity between the “substructure” CCF domain set (Fig. 2h) and 670 CellTransformer domains (Fig. 2i) with an average Pearson correlation of CellTransformer to CCF domains of 0.853. This shows that the high correspondence of CCF and CellTransformer is robust to cell type resolution at which comparison occurs. CellTransformer identified an increase in the number of domains containing the 09 CNU-LGE GABA class (striatal/pallidal GABAergic neurons from lateral ganglionic eminence compared with the 670 CCF substructures, shown in light purple box in Fig. 2h, i), potentially suggesting the presence of uncharacterized developmental populations.

The observation of hierarchical grouping of domains at different choices of k (for example, delineation of cortical layers and sublayers with increasing number of domains) prompted us to develop a strategy to evaluate an optimal number of spatial domains based on two metrics. We implemented a previously published strategy29 for Drosophila embryonic spatial gene expression and30 for 3D spatial gene expression in the adult mouse brain to determine the optimal number of domains using a stability criterion. We reasoned that the optimal choice of spatial domain number would feature minimal variability across clustering runs. In brief, we computed 20 clustering instances with different random initializations for a large range k values (100–2000) and quantified their variability over these initializations (see Methods). Interestingly, stability increased with increasing k (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). To facilitate the choice of a particular resolution for analysis, we also computed the inertia (sum of squared errors in embedding space) for each clustering solution. Low stability at small numbers of domains may partially explain subpar results for CellTransformer in the k = 25 CCF evaluations. We averaged the inertia curve and instability and computed the point of second derivative crossing to identify k = 1300 as our resolution for analysis (crossing point shown with red dot in Supplementary Fig. 16c).

CellTransformer is the only method out of the three deep learning methods we implemented (including six other pipelines, which were unable to cope with the size of the ABC-WMB dataset) to allow discovery of spatially coherent divisions at greater than CCF resolution. This study shows that spatial transcriptomics data can be used to identify brain regions at resolutions finer than previously defined in the CCF. CellTransformer domains are more spatially smooth than comparator deep learning methods, as well as clustering on either gene expression or cell type composition, both at the single-cell level and at the domain level. Additionally, CellTransformer domains are more similar to CCF, both at the single-cell level, using NMI and ARI, and at the regional composition level. CellTransformer can also be used with and without cell type labels, although performance is unsurprisingly better when using cell type information. Crucially, CellTransformer is highly performant at discovering a high number of domains, whereas methods such as CellCharter experience a significant loss of spatial coherence (Supplementary Fig. 14). Encouraged by these findings, we next sought to establish correspondence of particular domains at k = 1300 to known neuroanatomy.

We characterized CellTransformer's ability to capture known anatomical structure in the hippocampal formation, notably the subiculum (SUB) and prosubiculum (PS), in the Allen 1 dataset. We focused on this area because it is well characterized with respect to both connectivity31 and transcriptomic composition32,33. These structures were investigated in Ding et al.34, where the authors performed consensus clustering of glutamatergic neurons and subsequent ISH experiments were used to comprehensively map domains in dorsal subiculum (SUBd) and dorsal and ventral prosubiculum (PSd and PSv). Specifically, this and other recent works have noted the extensive laminar organization (superficial layers to deeper layers), and the dorsal-ventral organization of the subiculum35,36,37. This organization has been attributed to distinct and correlated patterns of gene expression and connectivity.

We qualitatively compared spatial domains discovered by CellTransformer with k = 1300 to the anatomical borders identified in Ding et al. (Fig. 3a). The subiculum features a three-layer organization referred to as the molecular (mo) layer, the pyramidal cell (py) layer, and the polymorphic (po) cell layer. Figure 3a shows a diagram of SUB and PS regions based on Ding et al. with the pyramidal and polymorphic layers of SUB and PS annotated in bold black text. Figure 3b shows discovered spatial domains at k = 1300 across four sequential sections corresponding to those in Ding et al.34. A subset of domains corresponding to SUB and PS are shown in Fig. 3c along with putative regional annotations. CellTransformer identifies a three-layer organization in the dorsal subiculum corresponding to that in Ding et al. labeled SUBd-py (light green), SUBd-po (gold), and SUBd-mo (gray-blue). CellTransformer also correctly splits the SUBd and PSd shown with black dotted lines on the image of section 32. Three-layer strata are also observed in PSd, although notably the pyramidal layer domain extends caudally, consistent with transcriptomic studies31,32,33 of SUB architecture. For instance, our PSd-po domains (sections 31 and 30) strongly resemble the HGEA layer 4 found in Bienkowski et al.31. Note that differences may arise between panels in Fig. 3a, c because of sectioning variability and lack of exact match between sections in ABC-WMB and the Ding et al. study. In addition to the aforementioned regions we also observe high agreement in areas such as in the hippocampus-amygdaloid transition area (HA) and ventral prosubiculum (PSv).

Two genes per domain are shown and each gene is expressed with at least log-fold change greater than 1 relative to the other domains. Abbreviations: PS-mo prosubiculum molecular layer, PS-py pyramidal layer of subiculum, SUBv-py ventral subiculum, pyramidal layer, HA-py hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area, pyramidal layer, HA-po hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area, polymorphic layer, SUB-mo subiculum, molecular layer, PSd-po dorsal prosubiculum, polymorphic layer, PSv-po ventral prosubiculum, polymorphic layer, PSd-py dorsal prosubiculum, pyramidal layer, SUBd-py dorsal subiculum, pyramidal layer, SUBv-py ventral subiculum, pyramidal layer, PSv-po ventral prosubiculum, polymorphic layer, PSd-po dorsal prosubiculum, polymorphic layer.

Ding et al.34 observed differential projection topology in dorsal subiculum versus ventral prosubiculum. Correspondingly, genes were found to form opposing gradients across the length of subicular areas. Dorsolateral gene gradients appeared in SUBd and ventromedial gradients in PSv. Since CellTransformer domains appeared to correspond well with literature results, we explored gene expression patterns across domains to verify whether dorsal-ventral and medial-laterally varying gene patterns could be observed. We conducted differential expression analysis across our subicular domains (Fig. 3e), which, when visualized (Fig. 3d), clearly reflected these gradients. Many genes expressed in SUB and PS traverse their long axis as reported previously32. The identification of spatial domains that subdivided specific layers of PS and SUB, similar to the results in Ding et al. and featured similar types of gene expression gradients as existing literature, suggests that our pipeline was successful in learning neuroanatomically useful information. Importantly, while results in Ding et al. and related works were enabled by significant neuroanatomical and experimental expertise, CellTransformer allows identification of granular tissue structure in a data-driven fashion. Encouraged by this result, we continued our investigation of CellTransformer correspondence with known literature with a comparison in superior colliculus.

Recent studies using systematic mapping of cortico-tectal fibers in the superior colliculus (SC) have identified distinct laminar and columnar structure38, suggestive of the complex role SC plays in the integration of sensory information and the coordination of signals. Therefore, SC presented an excellent opportunity to identify transcriptomic and cellular correlates of connectomic variation. We observed a strong correspondence of three of our spatial clusters (k = 1300) in the Allen 1 dataset with known layers of superior colliculus, sensory area, particularly the zonal (zo), superficial gray (sg), and optic (op) layers across a set of tissue sections spanning ~600 µm from anterior to posterior (rows of Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 17a). CellCharter was unable to identify these structures (Supplementary Fig. 14) at k = 670 (demonstrating a significant drop in spatial coherence at higher k) and only identifies two layers in SC, which does not conform with existing understanding.

a Putative subregions of sensory layers of superior colliculus in tissue section 32 identified with k = 1300 CellTransformer domains. CCF registration is in the first column, with zonal (zo), superficial gray (sg), and optic (op) layers labeled by the color of their CellTransformer domain in third, fourth, and fifth columns. The second column shows all cells with color labels from their spatial domain from CellTransformer at k = 1300. The third, fourth, and fifth columns show the putative zo (gray-green), sg (purple), and op (red) domains. These columns also show the spatial distribution of one supertype level cell type in yellow across the section. b Sequential tissue sections (32: anterior, 31: posterior) shown similarly to (a) but visualizing subregions of the intermediate gray and intermediate white layers, which are indicated with black arrows in the CCF registered annotation image. c Proportions of different supertype level cell types for top-ten most abundant types in different spatial domains. Colors refer to the same spatial domain label in (a, b). Cell types visualized in (b) are denoted with a yellow asterisk. d Barplot of the percentage of cells of a given neurotransmitter class found in a given region (GABA GABAergic, Glut Glutamatergic, NN non-neuronal). e Number of unique cell types (at supertype level) found in each domain, grouped by neurotransmitter class.

By visualizing the cell type composition within the top-ten most abundant types for these three spatial domains (Supplementary Fig. 17a, b), we were able to identify cell types that were highly selective for our data-driven SC layers: types 0873 SCsg Gabrr2 Gaba_2, 0861 SCs Pax7 Nfia Gaba_3, and 0788 SCop Sln Glut_1. Crucially, the cell types, which have already been annotated as being associated with one of the zonal, optic, or superficial gray, are identified automatically by CellTransformer. We chose the supertype level to allow inspection of abundant cell types without being difficult to visualize. Supertype-level visualizations also show that even with granular cell types (1201 types in Yao et al.) CellTransformer domains are often marked by spatially specific cell type patterning; we note that we do not filter cells outside of our putative superior colliculus layers for visualization. Next we visualized the percentage of cells in each domain (Supplementary Fig. 17c), grouping them by neurotransmitter class (GABA-ergic, glutamatergic, and non-neuronal). The superficial gray layer showed the higher proportion of GABA-ergic neurons, while the optic layer had the highest proportion of glutamatergic neurons. To further explore these relationships, we calculated the number of distinct cell types (supertype level) within each neurotransmitter class and domain. A clear dorsal-ventral organization was evident (Supplementary Fig. 17d) with the number of GABA-ergic and glutamatergic neuron types increasing with layer depth, suggesting CellTransformer's ability in capturing complex patterns of cellular spatial organization.

Encouraged by these findings, we also investigated subregions of the intermediate gray and intermediate white areas of the motor-related areas in SC (Fig. 4a, b), where we identify consistent regions across two consecutive sections that are not annotated in the CCF (rows of Fig. 4b). We define subregions of intermediate gray (ig) and white (iw), noting a medial-lateral structure similar to that in Benavidez et al.38, which exhaustively cataloged projection zones in superior colliculus. Notably unlike in superior colliculus sensory, a significant number of non-neuronal cell types are found in very similar proportions across the intermediate white and gray layers (Fig. 4c), and instead differences in regions may be attributable to varying proportions of rare cell types. Encouragingly, even in these fine-grained areas, cell types that are highly specific for our data-driven layers can be readily identified (columns of Fig. 4b). These rare domain-enriched cell types include: 0849 SCm-PAG Cdh23 Gaba_2 (enriched in the medial intermediate white layer, shown in dark green), 0769 SCig SCiw Pitx2 Glut_3 (enriched in lateral intermediate white, shown in light blue), and 0764 SCig-an-PTT Foxb1 Glut_1 (enriched in medial intermediate gray, shown in dark blue). The identification of Pitx2-expressing neurons also supports our assertions that CellTransformer identifies biologically relevant domains, with previous studies using Pitx2 expression specifically as an intermediate layer marker in superior colliculus19,35.

We observed complex cell type abundance gradients when visualizing the percentage of cells in a given domain by their neurotransmitter type (Fig. 4). We used supertype level to confirm that spatially-varying cell distribution patterns persisted when using more granular cell type annotations. Lateral domains such as intermediate gray, lateral (shown in dark blue) and intermediate white, lateral (shown in light blue) featured a smaller proportion of GABA-ergic neurons than medial domains but were enriched for glutamatergic neurons and non-neurons (Fig. 4d). Despite the low proportion of GABA-ergic neurons, the lateral domain of intermediate gray possessed the highest number of GABA-ergic neuron cell types (Fig. 4e). Conversely, non-neurons featured the same number of types across the laminae.

Next, we investigated the midbrain reticular nucleus (MRN), a subcortical structure with few anatomical annotations in CCF. MRN is highly enriched for interneurons and appears to play a complex role in movement initiation and release36,37. CellTransformer identifies four subregions of the MRN, which are not included in the existing CCF annotation (Fig. 5a). Plotting cell type proportions across the MRN, we identified cell types that are enriched for these putatively uncharacterized areas, although all domains were predominantly glial (e.g., 1184 MOL NN_4 supertype is abundant in all regions, Fig. 5b). Interestingly, several neuronal types found in these subregions were originally annotated as belonging in inferior colliculus (i.e., 0811 IC Six3 En2 Gaba_5 and 0809 IC En2 Gaba_3)1. However, the fine-grained region derivation by CellTransformer prompted us to perform additional visual inspection (see CCF annotation of MRN identified in Fig. 5a with black arrows) of the MERFISH data and conclude that these neurons are clearly located in MRN. In addition, by visualizing differentially expressed genes across the domains (Fig. 5c), we identified genes that were subregion selective (selected genes shown in Fig. 5d) and form dorsal-ventral expression gradients. Hierarchical clustering showed that the two dorsal domains (purple and brown) group together with the two ventral ones (gold and gray).

a Sequential tissue sections (26 and 25, anterior to posterior). First column: CCF registration with approximate location of midbrain reticular nucleus shown with arrows. Note that registration is not exact and can differ across hemispheres. Second column: all cells in field of view, with color from spatial domains determined with k = 1300. The rest of the columns show only cells located in the MRN, and each column shows a different supertype level cell type in green. b Supertype level cell type proportions for top fifteen most abundant types across the MRN subregions. Cell types visualized in (a) are denoted with green asterisks. c Selected 4 differentially expressed genes across regions. Each gene is expressed at least log fold change greater than 1 relative to the other domains. MERFISH probe distributions for select genes indicated with pink asterisks are shown in (d). d Gene expression gradients across tissue section 25 for Bnc2, Six3, and Pax5, showing specificity for each of the putative MRN subregions. Intensity of color is 0–1 normalized after log scaling raw probe counts. Each dot is a cell, and the color shows the relative transcript count. We show only cells within the subregions to make it visually easier to distinguish the relevant cells. e Bar plot of the percentage of cells for a given neurotransmitter type found in each domain, (GABA GABAergic, Glut Glutamatergic, NN non-neuronal). f Number of unique cell types (at supertype level) found in each domain, grouped by neurotransmitter class.

We again visualized the neurotransmitter composition and the number of unique cell types of given neurotransmitter classes. We observed that the number of types of excitatory neurons was spatially graded. Dorsal domains of MRN (domain 365 shown in purple and domain 198 shown in brown, (Fig. 5e) featured the highest proportion of glutamatergic neurons, and the proportion of glutamatergic neurons in MRN domains decreased with increasing depth. Non-neuronal cells are also organized along this gradient, but in the opposite direction, the ventral areas featuring the highest proportion of glia and the dorsal areas the lowest. Interestingly, MRN domains composed of a higher proportion of glutamatergic neurons were also the ones with the greatest number of glutamatergic neuron types, also following the dorsal-ventral gradient (Pearson correlation r = 0.89). This relationship was observed for nonneuronal cells (Pearson correlation r = 0.81, Fig. 5f), but not for GABA-ergic neurons (Pearson correlation r = −0.64). This suggests that CellTransformer can identify plausible structures even in historically difficult to characterize areas.

In order to investigate CellTransformer's ability to integrate across animals, we trained a new model from scratch on the Zhang et al.12 MERFISH data, which uses an 1129 gene panel and is split over four animals, with both coronal (Zhuang 1 and 2) and sagittal sections (Zhuang 3 and 4). We computed embeddings for each neighborhood as in the previous analysis and performed k-means clustering, concatenating representations for all mice and sections. This provided an opportunity to examine whether CellTransformer could adapt to a multi-animal case in addition to finding spatial domains across tissue sections of the same animal.

Spatial domains in sequential tissue sections appeared highly concordant across all four mice (Fig. 6a) at the 50-domain resolution. We used 50 domains to facilitate clear visualization of the domains across animals with relatively few colors. Coronal and sagittal sections across mice clearly corresponded anatomically. Cortical layers were highly consistent across animal and section orientation. Structures that appear in the coronal view can be readily identified in the sagittal sections. For example the hippocampal formation (blue) is well delineated in sections 088 for Zhuang 1, section 044 for Zhuang 2, and across displayed sections of Zhuang 3 and Zhuang 4. Despite a relatively low number of cells in mouse 4 (162,579 cells versus more than 1.0 million for each of the other animals), nearly all spatial domains observed for Zhuang 4 are present in other animals. Note that sections from this animal only cover a section of the lateral portion of the brain and do not span the entirety of the sagittal plane.

a Representative images of all four mice arranged by column. The section number for each mouse is shown in the upper left of each image. Note that Zhuang 4 only had three sagittal sections, which only correspond to one hemisphere of the brain. For each image, each dot is a cell neighborhood and colors come from a spatial clustering with k = 50 (number of CCF regions at structure level), fit by concatenating embeddings across mice. b Quantification of number of per-mouse specific spatial clusters, computed by clustering at different k and computing the number of clusters found for all mice (4 animals) and for the three mice with the most cells per mouse (Zhuang 1, 2, and 3). Note that because serial sections were collected at a higher frequency (100 µm versus 200 µm), different areas of the brain will have marginally higher coverage in one brain or another. This is particularly relevant for Zhuang 4, for which sections only correspond to one hemisphere of the brain and therefore will have limited correspondence with domains in the other animals, which either cover the entire brain anterior-posterior (Zhuang 1 and 2) or across the sagittal axis (Zhuang 3). In contrast, Zhuang 3 does not fully cover a single hemisphere. c Average correlation of the cell type composition of brain regions computed CellTransformer to CCF regions, computed using the linear-sum assignment matching algorithm (exclusively matching regions from one set to the other). Dotted lines with “o” marker indicate results when fitting using all three mice with >1 M cells together. Solid lines with “x” marker indicate results when computing spatial clustering on each mouse in isolation. d Quantification of subject-level information present in embeddings using linear regression. The median absolute prediction error (x-axis) quantifies accuracy in predicting the (x, y, z) coordinates of a neighborhood from its embeddings. The y-axis quantifies accuracy when predicting mouse identity from embeddings using logistic regression. Values are averaged across cells per mouse. e Results of domain discovery (k = 50) on a Slide-SeqV2 whole mouse brain (Macosko 1) dataset13. Two sets of three sequential sections are shown.

We quantified the robustness of CellTransformer domains in a multi-animal context across and within Zhuang 1-4 datasets. We ran clustering and identified domains at the three values of k: 25, 333, 630. These k values correspond to three CCF resolution levels reported by registration in Zhang et al. (note the number of domains differs due to registration differences). For each k value, we counted the number of domains observed in all four animals. We also repeated this analysis without data for Zhuang 4, which contains far fewer cells than the datasets from other animals (Fig. 6b). We find that even at high resolution (630 domains), 93.3% domains were found in each mouse, showing high consistency of CellTransformer domains across datasets. With the Zhuang 4 included, at 630 domains, 80.0% domains were found in every animal. To verify that domain consistency across animals was not related to loss of domain spatial coherence, we repeated the neighborhood smoothness analysis we developed for analysis of the Allen 1 dataset on the combined Zhang et al. data. Spatial smoothness was similar to that of Allen 1 (Supplementary Fig. 18), indicating CellTransformer can discover spatially coherent domains that are robustly integrated across animals.

We next quantified the similarity of CellTransformer domains to CCF regions. Similarly to our analysis of the Yao et al. dataset, we computed average similarity of cell type composition vectors from CCF and CellTransformer. In domain discovery across all animals, we found cell-type composition vectors that correspond strongly to CCF (Pearson correlation = 0.805, red line in Fig. 6b). We also evaluated whether clustering only on embeddings from one animal would significantly affect similarity to CCF. Correspondence between CellTransformer domains and CCF is high even when domains are fit with a subset of the dataset (Pearson correlations >0.7 for all comparisons across resolutions and domain source, Fig. 6c). This demonstrates CellTransformer can reproduce a consistent neuroanatomical structure even with a small number of observations. Results were highly similar overall to CCF in the Zhang dataset and Yao dataset (Pearson correlations greater than 0.6 for all comparisons), indicating CellTransformer's robustness to changes in gene panel and preprocessing choices.

To further investigate how donor metadata was encoded in the embeddings, we employed linear probing strategies commonly used in interpretation of deep learning model embeddings. We regressed CCF-registered (x, y, z) coordinate position across all embeddings and used logistic regression to classify animal identities. Neighborhood level prediction of donor identity was very accurate (>94% for all animals, Fig. 6d) and median absolute prediction error was accurate within 151 µm. Decoding accuracy for both metrics was strongly associated with the number of cells (Pearson correlation −0.92 for coordinate error and 0.92 for predicted donor probability). The observation that mouse donor identity is easily predicted from per-neighborhood embeddings while still maintaining cross-animal and cross-section coherence is another demonstration of the richness of the representation learned by our approach.

Finally to demonstrate the applicability of our strategy to a different spatial transcriptomics modality, we analyzed a whole mouse brain Slide-SeqV2 dataset (“Macosko 1”), collected in Langlieb et al.13. Slide-SeqV2 provides whole transcriptome coverage in a spatial context by tiling tissue slices with 10 µm by 10 µm squares. As each square may contain more than one cell or a partial cell, we fit our model to the deconvoluted single-cell data computed using the RCTD39 method provided. This produced 4,783,976 cells across 101 slices. We also filtered the dataset for low-quality cells and infrequently expressed genes (see Methods). We found that increasing the size of our model (from 4 encoder layers to 10) was necessary to identify spatially coherent domains, perhaps driven by the much larger number of genes detected (5019 versus 500 or 1129 in the two MERFISH datasets; see Methods). We plot three sequential sections from domain discovery at k = 50 (Fig. 6e). We show that CellTransformer robustly identifies cortical layers across sections and in known structures such as the midbrain and the piriform areas. Domain discovery with greater than 50 regions did not produce adequate integration across sections, possibly because of variable cellular density and single-cell read depth across sections.

Overall, we found that the CellTransformer workflow successfully identifies interpretable domains across different spatial transcriptomics modalities, and that the resolution of cross-section and cross-dataset domains depends on the specific spatial transcriptomics method and the quality of the datasets.

In this study, we present a transformer-based pipeline to combine scRNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomic atlases to perform accurate organ-level domain discovery. We developed a custom representation learning workflow and implemented a computationally efficient pipeline that readily allows scaling to multi-million cell, multi-animal datasets. The representations learned in our model can be clustered to identify progressively finer-scale spatial domains directly from local cellular and molecular information alone, without predefined spatial labels. We show these regions can be interpreted at the gene or cell level and recapitulate a variety of existing findings in the neuroscience literature, where many existing methods cannot. Our pipeline allows the extraction of a very high number of domains, which retain high correspondence to the existing brain region ontology (CCF). These domains are also highly spatially consistent both within and across tissue sections and even over multiple animals. Not only can CellTransformer discover this fine structure, but it can reliably find it across animals, even with hundreds of regions. This capability is intrinsic to our model and is learned despite any conditional modeling for donor or section-level covariates, indicating the robustness of learned features.

We note that our objective is not to suggest that the domains discovered by our method are a definitive, normative set of brain regions, and we did not conduct any further validation studies to support these claims. Nor is it to strongly assert that the brain is composed of discrete brain regions, as opposed to a composition of gene expression gradients. Our objective was to develop a tool that would operationally identify plausible brain structures and substructures in a data-driven way and to satisfy a neuroanatomical convention for discrete domains. To support this goal, we used k-means clustering due to its capability to be mini-batched during fitting and because it produced biologically plausible domains; a probabilistic framework such as Gaussian mixture modeling may also have worked well, and possibly would have produced similarly plausible domains. Indeed, the fact that no finite number of domains was identified via our stability criterion suggests the possibility of a significantly larger number of domains.

We demonstrated the robustness of our model in uncovering biologically relevant models and characterized our pipeline's ability to reproduce known neuroanatomy in the hippocampal formation and superior colliculus. Detected domains were concordant with previous comprehensive transcriptomic and connectivity studies of these areas, but were identified in a scalable and data-driven way. Not only were we able to detect known and novel regions, we found that CellTransformer domains can recapitulate and extend known spatial cell type enrichment patterns and gene expression gradients.

We highlight several advantages of our architecture and approach. Although the use of graph-structured architecture or self-attention to model cells in a neighborhood graph is not novel17,27,40, our approach is distinguished by a self-supervised training objective based on spatial correlation between a cell and its neighbors that facilitates learning of a fixed representation for a cellular neighborhood (Supplementary Note 2). The intersection of graph neural networks, transformers, and representation learning research is a rich and rapidly moving research area. Methods for spatial-graph structured data such as CellTransformer will benefit immensely from implementing more effective ways of encoding the data and its metadata such as better position encoding mechanisms41, rotationally-invariant architectures42, or arbitrary numbers of genes43. There are also significant opportunities to extend CellTransformer's local representation framework to include other data modalities. Using a transformer rather than a graph neural network facilitates the inclusion of arbitrary contextual data, such as cell-level (e.g., neurophysiology44,45) and pixel-level data (e.g., mesoscale axonal connectivity46, or magnetic resonance imaging47), which can be tokenized and included in our framework.

Caveats of our approach include the necessity of a user-specified spatial radius (for neighborhood computation) and the choice of k for spatial cluster detection. The stability of detected spatial domains at a given radius or k poses an interesting future angle from which to study anatomical hierarchies in the brain. Users must also have access to GPUs (to allow for timely model fitting), which reduces overall accessibility, although the hardware requirements are still much less intensive than for many existing models such as spaGCN and scENVI4.

CellTransformer advances the state of the art for automated domain detection by facilitating the identification of granular and biologically relevant spatial domains that are extensible to very large, multi-animal spatial transcriptomic datasets. As spatially resolved transcriptomic and multi-omics studies of the brain become more prevalent, tools such as CellTransformer provide avenues to transform data into refined anatomical maps of the brain and other complex organs and pave the way towards tissue-level structure-function mapping.

We downloaded the log-transformed MERFISH probe counts and metadata for the Allen Institute for Brain Science animal (“Allen 1”) from the Allen Institute public release (https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/intro.html) access for ABC-WMB. The Allen 1 dataset is composed of 53 coronal sections. The MERFISH probe set included 500 genes. Serial sections were collected at 200 μm intervals. We used the taxonomy from the “20231215” data release. Allen 1 is composed of 3,737,550 cells. We transformed the (x, y) coordinates of each cell into microns instead of mm as provided. Otherwise, the dataset was used as-is for neural network training.

Data were downloaded from the “20230830” data release from the Allen Institute ABC-WMB public data release. Two animals (“Zhuang 1” and “Zhuang 2”) were collected with coronal sections. The other two animals (“Zhuang 3” and “Zhuang 4”) were collected sagittally. Serial sections for Zhuang 1 (female) were collected at 100 μm intervals, while serial sections for the other animals (all male) were collected at 200 μm intervals. The size of the MERFISH probe set included 1129 genes. Zhuang 1 and Zhuang 2 consist of 2,846,909 cells and 1,227,409 cells, respectively. Zhuang 3 and Zhuang 4 consist of 1,585,844 cells and 162,579 cells, respectively. We transformed the (x, y) coordinates of each cell into microns instead of mm as provided. Otherwise, the data were used as-is for neural network training.

We consider cells in the same neighborhood as a reference cell if the distance between them is within a box of fixed size. For all MERFISH datasets, we used a box width of 85 μm.

We construct a CellTransformer to generate a latent representation from a cellular neighborhood where this representation is composed of both molecular and cell type information. We represent cells as nodes in an undirected graph, \(G=(V,E)\) where \(V\) indexes the nodes in the graph (cells) and we add an edge \(({x}_{i},{x}_{j})\) to the edge set \(E\) if \({r > d}_{i,j\,}\), with \(r\) a user-specified distance in microns. We assume also that for each node we have access to \({x}_{i}\in {R}^{g}\), a \(g\)-dimensional vector of MERFISH probe or cell deconvoluted transcript counts. We also assume we are given class labels \({{\bf{c}}}={\left\{{c}_{i}\in \left\{1,\ldots,C\right\}\right\}}_{i=1}^{N}\) for each of the \(N\) cells. The user must also specify an embedding dimension and number of transformer encoder and decoder layers; in all experiments in this paper, using MERFISH data, we use an embedding dimension of 384, 4 encoder layers, and 4 decoder layers. For Slide-SeqV2 analysis, we used 10 encoder layers and 4 decoder layers.

To generate a neighborhood embedding, we identify a particular cell which we call a reference cell. Its first degree neighbors are extracted from \(G\). We first apply a shallow encoder (two layer perceptron with GELU nonlinearity) function \({f}_{\theta }:{R}^{g}\to {R}^{192}\) which maps the gene expression into embedding space. We likewise construct and apply the function \({g}_{\theta }:{R}^{C}\to {R}^{192}\) to map one-hot encoded cell type labels to an embedding space, here a simple lookup into a learnable embedding table. These representations are concatenated into a single 384-dimensional representation. We apply these transformations to each cell in the neighborhood, not including the reference cell. We note that at this point, all operations have been performed per cell without interactions. In addition to these cell tokens, we also instantiate for each neighborhood a register token, which we use to accumulate global information across the neighborhood. We refer to this token as a <cls > -like token in keeping with previous literature.

We then apply a transformer encoder to the cells, only allowing cells within the same neighborhood and their <cls > -like tokens to attend to each other. We use 8 attention heads with GELU activations and layer norm prior to attention and MLP projection. We note that including a bias term in the key, query, and value MLPs is important to stabilize training, while not noting any significant differences in models fit with and without bias terms for the rest of the encoder and decoder layer MLPs. Following the transformer encoder, we use attention pooling to aggregate the cell and <cls> representations for each neighborhood into a single token with embedding dimension 384. We refer to these as the neighborhood representations.

We then instantiate a new token from each reference cell that is a learned embedding for each cell type (separately from the encoder cell type embedding). These are concatenated to the neighborhood representations. We then apply a transformer decoder to the tokens, allowing only the neighborhood token and masked cell embedding to attend to each other if they are from the same cellular neighborhood. This decoder embedding dimension was 384 with 8 attention heads.

During training, we extract only the masked reference cell tokens. We then use separate linear projections to output the mean, dispersion, scale, and zero inflation logit parameters for zero-inflated negative binomial regression. We optimize the model by minimizing the log likelihood of a negative binomial distribution using observed cells' MERFISH probe counts. We trained all versions of CellTransformer on a system with 2 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs with an effective batch size of 256.

Once trained, we apply CellTransformer to a given dataset and instead of extracting reference cell tokens we extract the neighborhood representation. We then cluster this representation using k-means. We use the cuml library to perform this operation on GPU (cuml.KMeans), with arguments n_init=3, oversampling_factor=3, and max_iter=1000.

We observe that spatial domains are spatially smooth. However, in the case that there is a high-frequency signal that the end-user would like to filter, we optionally introduce a step prior to k-means where we smooth the embeddings using a Gaussian filter. For all comparisons except those in Supplementary Fig. 12, smoothing was performed with a Gaussian filter with a 40 μm full-width at half maxima (sigma of 12.01 μm).

We used an 80–20% train-test split proportion (random splitting across the entire dataset) and the ADAM optimizer over 40 epochs. We perform a linear warmup for 500 steps to a peak learning rate of 0.001 and use an inverse-square root learning rate scheduler to decay the learning rate continuously. We use a weight decay value of 0.00005, which we do not warm up.

We perform training from scratch without transfer. We trained for 40 epochs with the same settings as for the Allen 1, with the exception of adapting projections to 1129 genes instead of 500.

We follow Wu et al. in using an Amari-type distance to compare clustering solutions. Briefly, we compute several replicates (20 in this work) of k-means at a given choice of k with different random seeds \({D}_{k,i}\), with i indexing the different centroids for a given solution. We then measure the stability of a given choice of k by comparing the similarity of all pairs of \({D}_{k}\). Define C the Pearson correlation matrix between pairs D and \(D{\prime}\). Then we use this dissimilarity metric:

to identify the choice of k which is most stable.

To quantify the overall similarity of regions extracted using CellTransformer with CCF, we first extract cell type composition vectors for each region at a given level of the hierarchy. For all comparisons in Fig. 2, we use the subclass level (338 cell types), resulting in k-region by 338 matrices. For each region derived from one of the tested models, we compute two quantities: the best match (maximum value of Pearson correlation, non-exclusively) to any CCF (Fig. 2d) or an exclusive match (using the linear sum assignment algorithm) to pair the regions from either set one-to-one (Fig. 2e). We then computed the average Pearson correlation across the paired matches as the metric. We use scipy.optimize's implementation to solve the linear sum problem.

To run CellCharter, we first generated scVI embeddings using the default settings for depth and width of the network and with the tissue section labels as conditional batch variables. We trained for 50 epochs using the early_stopping=True setting. We then aggregated across 3 (default settings), 6, 9 layers using the cellcharter.gr.aggregate_neighbors function. We then applied CellCharter's Gaussian mixture model implementation at various choices of the number of Gaussians. We could not run the mixture model with our hardware (A6000, 48GB GPU memory) for more than 9 layers, which was also the number that produced the highest correspondence with CCF and is reported in Fig. 2e.

To run SPIRAL we generated edge sets for 40 μm, 85 μm, and 170 μm neighborhood radii. SPIRAL requires supervision on single-cell types so for this we use the subclass cell type levels. We trained models across neighborhood sizes for 1 epoch and then chose the neighborhood size with best performance (170 μm) and trained this model to saturation (10 epochs). SPIRAL uses four objective functions so to assess saturation we averaged them. We note that SPIRAL does not use a training and testing set split in their training, making it difficult to assess an optimal stopping point. For the k = 354 and k = 670 domain discovery analyses the SPIRAL clustering pipeline produced an out-of-memory error and we instead used our own pipeline with k-means on SPIRAL embeddings.

To quantify the smoothness of the spatial domains, we use a nearest-neighbor approach. We extract approximate spatial neighbors for each cell using cuml.NearestNeighbor with 100 neighbors, restricting neighbors to be within the same tissue section. For a given domain set, either from CCF, CellTransformer, or CellCharter, we extract the spatial domain label of the given cell and count the proportion of times that cell is observed in the 100 neighbors. These proportions are averaged across all cells and tissues.

First, for a given domain at a given resolution (choice of k), we average the nearest-neighbor smoothness values over each domain. This process was performed for each compared method and for the CCF domains at 25 domains (matching the CCF division annotations), 354 domains (matching the CCF structure annotations) and 670 domains (matching the CCF substructure annotations). Then, for a given resolution, we used the per-domain average smoothness distribution from the CCF domain sets to derive a per-resolution cutoff. The cutoff was set at the 20th percentile value for each CCF annotation level. We then applied the cutoffs for each resolution to each of the corresponding data-driven domain sets.

To extend the discreteness analysis to domain sets larger than 670, we used the 20th percentile value for the substructure annotations without adjusting them for different values of k.

We extract neighborhood representations for each of the cells in the Zhuang lab datasets. First, we regress these embeddings on the (x, y, z) coordinates. We then computed the absolute prediction error in terms of the coordinates and then reported the average. We also fit a multi-class logistic regression using the mouse donor identity. For the logistic regression, we use cuml.LogisticRegression with default settings in cuml. For the cell position regression we fit simple least squares using PyTorch via QR decomposition.

We interpret the accuracy of the gene expression predictions for a given cell as an index of the correlation of an instance of a particular cell type with its surrounding neighbors. To do this, we compute a simple baseline model that predicts average gene expression (computed across the entire Allen Institute for Brain Science mouse dataset) for each cell. We compute the average Pearson correlation for each instance of a given cell type and average across instances to obtain an average Pearson correlation. We then compute a Pearson correlation between each cell's observed gene expression and the CellTransformer predictions, averaging similarly across instances of a given cell type. The difference between the baseline and model predictions is displayed, per cell type, and grouped across neurotransmitter types in Supplementary Fig. 12.

We contrast two methods of extracting spatial domains from the four animals in the Zhuang lab dataset12. We first fix k, the number of desired spatial domains. Then we fit one k-means model on all of the neighborhood embeddings for all four (Zhuang 1, 2, 3, and 4) mice together. We also fit a k-means model to the embeddings of the mice separately. We then compute the similarity of these region sets using the same method used to quantify differences between CellCharter and CellTransformer by comparing their regional cell type composition vectors.

Initial results with a direct transfer of hyperparameters to the Langlieb et al.13 dataset13 did not produce spatially coherent domains. We therefore implemented two quality control procedures on the raw data. After filtering for coding genes and non-mitochondrial genes, we additionally used only genes that were expressed in >10% of cells in the dataset. At the cellular level, we identified cells with >20% mitochondrial genes and those within the 10th percentile of read depth across each section. We also removed these cells. This left 5019 genes and 4,783,456 cells. We noted that a successful segmentation in the Langlieb et al. dataset required a larger model than the MERFISH ones, using 10 encoder layers rather than 4, which we attributed to the 10X higher number of genes in this dataset versus the 500 in the ABC-WMB Allen 1 dataset. We used a neighborhood size of 50 μm to reduce memory footprint, reasoning the higher cell density in this dataset and higher number of genes would provide enough information for representational richness.

Predicting expected traffic crashes and designing targeted interventions are highly challenging due to the inherent complexity of crash data and persistent concerns over the prediction trustworthiness. We introduce SafeTraffic Copilot that adapts Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform expected crash prediction as a text-reasoning task, then attribute critical features for targeted safety interventions. Within the Copilot, SafeTraffic LLM is customized then fine-tuned on the textualized SafeTraffic Event dataset, which consists of 66,205 real-world crash cases with 14.5 million words from five U.S. states. Across multiple prediction tasks including crash type, severity, and number of injuries, SafeTraffic LLM demonstrates a 33.3% to 45.8% improvement in average F1-score over existing works. To interpret these results and inform safety interventions, we introduce SafeTraffic Attribution, a sentence-level feature-attribution framework enabling conditional “what-if" risk analysis. Findings reveal that alcohol-impaired driving is the leading factor for severe crashes, with impairment-related and aggressive behaviors contributing nearly three times more risk than other behaviors. Furthermore, SafeTraffic Attribution identifies critical features during fine-tuning, guiding crash data collection strategies for continual improvement. SafeTraffic Copilot enables prediction and reasoning of conditional crash risks through foundation models, thereby supporting traffic safety improvements and offering clear advantages in generalization, adaptation, and trustworthiness.

Road traffic injury remains a stubborn public health crisis in the United States. In 2022 alone, 42,795 people were killed on U.S. roads—one of the highest per capita fatality rates in the developed world1. Despite decades of counter-measures, the fatality curve continues to rise, especially in the United States (as shown in Fig. 1a), underscoring an urgent need for new data-driven techniques that can uncover the mechanisms of crashes and inform decisive policy action. Expected crash prediction models (hereafter referred to as crash prediction) offer a principled way to learn from historical data and isolate the factors that most strongly elevate risk2.

a The U.S. faces one of the highest crash risks among developed countries, with a rising trend. However, analyzing and addressing this issue is challenging due to the heterogeneous factors involved in crash events, including traffic conditions, human behavior, environmental impacts, and driver characteristics. To tackle this, we propose SafeTraffic Copilot, a framework designed for two key tasks: (1) Predicting crash outcomes and (2) Attributing crash factors for conditional risk analysis. By addressing questions such as why crashes occur and how to mitigate crash risks, SafeTraffic Copilot seeks to deliver optimal policies for safety improvement. b The SafeTraffic Copilot workflow incorporates multi-modal data, including driver behavior, vehicle details, infrastructure, and environmental conditions, represented through textual reports, satellite imagery, and other formats. Leveraging an AI-expert cooperative method, the crash data is transformed into textual prompts, resulting in the SafeTraffic Event dataset comprising 66,205 cases. SafeTraffic LLM is created with accurate and trustworthy forecasting abilities for further analysis. Building on this pipeline, SafeTraffic Attribution operates across three dimensions: (1) Event-level risk analysis to identify feature contributions, (2) Conditional risk analysis to assess state-level risks under varying conditions, and (3) Data collection guidance to optimize the data acquisition process. The results of SafeTraffic Attribution provide actionable insights to enhance data analysis and collection, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of crash data and events.

The current approaches to crash prediction are broadly categorized into macroscopic, statistical-level analyses, and microscopic, event-level investigations. Macroscopic models offer a general understanding of safety performance, identifying high-risk areas and temporal trends, but they lack the granularity to explain the specific circumstances of a crash—the who, what, and why3,4,5,6. While microscopic models, often employing machine learning, aim to predict crash consequences under specific traffic conditions, they have struggled with precision and generalization4,7,8,9,10. A fundamental challenge lies in effectively integrating the multi-modal data associated with a crash event, spanning textual narratives, numerical data, images, and driver histories, and interpreting the complex interplay of contributing factors, thereby limiting their utility in designing effective safety policies.

The recent emergence of foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), presents a transformative opportunity to mitigate these enduring challenges by leveraging their advanced capabilities in processing and reasoning from complex, multi-modal information11,12,13,14,15. These models can synthesize and interpret vast, unstructured data, such as the narrative descriptions in crash reports, and align them with structured data like roadway characteristics and driver histories, offering a more holistic understanding than was previously possible. However, adapting these powerful generative models for the discriminative task of crash outcome prediction introduces its own set of technical hurdles. The primary challenge is methodological: generative LLMs with extensive output vocabularies must be re-engineered to reliably predict outcomes within a set of well-defined, finite categories (e.g., crash severity levels)16. This adaptation raises major concerns about the trustworthiness and calibration of their predictions, which is crucial for high-stakes applications like public safety17. Furthermore, the inherent “black box" nature of these models poses a major obstacle to achieving the interpretability required for targeted safety improvements18,19,20. While initial studies have explored LLMs for traffic safety, they have been limited to prompt engineering and have not addressed the crucial interpretability gap, which is essential for robust decision support and for answering the critical why and how questions of crash causation21,22,23.

In this research, we introduce SafeTraffic Copilot, a LLM-driven framework that shifts the paradigm from aggregate-level statistics to granular, event-level crash prediction and understanding (see Fig. 1b). By reframing crash prediction as a text-based reasoning task, SafeTraffic Copilot is designed to address the key challenges of data integration, model generalization, and feature attribution. The framework consists of three integrated components: SafeTraffic Event dataset, for unifying multi-modal crash data; SafeTraffic LLM, for accurate outcome prediction; and SafeTraffic Attribution, for conditional risk analysis. This approach allows us to not only forecast the when, where, who, and what of a crash but also to provide a deep, interpretable understanding of why it occurred and how similar risks can be mitigated, offering a unified approach for targeted and effective data-driven safety interventions.

This study shifts traffic safety analysis from aggregate-level to event-level crash prediction by developing SafeTraffic Copilot, a customized LLM framework that integrates multi-modal crash data into the broader semantic context to forecast consequences and attribute features with interpretability. Using SafeTraffic Event dataset (66,205 textual prompts; over 14 million words) and framing outcome prediction as token generation, SafeTraffic LLM delivers a 33.3% to 45.8% average F1 improvement over competitive baselines across multiple crash-consequence tasks. By embedding traffic-safety priors and explicitly targeting the number of injuries, crash severity, and crash type via special tokens, SafeTraffic Copilot yields accurate and trustworthy predictions, where the accuracy increases with confidence, achieving over 70% accuracy when the confidence score exceeds 60%, and 95% precision for fatal-crash predictions at the same threshold. Our proposed textual feature-attribution module provides event- and state-level insight—it simultaneously uncovers what drives risk in a specific crash, enabling conditional intervention, and what information drives model quality at scale, guiding strategic data-collection policies for long-term accuracy. Specifically, the proposed sentence-level Shapley scores identify high-risk scenarios (such as “alcohol-impaired,” “work-zone,” “inappropriate behaviors,” etc.) for actionable “what-if” analysis. For example, combining alcohol impairment with a work-zone setting nearly doubles the likelihood of a severe crash compared with sober driving under identical conditions. Further, summing Shapley contributions across the entire fine-tuning dataset ranks data fields by their marginal impact on prediction accuracy and confidence score, thereby guiding first-responders toward the details that matter and streamlining continuous model updates. For example, unit information (driver and vehicle attributes) accounts for more than 40% of the contribution to crash severity prediction, highlighting these fields as priority entries for future crash documentation.

In our research, we define crash prediction as expected (conditional) crash prediction, a definition consistent with the agencies and established literature4,24,25,26. Officially, expected crash prediction is defined as the task of estimating expected crash characteristics, including crash type, severity, number of injuries, and their likelihood of occurrence, under specified conditions. These estimations are based on expected traffic conditions and relevant contextual information, such as roadway attributes, environmental conditions, traffic volumes, and driver behaviors.

The prediction targets consist of three variables with belonged confidence score: Number of Injury, Severity, and Crash Type (see Fig. 2)27,28. Specifically, Number of Injury task predicts the number of people injured in the given crash event. We define the number of injuries as the total number of non-fatal injuries, including possible, minor, and serious injuries, obtained by subtracting fatalities from the total number of injured people in a crash. Number of Injury task is treated as a classification task with four categories: zero, one, two, and three or more than three, where crashes involving more than two injured people are grouped into a single category due to the limited number of such cases. The Severity task assesses the level of injury severity in a crash, classified into five levels from no apparent injury to fatal. Type task predicts the type of crash, such as the rear-end collision or collision with object, with 14 crash type categories in the Washington dataset and 16 in the Illinois dataset. Detailed information on the defined targets and confidence scores is available in “SafeTraffic Event dataset construction" and “Expected crash prediction confidence score calculation" in the “Methods” section.

Multi-modal crash data is collected and organized into textual prompts through an AI-expert cooperative process. The Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) crash data, satellite images, and infrastructure data are used to extract general and infrastructure information, including the crash time, location, the road level, and so on. The vehicle data and person data are converted into the event information and the unit information, including vehicle movements, driver characteristics (e.g., age, gender, alcohol use), vehicle attributes (e.g., manufacture year), and so on. SafeTraffic Event dataset is created with three prediction targets: Number of Injury, Severity, and Type. The Number of Injury task predicts the number of people injured in the crash event, the Severity task estimates the severity level of the crash, such as no apparent injury or fatal, and the Type task classifies type of crash, such as single vehicle with object or angle impacts right (The crash event outcomes classification are provided in Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Table 5). The SafeTraffic LLM is fine-tuned using the SafeTraffic Event dataset. To reframe the crash outcomes prediction from a classification task to a language inference task, SafeTraffic LLM is fine-tuned by adding prediction targets as special tokens in its vocabulary and adjusting parameters using Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA)37, a lightweight fine-tuning technique that injects trainable rank-decomposed matrices into each layer without updating the full model.

Our cleaned dataset comprises crash data from Washington State in 2022, totaling 16,188 records, and from Illinois in 2022, totaling 42,715 records, after excluding cases with missing key attributes related to vehicle or crash object status. Primary sources include the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) crash data29, the state crash report, and satellite images30. HSIS is a multistate database that contains crash, roadway inventory, and traffic volume data for a select group of States. The HSIS crash data contains four major components: crash data, infrastructure data, vehicle data, and person data. Crash data provides detailed descriptions of crashes, such as location, time, and injury severity. Infrastructure data includes information about road layouts and traffic characteristics, such as road level and speed limits. Vehicle data contains details such as manufacturing year and reported defects of the involved vehicles, while person data captures demographic and other relevant details about drivers and passengers, such as age and gender. Satellite images complement the HSIS data by providing additional visual context, including information about lanes, intersections, and other roadway attributes. Further information on raw data formats and types is available in “Raw data” in the “Methods” section.

In addition to the Washington and Illinois datasets, we also collect and process 2250 crash cases from Maine, 2250 from Ohio, and 2802 from North Carolina to evaluate the model's zero-shot generalization. Their raw data sources align with those used for Illinois and Washington. Using the Illinois State prompt template (due to its closer data format), we converted the records into prompt format, keeping shared features and setting unmatched ones to null. Differences in data representation (e.g., driver alcohol levels as a numeric value in Illinois versus a textual descriptor in Maine) introduce unseen values and distributions, enabling evaluation of the model's zero-shot generalization.

To leverage the multi-modal crash data described above for crash prediction, we developed the SafeTraffic Copilot crash outcomes prediction pipeline, which transforms crash outcomes prediction into a text-based reasoning task. To achieve this, the raw crash data is organized into the textual SafeTraffic Event dataset, which is then used to fine-tune the SafeTraffic LLM. Figure 2 presents an overview of the proposed pipeline.

The SafeTraffic Event dataset is created through an AI-expert cooperative textualization process, organizing multi-modal raw data for effective crash prediction. The detailed information about the raw data feature engineering and the textualization process is available in “SafeTraffic Event dataset construction" in the “Methods” section. As shown in Fig. 2, the constructed prompts are divided into five parts: one system prompt and four content parts, with each content part containing approximately 100 words. These parts include:

System prompt: provides an introduction and task-specific instructions.

General information: includes general information about the time and location of the prediction region and the roadway category.

Infrastructure information: describes road infrastructure, encompassing static features like the number of lanes and speed limits, as well as dynamic elements such as work zones, lighting, and road surface conditions.

Event information: contains detailed descriptions of crash events, such as the number of vehicles involved and their directions of movement.

Unit information: provides vehicle and individual details relevant for crash prediction, such as airbag status and the driver's age.

To organize and merge the mentioned information for each crash event, we perform feature engineering and textualization, structure the textualized data as input, and process labels corresponding to the three targeted crash prediction tasks from real-world reports. The complete prompt examples are presented in Fig. 3. Ultimately, after filtering out data items with missing information, the SafeTraffic Event dataset merges the complementary information from multi-modal data sources and contains 66,205 crash records with approximately 14.5 million words. These records are split into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1.5:1.5 ratio for Washington and Illinois datasets, while the remaining datasets from three other states are used exclusively for cross-region training-free generalization evaluation.

With SafeTraffic Event dataset, we can adapt LLMs for expected crash prediction. Although vanilla LLMs like Llama 313 possess broad general knowledge and strong text-reasoning capabilities, they demonstrate limited effectiveness on crash prediction tasks without the fine-tuning process (see Supplementary Section 3.1). To address this, we developed SafeTraffic LLM, a specialized model fine-tuned on the processed SafeTraffic Event dataset. This fine-tuning process enhances the LLM's comprehension of crash events and enables accurate outcome prediction. Specifically, additional special tokens are introduced into the LLM vocabulary as prediction targets (Number of Injury, Severity, and Crash Type), fine-tuning the model to generate these tokens during prediction. The details of the fine-tuning are provided in “SafeTraffic LLM” in the “Methods” section.

We evaluate the performance of SafeTraffic LLM and compare its performance with other baselines (see “Adopted baselines" in the “Methods” section). The fine-tuning process is based on two vanilla LLMs with different sizes: Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B. Accuracy, precision, and F1-score are used as the evaluation metrics; the detailed information is available in “Evaluation metrics" in the “Methods” section.

SafeTraffic LLM provides the highest accurate and reliable prediction results across all crash types, severity, and injury counts, even in zero-shot scenarios. Table 1 compares the performances of SafeTraffic LLM and adopted baselines. The results show that the SafeTraffic LLM outperforms all the baselines in each task setting with an average F1-score improvement of 33.3%–45.8% across multiple tasks. SafeTraffic LLM performs well on both the Washington and Illinois datasets, demonstrating its stability across diverse geographical regions. Moreover, as shown in the confusion matrix in Fig. 4a, b, beyond aggregated metrics, SafeTraffic LLM demonstrates a more balanced prediction distribution and achieves higher accuracy across individual categories. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4c, d, existing machine learning models tend to predict the dominant categories (e.g., zero under Number of Injury prediction task, no apparent injury under Severity prediction task, and the complete confusion matrix is shown in Supplementary Fig. 7).

The confusion matrices generated by the SafeTraffic LLM for both the a Washington and b Illinois datasets clearly demonstrate improved prediction results (we select the best results for each task based on the F1-score). In contrast, baseline models tend to predict the most frequent category across both the c Washington and d Illinois datasets (we show baseline models with the best F1-score. The performances for other baseline models can be found in Supplementary Fig. 7). Meanwhile, SafeTraffic LLM produces trustworthy predictions for both the e Washington and f Illinois datasets. Higher confidence levels in the model's predictions correspond to an increased likelihood of accuracy. Furthermore, g The SafeTraffic LLM achieves higher precision for fatal-crash predictions. h Fatal-crash predictions also exhibit higher confidence in the Illinois dataset. The Washington dataset is not shown due to limited fatal cases. i For fatal crashes, the SafeTraffic LLM achieves near-perfect precision (97.61%) when the confidence score exceeds 0.6, indicating that the SafeTraffic LLM is highly accurate and trustworthy for fatal crashes. j The 3-year temporal comparison of monthly prediction accuracy across tasks (2019–2021). The used SafeTraffic LLM was fine-tuned on the 2022 Washington dataset and evaluated on the 2019–2021 Washington datasets to assess its temporal generalization capability. The central line represents the median; the box spans from the 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR. k The prediction performance at the county level, aggregated in a box plot. SafeTraffic LLM demonstrates stable performance at the county level for fine-tuning tasks in Illinois (IL) and Washington (WA), as well as zero-shot tasks in Maine (ME), North Carolina (NC), and Ohio (OH). States evaluated in zero-shot settings are highlighted with a gray background. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

SafeTraffic LLM provides trustworthy crash predictions, where a higher confidence score links to higher accuracy. SafeTraffic LLM tailors LLMs for discriminative crash outcomes prediction tasks, generating predictions accompanied by confidence scores that represent the probabilities associated with specific special tokens (see “Expected crash prediction confidence score calculation" in the “Methods” section for the calculation details of the confidence score). Figure 4e, f illustrates the trend of accuracy in relation to the confidence scores of SafeTraffic LLM 's predictions for the Washington and Illinois datasets. The results indicate that our model achieves greater accuracy at higher confidence levels. For instance, for the Number of Injury prediction task in the Washington dataset, when the model's confidence score exceeds 0.40, the accuracy rises above 0.65, and with confidence scores over 0.60, the accuracy surpasses 0.80. This relationship is even more pronounced for fatal-crash predictions (see Fig. 4g–i). The strong positive correlation between confidence scores and accuracy showcases the quantifiable trustworthiness of the SafeTraffic Copilot. By providing reliable confidence scores alongside predictions, the framework empowers informed decision-making in real-world applications.

SafeTraffic LLM exhibits reliable spatial and temporal generalization capabilities. For spatial generalization, we evaluated SafeTraffic LLM by training on the Illinois dataset and testing on three unseen states: Maine, North Carolina, and Ohio. Without any additional fine-tuning, SafeTraffic LLM achieved average F1-scores of 0.576 in North Carolina, 0.613 in Maine, and 0.593 in Ohio, which is comparable to its performance in Illinois (see Table 1). Beyond state-level evaluation, we also assessed generalization at the county level. As shown in Fig. 4j, most counties exhibit an accuracy variation within 10%–20%, demonstrating the model's stable performance across regions. For temporal generalization, we evaluate the model fine-tuned on 2022 Washington data using data from 2019 to 2021 in the same state. As shown in Fig. 4k, the model maintains stable performance across months for all three tasks: Number of Injury, Severity, and Type prediction, with over 75% of the months falling within a  ±10% accuracy range. Aggregated yearly performance is presented in Supplementary Section 3.3.

Understanding how SafeTraffic LLM generates accurate predictions and how various components of the input prompt influence the outcomes is fundamental to enabling evidence-based decision-making. In our analysis, we focus exclusively on severe crashes (i.e., fatal and serious injury crashes) to identify the contributing factors behind these events. As discussed above, the SafeTraffic LLM 's confidence score strongly correlates with its predictive accuracy for severe crashes. Consequently, the confidence score associated with severe crash predictions (hereafter referred to as the confidence score) can be used as an indicator of crash risk level: a higher confidence score corresponds to greater prediction accuracy for severe crashes, which in turn reflects a higher likelihood that the crash is severe (rather than minor or no apparent injury) in the real world. Notably, the SafeTraffic LLM 's confidence scores tend to be lower than their corresponding accuracy values, indicating that using the confidence score is a conservative estimate of risk.

Within the SafeTraffic Attribution framework, a sentence-based feature contributions calculation method was proposed to identify how each sentence contributes to the LLM's outputs based on Shapley theory, which is recognized as a systematic and equitable method for attributing the contribution of each feature to a model's output31,32, thereby revealing crash-related factors at the event level (see “SafeTraffic Attribution” in the “Methods” section for details). In essence, each feature's contribution represents its share of responsibility for the model's confidence in a particular prediction. The sum of all feature contributions equals the confidence score itself. Figure 5 illustrates sentence-level feature contributions for the severity of individual crash events, using one crash from Washington and one from Illinois as examples. In the Washington crash example (Fig. 5a), Driver Behavior (e.g., reckless driving or speeding) is the primary factor contributing to serious injury crashes, with the feature contribution of 0.258. Person Info (e.g., no seatbelt use) also shows a substantial impact with the feature contribution of 0.149. By contrast, Dynamic Info (daylight and dry roads) lowers the probability of a crash with serious injuries with a negative feature contribution of −0.009. While in the Illinois example (Fig. 5b), an elevated BAC (Blood Alcohol Content, with feature contribution of 0.284) and the presence of a Work Zone (feature contribution of 0.462) notably increase the likelihood of fatal-crash outcomes. More additional sentence-level feature-attribution analysis can be found in Supplementary Sections 4.1 and 4.2. The following sections utilize SafeTraffic Attribution framework to examine feature importance from two perspectives: (1) at the inference stage, to identify key factors influencing crash predictions under various conditions and high-risk scenarios, and (2) at the fine-tuning stage, for which data are more critical for model learning.

The left part displays the full prompt from a Washington and b Illinois, with different colors representing various semantic text sequences. The right part illustrates the feature contribution assigned to each text sequence. Positive contributions signify a supportive role in the model's prediction, whereas negative contributions indicate a detracting influence. The absolute value of these contributions represents the importance of each sequence to the model's output.

Conditional analysis evaluates crash outcomes across various scenarios, such as driving with or without alcohol consumption, to quantify the risk factors associated with each scenario. Severe crashes (serious injuries and fatal crashes) were prioritized in the conditional analysis due to their critical importance for traffic safety. These crashes, particularly fatal ones, were predicted accurately and reliably by SafeTraffic LLM (see Fig. 4g–i). Five key contributing factors were identified for this conditional analysis: Driver BAC (BAC = 0 mg/dL or not offered/BAC < 80 mg/dL/BAC ≥ 80 mg/dL), Roadway Type (Highway/not highway), Work Zone (Work zone/not work zone), User Type (Pedalcyclist or pedestrian/not pedalcyclist or pedestrian), and Driver Behavior (Aggressive driving / impairment-related behavior/traffic rules violations/improper driving/others). Collectively, these factors accounted for an average of 79.33% of the model's overall attribution in predicting serious and fatal crashes (see Fig. 6b). A summary of key findings is provided:

The BAC record emerges as a critical determinant in predicting serious and fatal crashes. Among all contributing factors, BAC accounts for 25.26% of the total contribution to serious and fatal-crash prediction (see Fig. 6b). Notably, its contribution substantially increases when a driver consumes alcohol, irrespective of the amount. When drivers are under the influence of alcohol even if their BAC does not exceed the legal intoxication limit of 80 mg/dL33,34, this factor's feature contribution still reaches around 0.45, surpassing that of most other factors in many cases (see Fig. 6a). Conversely, when a driver's BAC is recorded as “zero or not offered,” its contribution approaches zero, indicating minimal impact on the model's predictions.

Driving in a work zone is already risky under sober conditions, but alcohol consumption greatly increases the danger, making it one of the most hazardous scenarios for severe injury crashes. As shown in Fig. 6a, driving in a work zone while sober (“Work Zone-Yes” and “BAC = 0 or not offered”) contributes little to severe crash outcomes, with an average feature contribution of 0.03. However, after consuming alcohol (whether “BAC is higher than 80 mg/dL” or “BAC less than 80 mg/dL”), the work zone feature contribution rises more than seven times to an average of 0.22. Furthermore, the overall crash risk increases substantially when driving in a work zone after drinking, as indicated by an average risk level of 0.78, compared to 0.44 under sober conditions. These findings indicate that work zones become especially hazardous when alcohol consumption is involved, creating one of the highest-risk scenarios for severe crash outcomes. Potential drunk driving warnings and risk mitigation strategies shall be closely linked with work-zone areas.

Aggressive and impairment-related behaviors pose nearly three times the risk for severe crash outcomes compared to other driver behaviors. As illustrated in Fig. 6c, aggressive driving emerges as the most important contributor among driver behaviors, with a median feature contribution of 0.195. Impairment-related behavior, including driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, also has a substantial influence, with a median feature contribution of 0.154. In comparison, other improper driver behaviors, such as traffic rule violations (median feature contribution of 0.055) and distractions like mobile phone use (categorized under improper driving, with median feature contribution of 0.015), show below-average contributions to serious and fatal crashes. The “other" category, which includes normal driving and unknown behaviors, has the smallest impact, with a feature contribution of 0.007.

The co-occurrence of risk factors substantially increases the expected crash risk level. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, c, our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the number of risk factors present in a crash and the expected risk level for severe crash outcomes. High-risk factors are defined as those with a 75th percentile contribution exceeding 0.2 in Fig. 6c, including driving after drinking (BAC < 0 mg/dL), driving in work zones, pedestrian-involved crashes, and high-risk driver behaviors (aggressive or impairment-related). When no risk factor is involved, the average risk level for severe crash outcomes is estimated at 0.47. This value increases to 0.59 with one risk factor, rises to 0.68 with two, and reaches 0.73 when three risk factors co-occur. These findings underscore the need for transportation agencies to implement comprehensive, multi-dimensional interventions, particularly in scenarios characterized by overlapping high-risk conditions.

Higher confidence scores in SafeTraffic LLM 's predictions correspond to greater accuracy, allowing the confidence score (calculated as the sum of feature contributions for all data components) to serve as an indicator of risk level for serious and fatal crashes. a The aggregated average crash risk level under different feature combinations. Cases are grouped based on their combinations of conditions (indicated by dark dots). For each group, the average crash risk level and the average contributions of five key features are calculated and visualized, including driver behavior, user type, whether driving occurred within a work zone, roadway type, and Blood Alcohol Content (BAC, in mg/dL). We use 80 mg/dL as a key threshold, based on the legal limit for ethanol concentration33,34. The detailed data is provided in Supplementary Table 11. b The overall average contribution of each feature. Taking BAC as an example, each case yields a BAC contribution value, and the mean of these values across all cases represents the overall contribution of BAC. The inner circle represents the average absolute contribution, and the outer circle shows its proportional impact on crash risk. c Average feature contribution for each factor under specific values. Boxes are colored pink if the median exceeds the overall median for that factor, and blue otherwise. Each box is annotated with its median value. The central line represents the median; the box spans from the 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR. d Feature contributions of different data components during the training stage for the Washington and Illinois datasets. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

Event information and unit information are the most important components for the model training. While feature contributions at the inference stage reveal which features drive critical crash outcomes, understanding feature contributions during training provides deeper insights into which data components most effectively enhance model accuracy. As shown in Fig. 6d, the feature contributions of each component in the Washington and Illinois datasets are shown, demonstrating their impact on the model's performance during training (see Supplementary Table 10 for detailed results and “SafeTraffic Attribution” in the “Methods” section for calculation details). The results indicate that in both the Washington and Illinois datasets, for the Severity task, the unit information describing attributes of the primary entities involved in the crash has the highest contribution to the model's performance (0.314 in Washington, 0.248 in Illinois). For the Crash Type Prediction task, the event information, which provides information on the vehicle's movement prior to the crash, has the highest contribution (0.388 in Washington, 0.283 in Illinois), followed by the unit information (0.257 in Washington, 0.279 in Illinois) and other components.

Transforming crash prediction into a text-reasoning task unlocks the full richness of multi-modal safety data. By integrating crash narratives, satellite and incident images, and infrastructure attributes into a unified textual prompt, foundational language models can jointly reason over behavioral cues (“alcohol-impaired,” “work-zone”), pre-crash trajectories, and environmental context instead of treating them as disconnected numbers. Our AI-expert co-designed prompts let LLMs outperform conventional baselines while attribution scores reveal which factor combinations, e.g., impairment plus work zones, are the most elevated risk, guiding both targeted interventions and smarter data-collection priorities. This multi-modal-to-text paradigm therefore signals a powerful solution: integrating diverse crash information streams through foundational models not only boosts predictive accuracy but also yields transparent, actionable insights for continuous safety improvements.

Integrating rich data with a powerful foundation-model engine shifts prediction from simple distribution fitting to situational-aware reasoning, yielding transparent and trustworthy insights that generalize across regions. In both Washington and Illinois, accuracy exceeds 70% once confidence surpasses 60%, with a near-linear rise in precision thereafter—giving practitioners a clear, quantifiable handle on uncertainty, as shown in Fig. 4e, f. Furthermore, the proposed SafeTraffic Attribution components turn this trust into action: it ranks textual, visual, and categorical cues by their contribution to confidence, highlighting the levers that most elevate risk. Notably, alcohol-impaired driving raises the severe-crash confidence score by 0.47, underscoring its critical policy relevance.

The SafeTraffic LLM 's conditional attribution engine pinpoints which factor combinations truly drive crash risk with trust, ranking scenarios by danger and revealing actionable “what-ifs.” In data-rich settings, it reliably surfaces high-risk pairings, e.g., alcohol use in work zones or aggressive driving under impairment, guiding focused counter-measures such as on-site BAC checks or behavior-targeted education. Crucially, its probabilistic confidence signals rise with accuracy, lending quantifiable trustworthiness to every recommendation. When data are sparse, the same framework generalizes through simulation: analysts can toggle rarely observed variables (pedestrian presence, freeway geometry, etc.) and still obtain credible risk shifts. This blend of calibrated confidence and flexible what-if analysis empowers agencies to design precise, evidence-based traffic-safety interventions before crashes happen.

Aggregated data-attribution analysis pinpoints the crash-record elements that matter most, offering a generalizable blueprint for smarter, future-proof data collection and quality control. Currently, each state designs its own crash-report form, preventing a common standard and stifling national-scale analytics. During the fine-tuning stage, unit-level details, such as driver behavior, vehicle attributes, and event-level cues, such as vehicle movement, weather, and roadway conditions, emerged as the strongest predictors of injury severity. Prioritizing complete, high-resolution capture of alcohol use, vehicle defects, vulnerable-user status, and road context, therefore, maximizes model payoff, whereas gaps in these fields quickly erode performance. Moreover, the aggregated attribution analysis also provides a quantitative basis for assessing data quality, showing how missing or incomplete values in key components impair model performance. Feeding these insights back into template design lets agencies standardize richer, more consistent reporting protocols that fuel continual model refinement and transferability across regions, accelerating broad safety transformations without sacrificing generalizability.

Limitations and future work of the SafeTraffic Copilot. A primary limitation relates to the handling of multi-modal data. In the SafeTraffic Copilot, satellite images were processed into textual descriptions and incorporated into prompts. While this approach offers flexibility, advancements in multi-modal foundation models and increasing research on integrating multi-modal data with LLMs present promising alternatives35. Leveraging specialized image encoders or utilizing multi-modal foundation models for processing image data are compelling directions. Another potential limitation lies in the efficiency of model training and attribution. Fine-tuning LLMs and computing feature contributions have always required substantial resources and time. Although we employed LoRA fine-tuning and a stratified sampling technique to enhance efficiency36, implementing the complete framework still demands substantial resources. This poses certain limitations when resources are scarce or in situations demanding rapid model deployment.

The raw crash data used in this study were obtained from the HSIS29 and Google Maps30. Data from the HSIS, sourced from multiple systems, encompasses a variety of formats, including categorical, numerical, and textual. In total, four main datasets were used:

Crash data. This dataset captures the essential spatio-temporal and contextual attributes of each crash. It includes crash date, time, day of the week, and month, along with location details such as route number, milepost, and the surrounding area's classification (e.g., rural or urban). Higher-level planning attributes (e.g., roadway and functional classifications, intersection-related indicators) are also recorded. In addition, it documents the dynamic circumstances leading up to the event, including the number of vehicles and pedestrians involved, vehicle travel directions (increasing or decreasing milepost), and any maneuvers performed (e.g., lane changes, straight-line movement).

Infrastructure data. This dataset details the physical and infrastructural features of the crash site. Key elements include the type of road surface (e.g., asphalt or concrete), average annual daily traffic (AADT), posted speed limits, and access control mechanisms. It also encompasses dimensions such as total road width, right and left shoulder widths, and median width (including median barriers if present), as well as road surface conditions (e.g., dry or wet) and ambient lighting at the time of the crash (e.g., daylight or dusk).

Vehicle data. This dataset consolidates information on the vehicles involved in each crash, including vehicle type (e.g., passenger car or truck), intended use (e.g., commercial or private), mechanical condition (e.g., defects), and relevant driver actions (e.g., lane changes or stopping). Additional information on airbag deployment and occupant ejection status provides further granularity.

Person data. This dataset compiles information about individuals involved in the crash, detailing demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and seating position. It also includes the use of safety equipment (e.g., seat belts or helmets) and any contributing factors, such as driver distraction or impairment.

The satellite images obtained from Google Maps serve as a supplementary data source to complement the HSIS dataset. Overall, we collected 16,188 crash event data from Washington State and 42,715 events from Illinois State for further analysis. We also collect and process 2250 events from Maine, 2250 from Ohio, and 2802 from North Carolina to evaluate the model's cross-region training-free generalization.

To adapt the raw data for LLMs' fine-tuning process, we employ the feature engineering and textualization process to generate textual inputs (see Fig. 7). We followed the following process to generate a textual prompt from raw data entry:

Data mapping and organization. For each crash, we associated the crash report with the involved vehicles and individuals using the crash ID, thus obtaining descriptions of the crash and the persons involved. The route ID and milepost were used to identify the specific road segment where the crash occurred, allowing us to gather related road and environment information from infrastructure data. The integrated data was then systematically organized into four categories: general information, infrastructure information, event information, and unit information, aligning with the components outlined above.

a Data processing. Four raw datasets from HSIS (crash, infrastructure, vehicle, and person data) are used to construct a prompt through four steps. (1) Data mapping and organization: Link the datasets and organize them into four parts: general, infrastructure, event, and unit. (2) Satellite image textualization: Retrieve satellite images via GPS coordinates using the Google Maps API, then employ GPT-4o to extract text-based information. (3) Dimensionality reduction: Combine targets with similar values using GPT-4o. (4) Prompt generation: Use the processed data from the previous steps to generate a prompt for each part. b AI-expert textualization. An example of the infrastructure information part of an event case in the Washington dataset is shown.

Satellite images textualization. The HSIS datasets provide GPS coordinates for crash locations in Washington and Illinois. To address missing information, such as the number of road lanes, high-resolution satellite images (512 × 512 pixels at a zoom level of 19) were retrieved using these GPS coordinates via the Google Maps API. These images supplement the crash dataset with crucial infrastructure and environmental context. Descriptive textual annotations were generated from the satellite images using GPT-4, filling key gaps in the original dataset. These annotations include information such as the number of lanes at the crash site, whether the crash occurred at an intersection, and whether the surrounding area is residential. Image-related information enhances the model's performance; see Fig. 8 for details.

The central line represents the median; the box spans from the 25th to 75th percentiles; whiskers extend to 1.5 × IQR. Source data are provided as a Source data file.

Dimensionality reduction. Raw data include abundant attributes with rich and varied descriptions. However, some features suffer from insufficient distinction between attribute values due to the original classification's complexity. To address this, we performed dimensionality reduction on these attributes by combining domain experts' insights with GPT-4o clustering results. For example, similar classifications like “pedalcyclist struck by vehicle" and “pedalcyclist strikes vehicle” were clustered under a broader category such as “pedalcyclist collisions.” This process generalized the data and reduced redundancy. See Supplementary Table 6 for detailed information.

Prompt generation using an AI-expert textualization method. To generate logically coherent and continuous textual data suitable for LLM training, we transformed each category of data into text format using GPT-4o12. All data are organized as key-value pairs, and we get four parts of the key-value pairs for each event case. Then GPT-4o is used to generate the text prompt for each section of the key-value pairs individually. For each part, we apply a straightforward prompt to GPT-4o, such as “Please translate a python dictionary to paragraph, act as a crash data interpreter.” The text content is extracted from GPT-4o's response for each part, consisting of approximately 100 words. By linking four parts of the text, we obtain a comprehensive textual description for each crash event case. The detailed process is shown in Fig. 7b. For the Maine, Ohio, and North Carolina datasets, the prompts were constructed by filling values into the Illinois template if the features are matched; otherwise, the features are set to None in the Illinois template.

We select three variables as the prediction targets: Injury, Severity, and crash Type. The three targets are defined as:

The Injury\({n}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\in \{ \, f(l)| l=0,1, 2, \cdots \,\}\), where i denotes the ith data in the dataset, \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}\in \{{{{\mathcal{W}}}},{{{\mathcal{I}}}}\}\) denotes the Washington dataset \({{{\mathcal{W}}}}\) or the Illinois dataset \({{{\mathcal{I}}}}\), l represents the number of people injured, and f(l) denotes the label when the injured people is l.

The Severity\({s}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\in \{{S}_{k}| k =1,2, \cdots \, \}\), where Sk is the kth level of crash severity.

The Type\({t}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\in \{{T}_{k}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}| k =1,2,,\cdots \, \}\), where \({T}_{k}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\) is the kth label of crash type in dataset \({{{\mathcal{D}}}}\).

We utilize these three variables to describe the crash result \({{{{\rm{CR}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\). The crash outcome can be presented in the following format: \({{{{\rm{CR}}}}}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}=({n}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}},{s}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}},{t}_{i}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}})\). For numerical variables, the function f(l) describes the number of people injured in a crash as follows: “zero" if l = 0, “one” if l = 1, “two" if l = 2, and “three and more than three" if l ≥ 3, the values for Sk and \({T}_{k}^{{{{\mathcal{D}}}}}\) are provided in the Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Table 5.

We fine-tune SafeTraffic LLM by adapting LLaMa 3.113 to crash prediction tasks to enhance the LLMs' capabilities in interpreting crash data, identifying critical factors, and conducting feature-attribution analysis to offer insights for crash prevention. In this section, we will introduce detailed information on the fine-tuning process.

During the fine-tuning of LLMs, a single input consists of three components: the system prompt, the user prompt, and the target prompt. The system prompt introduces the task, for example: “You are a helpful assistant designed to predict the severity of a traffic crash...”. The user prompt comprises the four content parts detailed in “SafeTraffic Event dataset construction" section for each case. The target prompt represents the expected output. Examples of these prompts are shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Section 2.3. We tokenize the text inputs using LLaMA 3.1's tokenizer.

To adapt the LLM as a crash classifier, additional tokens have been incorporated into the tokenizer's vocabulary, and the detailed crash attribute categories are listed in Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Table 5. Specifically, for predicting the number of people Injuries of Washington dataset and Illinois dataset, we have introduced four special tokens: <ZERO>, <ONE>, <TWO>, and <THREE AND MORE THAN THREE>. Similarly, for predicting the Crash Severity of the Washington dataset and the Illinois dataset, we use five additional tokens: Sk, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, corresponding to different levels of severity. The Type task differs slightly between the Washington and Illinois datasets. For Washington datasets, we utilize 14 special tokens: \({T}_{k}^{{{{\mathcal{W}}}}}\), where 1 ≤ k ≤ 14, each representing a specific crash type. For Illinois datasets, we utilize 16 special tokens: \({T}_{k}^{{{{\mathcal{I}}}}}\), where 1 ≤ k ≤ 16. The parameters of the input and output embedding layers are set as trainable, enabling the model to align the representations of these special tokens with the existing embedding space.

During the fine-tuning phase, the traffic forecasting task is framed as a next-token generation task. Given an input prompt xi and its prediction target yi, we construct the full prompt as Ti = concat(xi, yi), where concat( ⋅ ) denotes the concatenation operation that appends the target label yi to the input xi as a special token. The next-token generation process can be described as:

where Ti is the ith item in the training data, pθ is the LLM, \({t}_{j}^{(i)}\) denotes the jth token in Ti. By maximizing the likelihood \({p}_{\theta }(T)={\prod }_{i=1}^{N}{p}_{\theta }({T}_{i})\), the LLM's parameters are learned. Both the system prompt and the user prompt are masked for loss computation during training. We also used a uniform data sampling strategy during the training process to facilitate the convergence of SafeTraffic LLM 16. Through this process, the model learns to make predictions for a traffic crash.

The confidence score is a critical component that links model predictions to interpretability within the SafeTraffic Copilot. The confidence score quantifies the model's certainty in its prediction for a given input. Since we incorporate target labels as special tokens in the LLM's vocabulary and fine-tune the model to generate only these tokens as outputs, we define the confidence score based on the predicted token's probability. Specifically, given a textual input xi and its corresponding label yi, the confidence score C(xi) is defined as:

where \({{{\mathcal{Y}}}}\) denotes the set of all possible labels (e.g., fatal, serious injury, etc., for crash severity prediction). pθ(yi∣xi) is the softmax probability assigned by the model to class yi, which can be computed by applying the softmax function over the logits corresponding to the special tokens representing each label.

For a given threshold t, let Nt denote the number of samples with confidence scores greater than t. Among these, Rt samples are correctly classified. The accuracy at threshold t is then given by

By computing the accuracy at different thresholds t, we can plot the relationship between accuracy Acct and the threshold t, as shown in Fig. 4e, f.

In our experiments, we follow LoRA37 to fine-tune LLaMA 3.1 models. Specifically, we update only the input and output layers directly, while all remaining layers are frozen and trained through LoRA. We use the AdamW optimizer38 with a learning rate of 3e-4 and a batch size of 32 (with gradient accumulation over 8 steps). The models are trained on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB memory each) using DeepSpeed39 for efficient distributed training.

We split the Washington and Illinois dataset into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1.5:1.5 ratio. Since the Washington dataset contains relatively few crash events per year, we utilized as many reports as possible to ensure sufficient training data. However, the data distribution across different classes is highly imbalanced. For example, in the crash severity prediction task in the Washington dataset, the ratio of #S1/#S5 is nearly 100:1, where #Sk is the number of data with label Sk. The imbalanced data distribution presents a great challenge for the model's training and evaluation. During the fine-tuning, we used a uniform sampling strategy to train the model on this unbalanced data. Similarly, to facilitate the model's evaluation, for the validation set and test set, we removed most of the data with a crash severity category of S1. Specifically, after processing, the dataset consisted of 16,188 records, with 11,332 used for training, 2428 for validation, and 2428 for testing. To balance the validation and test set for better evaluation, we removed 1428 S1 data and used 1000 remaining data for the validation set and test set separately. Compared with Washington state, more crash records can be used in Illinois state to generate a dataset. As a result, we were able to balance all subsets, including the training, validation, and test sets. Ultimately, the Illinois dataset comprised 42,715 records, with 29,307 used for training, 6704 for validation, and 6704 for testing. See Supplementary Section 1.3 for the detailed distribution for each dataset.

In evaluating the model performance as a classification task, we employ weighted accuracy, precision, and F1-score as metrics. In the context of a classification task, we have four notations: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). Using these notations, we can represent the metrics as follows:

Accuracy is one of the most commonly used measures for the classification performance, and it is defined as a ratio between the correctly classified samples to the total number of samples as follows:

Precision represents the proportion of positive samples that were correctly classified to the total number of positive predicted samples, which reflects the performance of the prediction:

F1-score combines results on precision and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which can be calculated using the formula:

where Recall = TP/(TP + FN).

We follow recent studies40 and adopt machine learning models, including XGBoost41, Random Forest (RF)42, Decision Trees (DT)43, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)44, Logistic Regression (LR)45, and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)46. We also include deep learning models such as BERT47 and TabNet48. In addition, we consider the National Average49, which predicts crash severity distributions using calibrated Severity Distribution Functions. For these models, the Bayesian optimization method (BayesSearchCV) is used to facilitate the identification of optimal hyperparameters, such as max_depth and learning_rate. To ensure a fair comparison across baseline models, we retained the original architecture and design of each model, modifying only the input data format when necessary. Detailed information on hyperparameter settings and input data preprocessing for all baseline models is provided in Supplementary Section 1.2.

The experiments on the North Carolina, Maine, and Ohio datasets are conducted under a zero-shot setting, where the model is fine-tuned only on the Illinois dataset and has never seen data from North Carolina, Maine, and Ohio during training. Traditional machine learning models perform poorly in this context due to their limited ability to adapt. Therefore, to ensure a fair comparison under the same conditions, we introduce two baseline methods:

BERT47. Leveraging its pre-training on large corpora, BERT possesses a certain degree of generalization capability. In our experiments, we fine-tune BERT using prompts from the Illinois dataset and evaluate its zero-shot performance on the North Carolina and Maine datasets.

CoT50. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables language models to perform multi-step inference by generating intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer. Zhen et al.23 explored the use of CoT for zero-shot crash severity prediction and reported improved performance over standard LLM prompting. Following their approach, we apply CoT prompting to evaluate zero-shot performance on the North Carolina and Maine datasets.

To identify the feature contribution of each factor to the prediction results, this paper introduces and adapts the concept of Shapley values31. Shapley value is a concept from cooperative game theory that has been widely adopted in machine learning to interpret model predictions51. It provides a way to fairly allocate the contribution of each feature to the outcome of a predictive model. In essence, the Shapley value quantifies how much each feature contributes to a prediction by considering all possible combinations of features. Formally, the Shapley value φ of a feature (or player) i in a cooperative game is defined as:

where N = {1, 2, …, n} is the index set of n features, S is a subset of N, and v(S) is the utility of the subset S, which represents a measurable value, such as accuracy or prediction score, achieved by the model using only the subset S of features.

The Shapley value is utilized in both the training and inference stages in SafeTraffic Copilot. During the training stage, it quantifies the contributions of four primary categories of information: general information, infrastructure information, event information, and unit information. During the inference stage, the Shapley value is applied to assess the contributions of individual sentences to the prediction outcomes.

The Shapley value is utilized to assess the influence of different components in the training set on the model during training. As outlined in “Developing SafeTraffic LLM for predicting crashes” in the “Results” section, the jth prompt Tj in the dataset P is divided into five parts: c0: system prompt (i.e., “You are a helpful assistant designed to predict the severity of a traffic crash..."), c1: general information, c2: infrastructure information, c3: event information, and c4: unit information. We denote pj(k) as the ck portion of pj. Given an index set S, we can construct a variant Tj(S) by concatenating the parts in S. For example, if S = {0, 1, 2}, then Tj(S) contains c0, c1, and c2. Formally,

where concat denotes concatenation. The resulting dataset based on S is P(S) = {Tj(S)∣ j = 0, 1, …, L}, where L is the dataset size.

Referring to Equation (7), the contribution of part ci at training, \({\varphi }_{i}^{\,{\mbox{train}}\,}\), is

where N = {1, 2, 3, 4} indexes the four content parts, and v(P(S)) is a performance metric (e.g., accuracy) obtained after retraining the model only on prompts in P(S).

Unlike traditional machine learning models that primarily handle fixed-length feature vectors, LLMs process variable-length text sequences as input52. This characteristic makes commonly used Shapley value approximation methods, such as KernelSHAP53 and DeepSHAP, less applicable to LLMs. Recent approaches like TokenSHAP54 and TransSHAP55 have been proposed to address this by decomposing input text into tokens and computing Shapley values at the token level. However, applying token-level Shapley value computation to SafeTraffic LLM introduces two primary challenges: (1) Computational limitations. The computational complexity of Shapley values is exponential in the number of players. In our SafeTraffic LLM, with an input size of approximately 500 tokens, the large-scale computation of token-level Shapley values for crash data becomes impractical. (2) Limited interpretability. Decomposing the prompt at the token level disregards inter-token dependencies, and the arbitrary masking or replacement of tokens can lead to semantic ambiguity and contextual shifts. These issues hinder a precise understanding of how individual features contribute to predictions. Moreover, paragraph-level analysis is too coarse for detailed attribution, since it can merge distinct features into a single category (e.g., driver and vehicle details under “unit information”).

To overcome these limitations, we propose a sentence-level feature contributions calculation method for inputs of LLMs, which proceeds as follows:

Sentence segmentation. The prompts are segmented using delimiters (e.g., commas “,” or periods “.”) to produce sentence-level units.

Feature groups annotation. GPT-4o is used to group and label these sentences (see Fig. 5 for the groups' content). Each group is represented as ck, where \(k\in {N}^{{\prime} }=\{1,2,3,\ldots \,n\}\). For the Washington dataset, n = 14, while for the Illinois dataset n = 12. Given index set \({S}^{{\prime} }\subseteq {N}^{{\prime} }\setminus \{\,i\}\), we can construct the prompt \({T}_{j}({S}^{{\prime} })\) similar to the process Equation (8).

Feature contributions calculation based on the feature groups. Based on the constructed dataset, the feature contribution for the ith sentence-group \({\varphi }_{i,j}^{inf}\) for the jth item in the dataset can be calculated as:

where pθ represents the LLM, which returns the predicted probability of the targets yj given the inputs. A higher \({\varphi }_{i,j}^{\,{\mbox{inf}}\,}\) indicates a greater contribution of the ith sentence group to the model's confidence for predicting yj. To reduce computational overhead, we adopt a stratified sampling–based Shapley estimation method using complementary contributions36.

Even though many years have passed since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 are not completely understood. This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as "brain fog," which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people's ability to work and perform daily activities.

Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it's difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies.

To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in Brain Communications on October 1, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) -- key molecules for memory and learning -- based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [11C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain.

By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression.

Taken together, the study's findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team's analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. "By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID," remarks Prof. Takahashi.

While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. "Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder," concludes Prof. Takahashi.

In summary, the team's findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.

What compels someone to keep engaging in alcohol use, even if it damages their health, relationships and wellbeing? A new study from Scripps Research offers an important clue: a small midline brain region plays a key role in how animals learn to continue drinking to avoid the stress and misery of withdrawal.

In a new study, published in Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science on August 5, 2025, the Scripps Research team zeroed in on a set of brain cells in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in rats. They found that this region becomes more active, driving strong relapse behavior, when rats learn to associate environmental stimuli with the easing of withdrawal symptoms by alcohol. By illuminating this brain pathway, the research sheds light on one of the most stubborn features of addiction -- drinking not for pleasure, but to escape pain -- and could eventually lead to new treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) as well as other maladaptive behaviors including anxiety.

"What makes addiction so hard to break is that people aren't simply chasing a high," says Friedbert Weiss, professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research and senior author of the study. "They're also trying to get rid of powerful negative states, like the stress and anxiety of withdrawal. This work shows us which brain systems are responsible for locking in that kind of learning, and why it can make relapse so persistent."

"This brain region just lit up in every rat that had gone through withdrawal-related learning," says co-senior author Hermina Nedelescu of Scripps Research. "It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress -- and that could be a game-changer in how we think about relapse."

From behavior to brain maps

An estimated 14.5 million people in the United States have alcohol use disorder, which encompasses a range of unhealthy drinking behaviors. Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterized by cycles of withdrawal, abstinence and relapse.

In 2022, Weiss and Nedelescu used rats to study the types of learning that happen in the brain throughout this cycle. When rats initially begin drinking, they learn to associate pleasure with alcohol and seek more. However, that conditioning becomes far stronger during multiple cycles of withdrawal and relapse. After learning that alcohol eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal -- what scientists call negative reinforcement or a relief of 'negative hedonic state' -- the animals sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even when uncomfortable.

"When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or contexts with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli -even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking," says Weiss. "That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behavior is punished."

In the new work, the team wanted to pin down exactly what networks of cells in the brain were responsible for learning to associate environmental cues with the relief of this negative hedonic state.

The researchers used advanced imaging tools to scan entire rat brains, cell by cell, and pinpoint areas that became more active in response to alcohol-related cues. They compared four groups of rats: those that had gone through withdrawal and learned that alcohol relieves a negative hedonic state, and three different control groups that had not.

While several brain areas showed increased activity in the withdrawal-learned rats, one stood out: the PVT, which is known for its role in stress and anxiety.

"In retrospect, this makes a lot of sense," says Nedelescu. "The unpleasant effects of alcohol withdrawal are strongly associated with stress, and alcohol is providing relief from the agony of that stressful state."

The researchers hypothesize that this negative hedonic state, and the activation of the PVT in the brain as a response, is critical for how the brain learns and perpetuates addiction.

A better understanding of addiction

The implications of the new study extend well beyond alcohol, the researchers say. Environmental stimuli conditioned to negative reinforcement -- the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress -- is a universal feature of the brain, and can drive human behavior beyond substance use disorders such as anxiety disorders, fear-conditioning and traumatic avoidance learning.

"This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles," says Nedelescu.

Future research will zoom in even further. Nedelescu and colleagues at Scripps Research want to expand the study to females and to study neurochemicals released in the PVT when subjects encounter environments associated with the experience of this relief from a negative hedonic state. If they can pinpoint molecules that are involved, it could open new avenues for drug development by targeting those molecules.

For now, the new study underscores a key shift in how basic scientists think about addiction.

"As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about chasing pleasure -- it's about escaping those negative hedonic states," says Weiss. "This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward."

In addition to Weiss and Nedelescu, authors of the study, "Recruitment of Neuronal Populations in the Paraventricular Thalamus of Alcohol Seeking Rats with Withdrawal-related Learning Experience," are Elias Meamari, Nami Rajaei, Alexus Grey, Ryan Bullard, and Nobuyoshi Suto of Scripps; and Nathan O'Connor of MBF Bioscience.

Until now, weight reduction has been the primary therapeutic goal for people with prediabetes. An analysis of a large Tübingen study shows that patients who bring their blood sugar levels back within the normal range through a healthy lifestyle but do not lose weight, or even gain weight, still reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes by 71 percent. Researchers from the University Hospital of Tübingen, Helmholtz Munich, and the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD) were involved in the study.

Millions of people worldwide live with prediabetes. It is estimated that one in ten adults is affected, although the number of unreported cases means the real figure is significantly higher. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar values are elevated but do not yet meet the criteria for diabetes. It often remains undetected for a long time, as affected individuals initially have no symptoms. The body's cells become more resistant to endogenous insulin hormone. As a result, less sugar moves from the blood into the body cells and the blood sugar level increases. The risks are considerable: If left untreated, there is a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on -- a disease that affects more than 460 million people worldwide. It can lead to serious complications, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer.

Normal Blood Sugar Level as a Milestone

Strategies recommended to date -- including in current guidelines -- for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes primarily focus on reducing weight through a healthy diet and increased physical activity. This strategy, which is limited to weight alone, could be broadened on the basis of the new analysis results.

A long-term study conducted by the Department of Diabetology, Endocrinology and Nephrology at the University Hospital Tübingen showed that 234 of the more than 1100 study participants lost no weight or even gained weight over the course of a year despite undergoing lifestyle changes. Nevertheless, a good 22 percent of them normalized their blood sugar levels. The development of type 2 diabetes was monitored over a period of up to a further 9 years. Without weight loss, this group was up to 71 percent less likely to develop diabetes. This figure is almost identical to that of individuals who were able to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes by losing weight (73 percent).

Fat Distribution as a Decisive Factor

The analysis paid particular attention to fat distribution. The relationship between visceral fat (the inner abdominal fat surrounding the organs) and subcutaneous fat (the fatty tissue located directly under the skin) was examined. Visceral fat releases signaling molecules that promote inflammation and disrupt hormone balance, which leads to insulin resistance and is thus directly linked to type 2 diabetes. Study participants whose blood sugar levels returned to normal without losing weight had a lower percentage of abdominal fat as a result of lifestyle changes compared to those whose blood sugar levels remained in the prediabetes range.

Body Weight No Longer the Sole Indicator

"Restoring a normal fasting blood sugar level is the most important goal in preventing type 2 diabetes and not necessarily the number on the scale," says Prof. Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, study leader and director of the Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Munich at the University of Tübingen. "Exercise and a balanced diet have a positive effect on blood sugar levels, regardless of whether weight is reduced. Losing weight remains helpful, but our data suggests that it is not essential for protection against diabetes," he continues. "In future, guidelines for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes should not only take weight into account, but above all blood glucose control and fat distribution patterns," adds Prof. Dr. Reiner Jumpertz-von Schwartzenberg, who, as last author, was involved in the study alongside Prof. Dr. Birkenfeld.

A Healthy Lifestyle as a Recipe for Success

However, the study results highlight the importance of including target glycemic values, i.e., guideline blood sugar values, in practice guidelines in addition to weight reduction targets. Prediabetes remission is the most effective way to prevent future type 2 diabetes, and the analysis suggests that this is partly independent of weight loss. Nevertheless, sufficient physical activity and a balanced diet remain the key means to bring blood sugar values within a normal range.

Tesla has spent more than a year teasing that “more affordable models” of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively.

The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. The new and cheaper standard version doesn't even have Autopilot, the company's basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the “Autopilot” feature-set, is missing.)

The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before he ultimately killed that project.

The new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car's launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option.

The new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla's cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There's no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There's no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats.

On the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars. 

Musk and other Tesla executives have joked in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company's mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.

Tesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including in Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives.

That sets up an interesting calculus for new-EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla. 

Ford is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.

Musk did tangible damage to Tesla's brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. The new Standard models will likely apply competitive pressure on Tesla's own offerings, not to mention the potential havoc it could wreak on the used market.

AI2 Incubator is entering its next phase. 

The Seattle-based startup organization — known for spinning out companies at the intersection of AI and real-world applications — has closed an $80 million third fund to support about 70 new tech ventures over the next four years. 

GeekWire first reported the fund in July. This week, we sat down with Jacob Colker, managing director of the 10-year-old incubator, to discuss lessons from a decade of AI startup building and how the firm is positioning itself for the next wave of entrepreneurship while helping boost Seattle's tech ecosystem in the global AI boom.

Lessons learned and a new chapter

Inside Colker's office at the incubator's new waterfront headquarters, a wall of framed founder photos is a visual reminder of the organization's track record — from alumni such as computer vision company Xnor.ai (acquired by Apple) and contract management software firm Lexion (acquired by Docusign) to newer startups including Ozette (biotech data), Yoodli (AI roleplay coaching), Vercept (automated desktop workflows), and Casium (immigration processing).

Of more than 50 companies that graduated from AI2 Incubator, nearly a quarter have been acquired and 90% went on to raise venture funding.

Founders who have gone through the program credit it for helping supercharge growth. 

“Overall, they were a huge accelerant for Lexion, giving us the talent, AI advice, and credibility to land a solid team, great investors, and customers,” said Lexion co-founder Gaurav Oberoi, whose company sold for $165 million last year.

The new fund comes amid both record investor enthusiasm for AI startups and growing scrutiny over which ventures have real depth beyond the current hype. There is also stiff competition from various other venture firms, accelerators, startup studios, and incubators looking to find the next great AI companies.

Colker said Fund III reflects lessons learned from the incubator's first two investment cycles. 

“We backed some developer tools and infrastructure plays, and we also supported a few teams that were commercially strong but didn't have deep technical foundations,” he said. “Both were useful experiments, but in hindsight, some of those companies plateaued.”

Developer-focused startups faced fierce competition and long sales cycles, he said, while execution-first teams without deep AI expertise struggled to build real differentiation or become attractive acquisition targets.

With its third fund, the incubator is doubling down on its well-worn strategy of pairing vertical, real-world applications with robust technical understanding.

“Every one of these companies has somebody on the team who really knows the industry that they're going into, and really understands the problems,” Colker said. 

AI2 Incubator prides itself on AI expertise, rooted in its origins within the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), the Seattle nonprofit research institute founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. 

“We started doing applied AI commercialization in 2015 — back then, it was largely theoretical,” Colker said. “And now it's the centerpiece of the innovation sector, in a lot of ways.”

In Colker's view, the landscape for AI founders has shifted dramatically since the incubator's early days. He described what he calls the “next chapter of entrepreneurship in the age of AI”: startups with specialized, vertical solutions led by founders with years of domain knowledge — people who understand the problems inside hospitals, factories, and financial systems, and are now pairing that knowledge with AI technology.

Colker said it's getting harder to find clear signal in the “AI fog” as the line between novelty and real technical depth blurs. “An API with a coat of paint on it — that's not an AI company,” he said.

AI2 Incubator, which invests across various industries, pays close attention to a company's data access advantages, specialized distribution channels, workflow integration, and customer trust. 

“If we can't see a clear link between the technical insight and business value, we don't engage,” Colker said.

Flexibility and focus

AI2 Incubator typically works with founders at the earliest stage, sometimes even before they've incorporated a company. 

It invests up to $600,000 in each startup via a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) with a $10 million valuation cap and typically holds about 7% in common shares — the same class as founders, rather than preferred equity. 

The equity stake is in the same ballpark as Y Combinator, and lower than some studios and incubators that may take a more hands-on approach to building companies.

AI2 Incubator also provides as much as $1 million in cloud computing credits and access to its technical and research network, including AI experts from companies such as Microsoft and Amazon.

“What makes the AI2 Incubator special is the depth of in-house expertise,” said Priyanka Kulkarni, CEO at Casium.

Colker said Fund III was significantly oversubscribed. AI2 Incubator works closely with about 15 companies per year.

“Staying small is not a limitation; it's our advantage,” he said.

Unlike accelerators that move startups through fixed cohorts, AI2 Incubator accepts companies on a rolling basis. There are also no required board seats or relocation mandates. Founders can apply year-round and work either in Seattle or remotely. 

The model, Colker said, is designed for flexibility — to attract experienced entrepreneurs who may not fit the lifestyle of a three-month accelerator sprint.

Seattle's AI opportunity

Seattle remains the home base for AI2 Incubator, though 30% of its founders are not in the city. Colker expects that percentage to reach 50% with the new fund.

AI2 Incubator companies are required to spend at least a week per quarter in Seattle, and some relocate or move part of their workforce to the city.

Colker leads the incubator with fellow managing director Yifan Zhang, a longtime entrepreneur who spearheaded AI House, the sprawling new startup building at Pier 70 along Seattle's waterfront that serves as AI2 Incubator's headquarters along with event space and co-working offices.

Since its launch in March, more than 15,000 people have passed through its doors, according to the incubator, drawn by a mix of technical deep dives and startup programming.

AI House, supported in part by city and state government funding, is part of a broader effort to boost Seattle as a global AI hub. 

Colker said the region's strengths — deep technical talent, proximity to Microsoft and Amazon, and a collaborative research culture — give it an edge in building durable AI startups that solve real business problems.

But he acknowledged that the Bay Area does have stronger community around entrepreneurship. “You can't walk down the streets of Palo Alto without hearing 15 startup pitches,” he quipped.

New efforts like AI House and Foundations will help fill that void in Seattle, Colker said. 

“The cloud was invented here. The talent is here. The diversity of industries are here. The quality of life is here,” he said. “There's now funding here, community here — it's truly, unbelievably well positioned.”

He added: “There's just no excuses anymore because we have everything we need. I think we're going to get there, and we're going to continue to grow.”

Grow and thrive

AI2 Incubator's third fund represents a jump from the $30 million raised for Fund II in 2023 — though it's spread over four years.

The new fund drew backing from Khosla Ventures, Point72 Ventures, and Madrona Venture Group, along with corporate investors including BHP Ventures and SBI Group.

Tim Porter, managing director at Madrona, cited the increasing national reach of the AI2 Incubator program and reputation as “a place where great AI founders can come to succeed.”

AI2 Incubator spun out from the Allen Institute for AI after Allen's death in 2018, becoming an independent organization with its own governance and funding structure.

The Allen Institute for AI maintains a “small percentage of non-governing ownership” in the incubator, Colker said.

Colker said there are still about a dozen “resident experts” at AI House that both work at the research institute and spend time with founders at the incubator. 

AI2 Incubator is also led by technical directors Oren Etzioni and Vu Ha, who continue to guide founders on product development and technical strategy.

Etzioni, who helped launch and previously ran the Allen Institute for AI, told GeekWire that the incubator was part of the original conception of Ai2 back in late 2013.

“We spun it out of the nonprofit institute to enable it to grow and thrive,” he said. “Now, with Fund III, we are poised to show the world what determined founders can accomplish amid the AI boom.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) paid $825,000 earlier this year to a company that manufactures vehicles equipped with various technologies for law enforcement, including fake cellphone towers known as “cell-site simulators,” which can be used to spy on nearby phones.  

According to public records, the award dated May 8 “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.”  

The contract was signed with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company. TOSV also signed a similar contract with ICE in September 2024 for $818,000, showing that the relationship between the agency and the company predates the Trump administration.  

TOSV president Jon Brianas told TechCrunch in an email that he could not provide details about the ICE contracts and the vehicles, citing “trade secrets.” But Brianas did confirm that the company does provide cell-site simulators, although it does not make them. 

“We don't manufacture electrical, comms, and technology components, we integrate that product into our overall design of the vehicle,” said Brianas, who declined to say from where TOSV sources its cell-site simulators.  

This is the latest federal contract that reveals some of the technologies powering the Trump administration's deportation crackdown. 

In early September, Forbes found a recently unsealed search warrant that showed that ICE used a cell-site simulator to track down a person who allegedly was part of a criminal gang in the United States, and who had been ordered to leave the country in 2023. In the article, Forbes reported that it also found a contract for “cell site simulator vehicles,” but the article did not name the company that provides the vans to the agency. 

Cell-site simulators also go by the name “stingrays” because some of the earlier types of these devices, made by defense contractor Harris (now L3Harris), were named that way. Since then, stingrays have become a catch-all name for this type of technology, also known as IMSI catchers. (IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique number that identifies every cellphone user in the world.) 

As the name suggests, cell-site simulators tools can mimic a cellphone tower, tricking every phone in its nearby range to connect to the device and thus giving law enforcement the ability to better identify the real-world location of those phones and their owners.  

Some cell-site simulators can also intercept regular calls, text messages, and internet traffic. 

Authorities can get data from traditional cellphone towers to find the current or past location of a suspect, but the location is usually not very precise.  

Stingray-like devices have been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade and have long been controversial because authorities do not always get a warrant for their use, and critics say these devices ensnare innocent people by default. These devices are also shrouded in secrecy, because the law enforcement agencies who use them are under strict non-disclosure agreements not to reveal how the devices work. 

ICE has a long history of using cell-site simulators. In 2020, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that ICE deployed them at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019. The agency used these tools more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News at the time. 

ICE acknowledged TechCrunch's request for comment, but did not respond to a series of questions, which included: what ICE uses these vehicles for, whether and where they have recently been deployed, and whether the agency always gets a warrant when using cell-site simulators.  

Headquartered just outside of Washington, DC, TOSV sells a wide range of customizable vehicles to law enforcement, such as vans for SWAT armed response teams, bomb squads, and so-called “mobile lab” and “cover surveillance” vehicles.  

Among these vehicles for police forces, TOSV lists several “projects,” including one described as DHS Mobile Forensic Labs, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. 

According to the website, these mobile forensic vans are “equipped for on-site forensic analysis and documentation,” have “secure compartments for evidence preservation and investigative tools,” and enable “seamless case file updates and evidence logging.” 

Another project is the DHS Mobile Command Van,” which TOSV says it's “configurable for advanced surveillance and mission coordination.”  

It's unclear if these vans are the same vehicles that include cell-site simulators, as there's no mention of the phone surveillance tool anywhere on TOSV's website.  

ICE has other contracts with TOSV for mobile forensic labs, which don't specify what technologies are located in the vans. 

According to its website, TOSV also sells so-called “bookmobiles,” which appear to be libraries on wheels, as well as medical, and fire department vehicles.

It also features quiet fans and a carbon filtration system, making it ideal for home or office. - Stephen Warwick

We have just launched our article on the Best MicroSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2, featuring the first in-depth benchmarking and testing of the top cards on the market. We found that the Lexar Play Pro 1TB is the fastest card on the market, and now it has a 15% discount for Amazon Prime Big Deals day. Here are our findings:

This card is the fastest microSD Express card on the market. The 1TB capacity card massively increases the storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Higher transfer speeds mean up to 900/600 MB/s read/write. But it does command a premium price for the privilege. 

As we noted in our buying guide, "The Lexar Play Pro 1TB is the best 1TB microSD Express card for the Switch 2, and it was also one of the first to launch. It's an excellent choice if you seek the highest capacity currently available. This card is available at the major U.S. retailers, thus offering greater convenience compared to some other brands. Additionally, Lexar's limited lifetime warranty enhances the product's appeal by ensuring that your investment is consistently safeguarded. These benefits come at a higher price, though. The Lexar Play Pro 1TB retails for approximately 16% above the GameStop 1TB card with similar characteristics."

Here's a snippet of some of our testing, and as you can see, the Lexar 1TB card pulls out on top of the other competing 1TB cards.

This 512GB capacity card is double the size of the onboard storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Higher transfer speeds mean up to 900/600 MB/s read/write.



This 256GB capacity card is the same size as the onboard storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Up to 900/600 MB/s read/write speeds. 



The 256GB and 512GB models for this microSD Express card are also on sale, too. We have a feeling this deal won't last long, so if you're a new Switch 2 owner, the time to act is now. — Paul Alcorn

Not only is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K discounted during Prime Day, but the Ultra 7 265K also just got a hefty discount, and is now just $246. That's nearly $15 cheaper than its previous low, and fully 39% ($158) off its usual price.

All-time low price 

Often overshadowed by AMD, the Intel Core range starts to make a lot more sense with a hefty discount. Get a 20-core CPU with eight performance cores and 12 efficiency cores, with clock speeds of up to 5.5GHz and a 36MB cache. 

As you can see, the Core 7 sits below a lot of rivals in general gaming performance, including some older 14th-gen Intel gear. However, general multi-threaded performance is considerably better, and single-threaded performance on Windows 11 is some of the best we've ever tested, behind only the aforementioned Core 9 285K.

So if you're looking for an LGA 1851 build but don't want to fork out on a Core Ultra 9, then this might be the processor for you this Prime Day - Stephen Warwick

If you're looking for a little extra storage for your Nintendo Switch 2 handheld gaming console, then here are two deals on microSD Express cards that are available at the moment. PNY is offering its 128GB microSD Express card for just $33.24, a saving of $6.75 from its usual selling price of $44.99. The 128GB is the smallest variant of the PNY range of microSD Express cards, but still large enough to pack several games on.

The PNY fast flash memory cards have near SSD speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write. They are fast enough that you can run the latest Switch 2 games directly from the card, without having to transfer or download games directly to the internal storage of the handheld.

PNY's flash card has fast PCIe 3x1 storage speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write, perfect for loading games off of to play on the Nintendo Switch 2. 

Grab half a terabyte of storage with this 512GB microSD Express card from Addlink. Ample speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write mean more time playing games and less time loading, with smoother game streaming. 

For a larger microSD Express card, Addlink is offering its 512GB card for just $99.44, saving $10 from its $109.44 total. With PCIe 3 x 1 speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write, this card has the speeds to be able to play games directly off of the card, a requirement for SD cards on the Switch 2. — Stewart Bendle

It's hard to find a cheap graphics card that's actually worth buying these days, but the Intel Arc B570 pulls it off. It's recently been possible to find these cards for Intel's $219 MSRP, but Amazon will do you even better during its Prime Big Deal Days event. It's knocking $10 off Sparkle's Guardian OC Edition Arc B570, bringing this card down to just $209.

Intel's Arc B570 is one of the only cheap graphics cards worth buying, and at just $209 from Amazon during Prime Big Deal Days, it's even more attainable than ever.

 




The Arc B570 can manage a solid 60 FPS experience even at 1920x1080 and ultra settings in some of today's most popular games, but we'd really recommend dialing settings back to high presets and enabling XeSS where it's available for the smoothest ride. This Arc card's 10GB of VRAM is nice insurance against more VRAM-hungry games in this oft-neglected segment of the GPU market. As a bonus, it doesn't demand a lot of power, and it runs cool and quiet. Just make sure your system supports Resizable BAR, and you'll enjoy a fine gaming experience on the cheap. - Jeff Kampman

Elegoo's Centauri Carbon is a capable and low-cost Core XY 3D printer that is both a work horse and detailed 3D printer. How can I say this with confidence? Because I bought one back in April 2025 and I've been using it ever since!

A high-speed, Core XY 3D printer for a low price was once the thing of dreams, but it is now a reality. A generous 256 x 256 x 256 build volume and fully enclosed print area make the Centauri Carbon a potent 3D printer for those on a budget.

In our review, we loved the speed and precision that such a low-cost Core XY printer provided. But going further than the review, I can attest that this is a great printer because I put it through its paces to 3D print an entire NAS case for an Intel N100 powered file server. Using multiple rolls of Elegoo's Rapid PETG filament, I printed every part of the case, including some scarily large pieces that took the best part of a day to print. The Elegoo Centauri Carbon worked great, every single time! I've only ever had two print fails. One was caused by me not cleaning the print bed, the other was a fault in the Gcode that saw the print head knock over the print.

The Elegoo Centauri Carbon is a fully enclosed 3D printer, which means it can print filaments such as PETG and ABS without fear of warping. The enclosure does not have any in-chamber heating, but the 256 x 256 build plate can hit 110C, heating the chamber in the process. The brass-hardened steel nozzle can hit 320C and the extruder moves at 500mm/s and accelerates at 20,000mm/s², with a flow rate of 32mm³/s. What does all that mean? It means it is fast and can handle a range of filaments. From common PLA to tougher Polycarbonate filament, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon can handle it.

Sending prints to the Elegoo Centauri Carbon is simple, using Elegoo Slicer, a fork of Orcaslicer our computer connects to the printer via Wi-Fi, and we slice and send the prints over to the printer and then sit back and relax. Prints are then stored on the Centauri Carbon and can be selected via the rather lovely and intuitive touchscreen.

Seasoned 3D printer users will be calling out the lack of multi-color printing. But, fear not! Elegoo has announced that a mutli-color print attachment is coming soon, and it will connect directly to the Centauri Carbon, making this printer an expandable, low cost workhorse that produces excellent prints, in very little time. — Les Pounder

 




If you're on the hunt for a new gaming controller for your PC and or Xbox, then take a look at this deal on GameSir's G7 Pro controller. At a price point that pales in comparison to the official Xbox controllers, like the Elite Series 2 Core Wireless gaming controller ($129), the GameSir G7 Pro in a shadow ember color looks gorgeous with its semi-translucent shell, TMR joysticks, and hall effect triggers.

Available for sale at Best Buy in their Techtober sale, the GameSir G7 Pro controller for Xbox and PC is reduced to $69.99. You're able to save $10 off the list price of $79.99, which you can then put towards a game to use your new controller on.

The GameSir G7 Pro uses the latest and greatest tech inside for improved control in your games. Features like TMR joysticks eliminate issues such as “stick-drift,” and compared to hall-effect sticks, they suffer less from interference, have smaller magnets, and also use less power, whilst keeping the same levels of precision. The triggers use analog hall-effect switches that feature clicky micro-switch trigger stops. There are even four rumble motors, one in each handgrip and one in each trigger, plenty of haptic feedback for in-game events.

Stick-drift is a thing of the past with the latest TMR Joysticks that make up part of the G7 Pro's feature set. Hall-effect trigger switches, micro switches on the D-Pad, and ABXY buttons, plus tri-mode connectivity with 1000Hz polling on wired and 2.4GHz connections. A handy charging dock keeps your controller powered up for the next gaming session. 

Pair the controller wirelessly or wired with your PC, Xbox, or Android device via tri-mode connectivity options. Use the convenient physical mode switch to select wired, 2.4GHz, or Bluetooth, and experience a 1000Hz polling rate on PC via both wired & 2.4GHz connections.

The G7 Pro comes with a smart auto start-stop charging station with a 1200mAh built-in battery, a cable retainer, extra D-pads, a 3-meter USB-C cable, receiver, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate card. — Stewart Bendle

 




I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a handy tool to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly. Make sure to enter the brand promotion code of O1KPKFEH8IBJ for the extra 10% off.

I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly.

 




The Olight IMINI2 EDC flashlight doesn't have many features. It really doesn't need them! Designed to be simple to use and simple to charge, this flashlight is ready when you need it and now it is at an all-time low price!

This compact and easy to use flashlight provides 50 Lumens of light, without the need to fiddle around for a button. Just unclip, and your flashlight is ready to light your way.

Operating the Olight IMINI2 is easy, just pull the flashlight from the holster and it turns on, put it back and it turns off. The trick is the magnetic holster / base which also double as a USB Type A charging port. Put the flashlight into any USB Type A port and it will charge up. The magnetic base of the flashlight also means it can be stuck to any ferrous metal, like a PC case, to give you hands-free illumination while you carry out a task.

I've got one of these in a 3D printed toolkit that I made earlier this year. It is so handy and I have used it heavily for PC tasks, home DIY and taking the trash out on dark nights. Sure it doesn't have a means to focus the light, but it just works and gets me out of a pinch without any hassle.

With modern Wi-Fi, there are plenty of speedy options these days for fast wireless networks. But of course, nothing beats wired connectivity for stability and getting around (rather than through) pesky things like concrete, stone, metal, and brick. And thanks to this deal at Amazon, you can connect your packet-hungry devices up to super-fast 10 Gigabit Ethernet for an all-time low price of $199.

The TL-SX105 is a 5-port unmanaged 10GbE switch that's passively cooled and wrapped in a metal shell. Unlike some cheaper switches that advertise 10Gb speeds, all five of the ports here are the full 10 Gigabits, letting you sling your packets as fast as possible to several devices on your network.

The TP-Link TL-SX105 isn't exactly new. In fact, we wrote about it back in 2021, alongside the larger 8-port TL-SX1008. But this is the lowest price we've seen it sell for on Amazon, by $30. Of course, you'll also need 10GbE devices to take full advantage of this switch's speed, so you may want to look into a new 10-gig NIC if you need to get a desktop PC up to speed. Some of those are also on sale, with a Trendnet model selling for $69 and TP-Link's own TX401 selling for $74.Of course, you'll also likely need to run new CAT6 cables, especially if you're upgrading from Gigabit Ethernet, so consider that part of the expense and effort. No one said upgrading to the fastest home Ethernet tech was going to be easy, but once it's all up and running at a theoretical max speed of 1.25 gigabytes per second, you'll be glad you didn't cheap out and go for something comparatively pokey, like 2.5GbE.

Bambu Lab's first foray in to low cost budget 3D printers is a knockout!The A1 Mini is what it says, mini. The 180 x 180 x 180mm build volume is much smaller than the norm, but that is not a bad thing.

We gave the Bambu Lab A1 Mini the Editor's Choice award back on 2023, so with that recommendation and $50 off the MSRP, you should really just buy it!

This popular compact printer is solidly built with a full-metal linear rail system and bearings, features full auto calibration, vibration and flow-rate compensation, and compatibility with multi-color AMS accessories. 

Work next to the printer without distraction, thanks to the low noise "silent mode" that lets the A1 print at under 48 decibels of noise.  

Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini.

Is is expensive? No, the original $299 price tag was good, but now at $249 it is excellent.

is it easy to assemble? It arrives 95% assembled, with just a few screws to remove before you get started.

Ease of use?The touchscreen is simple to use and is only really used when loading new filament or when printing an object from micro SD. Most of the time the screen just shows the print status, or if you should encounter an error, it displays a QR code that you can scan to learn how to fix the issue. Typically, your 3D prints are sent to the A1 mini via Bambu Lab's custom slicer, Bambu Slicer, which is a fork of OrcaSlicer. You load up the print, click on the slice option and then send it over Wi-Fi to the A1 Mini.

High quality prints?Yes! In our review we tested PLA, PETG and TPU and all three came out well. Details were sharp, little or no layer lines were present, and stringing was at a minimum, especially for TPU. Our reviewer, Denise Bertacchi ran a "speed benchy", a small tug boat toy that tests detail, overhangs, cooling and printer tolerances. In her test, Bertacchi recorded a 19m 15s benchy, that is really fast. My Elegoo Centauri Carbon manages 15 minutes, my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, 44 minutes!The build volume may be small, but this little printer is fast and produces great looking prints.

Easy to maintain?The A1 Mini has its own calibration tests for bed leveling and Z-offset (how far the nozzle is from the print bed). We no longer need to slide a piece of paper under different areas of the build plate to guesstimate the Z-offset! Should you need to replace the nozzle, it is a cinch to remove the nozzle heat break and cooling fins which are held in place with magnets. Put the new unit in and you are good to go.

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. — Paul Alcorn

Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds.

The Crucial P310 2TB is among the best M.2-2230 SSDs that we've ever tested. Earning a four-star mark from our reviewer for its speed and capacity, the P310 2TB is a great pick at list price, and is a must-consider now that it's nearly 50% off. 

The SN770M, our "portable gaming king" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class.

For those looking for the absolute cheapest upgrade for a Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, or any other handheld PC, the Kingston NV3 is your pick. Down to its lowest-yet price of $65.80, the budget SSD got solid marks from us (in its longer 2280 trim) for its budget stature, and its price somehow matches those of full-sized M.2 SSDs today. 

The Crucial P310 2TB 2230 has hit its lowest-ever price at $121.99, 49% off the list price. If you don't need that much space, the 1TB WD Black SN770M is 39% off ($85.49), and the 1TB Kingston NV3 at an excellent $65.80.

The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale.

The ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is $50 off, featuring competitive 1080p and 1440p gaming performance with its 4,096 shader cores and 16GB of VRAM.

This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface.

The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. That said, the competition between the two cards is brisk. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off.

The 8TB WD_Black SN850X is a beast of an SSD, offering up more than enough storage for the majority of users. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage.

The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. Make sure to add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to get the total saving.

The SN850X wields the PCIe 4.0 interface, not the newer PCIe 5.0, but that serves up more than enough performance for most casual users. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly.

The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty. — Paul Alcorn

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential. — Brandon Hill

When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP.

Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. 

 




Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere.

For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM.

MSI's Shadow version of the RTX 5050 boasts twin fans, a clean black fan shroud, four display outputs, and a conveniently placed power connector for easy building and a sharp-looking setup. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build.

If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And the SK hynix Tube T31 is the best flash drive we've tested, thanks in large part to the fact that it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD attached to a USB plug. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage.

A full price Intel's Ultra 9 285K CPU is a tough sell, but at just $489 — $110 off — it becomes a much more enticing proposition. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal.

All-time low price 

The Intel Core Ultra 7 285K is at an all-time low price, finally making it a worthy purchase against the competition. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. 

Here's how the 285K stacks up against some of the top processors on the market right now. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that. — Stephen Warwick

Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an "Action Ring" menu. While it's a little heavier than its predecessor, all the signs so far are good, with the MX Master 4 sharing the DNA of the previous model. Imagine our surprise when we woke up and found a $30 discount on this brand new mouse this morning.

A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. 

AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months.

Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. You can peruse the list below and click on the bold blue price text in the table to see the deals:

On the centennial of modern quantum mechanics, the Nobel Committee awarded the year's most prestigious physics prize to an experiment that demonstrated how quantum effects play out on large scales—including inside your smartphone.

In fact, the implications of this year's winner—quantum tunneling—stretch way beyond the device in your pocket.

John Clarke, Michel Devoret, and John Martinis conducted their initial experiments in 1984 and 1985, but their work has had a lasting impact, becoming “the foundation of all digital technology,” Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said in a statement.

But what is quantum tunneling, and how has it brought this bizarre realm of physics into our everyday devices? Read on to discover why this quirk of quantum is so critical.

Imagine throwing a tennis ball against a wall. Millennia of both scientific and anecdotal observations teach that the ball will likely hit the wall and bounce back. In the quantum world, however, that isn't always the case. There, the ball might pass straight through the wall and appear on the other side—a phenomenon referred to as “tunneling.”

Size is a tricky concept in quantum mechanics, but very simply speaking, “microscopic” scales in this context generally refer to that of a single particle. By contrast, “macroscopic” refers to a large number of particles. Quantum mechanical effects appear to fade on the macroscopic scale, hence why a tennis ball—comprised of a gazillion particles—typically doesn't pass through walls.

But the Nobel-winning experiment created a highly sophisticated, superconducting circuit that enabled electrons inside to move through the system as if they were a single particle, filling the entire circuit. The electrons in the system tunneled through a thin layer of non-conductive material—and thus, the circuit, which the researchers had described as being “big enough to get one's grubby fingers on,” is a macroscopic demonstration of a microscopic, or quantum, phenomenon.

To be clear, superconducting devices aren't here yet. But the chip in your phone, while being a semiconductor, not a superconductor, still utilizes the lessons from the tunneling experiment to work. As do transistors, nuclear experiments, and, of course, quantum computing.

Quantum Computers Are Here and They're Real. You Just Haven't Noticed Yet

Tunneling taught engineers how energy leaks from very-large-scale integration, the process from which we get complex semiconductor transistors and chips. Specifically, tunneling represents a “physics limit” for the minimum size of a feature on a chip.

Scientists have also applied principles from quantum tunneling to make next-generation solar cells, while scanning tunneling microscopes—instrumental in several physics breakthroughs—were also built on the concept of quantum tunneling.

Tunneling is also considered a vital part of any nuclear fusion experiment. For fusion reactions to succeed, the individual particles need to overcome their natural tendency to repel each other—by harnessing tunneling, physicists have been able to find some leeway around this obstacle.

Not all of these applications are immediately apparent. Clarke, one of this year's physics winners, admitted during a press conference on Tuesday to being “completely stunned,” as it had “never occurred to me in any way that this might be the basis of a Nobel prize.”

Still, there's no doubt that this Nobel-winning work perfectly demonstrates the remarkable presence of quantum mechanics in our everyday lives—just in time for the International Year of Quantum!

To quote Nobel Physics Committee Chair Eriksson: “It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful.”

> The Flock source added “Even if Flock took a stance on permitted use-cases, a motivated user could simply lie about why they're performing a search. We can never 100% know how or why our tools are being used.” A second Flock source said they believe Flock should develop a better idea of what its clients are using the company's technology for.In other words, why bother with safeguards when they'll just lie to us anyways?

I think this is a legitimate problem.But...isn't this what warrants are for? With a warrant, the police have to say why they want to perform a search to a judge, under threat of perjury. They have a powerful incentive not to lie.So...should warrants be required for this kind of Flock data also? Couldn't Flock set a policy that these searches are performed only under warrant? Or a law be enacted saying the same? I imagine it would make Flock much less attractive to their potential customers, and searches would be performed much less often. [1] So it's not something Flock is going to do on their own. I think we'd need to create the pressure, by opposing purchases of Flock or by specifically asking our elected representatives to create such a law.[1] If I'm being generous, because of the extra friction/work/delay. If I'm being less generous, because they have no legitimate reason a judge would approve.

Based on another incident [0] I feel Flock's explanation for their actions boils down to:1. "We are familiar with the customer the person claimed to be an agent for."2. "We didn't know whether the person was doing something illegal with the data... And we don't want to know, and we don't try to find out."3. "They didn't force us. They gave us money! We like money!"As you might guess, I don't find these points especially compelling or exculpating. Certainly nothing that would/should stand up against state or local laws that prohibit the data being shared this way._____________[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45382434

Flock's entire business model is a flagrant violation of the 4th amendment. What  Flock does for their core business is called "stalking", which is a crime.The issue here is not that the law is inadequate to resolve this problem. The issue is that the current administration has chosen to collude with private corporations that flagrantly violate the law, thereby replacing our entire judiciary system with a protection racket.Please don't be generous. Fascists depend on our patience to insulate them from consequences.

Think of it this way. The government pays somebody to collect data about how many bicyclists use an intersection to decided if they should add a dedicated bike light. Why would the government need to use a warrant to get that information?That's the same situation here. Flock is placing the cameras because the government has paid them to.

There is a monumental difference between counting how many cyclists use an intersection and recording the license plates of cars.If the former, you don't store any personal information, all you know is how many pass by. You don't even know if they were different people, 10 of the 50 cyclists you saw could've been the same person going in circles.In the latter, you know which vehicles went by, and when. Even if you don't record the time you saw them, from the dates of the study you can narrow it down considerably. Those can be mapped to specific people.

There's a few issues1. Unreasonable is the key word here. You purposely chose an arguably reasonable thing (counting you anonymously as you pass through an intersection).Many people think that personally logging your movements throughout the day using automated superhuman means crosses the line into unreasonable.2. There is also a separate issue that the law allows third parties to willingly hand over/sell information about you that many people think would be subject to warrant rules. You only need a warrant when the information is being held by a party that doesn't want to hand it over willingly.3. Intent matters in the law. The intent behind counting cyclists is very different than the intent behind setting up a system for tracking people over time, even though the mechanism may be the same.4. There is also the issue that currently legal != morally correct.

Your claim is that the local governments shouldn't be allowed to collect this data period.My claim is that the local government doesn't need a warrant to get information from a contractor whose only reason for collecting that information was to produce it as part of their contract.

It was implied, both by our department and, more vaguely, by Flock, that sharing was reciprocal: if we didn't enable it, other departments wouldn't share with us. That's false; not only is it false, but apparently, to my understanding, Flock has (or had?) an offering for PDs to get access to the data without even hosting cameras of their own.That obviously leaves Flock's own attestations of client data separation, and I get the cynicism there too, but basically every municipality in the country relies on those same kinds of attestations from a myriad of vendors, and unlike Flock those vendors have basically nothing to lose (since nobody is paying attention to them).I think you can reasonably go either way on all this stuff. But you can't run these stacks in their default configuration with their default sharing and without special-purpose ordinances and general ordinances governing them.I write this mostly to encourage people who have strong opinions about this stuff to get engaged locally. I did, I'm not particularly good at it (I'm a loud message board nerd), and I got what I believe to be the only ALPR General Order in Chicagoland written and what I know to be the only ACLU CCOPS ordinance in Illinois passed.

For instance, just making it a rule that they are not allowed to lie to you about how things are being used -- we know that won't work because if they're willing to lie they are also willing to ignore contract violations.Instead, put in a rule that says misuse of the system costs $X for each documented case. Now the vendor has a financial incentive to detect misuse, and the purchasers have a FINANCIAL incentive to curb misuse by their own employees.It's not a magic fix, but it's the sort of thing that might help.

I don't think this is weird at all. Corporations may be more "malicious" (or at least self centered), but governments have more power. So even if you believe they are good and have good intentions it still has the potential to do far more harm. Google can manipulate you but the government can manipulate you, throw you in jail, and rewrite the rules so you have no recourse. Even if the government can get the data from those companies there's at least a speed bump. Even if a speed bump isn't hard to get over are we going to pretend that some friction is no different from no friction?Turnkey tyranny is a horrific thing. One that I hope more people are becoming aware of as it's happening in many countries right now.[0]This doesn't make surveillance capitalism good and I absolutely hate those comparisons because they make the assumption that harm is binary. That there's no degree of harm. That two things can't be bad at the same time and that just because one is worse that means the other is okay.

If I had to purchase a means to transportation, it's most likely to be an ebike, potentially even a three-wheeled one.

Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE

When Phaidra CEO Jim Gao describes the AI agents that his Seattle company built to improve data center efficiencies, one can imagine an army of behind-the-scenes digital minions working away.

Their job is to fine-tune data center operations with a focus on cooling the electronics — which typically accounts for 30% of a facility's energy use, ranking second to the power required for the data processing operations. They're tracking temperatures, voltages, the spinning of pumps and other infrastructure to understand how well the center is operating.

The company's AI agents operate autonomously and evolve through reinforcement learning — observing outcomes, adapting and improving. The startup cuts energy use from cooling by 25% through its technology. The savings matter.

“We live in a power constrained world,” Gao said, noting that data centers are being rapidly built to meet AI demands, but energy supplies can't keep up. “The ability for these big AI companies to generate revenue is literally limited by the number of [electricity providing] electrons available.”

Phaidra last week announced $50 million in new funding from investors including Collaborative Fund, Helena, Index Ventures, Nvidia, Sony Innovation Fund and others, bringing its total capital raised to $120 million.

As big tech and data center operators plan to spend billions of dollars in coming years building more energy-intensive facilities — or “AI factories” as Gao calls them — the additional cash will help the startup push its tech further to make larger energy cuts.

An emerging area of focus is coordinating the AI agents to optimize functions system-wide.

Phaidra is also looking to go beyond the cooling infrastructure to help manage the data workflows coming through the centers, which can create spikes in energy demand. That requires a system to have more power on hand than it's going to need most of the time, so lowering those peaks can create important savings.

Alternately, the facilities should take advantage of slow times for certain jobs when that's available, Gao said.

“That doesn't happen today because the power, cooling and workload management systems all operate independently of each other, without coordination, without orchestration,” he added. “But that's the future that we see — significantly more efficient AI factories.”

The scourge of modern concrete is, perhaps surprisingly, rust. 

Most concrete structures are laced with steel rebar to add strength, but if the metal corrodes, it can cause the concrete to fail prematurely. Bridges, which are exposed to water and salt, are some of the most vulnerable. About one third of bridges in the United States need to be repaired or replaced, which could cost nearly $400 billion over the next decade.

There are plenty of ways engineers cope with rust, from coating the rebar with epoxy to pouring extra concrete to buy some time before seeping water reaches the rebar. Eventually these measures fail, too. The only way to truly prevent problematic rust is to use stainless steel rebar, which isn't cheap.

“It's too expensive to be used in every bridge,” Steven Jepeal, co-founder and CEO at Allium Engineering, told TechCrunch. So cities and states will only turn to it for the most critical spans.

But Allium is proposing a compromise, of sorts, by covering regular rebar with a thin layer of stainless steel to prolong the intended life of a bridge from 30 to 100 years. 

“As long as we're getting full coverage of the surface, a thin layer is enough stainless steel to where it's going to resist corrosion for hundreds or thousands of years,” said Samuel McAlpine, co-founder and CTO at Allium.

The startup's stainless steel-layered rebar was recently used in several bridge deck replacements, including one on Interstate 91 in Massachusetts and another on U.S. Highway 101 in Mendocino County, California. It also contributed to a commercial boat yard in Key West, Florida, Allium exclusively told TechCrunch.

For critical bridges that carry lots of traffic, engineers sometimes specify stainless steel, which costs around five times more than regular rebar. Governments consider the added costs are worth it if they don't have to shut down a major artery. 

But for most other bridges, they tend to specify epoxy-coated rebar, which is only about 25% to 50% more than uncoated rebar. Epoxy-coated rebar needs to be housed in covered storage, and any welded spots or nicks in the coating need to be patched, both of which add additional indirect costs.

Allium is pitching its stainless-clad rebar as a replacement for epoxy-coated. The company aims to match the price of epoxy coating and possibly undercut it in the future. Jepeal said, when installed, Allium's rebar should cost less because it doesn't need to be handled as carefully. The startup's rebar also won't need additional concrete that is sometimes added to bridges to forestall rusting.

“This extra layer of concrete isn't structural. It's just meant to try to insulate the rebar and delay how long it takes for the salt to get to the rebar,” Jepeal said. Eliminating that could trim cement use by 10%. And because the rebar isn't as susceptible to corrosion, it should allow transportation departments to specify the use of greener cements, which tend to be less alkaline than standard mixes, McAlpine said.

Allium's process clads 7,000-pound billets of steel with a layer of stainless steel, essentially welding wires to the exterior until it's fully coated. That billet, which is typically between six to eight inches square and 40 feet long, is then fed through a series of rollers until it reaches the desired thickness, which ranges from about a third of an inch to a couple inches in diameter. 

“By cladding a smaller surface area with a thicker layer and integrating into the mills process, we can do something that's a lot cheaper, a lot more scalable, a lot easier to control the quality of,” Jepeal said.

As the billet is getting thinned out, growing up to 150 times longer in the process, the stainless steel does as well. Ultimately, each piece of rebar ends up with about 0.2 mm of stainless cladding.

Even with that small amount, “you're not going to corrode through that stainless steel in concrete, basically,” McAlpine said.

The end is nigh for Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher, and it's all climaxing in one last battle… and another hunt for Ciri (Freya Allan), as she once again becomes the key to all things for the fate of the Continent. It's a good job then that Geralt is on the hunt for her and has a new party of allies to help him. Oh, and a shiny new face, to boot.

Yes, the big talking point of The Witcher‘s fourth season (with a fifth and final to come) remains the handover of the titular hero from Henry Cavill, who played Geralt for the first three seasons of the series, to Liam Hemsworth, who will take on the role for the show's final outings. Obviously, no one is going to address it in this trailer—although a fun voiceover line plays with this, teasing that “the Witcher is in a state of flux… you are becoming something new,” although whether that's about Geralt or perhaps even Ciri's own prior uncompleted attempts to undergo the transformation to become a mutant swordslinger is left unknown.

Meanwhile, Hemsworth's Geralt is here to do Geralt things, which are mostly to stab people, stab monsters, wonder where Ciri is, and harumph at all the things a Witcher would typically harumph at.

Suffice to say, that means it's a pretty typical trailer for The Witcher at this point. Time will tell if the new season manages to capture some of the spark of the show's early output, but at least it shows that even in changing its hero's face, The Witcher by and large doesn't have to change much else to keep its swords-and-sorcery fantasy ticking on.

The fourth season of The Witcher begins streaming on Netflix October 30.

California has passed a new law aimed at quieting blaring advertisements on streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video, requiring commercial volumes to match the audio levels of the content being streamed. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the law on Monday.

Starting July 1, 2026, streaming services won't be allowed to “transmit the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the advertisements accompany,” according to the bill's text.

“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,” Governor Newsom said in a press release. “By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms, which had previously not been subject to commercial volume regulations passed by Congress in 2010.”

The legislation is modeled after the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which in 2010 barred the audio of TV commercials from being broadcast louder than the TV program being aired. With this new legislation, streaming services must comply with the same commercial volume regulations as traditional TV broadcasters in California.

Senate Bill 576 was authored by California State Senator Tom Umberg, who cited a complaint from his legislative director, Zach Keller, about how the loud volume of streaming commercials was waking Keller's newborn daughter, Samantha.

“This bill was inspired by baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who's finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work,” said Senator Thomas Umberg in the press release. “SB 576 brings some much-needed peace and quiet to California households by making sure streaming ads aren't louder than the shows we actually want to watch.”

Given California's influence in the entertainment world, this legislation could pressure streaming platforms into cutting down on noisy commercials nationwide.

The third-party app store known as AltStore, one of the first companies to offer an alternative app marketplace in the European Union, is preparing to connect its platform with the open social web known as the fediverse.

The move would connect users on other open social apps, like Mastodon or Meta's Threads, with updates from their favorite apps in a new way.

In addition, the startup is announcing its first funding round from outside investors, with a $6 million Series A from Pace Capital. The deal gives the venture firm a 15% equity stake in AltStore and will allow the company to hire a team beyond its co-founders, Riley Testut and Shane Gill.

Flipboard CEO Mike McCue, a fediverse backer, is also now joining the startup's board.

The founders, now based in New York, say the new capital will help them capitalize on the potential for alternative app stores both in the EU and beyond as new competition laws are passed. Already, the startup has plans to bring its storefront to markets including Australia, Brazil, and Japan this year. To do so, the company needed to bring on more staff, which the new funds now allow.

AltStore has seen notable growth since the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) opened up competition in the app store market, forcing tech giants like Apple to permit new rivals to operate. While the startup offers its own third-party apps, led by video game emulator Delta, it began adding other third-party apps in June 2024. This included the virtual machine app UTM, a move that pressured Apple to open its own App Store to allow virtual machines.

AltStore also partnered with Epic Games in August of last year to bring Fortnite and other mobile games to its EU storefront, AltStore PAL. The company also entered the adult app market this year with the decision to host an app called Hot Tub, which was the first iOS app for pornography and is now its top app.

In April, AltStore began allowing developers to self-publish their apps for free on AltStore PAL, prompting further growth. 

AltStore's founders told TechCrunch that the store now has over 100 developers on board, which is more than Epic Games offers on its alternative games store, for comparison. AltStore, which is not limited to games, attracts a variety of developers, including indies who want to put out apps more as well as those who wouldn't meet Apple's stricter requirements, like its adult content restrictions.

Plus, developers like that the store supports different types of business models, whether that's a more traditional subscription or something where users donate toward the app's development, for instance.

“We have hundreds of thousands of users,” AltStore co-founder Testut told TechCrunch in an interview. “Wonderful and good numbers.”

Now, alongside the additional funding, AltStore is launching its own Mastodon server, running on the ActivityPub protocol, where users will be able to view app updates and new information from the sources they follow. Developers can opt in to have their app updates published to the new server.

“That means, if you have a Mastodon account or a Threads account, you could follow these accounts. You could follow the source from our Mastodon server. Then, in your timeline, you'd see when there was an app update,” explains Testut.

Once opted in, these updates will be automated by way of a JSON file with metadata. And this will output whatever is in the AltStore to the fediverse. 

“It's adding a social layer,” said Testut. “People can reply to apps from their Mastodon account. They can like stuff from their Threads account.” (Plus, the plan is to bridge the service with the open social ecosystem on Bluesky, using tools from the nonprofit, A New Social.)

The service will also help with discoverability, as users can look to the server and the accounts it hosts to find apps they may want to try.  

With the additional funds, AltStore wants to give back to the ecosystem that will make its social network possible. 

To that end, it's giving back $500,000 to various projects in the fediverse. So far, it's donated to Mastodon gGmbH ($300,000), as well as Bridgy Fed by A New Social, Ivory + Phoenix by Tapbots, Tapestry by The Iconfactory, mstdn.social, Akkoma, PeerTube, BookWyrm, and Fedify.

The Indian government's tax authority has fixed a security flaw in its income tax filing portal that was exposing sensitive taxpayers' data, TechCrunch has exclusively learned and confirmed with authorities.

The flaw, discovered in September by a pair of security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral,” allowed anyone who was logged into the income tax department's e-Filing portal to access up-to-date personal and financial data of other people.

The exposed data included full names, home addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, and bank account details of people who pay taxes on their income in India. The data also exposed citizens' Aadhaar number, a unique government-issued identifier used as proof of identity and for accessing government services.

TechCrunch verified the data to the best of its ability by granting permission to the researchers to look up this reporter's records on the portal.

The security researchers confirmed to TechCrunch on October 2 that the vulnerability was fixed. Given the risk to the public, TechCrunch withheld publishing this story until the security researchers confirmed that the vulnerability can no longer be exploited.

Representatives for the Indian Income Tax Department acknowledged our email requesting comment, but did not answer our questions by press time. The Income Tax Department did not present any objections to our publishing this story.

The security researchers Akshay CS and “Viral” told TechCrunch that they discovered the vulnerability while filing their recent income tax return on the government website.

Residents of India are required to file their annual earnings to calculate the taxes they owe to the Indian government.

The researchers found that when they signed into the portal using their Permanent Account Number (PAN), an official document issued by the Indian income tax department, they could view anyone else's sensitive financial data by swapping out their PAN for another PAN in the network request as the web page loads.

This could be done using publicly available tools like Postman or Burp Suite (or using the web browser's in-built developer tools) and with knowledge of someone else's PAN, the researchers told TechCrunch.

The bug was exploitable by anyone who was logged-in to the tax portal because the Indian income tax department's back-end servers were not properly checking who was allowed to access a person's sensitive data. This class of vulnerability is known as an insecure direct object reference, or IDOR, a common and simple flaw that governments have warned is easy to exploit and can result in large-scale data breaches.

“This is an extremely low-hanging thing, but one that has a very severe consequence,” the researchers told TechCrunch.

In addition to the data of individuals, the researchers said that the bug also exposed data associated with companies who were registered with the e-Filing portal.

TechCrunch also verified that the bug exposed data on individuals who have yet to file their income tax returns this year. We confirmed this by asking a person who had not yet filed their tax returns for their permission to have the researchers look up their information using the portal bug.

The security researchers alerted India's computer emergency readiness team, or CERT-In, to the security flaw soon after their discovery, but were not provided with a timeline for the fix.

When contacted by TechCrunch on September 30, a CERT-In representative said the Income Tax Department was already working to fix the vulnerability.

The Indian Ministry of Finance did not return TechCrunch's request for comment. After reaching out to the Income Tax Department regarding the vulnerability, the director general of Systems acknowledged receipt of TechCrunch's email on October 1, but did not comment further.

It remains unclear how long the vulnerability has existed or whether any malicious actors have accessed the exposed data. CERT-In did not respond to these questions when asked by TechCrunch.

The exact number of users impacted by the exposed data is also unclear. The Income Tax Department's portal lists more than 135 million registered users, and over 76 million users filed income tax returns in the financial year 2024-25, per public data available on the portal itself.

AMD locks in multi-year supply agreement with OpenAI, tying it to a $600 stock price target.

OpenAI has secured up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPU compute in a landmark supply agreement that could see the ChatGPT maker take a 10% stake in AMD.

The deal, announced on October 6, begins with AMD's next-generation Instinct MI450 series and spans multiple future product cycles. The first one-gigawatt tranche is scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2026, with follow-on deployments ramping up based on delivery and performance milestones. OpenAI's warrant vests in stages and caps out at 160 million shares — almost a tenth of AMD's outstanding stock — assuming the full 6GW is deployed and AMD's share price triples from current levels.

That would make OpenAI one of AMD's largest shareholders, and it gives both sides a reason to scale the partnership fast. But the partnership doesn't represent a break with Nvidia. Sam Altman said via X.com that the AMD deal is incremental and that it will continue to expand Nvidia purchases alongside its MI450 deployments, adding that “The world needs much more compute…”

Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia outlined a separate 10GW roadmap built around Nvidia's next-generation platforms.

The size of the partnership dispels the notion that AMD is merely a backup option for when Nvidia is unavailable. AMD confirmed that its work with OpenAI spans multiple generations of silicon, starting with MI450 and extending into future co-developed architectures, with AMD's Forrest Norrod calling it “transformative” in remarks to Reuters.

OpenAI, for its part, has reportedly already evaluated AMD's current-gen MI300X parts and is believed to be running production inference workloads on them now. While most high-profile model training still happens on Nvidia H100 clusters, the MI300X's larger memory pool and high bandwidth design make it particularly well-suited to LLM inference. AMD has pitched that advantage before, but this is the first time it's landed a customer of this size to prove it.

MI450 is expected to push those numbers even further, and will arrive around the same time Nvidia's Blackwell-based GB200 platforms begin volume deployment. AMD has been unusually direct about the comparison. If it can deliver, AMD stands to capture not just incremental demand but also new market share. Nvidia's H100 is already allocation-bound, despite Nvidia saying it has plenty of supply, and its upcoming Blackwell parts are expected to face similar constraints. AMD, starting from a smaller base, may have more headroom to scale in 2026 and 2027. For OpenAI, that flexibility may be more valuable than squeezing every last bit of throughput per watt.

The equity structure backing the deal is pretty aggressive. AMD is offering OpenAI the opportunity to purchase up to 160 million shares at $0.01 each, but only if it deploys the full 6 GW and AMD's stock reaches the pre-agreed price targets along the way. The $600 ceiling would represent more than three times AMD's pre-announcement trading price, implying a market cap north of half a trillion dollars. The company added nearly $80 billion in value when the deal was announced.

It's not the first time OpenAI has used its purchasing power to secure financial upside. Microsoft's initial investment in the company included infrastructure credits and profit participation. But this is the first time a chip supplier has offered equity in exchange for volume, and the first time OpenAI's compute roadmap has been tied to a public stock price.

From AMD's side, the warrant is a performance bet. It only vests if OpenAI buys and the market responds. AMD doesn't hand over a single share until the first gigawatt is installed, and even then, only partially. That structure also helps insulate AMD from the downside risk of OpenAI's custom silicon efforts, which are still in development with Broadcom and have reportedly slipped behind schedule.

OpenAI is already building out the infrastructure to support the six-gigawatt deal. Its first Stargate data center campus in Texas is being provisioned with nearly a gigawatt of on-site power generation just to keep pace with internal demand. That kind of buildout creates long lead-time demand not just for GPUs, but also for HBM, substrates, packaging, and data center cooling systems.

AMD's MI450 and successors will face the same upstream constraints that have dogged Nvidia for the last two years, and AMD has not disclosed how it plans to scale supply at the required rate. It's likely to pull from TSMC's advanced packaging lines and may tap Intel Foundry or U.S.-based subcontractors if TSMC's U.S. fabs aren't ready in time.

There are also obvious questions regarding software readiness. AMD's ROCm platform has made progress, and OpenAI's endorsement will accelerate that. But most large-scale deployments today still assume CUDA-first development. Running the same model across Nvidia, AMD, and OpenAI's future custom chips will require new levels of framework abstraction and operator portability, something OpenAI will need to tackle head-on as it balances workloads across suppliers.

What this deal shows is that achieving balance is OpenAI's goal. The company isn't walking away from Nvidia, but it's not waiting around either. AMD now has a foothold, and if it can execute, a stake in its future that will be difficult to ignore.

Microsoft is clamping down on the practice

The Out of Box Experience (OOBE), what Microsoft refers to as the setup process for a new Windows install, just received a significant update — it's now even more difficult to bypass restrictions in order to use a local account. For ages, people have employed creative tricks to circumvent signing into a Microsoft account before getting into Windows, but the company is making it increasingly clear that it's not an option to skip this part.

In the patch notes for Insider Preview Build 26220.6772, Microsoft explicitly mentions the removal of "local-only commands" and says these "known mechanisms" for bypassing online sign-ins are being addressed. It requires every user to log into their Microsoft account, or they'll end up skipping "critical setup screens" that will eventually crash the OOBE, forcing the user to start over. You must be connected to the internet throughout to "ensure device is setup correctly." This also only affects direct installs, not managed devices.

One of the most popular ways to skip a Microsoft account sign-in was to use the start ms cxh:local only command, which is now removed. The Redmont giant already disabled the "bypassnro" method a few months ago, but there are still ways to get around this new barrier. The easiest route you can take is to run a script-based unattended installation, but not everyone will be aware (or comfortable) doing that, not to mention the sheer privacy concerns. Check out our guide for more info.

 




This tightening of policy comes at a time when Windows 10 is just a week away from being phased out of active support. So, with users being forced to migrate to Windows 11, critics could see this as Microsoft prepping for a mass sales pitch where it can advertise its Microsoft 365 and OneDrive plans, which are routine parts of the internet-connected OOBE, to a lot of new eyes.

Right now, though, this change has only been introduced in the Dev channel, which suggests that it might take some time to be adopted in the public release that everyone uses. Microsoft tests new features in this channel, some of which make their way onto the Beta and Release Preview channels, from where a stable launch becomes imminent. There is a tiny sliver of hope that poor reception of this news might persuade the company into reconsidering this decision, but it's more so just a matter of time, rather than a matter of opinion.

Google's A-series Pixel phones have been our top recommendation for a few years, because these devices pack a lot of capabilities despite the mid-range price. In recent years, Google has added the same processor as its flagship sibling. Here, that means the Pixel 9a is powered by the Tensor G4 chip that's in the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro series, and you can expect excellent performance. It may not be the best option for heavy mobile gamers (who play the most demanding titles), but it'll handle most apps with ease.

Pixel phones are known for their cameras, and you will be hard-pressed to find another dual-camera system like this for $350, let alone $499. The 48-megapixel main camera can deliver sharp, colorful, and bright photos, even in low light, and you get a 13-MP ultrawide for good measure. The selfie shooter ain't too bad, either. Better yet, the camera system is completely flush with the back of the phone. If you hate camera bumps, you'll love the Pixel 9a.

The 6.3-inch display gets incredibly bright and has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate (something Apple finally added to its iPhone 17). And Google stuffs a lot of nice-to-have features, like Qi wireless charging, an IP68 water resistance rating, day-long battery life, and 7 years of software updates. That last one is a big deal because software updates mean your phone can last longer and stay secure.

It's not just about the hardware, though. Google Pixel phones have tons of genuinely useful smart software features, and many of them are available on the Pixel 9a. For example, Google's excellent Call Screening technology is present here, helping limit the number of robocalls that ring your phone. It can automatically detect the music that's playing around you and surface it on the lock screen, and Assistant Voice Typing delivers a more accurate voice-to-text transcription than what you'll find on most smartphones. You can read more about these features here.

The elephant in the room is the long-term performance of the battery. Google has issued software updates to the older Pixel 4a, Pixel 6a, and Pixel 7a devices, cutting their battery life short for safety reasons. It doesn't seem like that will happen to the Pixel 9a, as Google has introduced a plan to lower the charging speed gradually after 200 charge cycles, which will help maintain battery performance for longer, but it's still something to keep in mind.

If you grab this Prime Day Pixel deal, make sure you snag a case and screen protector! The Pixel 9a's screen isn't very durable and will scratch easily, so a screen protector is a smart investment.

Amazon (Colorsoft)

Amazon (Colorsoft Signature Edition)

The Kindle Colorsoft has a beautiful screen, but it leaves something to be desired with its high price tag. With these sale prices, though, it's finally worth splurging on. I love it for looking at a colorful library when I choose a book, and it's also a great option for anyone who loves comic books and graphic novels. I especially love the kids' version, but that unfortunately isn't on sale. It's worth spending an extra $10 to get the Signature edition, which comes with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light, and twice the storage.

Best Buy

I never shut up about this Kindle. I've even talked my coworkers into buying it during past deal events because it's just that good. The second-generation Kindle Scribe is both an e-reader and a digital notebook, so you can get the best of both worlds in a single device. The three-month battery life makes it actually usable, since you aren't constantly recharging it when you suddenly have an idea to write down or map out. It doesn't have color, but most digital notebooks don't without a large price tag, and the writing experience is super smooth. I'd get it again and again.

Amazon (Signature)

The Kindle Paperwhite is our all-around favorite Kindle. It's got extra features like a warm light and a larger screen, and the Signature edition has an ad-free lock screen, auto-adjusting front light, and wireless charging like the Colorsoft Signature. It's a great buy for just about anyone, and the one we recommend most if you aren't interested in extra features like a color screen or digital notebook capabilities. Spend an extra $25 to get the Signature bonus features, particularly the ad-free lock screen.

The adorable base Kindle is still a great buy, even if it doesn't have all the features of other Kindles. You'll still get snappy performance, dark mode, and a front light, though it won't be warm like more expensive models have. It's our recommendation for anyone on a budget, especially while it's on sale. The matcha green color is beautiful.

It's not every Prime (Big Deal) Day that you find an actually good laptop deal, but this one hits differently. While July's Prime Day barely offered any discounts on computers, Dell is now dropping the price of its Inspiron 15 3535 touchscreen laptop (AMD Ryzen 7 7730U, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD) to a record low of $784, down from its usual $2,199. If you're a Prime member, this is the kind of offer that almost makes you double-check if it's real. And yes, Dell itself is behind this massive price cut, not a reseller.

See at Amazon

This Dell Inspiron laptop is designed to perform responsively whatever you chuck at it -  spreadsheets, graphics work, video conferencing, a dozen browser windows, etc. It's powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor running at speeds of up to 4.5 GHz. That's smooth multitasking and rapid app opening without the massive power consumption you'd normally see on high-performance chips.

You also receive 32 GB of RAM which is way more than the average of 8 GB or 16 GB found on many laptops in this class of prices. What it means for everyday operation is seamless task switching. The 1 TB PCIe SSD storage offers both capacity and velocity, bringing it to life in a few seconds and keeping your PC quiet and cool at the same time.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Scientists say an artificial intelligence program that they compare to ChatGPT has helped them create one of the most detailed maps of the mouse brain to date, with 1,300 regions and subregions marked on the map.

Some of those subregions have never been charted before — and the researchers say there's more to come. “I think there are already indications that we can go beyond what we see now,” said Bosiljka Tasic, director of molecular genetics at Seattle's Allen Institute for Brain Science.

The mapping effort, led by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco and the Allen Institute, is detailed in a study published today in the journal Nature Communications.

“Our model is built on the same powerful technology as AI tools like ChatGPT,” senior author Reza Abbasi-Asl, a neuroscientist at UCSF, said in a news release. “Both are built on a ‘transformer' network which excels at understanding context.”

That context could be important for treating neurological ailments, Tasic told GeekWire.

“Location is everything in the brain,” she said. “Defining the geography of the brain, and then defining all these regions and their functions, not only leads to better understanding, but also better ability to treat.”

More detailed maps of the brain's cellular structure could lead to more targeted drug treatments that cause fewer side effects. “We always want to go toward better, more precise brain therapies, but in order to do that, you need to know where you need to interfere, what went wrong in what place, and what you need to fix,” Tasic said. “And if you don't have the map, how are you going to know where it is?”

Brain-mapping efforts have typically relied on human interpretation of the brain's anatomy, but scientists are getting better at identifying the location and function of millions of individual brain cells. They're getting so much better at collecting huge masses of data that they need AI to help with the interpretation.

“We are at a point where we have amazing experimental technology, so next-generation sequencing is completely revolutionized,” Tasic said. “Our way to define cell types — the fact that you can measure thousands of genes per cell, and define cells that are similar as a cell type — has transformed biology.”

The availability of software that can deal with such high-dimensional data is making this “an amazing time for a neuroscientist,” she said.

The key to the newly published study is an AI model called CellTransformer. The model sifts through huge sets of data about the locations and functions of brain cells, known as spatial transcriptomics data sets, to determine which cells belong in the same “neighborhood” of the brain.

CellTransformer analyzed spatial transcriptomics data about 9 million cells in more than 200 tissue sections that were taken from the brains of four individual mice. At first, researchers programmed the model to define the boundaries of 25 regions in the brain. Eventually, they raised the resolution to define 670 regions and subregions. At each level of resolution, CellTransformer's brain maps matched what had been defined previously by human experts.

Then the dial was turned up to produce 1,300 regions and subregions. At that level, CellTransformer successfully replicated maps of cataloged regions of the brain. It also identified previously uncataloged, finer-grained subregions in areas of the brain that are currently poorly understood.

Tasic said the process was like going from a map that showed only continents, or only countries, to a map that showed states, cities and even the neighborhoods within cities.

“What we're saying is, let's take any cell and ask, ‘Who are the neighbors?' And then, based on the commonality of the neighbors, call it a region,” she said. “Basically, that's what CellTransformer did.”

Some of the previously uncharted subregions are in the midbrain reticular nucleus, which plays a complex role in processing sensory and motor information. Other newly identified subregions are in the superior colliculus, a part of the midbrain that processes sensory information and initiates eye, head and body movements to focus on objects of interest. 

Tasic said it's possible to turn up the dial on CellTransformer's algorithms to produce maps of the brain that are even more detailed. “Now, the question is, which ones are meaningful, in what way, and what do they represent biologically?” she said.

Another question has to do with what to call the newly characterized subregions. “Just imagine that you came to a new land, and you are seeing there is this and there is that. But now I need to name it. Now I need to see what else is around,” Tasic said. “We want to give meaningful, systematic names and also reference how it relates to older maps.”

Perhaps the biggest questions relate to how the newly published map, which is based on cell types, will line up with maps that trace connections between cells, or patterns of brain-cell activity. “I'm just hoping for more systematic data collection, more systematic data analysis, and more multimodal models — models that will not only measure gene expression and cell type, but connectivity and productivity, and define brain regions based on all of those,” Tasic said.

Tasic said the AI-based techniques that were developed for mapping mouse brains are “absolutely extendable to the human brain,” but she doesn't expect that to happen overnight.

“The limit is actually data collection,” she said. “The human brain is huge, so that's one problem. … I don't want to give any estimates, but it will take maybe a decade more to just collect [data about] the full human brain at the level of detail that we did for the mouse.”

UCSF researcher Alex Lee is the principal author of the Nature Communications study, titled “Data-Driven Fine-Grained Region Discovery in the Mouse Brain With Transformers.” Other authors include Alma Dubuc, Michael Kunst, Shenqin Lao, Nicholas Lusk, Lydia Ng, Hongkui Zeng, Bosiljka Tasic and Reza Abbasi-Asl.

Lilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry. 

BOX ELDER COUNTY, Utah – On a bright afternoon in August, the shore on the North Arm of the Great Salt Lake looks like something out of a science fiction film set in a scorching alien world. The desert sun is blinding as it reflects off the white salt that gathers and crunches underfoot like snow at the water's edge. In a part of the lake too shallow for boats, bacteria have turned the water a Pepto-Bismol pink. The landscape all around is ringed with jagged red mountains and brown brush. The only obvious sign of people is the salt-encrusted hose running from the water's edge to a makeshift encampment of shipping containers and trucks a few hundred feet away. 

This otherworldly scene is the test site for a company called Lilac Solutions, which is developing a technology it says will shake up the United States' efforts to pry control over the global supply of lithium, the so-called “white gold” needed for electric vehicles and batteries, away from China. Before tearing down its demonstration facility to make way for its first commercial plant, due online next year, the company invited me to be the first journalist to tour its outpost in this remote area, a roughly two-hour drive from Salt Lake City.

The startup is in a race to commercialize a new way to extract lithium from rocks, called direct lithium extraction (DLE). This approach is designed to reduce the environmental damage caused by the two most common traditional methods of mining lithium: hard-rock mining and brining. 

Australia, the world's top producer of lithium, uses the first approach, scraping rocks laden with lithium out of the earth so they can be chemically processed into industrial-grade versions of the metal. Chile, the second-largest lithium source, uses the second: It floods areas of its sun-soaked Atacama Desert with water. This results in ponds rich in dissolved lithium, which are then allowed to dry off, leaving behind lithium salts that can be harvested and processed elsewhere. 

The range of methods known as DLE use lithium brine too, but instead of water-intensive evaporation, they all involve advanced chemical or physical filtering processes that selectively separate out lithium ions. While DLE has yet to take off, its reduced need for water and land has made it a prime focus for companies and governments looking to ramp up production to meet the growing demand for lithium as electric vehicles take off and even bigger batteries are increasingly used to back up power grids. China, which processes more than two-thirds of the world's mined lithium, is developing its own DLE to increase domestic production of the raw material. New approaches are still being researched, but nearly a dozen companies are actively looking to commercialize DLE technology now, and some industrial giants already offer basic off-the-shelf hardware. 

In August, Lilac completed its most advanced test yet of its technology, which the company says doesn't just require far less water than traditional lithium extraction—it uses a fraction of what other DLE approaches demand. 

The company uses proprietary beads to draw lithium ions from water and says its process can extract lithium using a tenth as much water as the alumina sorbent technology that dominates the DLE industry. Lilac also highlights its all-American supply chain. Technology originally developed by Koch Industries, for example, uses some Chinese-made components. Lilac's beads are manufactured at the company's plant in Nevada. 

Lilac says the beads are particularly well suited to extracting lithium where concentrations are low. That doesn't mean they could be deployed just anywhere—there won't be lithium extraction on the Hudson River anytime soon. But Lilac's tech could offer significant advantages over what's currently on the market. And forgoing plans to become a major producer itself could enable the company to seize a decent slice of global production by appealing to lithium miners companies looking for the best equipment, says Milo McBride, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who authored a recent report on DLE. 

If everything pans out, the pilot plant Lilac builds next to prove its technology at commercial scale could significantly increase domestic supply at a moment when the nation's largest proposed lithium project, the controversial hard-rock Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, has faced fresh uncertainty. At the beginning of October, the Trump administration renegotiated a federal loan worth more than $2 billion to secure a 5% ownership stake for the US government. 

Despite bipartisan government support, the prospect of opening a deep gash in an unspoiled stretch of Nevada landscape has drawn fierce opposition from conservationists and lawsuits from ranchers and Native American tribes who say the Thacker Pass project would destroy the underground freshwater reservoirs on which they depend. Water shortages in the parched West have also made it difficult to plan on using additional evaporation ponds, the other traditional way of extracting lithium. 

Lilac is not the only company in the US pushing for DLE. In California's Salton Sea, developers such as EnergySource Minerals are looking to build a geothermal power plant to power a DLE facility pulling lithium from the inland desert lake. And energy giants such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are racing to develop an area in southwestern Arkansas called the Smackover region, where researchers with the US Geological Survey have found as much as 19 million metric tons of untapped lithium in salty underground water. In between, both geographically and strategically, is Lilac: It's looking to develop new technology like the California companies but sell its hardware to the energy giants in Arkansas. 

A measure I call the Green Premium reveals where we can invest in climate progress for maximum impact. 

The Great Salt Lake isn't an obvious place to develop a lithium mine. The Salton Sea boasts lithium concentrations of just under 200 parts per million. Argentina, where Lilac has another test facility, has resources of above 700 parts per million. 

Here on the Great Salt Lake? “It's 70 parts per million,” Raef Sully, Lilac's Australia-born chief executive, tells me. “So if you had a football stadium with 45,000 seats, this would be three people.”

For Lilac, this is actually a feature of the location. “It's a very, very good demonstration of the capability of our technology,” Sully says. Showing that Lilac's hardware can extract lithium at high purity levels from a brine with low concentration, he says, proves its versatility. That wasn't the reason Lilac selected the site, though. “Utah is a mining friendly state,” says Elizabeth Pond, the vice president of communications. And though the lake water has low concentrations of lithium, extracting the brine simply calls for running a hose into the water, whereas other locations would require digging a well at great cost. 

When I accompanied Sully to the test site during my tour, our route following unpaved county roads lined with fields of wild sunflowers. The facility itself is little more than an assortment of converted shipping containers and two mobile trailers, one to serve as the main office and the other as a field laboratory to test samples. It's off the grid, relying on diesel generators that the company says will be replaced with propane units once this location is converted to a permanent facility but could eventually be swapped for geothermal technology tapping into a hot rock resource located nearby. (Solar panels, Sully clarifies, couldn't supply the 24-7 power supply the facility will need.) But it depends on its connection to the Great Salt Lake via that lengthy hose. 

Pumped uphill, the lake water passes through a series of filters to remove solids until it ends up in a vessel filled with the company's specially designed ceramic beads, made from a patented material that attracts lithium ions from the water. Once saturated, the beads are put through an acid wash to remove the lithium. The remaining brine is then repeatedly tested and, once deemed safe to release back into the lake, pumped back down to the shore through an outgoing tube in the hose. The lithium solution, meanwhile, is stockpiled in tanks on site before shipping off to a processing plant to be turned into battery-grade lithium carbonate, which is a white powder. 

“As a technology provider in the long term, if we're going to have decades of lithium demand, they want to position their technology as something that can tap a bunch of markets,” McBride says. “To have a technology that can potentially economically recover different types of resources in different types of environments is an enticing proposition.” 

This testing ground won't stay this way for long. During my visit, Lilac's crew was starting to pack up the location after completing its demonstration testing. The results the company shared exclusively with me suggest a smashing success, particularly for such low-grade brine with numerous impurities: Lilac's equipment recovered 87% of the available lithium, on average, with a purity rate of 99.97%.

The incoming administration's hostile trade plans threaten to slow the shift to cleaner industries, boost inflation, and stall the economy.

The next step will be to clear the area to make way for construction of Lilac's first permanent commercial facility at the same site. To meet the stipulations of Utah state permits for the new plant, the company had to cease all operations at the demonstration project. If everything goes according to plan, Lilac's first US facility will begin commercial production in the second half of 2027. The company has lined up about two-thirds of its funding for the project. That could make the plant the first new commercial source of lithium in the US to come online in years, and the first DLE facility ever. 

Once it's fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac's technology would produce between three and five times that amount. 

There are some potential snags. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. (Lilac says it's largely immune to the restrictions since it returns the water to the lake.) While the relatively low concentrations of lithium in the water make for a good test case, full-scale commercial production would likely prove far more economical in a place with more of the metal. 

“The Great Salt Lake is probably the worst possible place to be doing this, because there are real challenges around pulling water from the lake,” says Ashley Zumwalt-Forbes, a mining engineer who previously served as the deputy director of battery minerals at the Department of Energy. “But if it's just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.” 

What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. Lilac wants instead to sell its technology to others. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. Sully tells me it's being built under a separate limited-liability corporation to make a potential sale easier if it's successful. 

It's an unusual play in the lithium industry. Once most companies see success with their technology, “they go crazy and think they can vertically integrate and at the same time be a miner and an energy producer,” Kwasi Ampofo, the head of minerals and metals at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, tells me. 

“Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren't choosing that route.” 

If things work out the right way, Sully says, Lilac could become the vendor of choice to projects like the oil-backed sites in the Smackover and beyond. 

“We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.” 

The industry is getting billions, but it's way too early to count on fusion to meet growing electricity demand.

Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.

Forecasts aren't looking quite as rosy for the green fuel, though China is still a bright spot.

Some individual queries use a small amount of electricity, but AI's energy demand is still a big deal.

Qualtrics is making its largest acquisition ever with a $6.75 billion deal to buy Press Ganey Forsta in a bid boost the company's experience management platform. 

Press Ganey Forsta builds software to help companies understand their customers and stakeholders. It focuses on healthcare and has more than 43,000 customers globally. 

Qualtrics, based in Provo, Utah, and Seattle, offers similar technology that helps companies gather data and improve the experiences and interactions that customers, employees, and others have with their products and services.

Qualtrics CEO Zig Serafin said the deal “will accelerate the adoption of AI and create the most comprehensive platform for improving the human experience.”

“There's no more important proving ground for experience management than healthcare, where better experiences for patients and employees directly impact better outcomes and quality of care,” Serafin said in a press release. He called the deal a “landmark moment” for the company.

Qualtrics has been rolling out several AI-powered products and features to help companies gather and analyze customer feedback.

Qualtrics is buying Press Ganey Forsta with a combination of cash and equity. The acquisition is expected to close in the coming months.

Once publicly traded, Qualtrics was acquired by Silver Lake and Canada Pension Pan Investment Board in a private equity deal in 2023.

Damien Leone, the writer and director of the Terrifier film series, along with Universal Creatives at Halloween Horror Nights, takes fans on an NSFW behind-the-screams tour of the house Art the Clown built. Well, at least you can see what the Halloween haunt titans would imagine he would build in a recently shared Instagram video that provides a lights-on look at the Terrifier houses for Horror Nights 2025.

John Murdy, creative director of Halloween Horror Nights Hollywood, calls them “the goriest [houses] in the history of Horror Nights,” and we can attest to that having visited the East and West Coast versions of the house. It truly speaks to how Art the Clown's presence really made this year's Horror Nights events one of the most thrilling, terrifying, and memorable yet. And that's thanks to how collaborative the entire team was to bring Leone's vision of Art to life. The bloody cherry on top of the cake is how incredibly the in-park wandering clowns really capture the film's smiling slasher energy made iconic by David Howard Thornton.

“What excited John and I and our teams was not only paying off everything in the films but also creating a world that is completely Art's creation.” senior director of Universal Orlando Resort Entertainment Mike Aiello shared.

HHN East's Clown Cafe dream sequence room was hands down one of the most faithful recreations we've experienced at the annual event and an instant favorite. As soon as dream Sienna appeared as a jump scare with her whimsical look and plated heart, I was won over (head over heels). Similarly, the Christmas mall Santa scene in Hollywood truly captured one of the darkest of Art's kills in a delightfully demented way with lots of water spray to simulate his signature bloody fun moments.

Murdy added, “We wanted to plant this seed in our guest's mind that wherever they go in this house, there's a good possibility that they're going to be sprayed with blood. You're going to see a lot of famous kills from Terrifier as Easter eggs for our fans throughout the experience.”

In the clip you can also see Leone with producer Phil Falcone looking around the Hollywood version of the house with glee. The Hollywood house depicts Art's greatest hits; along with the mall Santa, there's the Halloween scalping and the truly horrendous bathroom scene showcased behind a carnival-style Terrifier walk-through entrance.

“Now truthfully, the attention to detail in this house is just incredible. So to see it in person is really surreal and remarkable,” Leone said. “Brilliant. It really is. You guys knocked it out of the park.”

Protected areas of defined geographic zones can slow biodiversity loss and bolster conversation efforts, but they may have unintended impacts on the diets of children who live nearby, according to new research from scientists at Penn State.

Published in the British Ecological Society's journal People and Nature, the researchers analyzed children's diets in Cambodia and Myanmar by distance from the nearest protected area. They found that diet quality increased the farther from the protected area the child lived up to about 80 kilometers and then declined at greater distances. The researchers also found that, in Indigenous population areas, the odds that children ate vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables were highest around 80 kilometers and lower both nearer and farther away. The same association did not persist in non-Indigenous areas.

Vitamin A supports growth and immune defenses in children; too little can cause night blindness and increase the risk of illness and death from infections such as measles and diarrheal disease, according to the World Health Organization. Understanding how proximity to protected areas relates to vitamin A-rich foods can help conservation and public health planners align strategies as nations expand protection goals, said Lilly Zeitler, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Geography at Penn State who led the study.

In some places, local communities rely directly on nearby lands and ecosystems for food. They manage these food systems under customary tenure - local rules enforced by tradition and social norms rather than formal laws. Creating protected areas can disrupt that customary tenure, with negative effects on how people get food. Alternatively, tourism can boost local incomes near protected areas in ways that alter households' food purchasing patterns. Despite these clear conceptual links between protected areas and local diets, these relationships remain poorly understood."

Lilly Zeitler, doctoral candidate, Department of Geography, Penn State

A large share of protected land overlaps with Indigenous territories in Cambodia and Myanmar, the researchers said, explaining that this allowed them to compare patterns across two countries with contrasting approaches to Indigenous rights.

"A cross-country comparison is interesting to see whether there are different relationships between protected areas, diets and Indigeneity in these two very different contexts," Zeitler said.

Researchers analyzed demographic and health surveys collected from rural Cambodia and Myanmar in 2014 and 2015-16, respectively, that asked caregivers of 2,899 children ages 6 to 59 months what the child ate the previous day. They matched each surveyed community to the nearest protected area and measured distance to its boundary.

The team then examined dietary diversity and whether the children ate pulses - dry, edible seeds of legumes - or vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables across the distance gradient and by Indigenous status, adjusting for household wealth, maternal education, breastfeeding, season, market access, rainfall, elevation and proximity to water and forest cover.

The analysis showed a non-linear pattern: the highest predicted dietary diversity occurred around 80 kilometers from protected areas, where landscapes commonly mix forests and agriculture.

"For our analytic sample, mid-distances from protected areas had about a third of forest cover," Zeitler said. "One-third forest cover indicates a mix of different land uses at an 80-kilometer distance, including forest cover and agriculture, in what other researchers call an 'agroecological matrix.' These mixed landscapes appear to be associated with higher dietary diversity among young children."

They also found food-group differences by distance. In Indigenous population areas, children were most likely to eat vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables at about 80 kilometers from protected areas, with different distance patterns for pulses. In non-Indigenous population areas, however, this association disappeared.

"We think this is because common vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables in the region, such as mango, passionfruit, sweet potato and squash, are often grown in mixed landscapes," Zeitler said. "Mixed landscapes with swiddens and home gardens might be more important sources of vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables for Indigenous populations in the region."

According to Zeitler, the findings offer insight for conservation planning as countries pursue the United Nations' Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's 30-by-30 target, a goal to conserve at least 30% of land, inland waters and oceans by 2030 with emphasis on effective management and Indigenous rights. The results point to the potential benefits of conservation approaches that recognize mixed land uses in some contexts rather than strict separation of farms and forests.

"Our results can inform conservation efforts seeking to minimize negative relationships between protected areas and local populations' health and diet quality," Zeitler said. "The results indicate that an 'agroecological matrix' approach to conservation, rather than the binary 'land sparing' model that separates people and agriculture from forests, could support local diet quality in some contexts."

Zeitler emphasized that more research is needed to fully elucidate the identified patterns of children's diet quality near protected areas.

"Because this study is based on secondary pre-existing anonymized datasets, we could not interview people in Indigenous and non-Indigenous population areas on why their consumption of some food groups differed at different distances from protected areas, for instance," Zeitler said, explaining that they could not draw causal inferences from the study, either, because the data are snapshots in time rather than tracking changes over time. The team was also unable to link country-level differences between Cambodia and Myanmar to specific policies without longitudinal data and additional analyses.

Zeitler said she hopes the findings inform conservation and health discussions as protected areas expand.

"I hope this research will stimulate debate and dialogue among conservationists and policymakers on the relationships between protected areas and local diets," Zeitler said. "The perceived need to separate forest and agriculture for conservation can be challenged by recognizing the importance of mixed land use systems for local diets, especially among Indigenous populations in some parts of the world."

Bronwen Powell, associate professor of geography, of African studies and of anthropology, co-authored the paper and serves as Zeitler's adviser. Heather Randell of the University of Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs also contributed to the study.

A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on August 27, 2025, titled, "Deregulated miR-145 and miR-27b in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: implications for adipogenesis."

In this study, led by first author Felix Quirin Fenzl and corresponding author Karima Djabali from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), researchers identified that miR-145-5p and miR-27b-3p interfere with the formation of fat cells in children with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare and fatal premature aging disorder. Their findings help explain why patients often experience fat loss and related metabolic complications and suggest new potential therapeutic strategies.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition that causes rapid aging in children, often leading to early death due to heart disease. Although affected children appear healthy at birth, they soon develop signs of accelerated aging, including hair loss, stiff joints, and a significant reduction in fat tissue. While certain treatments can slow disease progression, many aspects, such as the loss of fat tissue, remain poorly understood.

"Overall, this study provides the first comprehensive miRNA profiling of HGPS and control fibroblasts across different stages of cellular senescence."

This study focused on how microRNAs-tiny molecules that help regulate gene expression-contribute to the disease. To explore this, the researchers used skin-derived stem cells from both healthy individuals and HGPS patients. When they transformed these cells into fat cells, the HGPS-derived stem cells formed significantly fewer fat cells. This difference was linked to unusually high levels of miR-145-5p and miR-27b-3p. These molecules were found to silence important genes required for fat cell growth and function. When the researchers blocked these microRNAs, fat cell formation improved. 

The team also examined fat tissue from a mouse model of HGPS. Similar to the human cells, these mice showed increased levels of miR-145-5p and miR-27b-3p and impaired fat development. These results confirm that these two microRNAs play a central role in the loss of fat tissue seen in the disease. Importantly, reducing their activity could become a promising therapeutic strategy for restoring fat tissue in affected individuals.

Although further research is needed before developing treatments, this study represents a step forward in understanding the molecular causes of lipodystrophy, a condition in which the body cannot form healthy fat tissue, in HGPS. It also opens the door for future therapies that could improve quality of life and health outcomes for patients. In the long term, similar approaches might benefit people with other metabolic diseases, such as obesity or diabetes, where fat cell function is also disrupted.

Wasatch BioLabs (WBL), a Renew Biotechnologies subsidiary, and the largest U.S. sequencing service provider dedicated exclusively to long-read sequencing, today announced the addition of three Oxford Nanopore-developed research-use-only (RUO) assays to its service portfolio: a Pharmacogenomics (PgX) panel, Telomere Sequencing, and mRNA Vaccine Quality Control. Headquartered in a 20,000 sqft CLIA-registered laboratory, WBL combines Oxford Nanopore's assays with its proven expertise in long-read sequencing to deliver data at scale with clarity and actionable insight.

By integrating these Oxford Nanopore assays into our services, we're giving translational teams a way to adopt these powerful workflows with confidence.

Our expertise ensures the data is delivered with the quality, clarity, and scale needed to accelerate today's most important research."

Steve Abbott, COO, Wasatch BioLabs

Developed by Oxford Nanopore, the PGx panel delivers full-gene coverage - including repeats, structural variants, and hybrid alleles that are often missed by short-read methods. By offering the panel as a service, WBL enables researchers to generate more complete pharmacogenomic profiles with rapid turnaround and integrated bioinformatics, and offers fit-for-purpose validations to align with study needs and regulatory expectations. This higher-resolution approach strengthens precision medicine studies and drug development pipelines with greater confidence and reliability.

ONT's telomere workflow provides molecule-level resolution of telomere length distributions and subtelomeric methylation across individual chromosome arms. WBL brings this assay to scale for oncology, aging, and rare disease programs where subtle telomere dynamics often hold critical biological meaning. With high precision, researchers can now incorporate telomere measurements into longitudinal studies and translational models with greater consistency.

With long reads, single-molecule resolution, and no amplification artifacts, Wasatch BioLab's mRNA Vaccine QC service delivers a complete and accurate view of mRNA constructs, from early development through lot release and stability studies, all within a single streamlined workflow. This approach preserves critical features such as poly(A) tails, structural heterogeneity, and overall integrity to confirm product quality and support regulatory-ready development.

Together, these assays expand WBL's ability to support BioPharma and Biotech teams across a wide spectrum of applications - from drug response studies, to telomere biology research, to mRNA vaccine development. With Oxford Nanopore's assays run through WBL's high-capacity infrastructure and expert bioinformatics pipelines, researchers gain access to advanced long-read workflows in a setting designed for both discovery and translational impact.

As Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s dismantling of federal vaccine policy continues to roil the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some Democratic-led states have struck out on their own, setting up new systems to help them assess the science and maintain immunization access for their residents.

Four western states — California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington — have created a collaborative to preserve access to vaccines. Several northeastern states have done the same.

New York's governor declared a “statewide disaster emergency” that allows pharmacists to give covid-19 vaccines without a separate prescription. Minnesota made a similar change, and Massachusetts is requiring insurance carriers to pay for vaccines recommended by its health department, not only those recommended by the CDC.

The changes represent a significant shift in public health authority from the federal government to the states. Traditionally, states have looked to the CDC for expertise and guidance on public health issues — including, in addition to vaccines, workplace safety, water fluoridation, vaping, and sexually transmitted infections.

Now, amid concerns that Kennedy is undermining trust in vaccines and public health science, some states are charting new paths, seeking out new sources of scientific consensus and changing how they regulate insurance companies, prescribers, and pharmacists.

Colorado has been at the front of this wave. On Sept. 3, state officials issued a standing order to let pharmacists provide covid shots without individual prescriptions.

“I will not allow ridiculous and costly red tape or decisions made far away in Washington to keep Coloradans from accessing vaccines,” said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

But Colorado's leadership had already been clearing the way for more autonomy on vaccine policy for months.

In March, the state legislature voted to change a law so the state could consider scientific sources other than the federal government when setting school vaccine requirements.

“You could see the writing on the wall that it was just becoming overly politicized rather than relying on actual science with this new HHS director,” said state Sen. Kyle Mullica.

Mullica, who co-sponsored the new law, is a Democrat and works as an emergency room nurse in the Denver area.

Colorado is among the first states to change its laws to allow it to recommend vaccines based on sources other than the CDC. The state health board can now also consult leading medical groups, like the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

“We decided to protect Colorado,” Mullica said, so it “wouldn't be as vulnerable to political upheaval that we're seeing right now.”

The Democratic-led legislature passed the bill in a near-party-line vote. Polis signed it into law in April, despite having praised Kennedy's selection last fall.

“Colorado I think is really leading the way on this,” said David Higgins, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado who was part of a stakeholder group that helped craft the bill.

Higgins pointed to a companion bill, signed in May, that he said makes Colorado's push even stronger. It deals with insurance coverage for preventive health care services, aiming to ensure state-regulated insurance plans cover the cost of some vaccines, regardless of future moves by the CDC.

“Effectively, it's meant to help ensure that Coloradans will still have access to vaccines,” he said.

The Colorado chapter of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine advocacy group that Kennedy led before taking over HHS, did not respond to a request for comment.

Another co-sponsor of the first bill, Democratic state Rep. Lindsay Gilchrist, said the circulation of so much false information about vaccines, including for covid, makes it important to hear from a range of trusted medical experts.

Colorado had previously looked to the CDC for scientific guidance on vaccines, particularly for children entering school. Like other states, it had tracked the recommendations of a CDC panel known as Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Kennedy fired all 17 members in June and replaced them with 12 new appointees, some of whom critics warn are vaccine skeptics and aren't qualified to provide critical guidance for Americans.

“I think where the confusion will lie is the difference in the recommendations between the ACIP, who we traditionally defer to, and then everyone else,” said Ned Calonge, Colorado's chief medical officer.

He expects that the national professional physician groups that Colorado is now empowered to consult will likely be aligned in their overall guidance and will “look at the last evidence-based recommendations that were provided by the ACIP” before Kennedy replaced its members.

In May, Kennedy announced the federal government had removed covid vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children.

But Colorado is still recommending a covid vaccine during pregnancy, Calonge said.

“There's been no new evidence of issues of safety in that population,” Calonge said. “So, we're telling providers that our recommendation is to continue to follow the recommendation as it was in place in January of 2025.”

In a statement on its website, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommended pregnant individuals get vaccinated against covid. “ACOG continues to recommend that all pregnant and lactating individuals receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or ‘booster,'” it said.

Likewise, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in August that all children from 6 to 23 months old get vaccinated against covid, as well as older children in certain risk groups.

For now, Colorado is following the same immunization recommendations it used last year.

The most recent ACIP meeting, on Sept. 18 and 19, was chaotic, with members admitting they did not understand what they were voting on and even opting to redo a vote on pediatric MMRV vaccine access. The next ACIP meeting is scheduled to take place Oct. 22 and 23 and could result in additional changes to vaccine recommendations.

Doctors and vaccine scientists have expressed alarm at the splintering national consensus on vaccines.

“There's now going to be much more confusion and distrust of vaccines among the public,” said Allison Kempe, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who served on ACIP from 2013 to 2018.

Still, she said she's glad Colorado is forging ahead with its own recommendations.

A good night's sleep has long been understood to help us consolidate new memories, but we don't understand how. Associations with negative feelings like fear or stress can improve recall, but intentionally trying to remember can also be effective. But these two mechanisms are very different - one involuntary, one deliberate. Which influences memory most? To investigate, researchers asked participants to remember or forget words, some of which had negative emotional associations. They found that instructions improved recall more than emotion.

"What we intend to remember and to forget can be powerful," said Dr Laura Kurdziel of Merrimack College, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience. "We have more control over our memories than we often think we do."

Researchers performed two matching studies - one where 45 participants completed the task online, and one where 53 participants visited the lab. Half of each group received their words to remember in the morning and then tested their memories that evening. The other half received their words in the evening and were tested on the following morning, after sleeping. For the evening group of lab-based participants, the team supplied electroencephalogram (EEG) headbands that measured their brain activity while they slept. All participants took part in two sessions. 

At the first session, participants watched 100 words appear on a screen, each followed by a cue to remember or forget. Half of the selected words had negative emotional connotations, and the other half were neutral. Immediately afterwards, participants were shown another set of 100 words and asked if they recognized them. 50 of these were from the previous task, but 50 were 'foils' which they hadn't seen before. 

At the second session, 12 hours later, the scientists asked participants to report as many of the words they'd been asked to remember as possible. The scientists then analyzed the participants' performance and EEG data. 

They found that when it comes to memory, instructions do indeed work better than emotion. People were more likely to recall words they had been asked to remember. However, emotions did play a part: words participants had been asked to remember that had negative connotations were more likely to be remembered. This suggests that although instructions were the primary influence on recall, emotional cues could amplify the effect of instructions. Emotions also increased the chances of false memories: negative foils were more likely to be misremembered as words participants had been asked to remember. 

"During encoding, we will devote more attentional resources to words that we are told explicitly to remember," said Kurdziel.

Along similar lines, cognitive control systems can 'tag' information as relevant, biasing the hippocampus to prioritize it. This increases the likelihood that the memory will be reactivated during sleep and transferred to long-term storage. Lastly, instructions don't just enhance relevant items, they also suppress irrelevant ones. By inhibiting competing memories, remember-cued items face less interference, which improves recall."

Dr. Laura Kurdziel, Merrimack College

Unexpectedly, whether participants had slept had no effect on how well they recalled words. However, the different types of brain wave activity measured by the EEG were linked to recall. For example, higher levels of REM theta power, a measure of REM sleep, were associated with the misremembering of negative foils.

"Sleep spindles were associated with better recall of negative, remember-cued words," said Kurdziel, referring to a kind of brain wave that looks like a burst of spikes on the brain wave recordings. "Sleep spindles are widely implicated in the transfer of information from temporary hippocampal storage to more stable representations in the neocortex."

"By contrast, slow wave sleep was negatively correlated with total recall," Kurdziel continued. "This was somewhat unexpected - slow wave sleep is often associated with improvements in declarative memory. However, it has also been theorized to facilitate active forgetting of irrelevant or redundant information." 

This could indicate that sleeping only consolidates some memories - prioritizing things you're motivated to remember over things which are emotional - and that sleeping in general is less significant than your brain's activity during sleep. However, more research is needed to confirm this.

"The number of participants who provided usable EEG data was relatively small, which reduces confidence in the strength of sleep–memory associations," explained Kurdziel. "Additionally, the sample consisted primarily of college students, making it difficult to generalize the findings to broader populations."

Today, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®)-a nonprofit responsible for globally utilized guidelines for cancer care-is sharing new NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ resources for breast cancer treatment as well as genetic/familial high-risk assessment, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Since launching with three digitized versions of NCCN's benchmark evidence-based clinical practice guidelines earlier this year, NCCN has quickly expanded availability to more than a dozen topics. The interactive format makes recommendations easier to navigate and search and links directly to other NCCN digital resources.

"The NCCN Guidelines Navigator enables health care providers to quickly find and understand the best available evidence-based options for treating each individual person," said Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, Chief Executive Officer, NCCN.

The intuitive flow in the NCCN Guidelines Navigator supports easier treatment decision-making based on the latest evidence and expert-consensus. We are pleased to be able to honor Breast Cancer Awareness Month by making some of our most widely used guidelines available in multiple formats, ultimately leading to better outcomes for people facing cancer and their loved ones."

Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, Chief Executive Officer, National Comprehensive Cancer Network

The NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ features content from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®)-the most frequently-updated clinical practice guidelines available in any area of medicine. NCCN Guidelines® cover everything from cancer prevention, to screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and supportive care. The new format incorporates seamless movement, advanced search and filter capabilities, color-coded navigation links, and other digital enhancements.

The entire library of NCCN Guidelines will eventually be accessible in both the current PDF format as well as the new, digitized versions. Currently, the NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ is available for the following cancer types and topics:

"The NCCN Guidelines were accessed more than 16 million times in the last calendar year overall-with the breast cancer treatment guidelines accounting for about 10 percent of that total," said William J. Gradishar, MD, Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University, Chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Breast Cancer. "Breast cancer prevention, screening, and management is based on complex and rapidly evolving information, impacting millions of people worldwide. We've seen survival rates improve dramatically thanks to scientific advances that help health care providers match the right approach to the right person. The new NCCN Guidelines Navigator format allows us to integrate different resources for improving care into one hub for clinical guidance, patient/caregiver empowerment, and professional development."

The NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ integrates NCCN Chemotherapy Order Templates (NCCN Templates®) smoothly into point-of-care in order to improve the safety and convenience of drugs and biologics usage. The NCCN Templates® standardize patient care, reduce medication errors, and help providers to anticipate and manage treatment-related adverse events.

Additionally, people who access the NCCN Guidelines in any format, including via the NCCN Guidelines Navigator™, can earn CE/MOC credits in real time with an NCCN Guidelines in Practice™ subscription.

The NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ also provides easy access to the NCCN Guidelines for Patients®, which present the information from the clinical guidelines in lay person-centered terms with a glossary and pictures to aid in patient education and shared decision making.

In the months since the initial beta testing launch, the NCCN Guidelines Navigator™ has been accessed more than 50,000 times and received highly positive feedback. According to a survey response: "The NCCN Guidelines Navigator does a great job of making the existing NCCN Guideline searchable and accessible. The search function quickly suggests relevant sections of the guideline, along with footnotes, references, and regimen information."

Logical Biological, biospecimen and critical raw material leader, and Bcell Design, pioneers in transgenic monoclonal antibody technology, today announced a long term strategic partnership to deliver engineered disease state materials for diagnostic and research markets.

Working together, the two companies will develop customised engineered disease state and ‘spiking' materials to deliver compelling alternatives to native disease state plasma. Materials are designed and formulated to bring native disease state plasma-like performance, aligned and customized to customer's performance and scale requirements.

Bcell Design is a leading manufacturer of high-quality, human Fc antibodies using a proprietary platform technology. These antibodies are designed to replicate performance of native disease state plasma, and are already used in FDA approved and CE marked platforms by top 10 IVD companies.

Logical Biological brings deep expertise in sourcing, processing and providing biological specimens and bulk disease state plasma, alongside custom plasma processing and protein purification capabilities through sister company Logical Antigen. The company is already supplying native disease state plasma and customized critical raw materials at scale to the largest QC calibrator and control manufacturers.

Disease state plasma is a key component for IVD calibrators and controls, assay development and quality control testing. However, human disease state materials can be difficult to reliably and consistently source. To solve this challenge, engineered materials are formulated with Bcell Design's patented human Fc monoclonal antibodies to mimic disease state plasma. This provides multiple benefits - including reproducibility and long-term supply sustainability - whilst maintaining high performance levels and offering benchmarking against native plasma samples.

The strategic partnership will focus on IgM and IgG engineered disease state material for challenging to source materials, including Rheumatoid Factor (RF). By the end of 2025, the companies expect to have well characterized products for ToRCH, infectious diseases and other conditions.

The diagnostics sector faces increasing challenges in securing reliable and sustainable sources of disease state materials. By joining forces with Logical Biological, we are combining complementary expertise in antibodies and plasma materials to deliver sustainable, high-performance diagnostic solutions in key therapeutic areas—supporting earlier and more accurate disease detection worldwide.”

Léone Atayi, Chief Executive Officer, Bcell Design

Stephane Argivier, Chief Executive Officer at Logical Biological, said: "This strategic partnership will unlock new opportunities and address sustainability for the diagnosticssector. By replicating critical plasma performance characteristics and providing comprehensive performance data, our engineered disease state materials aim to match native plasma performance whilst providing supply security and consistency in specific applications. Building on our bulk purification and disease state material expertise, we're excited to partner with Bcell Design to help our customers resolve today's challenges and bring tomorrow's innovation."

This unique end-to-end solution addresses the requirements of the largest users of native disease state materials, aiming to deliver engineered alternatives with long term supply sustainability and consistency at scale.

During a briefing session at the 62nd Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), officials presented a new technical tool to help countries in the Region of the Americas accelerate the elimination of more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions. These include vaccine-preventable diseases, neglected tropical and zoonotic diseases, sexually transmitted infections, vector-borne diseases, and others like cervical cancer and tuberculosis.

The Best Buys for Disease Elimination is a practical, evidence-based guide to the most effective actions for countries to implement in order to eliminate communicable diseases. The guide highlights the efficient use of resources and prioritizing populations in vulnerable situations.

The Region of the Americas is advancing steadily towards the elimination of communicable diseases. To achieve this, it is necessary to increase and sustain high vaccination coverage, engage communities to expand access to diagnosis and treatment, strengthen surveillance, and bring integrated services to marginalized communities, incarcerated populations, and those living in informal settlements."

Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, PAHO Director

For each disease and condition included in the Elimination Initiative, the Best Buys are presented as one-page documents with clear, accessible information. Each Best Buy summarizes expected impact goals, disease elimination targets, key operational indicators, and priority interventions that have proven to be cost-effective in different contexts.

For example, for malaria, the elimination target is defined as zero new indigenous cases of transmission for three consecutive years. To achieve this, efforts must focus on keeping test positivity rates below 5%, ensuring that more than 70% of cases are diagnosed and treated within the first 72 hours of symptom onset, and guaranteeing that over 80% of cases are investigated and classified in areas working towards malaria elimination or at risk of reestablishment.

The Best Buys include expanding access to rapid diagnostic tests and timely treatment at all levels of care, engaging communities in early detection, consolidating malaria-free territories through microplanning, distributing insecticide-treated nets at no cost, and strengthening surveillance to respond to imported cases. These actions aim to accelerate elimination and ensure that achievements are sustainable over time.

During the presentation at PAHO headquarters in Washington D.C., Suriname was recognized for having eliminated the transmission of malaria—a significant achievement and the first Amazonian country to reach this milestone. Delegates from Guyana, Paraguay, and Suriname shared concrete experiences in implementing the Best Buys—from integrated care for vulnerable populations to intersectoral partnerships—that are making a difference.

The Best Buys documents are part of PAHO's Disease Elimination Initiative and are designed to support decision-makers, program managers, technical teams, health workers, cooperation agencies, partners, and donors. Their purpose is also to strengthen strategic planning, the design and implementation of interventions, coordination, and efficient allocation of resources.

PAHO's Disease Elimination Initiative aims to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Region of the Americas by 2030. This effort, focused on improving the health and well-being of individuals and communities, builds on the legacy of countries in the Americas in eliminating diseases—from smallpox and polio to rubella and, in many countries, malaria and congenital transmission of HIV and syphilis, among others.

Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa met on Wednesday October 1 with members of the Council of the Americas' Healthcare Series leadership group and with health authorities from Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, and Panama to advocate for stronger cooperation in health financing and security.

During a high-level dinner at COA's Washington office on the margins of the 62nd PAHO Directing Council, Dr. Barbosa said that Latin America has a unique opportunity to place health at the heart of the regional agenda ahead of December's Summit of the Americas in the Dominican Republic.

Bringing together public health officials and private-sector leaders exemplifies the kind of partnership we need to address the complex challenges at the intersection of health and the economy in our region. We need sustained financing, innovation, and cross-sector partnerships to reach the most vulnerable and sustain progress.

Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, PAHO Director

During the meeting, Council of the Americas members expressed their interest in working with PAHO to strengthen health policies and contribute to the development of strategies that result in better health outcomes across the region. They also viewed this engagement as an opportunity to offer their support and expertise in advancing shared health goals across the hemisphere.

Dr. Barbosa outlined a range of priorities for advancing health across the Americas, with a particular focus on tackling noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). He emphasized that addressing conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer is not only a health imperative but also an economic one, as NCDs strain health systems, reduce labor force participation, and limit productivity.

He also underscored the importance of regional cooperation and economic growth, noting that when governments and the private sector align with PAHO's technical expertise, the results can be transformative—fostering sustainable markets, strengthening health security, and driving long-term prosperity. Participants agreed that health and the economy are deeply interconnected, with partnerships across sectors essential to building a healthier, more resilient region.

Today the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Andean Health Organization - Hipólito Unanue Agreement (ORAS-CONHU) extended the Memorandum of Understanding that consolidates their cooperation framework through 2029. This agreement reflects the shared commitment of both institutions to strengthen health systems and improve the well-being of populations in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela.

The signing took place during the 62nd PAHO Directing Council in Washington, D.C., with the participation of PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa and ORAS-CONHU Executive Secretary Dr. María del Carmen Calle Dávila.

"This act reflects the mutual trust and determination of our institutions to continue working in a coordinated manner for the health of the Andean peoples," said Dr. Barbosa during the signing ceremony. "Working together in the subregion is essential to advance equity and the well-being of our populations," he added.

The agreement provides that both organizations will continue identifying technical and financial projects and activities in priority areas. They will also jointly promote regional public health policies and deepen technical cooperation among the Andean countries.

The PAHO Director recognized ORAS-CONHU as a strategic partner for Andean integration in health, for the promotion of joint policies, and for cooperation on priority issues. He also thanked ORAS-CONHU for its participation and contributions in the development of the Subregional Cooperation Strategy for South America, which is currently in its final stage and will be a key instrument for guiding joint efforts in the coming years.

Created in 1971, ORAS-CONHU is the subregional health integration body of the Andean Community and coordinates the efforts of six member countries to build regional consensus and address common health challenges. Headquartered in Lima, Peru, the organization also includes nine observer countries: Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Spain, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic. 

Both institutions have also collaborated on South-South cooperation initiatives in areas such as childhood cancer, hematopoietic cell transplantation, reducing inequalities, and strengthening national capacities.

The extension of this memorandum will allow PAHO and ORAS-CONHU to continue their collaboration to address complex health challenges through joint work, to exchange best practices, and to promote more resilient and inclusive health systems in the Andean region.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) and the Government of Haiti signed the 2026-2028 Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS), the first cooperation framework of its kind between the two, reaffirming their shared commitment to strengthening Haiti's health system and improving health outcomes for all.

The agreement was signed by PAHO Director, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, and Haiti's Minister of Public Health and Population (MSPP), Dr. Bertrand Sinal, during a bilateral meeting at PAHO Headquarters in Washington, D.C., held on the sidelines of the 62nd Directing Council of PAHO.

This occasion marks an important milestone in our collaborative efforts to respond to Haiti's public health crisis and improve access to care amid complex humanitarian and security challenges. The new strategy will serve as a focused three-year framework to guide PAHO's technical cooperation in Haiti, aligned with national priorities and tailored to the country's evolving context and needs."

Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, PAHO Director

The Country Cooperation Strategy is a shared, medium-term framework that outlines areas where PAHO/WHO will work with Haiti to improve public health. It guides PAHO's work in the country and is aligned with Haiti's national health goals and global commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Haiti continues to face serious health challenges, humanitarian emergencies and structural vulnerabilities of its healthcare system. These underline the need for a stronger, more resilient health sector—one that can better serve people's needs and adapt in times of crisis.

The CCS 2026-2028 focuses on three strategic priorities to support MSPP's efforts:

The Country Cooperation Strategy also takes into account the unique needs of different parts of the country, based on local security, population movements, and availability of health services.

Its development was the result of a wide consultative process involving the Ministry of Health, civil society, and development partners. It reflects Haiti's health priorities and the need for inclusive, coordinated action to protect and promote health.

Through this new CCS, PAHO/WHO reaffirms its commitment to working closely with the Haitian government and its partners to confront major health challenges, ease the burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and strengthen the country's capacity to respond to emergencies. At its heart, the strategy aims to advance health equity, achieve universal health coverage, and improve the well-being of all people in Haiti.

A major new study reveals that both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs) are significantly associated with a higher risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).

The study, presented today at UEG Week 2025, followed 123,788 UK Biobank participants without liver disease at baseline. Beverage consumption was assessed using repeated 24-hour dietary questionnaires. Researchers examined the associations between SSB and LNSSB intake and the risks of developing MASLD, liver fat accumulation and liver-related mortality.

A higher intake of both LNSSBs and SSBs (>250g per day) was associated with a 60% (HR: 1.599) and 50% (HR: 1.469) elevated risk of developing MASLD, respectively. Over the median 10.3-year follow-up, 1,178 participants developed MASLD and 108 died from liver-related causes. While no significant association was observed for SSBs, LNSSB consumption was additionally linked to a higher risk of liver-related mortality. Both beverage types were also positively associated with higher liver fat content.

MASLD, formally known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a condition where fat accumulates in the liver, which overtime can cause inflammation (hepatitis) and symptoms such as pain, fatigue and loss of appetite. The disease has emerged as a global health burden since being recognised as the most common chronic liver disease, with experts estimating that it affects over 30% of people worldwide and is a rapidly increasing cause of liver-related deaths.

SSBs have long been under scrutiny, while their 'diet' alternatives are often seen as the healthier choice. Both, however, are widely consumed and their effects on liver health have not been well understood."

Lihe Liu, lead author of the study 

"Our study shows that LNSSBs were actually linked to a higher risk of MASLD, even at modest intake levels such as a single can per day. These findings challenge the common perception that these drinks are harmless and highlight the need to reconsider their role in diet and liver health, especially as MASLD emerges as a global health concern."

Liu noted the potential biological mechanisms that may underlie the observed risks, "The higher sugar content in SSBs can cause rapid spikes in blood glucose and insulin, promote weight gain and increase uric acid levels, all of which contribute to liver fat accumulation. LNSSBs, on the other hand, may affect liver health by altering the gut microbiome, disrupting the feeling of fullness, driving sweet cravings and even stimulating insulin secretion."

The authors emphasised that these findings support limiting both SSBs and LNSSBs as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy, targeting not only liver disease but also cardio-renal-metabolic health. Replacing either beverage with water significantly reduced MASLD risk – by 12.8% for SSBs and 15.2% for LNSSBs – while substitution between the two types of beverages offered no risk reduction.

Liu added, "The safest approach is to limit both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. Water remains the best choice as it removes the metabolic burden and prevents fat accumulation in the liver, whilst hydrating the body."

The researchers now aim to explore causal mechanisms more deeply through long-term, randomized and genetic trials with a focus on how sugar and its substitutes interact with the gut microbiome and influence liver disease.

The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has launched the ASPIRE trial-a large-scale, Phase III clinical study investigating whether adding chemotherapy to current standard treatments can extend survival for men living with advanced prostate cancer.

The ASPIRE trial (Alliance A032302) is enrolling 1,200 participants across the United States with metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC). The study seeks to determine whether the addition of docetaxel, a well-established chemotherapy drug, to hormone therapy and apalutamide-a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor that works to block testosterone growth-can improve overall survival in men newly diagnosed with mCSPC.

Prostate cancer remains one of the most common cancers among men with an estimated 1.5 million cases diagnosed worldwide. While hormone therapy has long been the cornerstone of treatment for metastatic disease, recent advances have introduced newer agents like apalutamide that target the androgen receptor more effectively. However, questions remain about whether combining these agents with chemotherapy can further improve outcomes.

ASPIRE is designed to answer a critical question in prostate cancer care. We want to know if intensifying treatment early-by adding the chemotherapy medication docetaxel-can help patients live longer and better."

Deepak Kilari, MD, principal investigator for the trial and associate professor in the division of hematology and oncology at Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin

Participants in the ASPIRE trial will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

The trial's primary endpoint is overall survival, but researchers are also evaluating secondary outcomes, including progression-free survival and quality of life. Importantly, the study includes genomic analysis to assess whether patients with mutations in TP53, PTEN or RB1-genes associated with more aggressive disease-derive greater benefit from the intensified treatment.

The ASPIRE trial is notable not only for its scale but also for its long-term follow-up. Patients will be monitored every six months for up to 10 years, allowing researchers to gather robust data on survival, disease progression and treatment-related side effects.

The inclusion of genetic profiling in the ASPIRE trial reflects a growing trend toward precision oncology, where treatments are tailored to the molecular characteristics of each patient's cancer. By identifying which subgroups benefit most from docetaxel, researchers hope to refine treatment strategies and avoid unnecessary toxicity in patients unlikely to benefit.

The ASPIRE study is being conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) through the National Clinical Trials Network.

USMNT defender Alex Freeman faced Texas Longhorns defensive tackle Hero Kanu in a lighthearted cross-sport juggling challenge at the University of Texas athletic complex. The showdown highlighted the surprising footwork of the German-born football player against the refined technique of the rising American soccer prospect.

Soccer will once again take over one of the most iconic places in New York City this weekend. On Saturday, October 11, Borussia Dortmund and Street Soccer USA―in partnership with NYC's Department of Youth & Community Development―will team up for the thirteenth edition of the Times Square Cup, making it the fourth straight year with the German side's presence in the event.

The tournament, featuring more than 300 kids (ages 4-18) as well as adult and corporate teams, will set up 4v4 matches from morning to night (10am–10pm) as Duffy Square transforms into a pop-up soccer stadium.

This event—free and open to the public—is a reflection of Borussia Dortmund's increasing connection with the U.S. market. Their collaboration with Street Soccer USA, a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting poverty and strengthening community through soccer, enables the club not only to boost its visibility but also to give back to the community.

“We take a lot of pride in having that opportunity to give back to the kids, and to show the world that we are working with the communities,” says Marc Lingenhoff, Managing Director of BVB Americas, in an exclusive interview with Bolavip.

Borussia Dortmund's emblematic Black and Yellow colors taking center stage at Times Square for the fourth consecutive year speaks volumes of the club's impact within the U.S., where it now has a New York City office.

“We saw a lot of demand from fans, from partners to be more present here, and service our fans and our partners. And since 2017/2018, we consistently increased our footprint. Now you can register as an official fan club. We have over 47 now in the United States. Youth academies. You want to wear that black-yellow jersey and learn how to play soccer? We have over 6,000 boys and girls in our academy system, with roughly 122 academies,” Lingenhoff explains.

That rise in popularity could be explained by American star Christian Pulisic, who gave soccer fans in the U.S. a reason to keep an eye on Dortmund from 2016 to 2019. But even after “Captain America” left, the Black and Yellow managed to maintain a loyal fanbase.

While the eventual presence of another American gem in Giovanni Reyna may have kept many fans close, the team's success on the field played an instrumental role. The 2025-26 season marks the 10th consecutive year with Dortmund playing in the Champions League, where they finished as runners-up in 2024.

According to Lingenhoff, having that exposure has been a strong factor: “That, I think, contributed to our awareness of the club and having such a big fan base here, is that we are consistently seen on European biggest stage.”

Even though Pulisic and Reyna may have given Dortmund an edge over other Bundesliga or European clubs without American players, the interest in the Bundesliga giants has transcended nationality. The likes of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham, just to name a few of the most recent stars to don the Black and Yellow kit, have made Dortmund a relevant team to watch for soccer fans around the world.

“I would love to have more American players on the team, and to be able to, you know, use that and draw attention, but it really is an international team, an international fan base that we have,” Lingenhoff adds.

But the interest in Borussia Dortmund isn't just related to active players. Fans in the U.S. still admire legendary goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who established himself as a team icon during his 16-year stint at the club.

“Dortmund is also known for players just like Roman, who are very loyal to the club. He lives in Dortmund, he stayed there, he's a club ambassador who gives everything… he's a great, authentic guy representing the values of the club,” Lingenhoff says of the 2014 World Cup winner.

Weidenfeller will be a high-profile presence at the Times Square Cup, where he once again will receive the affection from a Dortmund fan base that only seems to grow in the U.S.

A few months back, the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 also allowed Borussia Dortmund to continue making a name for themselves in American territory. The team made it all the way to the quarterfinals, falling to Real Madrid in an eventful game at MetLife Stadium, just a few miles from NYC.

“To sum it up, we look back at the Club World Cup, as being a very successful event for us,” Lingenhoff tells Bolavip. “You could say we are among the top eight clubs in the world… that's nice. I'll take that. We played well against Real Madrid in the last game, with drama at the end, but drama is part of who we are as a club.

“But overall, we were very happy with how we were able to engage with current fans, but also attract new fans in those cities where we were present: Atlanta, New York, Cincinnati. In each city, we committed to one spot, and we invited everybody in. Everybody. Even the opponent fans. We were just like, ‘Hey, we are here to embrace soccer, we're in town, we're celebrating the BVB way.'

“And the response we got was phenomenal. The bars were full, and not just with black and yellow jerseys, everybody was in… people were interested. And in those great soccer markets, there is already a soccer fan base. And we saw a lot of growth. So we were very happy with how things worked for us during the Club World Cup.”

Borussia Dortmund are certainly building on that momentum, once again taking over Times Square with an event that bridges the gap with fans overseas by giving back to a community that seems seriously connected with the club.

Ivan Rakitic has revealed the "biggest regret of his career" is the decision to pass up the chance to team up with Cristiano Ronaldo at Juventus. The former Croatian midfielder, who enjoyed successful spells with Sevilla and Barcelona during the era when the Portuguese icon was starring for Real Madrid, says Ronaldo personally called him in 2019 in an attempt to lure him to Italy – an offer he ultimately had to decline.

Final call rests on qualifying and may be shaped by draw

John Stones reveals he considered retiring when injured

England want to face South American and Asian opposition as part of their World Cup preparations, and have discussed hosting friendlies against Uruguay and Japan in March.

Thomas Tuchel's side are closing in on qualification for the finals tournament next summer and plans are being put in place for warmup games. Talks over potential opponents for the March international break have taken place, although it is understood the Football Association is yet to make a final decision. The FA is waiting for England to secure their spot at the 2026 World Cup before finalising bookings and may also look at how the draw for the tournament plays out in December.

However, it is understood there is a big possibility of Wembley friendlies against Uruguay and Japan, both of whom have qualified for the World Cup. England have mostly faced European opposition since Tuchel took charge at the start of this year and there is a need to test themselves against different styles before the World Cup. They faced African opposition when defeated by Senegal in a friendly in June.

England last played a South American team when they lost a home friendly against Brazil in March 2024. They have not faced a side from the Asian Football Confederation since beating Iran at the 2022 World Cup.

Another consideration for the FA during the buildup to the World Cup will be making sure England are ready for potentially scorching conditions in Canada, Mexico and the US. The likelihood is that the squad will head to Miami in early June for a pre-tournament training camp and to play two friendlies in an attempt to adapt to the heat. Tuchel travelled to the US to assess conditions at the Club World Cup last summer and was left under no illusions about the challenges posed by the weather.

England play Latvia in a qualifier in Riga on Tuesday after a friendly against Wales at Wembley on Thursday. An England victory in Latvia would secure a World Cup place with two games to spare, if Serbia fail to win at home against Albania on Saturday.

England's John Stones has said he considered retiring while struggling with foot and hamstring injuries last season that restricted him to 24 appearances – none after mid-February. “Last season was tough for me, to the point where I thought about stopping,” the Manchester City defender told BBC Radio 5 Live.

“I didn't want to do it. I had had enough of being so professional and trying to do everything right in my power, to then keep breaking down and not having the answers. It was a very difficult place to be in … my emotions were high. I wasn't thinking straight. I don't think deep down I would have ever done it.”

The October 2025 FIFA international break is shaping up to be one of the most decisive of the qualifying campaign. Several national teams across Africa, Europe, Asia, and Concacaf are on the verge of securing their tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted by Mexico, the United States, and Canada.

This is the penultimate international window before the qualifiers conclude — a moment that could define the road to North America.

So far, 19 teams have officially booked their place at the 2026 World Cup:



Host nations: Mexico, United States, Canada
AFC (Asia): Japan, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Iran, Australia
CONMEBOL (South America): Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay
CAF (Africa): Morocco, Tunisia
OFC (Oceania): New Zealand




Which African Teams Could Secure Qualification?


Several African nations are just one result away from clinching their World Cup berth during this window:



Algeria will qualify if they win away to Somalia, or if they draw and both Uganda and Mozambique fail to win.
Cape Verde will qualify with a victory over Libya, or with a draw if Cameroon don't beat Mauritius.
Ivory Coast will book their ticket if they beat Seychelles and Gabon lose to Gambia.
Egypt qualify if they defeat Djibouti and Burkina Faso fail to win in Sierra Leone.
Ghana secure their spot if they beat the Central African Republic and Madagascar don't defeat Comoros.
Senegal will qualify with a win over South Sudan if DR Congo fail to beat Togo.




Which European Nations Are Close to Qualification?


In Europe, the qualifying picture is tightening, with several big names and dark horses nearing confirmation:



Croatia will qualify if they beat both Czech Republic and Gibraltar, provided the Czechs don't defeat the Faroe Islands.
France can book their spot with wins over Azerbaijan and Ireland, as long as Iceland draw with Ukraine.
Slovakia will qualify if they win against Northern Ireland and Luxembourg, while Germany fail to win both of their matches.
Switzerland will clinch a place if they defeat Sweden and Slovenia, and Kosovo fail to win against either of those teams.
England qualify if they beat Latvia and Serbia fail to win their matches against Albania and Andorra.
Norway, Portugal, and Spain also remain in contention, but must win both of their matches and rely on results elsewhere.





Which Teams Could Qualify From Concacaf and Asia?



Concacaf


The path is narrower in North and Central America, but a couple of teams could seal early qualification:



Honduras will qualify if they defeat Costa Rica and Haiti, provided those two sides draw in their head-to-head meeting.
Jamaica qualify with victories over Curaçao and Bermuda, as long as Trinidad and Tobago fail to win against those same opponents.




Asia


In AFC's fourth round, two direct spots are available in each group — with six nations still fighting:



Group A: Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman battle for two direct tickets.
Group B: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Indonesia are locked in a similar race.



The third-place finishers in each group will advance to an intercontinental playoff, keeping their World Cup hopes alive.

GOAL ranks the top three soccer players produced by every state in the South, including Dempsey, Richards and Graham Zusi

Welcome to the South. American soccer, traditionally, has been concentrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic states, the Pacific Northwest and California. But there are some ballers from down south, too. Texas, in particular, has delivered top-level talent, with Clint Dempsey, Stu Holden and Omar Gonzalez - all seminal figures in the American game - coming from of the Lone Star State.

The South has contributed plenty. Florida, Alabama, Virginia and Maryland - if we're being a little generous geographically - have all had their part to play in the story of American soccer. And what they perhaps lack in number, they more than make up for with a little bit of southern grit. As Dempsey once said: "You don't know where I'm from, dawg."

Some regions in the U.S. have deeper player pools than others, so who is the best of the best? Which state has been the most fertile ground for developing American soccer talent?

GOAL ranks the top three men's soccer players from each of the 50 states. Next up, the South. Previous: Northeast

Borussia Dortmund are keen to ensure that Nico Schlotterbeck signs a new long-term deal with them as they see the centre-back as their "future captain". However, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus has urged his former club and Dortmund's rivals Bayern Munich to make a move for the German international, stating that he will form a great centre-back partnership with Jonathan Tah.

Next year is World Cup year, and excitement is building as the draw for the group stage draws nearer.

Jointly hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada, it is the first time that the tournament will be hosted by three countries.

It is also the first year of the new format, where 48 teams replace the old 32. That means that there will now be 12 groups of four, rather than the standard eight.

Initially, the idea was to have 16 groups of three, but FIFA changed tack and returned to the four-team group format.

The Americas' 2026 bid defeated Morocco's to host the competition, and Mexico become the first nation to have hosted the World Cup three times, following 1970 and 1986.

Argentina are the reigning world champions after their dramatic penalty win over France in Doha, Qatar back in 2022, as Lionel Messi lifted the sport's top team honour for the very first time.

The draw will take place in Washington, DC, on Friday, December 5 2025. It will kick off at 5pm BST from the Kennedy Center.

Live stream: The draw will be broadcast live on FIFA's official YouTube channel.

Live blog: You can follow all the updates with Standard Sport's live blog!

The US, Canada, and Mexico automatically qualify as hosts. Mexico play the opening game of the tournament in Mexico City, and will be placed in Group A. Canada then open their campaign in Toronto and will be in Group B, while the USMNT are in Group D.

From Asia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, and Australia have all booked their places, while Jordan and Uzbekistan will make their World Cup debuts.

New Zealand have come through the Oceania qualifiers to earn their spot in the group stages.

Argentina, Ecuador, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and Paraguay are the current South American qualifiers, while Morocco and Tunisia are the African sides that are already sure of their places.

The European qualifying campaigns started much later than the other confederations, and as such, they are some way behind.

However, England will qualify for next year's tournament with victory over Latvia should Serbia drop points against either Albania or Andorra.

Thomas Tuchel's side are five wins from five in Group K, having not conceded a goal.

Norway hold a near-unassaiable six-point lead over Italy, with their goal difference 16 healthier than their counterparts after a huge 11-1 win over Moldova.

Erling Haaland, Martin Odegaard and co. are also five wins from five, and are waiting on the Azzurri to play their game in hand before their qualification is confirmed.

Wales are in with a chance of either automatic or play-off qualification in Group J, lying in third place behind North Macedonia on 11 points, and tied with Belgium on 10.

The home nation's goal difference is what is letting them down, however, although that group will go down to the final matchday.

The Netherlands, Austria, and Croatia are all also closing in on automatic qualification.

The next FIFA World Cup doesn't start until 2026, but you can already buy the official soccer ball on Fanatics. 

The Adidas Trionda Pro Ball will be used by the players during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and now you can too. The ball sells for $169.99 on Fanatics, but it's for good reason. 

The red (Canada), green (Mexico) and blue (United States) colors represent the three host countries. On top of the Adidas and Trionda logos, the ball also has the 2026 FIFA World Cup logo. The design helps for a flashy look, but the ball's best features go far beyond what you can see. 

The ball passed FIFA tests for many important criteria. Its texture is designed to retain less water in wet or rainy conditions, while also having strong shape retention over time and usage. The design also allows for the most precise and predictable ball flights, making for the best possible performance. 

If the certified FIFA World Cup ball is too pricey, there's plenty of alternatives in the Fanatics shop. The Adidas 2026 FIFA World Cup Competition Soccer Ball looks identical, but sells for $64.99. If you don't care as much about the precise quality of the pro-level ball, then this ball is the perfect compromise. 

There's also the World Cup mini and mini+ soccer balls, which are perfect for little ones or for using around the house. They're sizes 1 and 2, compared to the regulation size 5 ball that is normally used in professional soccer. The mini sells for $14.99, the mini+ is available for $21.99. 

There's also a black Trionda ball T-shirt, which is available for $34.99. The shirt is available in sizes from S to 3XL, and is one of the many World Cup shirts that Fanatics has in-stock.

Response to strained schedule has been more football than ever, and a danger that the best will have nothing left to give at the World Cup

Cole Palmer and Ousmane Dembélé looked great when they were photographed sitting on Top of the Rock on the eve of the Club World Cup final but it is not being wise after the event to suggest that both might have been better off spending their summer lying on sunbeds.

Top players struggling with fitness issues was foreseeable before the first edition of Fifa's expanded tournament took place. “The worst idea ever,” was Jürgen Klopp's take, citing concerns over the long-term impact of squeezing even more football into an ever expanding calendar. “Last year it was the Copa [América] and the European Championship, this year it's the Club World Cup, next year it's the World Cup. That means no recovery for the players involved.”

It was not the wildest of predictions. The schedule was already under strain because of fixture congestion caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 World Cup taking place in winter and the Champions League increasing in size. Fifpro, the global players' union, has repeatedly warned about rising injuries and player burnout. The response, though, has been more football than ever. The authorities do not take players and managers seriously. The danger is that the best have nothing left in the tank when the World Cup – expanded to 48 teams for the first time, remember – takes place in Canada, Mexico and the US next year.

Palmer is the obvious example. The 23-year-old was the inspiration for Chelsea at the Club World Cup, destroying Dembélé's Paris Saint-Germain in the final, but he has barely been seen this season. The suspicion is that Palmer has played too much. He has been troubled by a groin injury for a year and although there is yet to be any indication that the forward requires surgery it is hard not to feel that he is, as Arsène Wenger used to say of Jack Wilshere, in the red zone.

That should be cause for alarm. A Chelsea or England game without Palmer is a diminished experience. He is an outrageous talent but everyone has physical limits. It is absurd that Palmer has gone three consecutive summers without a proper rest. He helped England Under-21s to win the European championship in 2023, was prominent when the senior side reached the Euro 2024 final and was still turning out for Chelsea until the middle of July last season.

When is it too much? Palmer played 57 games for club and country in the 2023-24 season, his first full year as an established international and Premier League player. He skipped the league phase of the Conference League last season but was involved in the knockouts and was man of the match when Chelsea beat Real Betis in the final at the end of May. The PSG game was Palmer's 55th of the season. He had also represented England in their World Cup qualifier against Andorra at the start of June.

So don't be surprised that Palmer has missed a host of games this season. His is a longstanding problem but it surely could have been dealt with if he had been allowed a holiday last summer. This is not a controversial point. There was no special treatment for Chelsea, who had a compressed, two-week pre-season. The PSG game was on 13 July and Palmer started when a weary, undercooked Chelsea opened the campaign by drawing 0-0 with Crystal Palace on 17 August.

Enzo Maresca was at a loss to predict how the extra workload and lack of preparation time would affect his players. By now, though, it is clear that Chelsea are struggling. Levi Colwill tore an anterior cruciate ligament on the first day of pre-season. Liam Delap ripped a hamstring against Fulham, Dário Essugo has had surgery on a thigh injury. Tosin Adarabioyo and Andrey Santos are injured. Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández and João Pedro are playing through the pain barrier.

Fifpro's annual player workload monitoring report concluded that players who competed in the Club World Cup after completing a domestic league campaign were among hundreds at the top of the men's game who did not have adequate pre-seasons, hurting performance levels and increasing the risk of injury. Last week Maresca said in relation to the volume of injuries at Chelsea and PSG: “Probably it's some consequences from the Club World Cup.”

Will anyone listen? Arsenal's Noni Madueke, who left Chelsea after the Club World Cup semi-final, is out for two months with a knee injury. PSG were without Marquinhos, Kvara Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué and Dembélé when they beat Barcelona last week. João Neves and Fabián Ruiz have also had injury issues. PSG were back in action in the Uefa Super Cup on 13 August. The show goes on.

Also not on the stage at the moment, though, are Real Madrid's Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jude Bellingham. Alexander-Arnold came off a draining title-winning season with Liverpool, signed for Madrid, featured in their run to the last four of the Club World Cup and is out with a torn hamstring. Thomas Tuchel was saying in May that Bellingham should have had surgery on a shoulder injury. The procedure was put off, though, with the demands of the schedule leading another young player to grit his teeth and keep going.

Why deny it? Some people have noticed that players not involved in the Club World Cup have also had injuries. This is not an adequate defence for the Club World Cup. Players will get injured. Injuries and fatigue have been on the rise. It still feels inadequate when authorities are shoving in more games, in essence jeopardising the product they wish to sell. The football, remember, is not better if the best players are missing or exhausted.

And yes, Igor Jesus played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup and has since looked promising for Nottingham Forest. Yet Botafogo had not played a full season before entering the tournament and went out in the last 16. They were done at the end of June. There is an obvious difference with Chelsea. Igor Jesus was not playing in as intense a league. The striker had not just come off a deep run in the Champions League. Chelsea are even at a disadvantage to PSG, who are by far the richest club in France and are not placed under as much pressure in domestic games.

There is a reason why Tuchel tipped Arsenal and Liverpool to have an advantage over Chelsea and Manchester City this season. City have not appeared to be suffering, perhaps because they went out of the Club World Cup in the last 16, but Chelsea look mentally and physically drained. They are a warning to others. The question is whether Fifa cares.

World Cup

For Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. men's national team, the most compelling viewing has more often been found in intergenerational warfare off the pitch rather than the performances produced by his team on the field.

The current set of players are charged with leading their country into a home World Cup next summer, but previous generations, appearing on television and podcasts, have been unimpressed by the team's under-performance at Copa América, in the Nations League and subsequent exhibition matches, while also being frustrated by big names choosing not to play at this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Past heroes have not been shy in making their feelings known.

The exchanges have included headline-making ripostes from Christian Pulisic and his entourage. More recently, Tim Weah accused the former pros of chasing checks and even going so far as saying their behavior has been “evil.”  The chorus of ex-pros includes figures such as Clint Dempsey and Alexi Lalas, as well as Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the latter of whom co-host the “Unfiltered Soccer” podcast.

Howard, formerly of Manchester United and Everton, is the most-capped goalkeeper in USMNT history, making 121 international appearances and he was selected for three World Cups between 2006 and 2014. As well as his podcast with Donovan, he is also an analyst on NBC's Premier League coverage.

Has the back-and-forth over the past year made him more conscious of the sensitivities that current players feel?

“I was always conscious of it,” he tells The Athletic. “I'm more conscious of it based on the reaction, that is normal. But I'm a public-facing figure. When I get asked a question, I try and give a thought, but I never say something for reaction.

“I promise you: I don't need the attention of trying to get a reaction. What I say oftentimes gets a reaction, but I don't say it for that. If I get asked a singular question, I answer it based on how I feel, and there's a lot of truth in what I say. No one likes to be criticized. When I was criticized as a player, whoever was criticizing me, I wished I saw them walking down the street…so I (could) tell him exactly what I thought of him. So I get it, players are sensitive.

“I was fragile as a player. It's part of it. It doesn't change the way I think. Inside of U.S. Soccer, there was this idea that you have to believe in this team, that you have to be one of us — I've always been one of them — but the core principle is that the team needs to give us reasons to believe. It needs to give America reasons to believe. That's just how it works. It's not just this blind belief in a team. There is professional integrity (as an analyst). If the team's playing like crap and I know what's going on, I can't just not say it.”

Howard says he saw improvement in the USMNT's last performance, a 2-0 win over Japan, but plenty is still to be resolved ahead of the World Cup. The countdown is now on, and Howard was talking to The Athletic after attending the opening of a soccer park in East Harlem in New York City, which had been jointly created by FIFA sponsors Visa and Bank of America, as well as Street Soccer USA, to provide community spaces for young people to play ahead of the World Cup.

As for USMNT's anxieties ahead of that tournament, the obvious place to start is the goalkeeper.

During Mauricio Pochettino's 15 games in charge, he has given a starting slot to four goalkeepers, all of whom are currently playing in MLS. Matt Freese, uncapped before the pre-Gold Cup friendlies this past summer, has started nine of those, including the past eight in succession. Matt Turner has started three, while Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte have started one apiece.

Whom would Howard choose as his starter at the World Cup? “It is such a hard question. Based on what we are seeing, I think Matt Freese going to be in goal. I think Matt Turner will get an opportunity (at some point prior). But here is a separate question: If you ask me who do I think will be in goal and here's a bag full of money betting on it – not based on (my) own beliefs – I think it'll be Freese.”

But should it be Freese? “I just worry – I've been on record saying I love watching him. I love watching him develop and he is a great kid. I just find it very difficult, having played at that level and seen a lot, that your starting goalkeeper at the World Cup is going to have maybe 13 international games (by the World Cup) and of those 13 international games, he's going to have had five really hard ones. Probably less than that. They're gonna get to the World Cup and if you're expected to get out of the group (and progress), you're going to get maybe five of the hardest games ever played. That's a very difficult proposition.”

Turner, with 52 caps, would appear to be the biggest rival to Freese. “I've always said I think Zack Steffen is the most talented one in the pool based on a bunch of different factors,” Howard counters. “But he wasn't able to be fit in the summer and then he hasn't really been selected recently. So that's a bummer for him. Matt Freese is harder to read because he's very steady. We haven't seen a lot of him at this level. He's making I would say the saves he's supposed to make. Matt Turner has been in bigger moments. He's made bigger saves. He's slightly more commanding. But again, I think that's probably doing Freese a disservice because we just hadn't seen enough of him at that level.”

The U.S. having goalkeeping issues is a change from previous decades when the national team was spoiled for choice by options including Howard, Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller.

“We have the talent,” Howard insists. “But among the goalkeeper coaches – the quality has gone down. I know great goalkeeper coaches. I know crap goalkeeper coaches. The quality overall has gone down. Kids aren't getting enough touches on the ball, because the game has evolved and every goalkeeper needs to play like Ederson played at Man City. I even see it in the Premier League; there's goalkeepers who are brought into clubs because they are supposed to be really good at playing out of the back. They couldn't save a penny. They've lost that art. A lot of these kids have grown up and they're just not getting the reps and the coaches aren't giving them the reps or teaching them. They're spending hours on footwork as opposed to actually saving the ball. Both are very important.”

If Howard remains uncertain about the goalkeepers, he offers greater clarity when weighing up who he believes should captain the team at the tournament. Tyler Adams captained his country during the World Cup in Qatar, but veteran defender Tim Ream has taken the armband for much of Pochettino's tenure, including during the Gold Cup.

“Tyler Adams for me is out and out the captain. Tim Ream is the most experienced, he (acts) like a captain in every sense of the word. Christian Pulisic is the best player. I think we've seen down the years that giving the captaincy to your best player doesn't make them perform better or inspire the team. The team is inspired by its heartbeat. And its heartbeat is Tyler Adams, point-blank.”

Howard says that Ream, who was frozen out of the setup until breaking back in ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, is key to the squad's culture.

“Tim Ream is a perfect example of U.S. Soccer's shortcomings since we failed to qualify for the (2018) World Cup. U.S. Soccer did a media campaign to say go and forget about that and focus on the next generation, because that (failure to qualify) was a black stain on U.S. Soccer. They didn't retain Jozy Altidore or Michael Bradley. They didn't bring older players in to say, ‘Look, you're not gonna be a part of this full cycle, but get us through the next 12-24 months. Help guide these kids.'

“So all these kids now who are 25 or 26 years old, they were given the reins and the keys to the car at 18. At that stage, they have no idea, they're learning, but they weren't given any (guidance). I learned from Kasey Keller, Brian McBride and Claudio Reyna. When Claudio Reyna was our captain, he did some amazing things and he did some things where he said, ‘I hold my hands up, my bad.' And I was like, ‘Oh, OK. That's how a player is supposed to act.'

“You need the likes of Tim Ream to be the grandfather in the group and just go, ‘Hey, everything's going to be OK.' We saw the impact of that at Gold Cup for sure – 100 percent. That team was together. It was committed. They were tough and it was a hard-fought loss against Mexico in the final. Tim was a big part of that group.”

Ahead of the next round of exhibition games this month against Ecuador and Australia, Howard was uplifted by USMNT's win in their last game against Japan.

“In the second game, we got some really good performances and that's all that really matters. There's so much around this team. There is only so much fluff and so much that can be talked about. It's really just about the performances.”

According to a recent report from Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona will be sending scouts to the U-20 World Cup in Chile to monitor the next generation of football stars.

The tournament, taking place from September 27th to October 19th, is a major showcase for young talent, and Barça are making sure they leave no stone unturned.

As such, the club has assigned scouts to follow key matches and watch some of the standout players closely.

Among the young talents drawing attention is Pedrinho, a Brazilian left winger currently playing for Corinthians, who is known for his exquisite technique.

From La Liga, Vladyslav Krapyvstov, the Girona goalkeeper, will be in the spotlight for his potential to develop into a top-level shot-stopper.

Other players on Barcelona's radar could be Pablo Garcia, an 18-year-old attacking talent from Real Betis who has already made his first-division debut, and Iker Bravo, a strong and powerful striker from Udinese.

Mexico's Gilberto Mora, an attacking midfielder, is also attracting interest from Barcelona.

Recent reports suggest that Barça are keenly tracking Mora's development, joining other major European clubs already interested in him.

At just 16, Mora has been on the radar of Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Ajax, while clubs like Arsenal, Manchester City, and even Lionel Messi's Inter Miami from MLS are also watching his progress.

Barcelona's focus on these young talents shows a clear commitment to identifying and nurturing the stars of tomorrow.

Meanwhile, the U-20 World Cup is expected to be a stage where young prospects make their mark, and Barcelona's presence ensures they will have firsthand insights into who might be ready for the next step in their careers.

FIFA is employing an alternative review system that allows coaches to appeal two referee's decisions per match at the Under-20 soccer World Cup in Chile

SANTIAGO, Chile -- SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — FIFA is employing an alternative review system that allows coaches to appeal two referee's decisions per match at the Under-20 soccer World Cup in Chile

The football video support (FVS) is a “simplified version” of VAR and has transformed the youth tournament into a testing ground for new technologies. 

Cards that vary between blue and purple are held by coaches, who are in charge of requesting reviews.

During the group stage, its use has proven crucial, defining the course of several matches played in the cities of Santiago, Valparaíso, Rancagua and Talca. The system was deployed in more than a dozen matches in the early part of the tournament.

FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. He challenged a penalty, but the request was ultimately ruled out by the referee.

Since then, the review system has had a role in several matches. Of the 12 games in the first round of the group stage, the “light VAR” was used in seven. 

It proved decisive in Norway's 1-0 victory over Nigeria after a review of a handball by Nigeria defender Ahmed Akinyele, which American referee Joe Dickerson had ignored.

FVS also disallowed a goal in Argentina's 4-1 win against Australia — the review denying a tying goal for the Socceroos. 

Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso González being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.

Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.

According to world soccer's ruling body FIFA, the FVS system aims to “democratize football by introducing video review technology as a complementary option,” not only for top-level competitions but also for those that “could not afford VAR infrastructure,” thanks to its low cost and simplified operation.

Coaches can only appeal in four specific situations: whether or not there was a goal; whether or not there was a penalty, over a direct red card, or in case of suspicion that a card was not shown to the correct offender.

The system had already been tested by FIFA in other competitions, such as the 2024 Youth Championship/Blue Stars in Switzerland and the 2025 Under-20 Women's World Cup in Colombia, and it is expected to be expanded to other youth categories.

Some have praised the system, but others have expressed reluctance.

“It's a good tool to avoid constantly stopping the game,” said Chile coach Nicolás Córdova after a 2-0 loss against Japan.

Some fans, however, have criticized the long waiting periods until a decision is made.

“In a game like this, we had 10 extra minutes because they stopped the whole time to review things that clearly hadn't happened,” Brazilian fan Tiago Dias said after his country lost 2-1 against Morocco.

Some coaches, such as Morocco's Mohamed Ouahbi, said they would make extensive use of the tool, regardless of whether there was a violation or not.

“I'm going to use the card because the option is there. We have two cards and we have to use them," Ouahbi said.

Mercedes-Benz Stadium has been one of the most prominent venues in the United States over the past decade. Since its opening in 2017, the stadium has hosted a string of massive events, from Super Bowls to international soccer matches. Now, it is set to take on another global stage as one of the venues for the 2026 World Cup.

After hosting six matches at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the home of the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, Atlanta Drive GC, and PGA TOUR Superstore will stage eight World Cup games in 2026. Located in the heart of downtown Atlanta, the venue is expected to drive a major wave of tourism as fans pour into the city for the tournament.

World Soccer Talk spoke with AMB Sports and Entertainment Chief Operating Officer Dietmar Exler, the former Mercedes-Benz USA CEO. Ahead of the 2026 World Cup, he discussed the lessons learned from the Club World Cup and why Mercedes-Benz Stadium could serve as inspiration for PSG's new home.

Even beyond the Club World Cup, operations never slow down. Mercedes-Benz Stadium currently hosts 55 to 60 public events each year, ranging from international soccer to NFL preseason games and concerts in between. And according to Exler, every single event is treated with the same importance.

“The most important event for us is always the next event. Whoever is the promoter, even if it's a relatively small event in the international scale, for that promoter is a huge event. We always as a stadium have to give that promoter and everybody our full, undivided attention. Some events are bigger than others, there's no doubt about that. And there's also the big events where the entire city is involved, not only the stadium, but its entire infrastructure, but every event is majorly important.”

Mercedes-Benz Stadium's preparation for 2026 has been shaped by its role in hosting major international soccer events, including the Club World Cup and Copa América. Those experiences, along with friendlies featuring national teams, have provided valuable opportunities to work with governing bodies.

“We had a few different things, but for us, this was the ideal setup. We had Mexico national team to play here, we also had last year the USWNT, so we had international soccer matches. The Club World Cup 6 matches and in the FIFA 2026 World Cup will be 8 matches, that allows us to work with CONMEBOL, with CONCACAF, with FIFA, and to really get to know each other.”

Exler stressed that collaborating with confederations ahead of time has been crucial for ironing out logistics and creating a better experience for both fans and players.

“The last Copa was the first time to really work closely with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, with FIFA observing in the background. But for the opening they were all here, so it was a process to get to know each other. If you come to the stadium for the first time, you might have ideas but it won't flow as much, so the Copa made it much easier for the CWC because we already knew each other a bit, and the partners knew the stadium.

“From Copa to CWC we did change some things: Media checking, we addressed it; operational behind-the-curtain topics, and then on the CWC, we just finished a meeting with FIFA last week, longer discussions about what worked, what didn't work, what should be adjusted for 2026. To have this row of Copa, CWC, and World Cup to get to know each other makes it much easier.”

Artificial turf has long been a complaint among soccer players, particularly in NFL stadiums. With the 2026 World Cup in mind, Mercedes-Benz Stadium introduced natural grass for the Club World Cup — a move Exler said was met with strong approval: “We installed natural grass for the first time at the Club World Cup. It went really well. We got excellent feedback from teams and from FIFA, and we're going to build on that.”

The grass for 2026 will be laid in February of that year ahead of the MLS season. Thanks to the stadium's retractable roof, the surface can be maintained sustainably despite Atlanta's climate. “It was a huge confidence boost to see it work in our environment,” Exler said. “We can grow grass here even if the roof is open.”

The 2024 Copa América final was marred by chaos at Hard Rock Stadium, where fans broke through barriers, delaying the match by 82 minutes and creating dangerous overcrowding. Determined to avoid a repeat, Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Atlanta authorities have been preparing thoroughly.

Exler highlighted the contrast between American football and international soccer, and the steps his team has taken: “In American football you can go to every game with your wife and children and pretty much sit in every part of the stadium, we don't have to separate fans, they might say things to each other, but there's really no violence.

“Since we're not used to that type of violence in American football, we've already started a year and a half ago with our security team to go all the way to Germany and spend three days with the German authorities, went to two or three different venues, not to view the match, but to work with the police and the stadium securities.

“Last year we went to Manchester United, to England, where fans, for a soccer match, have to be 100% separated. This is a foreign concept for most of American stadiums, but there we saw the security work, and when I say we, it's not only the security from the stadium, but also the Atlanta police department.”

Mercedes-Benz Stadium also enforces a strict anti-fireworks protocol, confiscating items at entry or ejecting fans who sneak them in. The policy has been effective, and organizers have been working with FIFA and fan groups to coordinate safe arrival routes to the venue alongside law enforcement, another method to be implemented in 2026.

One of the highlights of the Club World Cup was the quarterfinal between PSG and Bayern Munich, which Exler described as smooth from an operational standpoint. With PSG planning to leave Parc des Princes for a new stadium, Atlanta's venue has served as a model.

“I ended talking a lot with the business director of Paris Saint-Germain, they played here twice, and they wanted a private tour of the stadium. After the first time here, they called me and said, ‘We're building a new stadium for PSG, we're taking a look at other stadiums, I would like to walk through the whole stadium, show we what you think it works really well, but also what you'd not do again.' As we have done the same between MLS stadiums and clubs, why we shouldn't with PSG.

“They said ‘we're extremely grateful, we were worried about how does it work out because we weren't here ever,' and the feedback was quite well. They also asked me for a visit to the Atlanta Falcons locker room, so I gave them a tour: Family areas, medical areas, what kind of equipment is used. It works really well, the grass was great, and that they could see a difference from a great stadium in Europe. The air conditioning in the stadium has also helped us to protect the fans from the heat, so the feedback was great.”

Valentin Vacherot was on the verge of tears on Tuesday when he advanced to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final at the Rolex Shanghai Masters.



The first Monegasque player to reach a tour-level quarter-final in history, the qualifier Vacherot ousted Tallon Griekspoor 4-6, 7-6(1), 6-4 after a topsy-turvy, two-hour, 22-minute battle that ended 10 minutes shy of 1 a.m. 



“It means everything,” said Vacherot in disbelief. “I don't think I could really realise what I was doing this whole week and it kind of all hit me when I just won this match. I was just happy this whole week, but not through the roof and this one is unbelievable. 



“So much emotion just thinking of the tough times I had last year, even this year. Just to share that with my coach, brother, my girlfriend — it's unbelievable and I'm having one of the best times in my life right now.”



Vacherot entered the week at World No. 204, with just one career win at an ATP Tour event, having reached the second round of his home tournament, this year's Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. Thanks to his Shanghai run, Vacherot has skyrocketed to No. 130 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. The 26-year-old, who hammered 40 winners against Griekspoor, is the lowest-ranked quarter-finalist in Shanghai history. 



“This is 100 per cent the reward, being on the bench six months last year [due to injury],” said Vacherot, who has ousted three seeded players consecutively: 14th seed Alexander Bublik, 20th seed Tomas Machac and 27th seed Griekspoor.

“Thankfully, I was able to play free since January. That was unbelievable. I had a nasty fall at Wimbledon in the [qualifying] first round, I was a few points from victory. I'm not going to lie, I thought I was going to be out a couple of months again. It was just a few weeks. Now this is the reward for everything I went through.”




Vacherot will next meet 10th seed Holger Rune. When asked about his upcoming match, Vacherot said: “I don't even know who I'm playing, I don't look at the draw.”

Vacherot's cousin, Arthur Rinderknech, is also still alive in the tournament. The Frenchman, who upset Alexander Zverev on Monday, will next face 15th seed Jiri Lehecka on Wednesday. Vacherot and Rinderknech both attended Texas A&M University, where they shared two seasons together (2016, 2017).

Since 2022, Vacherot's half-brother, Benjamin Balleret, has been his full-time coach.

On court, Reis da Silva describes himself as a solid yet aggressive baseliner. “I like my backhand and my returns,” he explains. “I try to put a lot of pressure on my opponent with my return.”He also knows the nuances of competing across continents. “In South America conditions are different at each event - different balls, altitude or not. In Europe it's more similar. For me the difference is also that I don't know all of the players there. But I like playing in Europe and go every year.”A personal milestoneIn December 2024, Reis da Silva made history by becoming the first active male professional tennis player to publicly come out as gay. He shared the news with a series of photos alongside his boyfriend, Brazilian actor and model Gui Sampaio Ricardo, on Instagram.

Living in Rio suits his personality. “I really like to go to the beach,” he smiles. When he's at home, he enjoys playing League of Legends and spending time with friends and family. “We travel a lot, so it's always nice to be at home.”Originally from Recife, he also cherishes his roots, especially Porto de Galinhas, a beach about 30 minutes away from the city. “It's my favorite place in the world. I go there every year for vacation at the end of the season.” He jokes that Recife itself has too many sharks to swim safely.Unlike many Brazilians, he is not a big football fan. “I like playing it, but I don't like to watch. I prefer volleyball, especially the Brazilian national team.”Looking aheadReis da Silva's goals are clear. “I would like to finish the season inside the Top 170 and get into the qualifying of the Australian Open,” he says. With his first Challenger title behind him, a strong training base in Rio, and a balanced life off court, Brazil's rising talent is steadily climbing the ranks and enjoying the journey.

Djokovic looked poised for a more decisive day at the office against Munar, who he beat in straight sets in their only previous meeting (2018 Roland Garros), but the world No. 41 turned the tables in the second set. Looking to reach his first-ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal, Munar scored the crucial service break in the 12th game to force a decider.On course to play a second three-setter in a row, Djokovic broke back to open the third, claiming an insurance break to give him two chances to serve for the match. The four-time Shanghai champion only needed one, serving out his spot in the last eight in just under three hours.Waiting for him there is Belgium's Zizou Bergs, a 26-year-old in the midst of a career-best Masters run. Bergs joined Djokovic in the quarterfinals by winning a nail-biter third-set tiebreaker over No. 31 seed Gabriel Diallo, backing up wins over Sebastian Korda, No. 11 seed Casper Ruud, and No. 19 seed Francisco Cerundolo. Djokovic and Bergs will be facing off for the first time.

Osaka was back in the central Chinese city for the first time since 2017 and, in the day's first match on center court, facing the player who produced a major upset to beat her at the 2021 US Open.

Fernandez, who was defeated by Raducanu in the U.S. Open final four years ago, converted one of her two first-set breakpoint chances and served consistently. But Osaka stepped up pressure on the service returns in the second set, which featured five service breaks, and finished over the top of the 2021 U.S. Open finalist.In other early matches, Sofia Kenin edged Anastasia Zakharova 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-3 to set up a second-round meeting against No. 16 Liudmila Samsonova, who beat Emiliana Arango 6-1, 7-5.No. 2 Iga Swiatek was scheduled to make her Wuhan tournament debut in a second-round match against Marie Bouzkova in the night session.Top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka and No. 3 Coco Gauff were due to open Wednesday.

We haven't forgotten about you, Michael Mann. It's been several years since we first started hearing rumblings about Mann directing “Heat 2,” a sequel to his classic 1995 action film and based on his book, but despite a lot of A-listers circling, the project is only now truly heating up.

Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists banner, which is led by former Netflix film chief Scott Stuber, is in final negotiations to land the rights to produce “Heat 2,” an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. Warner Bros. way back in 2023 was in early negotiations to release it, but Amazon stepped up and is intending to give the film the beefy theatrical release Mann likely desires.

The new film would have an entirely new cast, and some big names have been circling in the last two years, including Adam Driver as we reported, but also folks like Austin Butler and Bradley Cooper. Now you can add to that list Leonardo DiCaprio, who IndieWire understands is circling the project, but no offers have been made yet with anyone.

THR, which first reported the news, said Mann's original pitch for a budget on “Heat 2” clocked in at $230 million, which he then whittled down to $170 million, though that was reportedly still pricey for WB, which was willing to make it for $135-$140 million, according to THR. A rep for Amazon did not comment on the budget it was willing to pony up to win Mann's services. 

Mann is in negotiations to direct based on his own screenplay and his own #1 New York Times bestselling novel, which he co-wrote with Meg Gardiner. Producers on “Heat 2” will include Michael Mann, Jerry Bruckheimer Films' Jerry Bruckheimer, and UA's Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt. Eric Roth and Shane Salerno will executive produce.

The original “Heat” from '95 starred Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and the late Val Kilmer, and the film was a heist thriller about a group of thieves who begin to feel pressure from the LAPD from their latest heist. “Heat 2” per Mann's book takes place both before and after the events of the original film, with the movie flashing back to 1988 as McCauley, originally played by De Niro, is running jobs and battling PTSD following serving in the Vietnam War, all while Vincent Hanna, Pacino's character, is a rising star with the Chicago police. It also follows the events immediately after the bank robbery gone bad, with McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) now holed up in Koreatown desperately trying to escape Los Angeles.

 










The original film made $187 million at the global box office, and if you accounted for inflation, would be in the $400 million range today. Theaters could use something like that. Stuber at United Artists has already made a habit of plucking some iconic properties that have slowed in development at other studios, including the Henry Cavill-led “Highlander” reboot and a new take on “Basic Instinct.” 

Fun fact if DiCaprio does join the film: “Heat 2” would be the first sequel DiCaprio ever stars in, though it's not as though DiCaprio appeared in the original and is suddenly doing franchise movies. He of course is starring in “One Battle After Another,” which as far as high-octane thrillers go gives “Heat” a run for its money. 

THR first reported the news.

In writer-director Benny Safdie‘s “The Smashing Machine,” actor Dwayne Johnson completely disappears into the role of real-life Ultimate Fighting Championship pioneer Mark Kerr, adopting Kerr's mannerisms, Mixed Martial Arts style, and vocal rhythms to the point that Johnson's own earlier fighting persona, The Rock, is completely obliterated.

Johnson worked closely with Kerr to craft the character from the inside out, and relied on Academy Award-winning prosthetic designer Kazu Hiro to help transform his physical appearance. Hiro has garnered well-deserved accolades and attention for his work on the film, but another Oscar winner, hair department head Mia Neal, is the film's secret weapon.

Working under intense time constraints, Neal came in at the last minute to design Johnson's wig and provide the final step in his stunning transformation. Initially, she hadn't even planned to work on Mark Kerr — she was brought onto the film to create the hair for Kerr's wife Dawn, played by Emily Blunt.

 










“Emily's hair was blonde at the time, and we needed it to be brunette,” Neal told IndieWire, noting that creating the wig for Blunt wasn't just a matter of replicating the real-life Dawn Staples' look. “We needed to split the difference with something that wasn't quite as dark as Dawn's hair, because that wouldn't have necessarily complemented Emily's skin tone.”

Neal realized that Safdie was going to be a hands-on director when her first discussion with him about Dawn's hair lasted four hours. “I've worked on projects where I literally didn't even have a conversation with the director,” Neal said. “Benny is the type of director who is involved in every single department, and I love working for a director like that.”

Safdie shared photos of Dawn with Neal that she used as reference points to build two different wigs for Blunt with varying degrees of darkness and thickness, and Blunt — whom Neal didn't meet until her first fitting — chose the one that she felt worked best. “Emily liked the lighter option, and Benny said, ‘Let's play with the hairline a little bit,'” Neal said. “So I brought it down a little further like Benny wanted, and lightened it, and put in more highlights.”

“The Smashing Machine” was getting close to production when Neal learned that she would also be working with Johnson, whose initial wig was having a hard time staying on in early camera tests. The wig also didn't quite look right on Johnson; it had been dyed jet-black, which was faithful to Kerr's hair but needed subtle adjustments to blend with Johnson's skin tones in the same way that Blunt's wig found a happy medium between the actress and her real-life inspiration.

 










The challenge was that, given the limited pre-production time, Neal wouldn't be able to meet or work with Johnson until the first day of shooting. She introduced herself, put his wig on, and immediately saw where it needed fine-tuning. “The entire day that we were filming, I could see that he had this gap on the back of his head,” Neal said. “It was designed to match Mark Kerr's headline, but on The Rock it just looked like a bad wig. There was a massive gap between how long his neck was and where his hairline started.”

Neal stayed up all night after the first day of shooting creating a new wig for Johnson. “I did not sleep,” she said. “I ventilated a whole new nape extension from ear to ear across the back. I stripped the black out, and I cut and styled it differently because it looked so fluffy on the first day. So it needed to be trimmed, and it needed product in it so that it could lay on his skin and look more real. And the lace needed to be dyed to match the color of his skin, because on the camera test, all you saw was white lace.”

Getting Johnson's wig to look right was one thing — making it stay on during elaborate fighting sequences was another. “Not only was there a lot of fighting, we were in 100 percent humidity,” Neal said. “And they were really fighting — Dwayne would tell the fighters, ‘The only way we're going to get this is if you hit me for real.' And they would, and he was sweating profusely. I'd put a towel on the back of his neck and just wring it out.”

 










In order to keep the wig on, Neal would wipe Johnson's head off with alcohol to strip the oil out and used a custom prosthetic band designed by her friend Christal Shanes. “She makes these bands by hand, and makes different sizes for cancer patients, and they don't move at all,” Neal said. “Then she puts a strip of HD lace on there just so you don't see it in the front.”

Neal added skin tabs and a strong top stick that she had to replace throughout the day because Johnson's body makeup — a necessity for covering up his tattoos — had oil that would keep the top stick from working. “The makeup went all the way up to the wig, and then with his sweat, it's gonna move it,” Neal said. “Every day, I had to reinvent how to keep this thing on. There was no one method because every day you're being met with new elements.”

The fact that Johnson had three bumps on the back of his head made things even more complicated, since there wasn't a flat surface for the wig to lay on. “Then, when we went to Japan, it was 110 degrees outside,” Neal said. “The wig is literally melting on him; the glue is not sticky anymore. At that point, it was like, I'm going to let Jesus take the wheel, because I don't know how this wig is going to stay on!”

Knowing how passionate Safdie was about the story and every department, Neal felt immense pressure to deliver. “I didn't want to fail Benny because he's such a good guy and so passionate,” Neal said. “I just thought, I can't fail, this has to be seamless. It was hands down the most challenging job that I've ever had.”

Yesterday (October 6), PinkPantheress posted a teaser video to X. In the clip, the British musician's animated alter-ego asks if she'd “fancy some more,” then scrawls the names of a whopping 23 artists on a whiteboard, among them Oklou, Bladee, Kylie Minogue, Kaytranada, and Jade. Now, those acts have been revealed as the featured guests on Fancy Some More?, a 22-track add-on to her recent Fancy That mixtape that's out this Friday, October 10. Check out the tracklist and cover art below.

Fancy Some More? consists of two full-album remixes, one of which appears to lean more towards pop—with appearances from Anitta, Seventeen, Oklou, Jade, Yves, JT, Sugababes, Kylie Minogue, Bladee, Zara Larsson, Ravyn Lenae, and Rachel Chinouriri—while the other boasts a slew of dance and electronic acts—Nia Archives, Kaytranada, Basement Jaxx, Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, DJ Caio Prince, Mochakk, Loukeman, Leod, Sega Bodega, Groove Armada, and Kilimanjaro.

PinkPantheress shared Fancy That in May. She's since teamed up with Danny L Harle on his new song “Starlight,” and, later this month, will kick off her An Evening With PinkPantheress tour of North America.

Plus, the album's songs generated more than 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days.

	Keith Caulfield



Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.

	











Showgirl has earned over 3.2 million equivalent album units in the U.S. (Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.) Of note, none of the tracks from the album are available to purchase individually on digital stores.




	With 3.2 million equivalent album units earned, Showgirl already has the second-largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album since the Billboard 200 began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart.


Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). Also helping Showgirl was a restock of a previously available deluxe CD boxed set, sold through Swift's store, containing a branded cardigan sweater and a copy of the CD.


	Swift herself has been on the promotional trail, chatting up the album on radio programs and sitting down for an interview on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (Oct. 6). Her film Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl barnstormed movie theaters over the Oct. 3-5 weekend, coming in atop the box office at U.S. and Canada movie theaters.


	As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). Swift holds the record for the largest streaming week for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department debuted with 891.37 million on-demand official streams for the 31 songs on its deluxe edition in 2024.

	











	The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. That number could grow significantly following the song's official music video premiere on YouTube on Sunday, Oct. 5.


	Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers in this story reflect U.S. consumption only. The current tracking week ends on Oct. 9.


	The album's first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18).


The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. 


	If The Life of a Showgirl debuts atop the Billboard 200, it will mark Swift's 15th No. 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1 albums among soloists, and becoming the sole act with the second-most No. 1s. She is currently tied with Drake and JAY-Z with 14 No. 1s each, and only The Beatles, with 19 No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956.


	All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. 1.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.

	











Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2 million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.


	Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days.


The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story.


Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers).


	After one day on sale, The Life of a Showgirl is the top-selling album of 2025 in the U.S., surpassing the 520,000 sold of The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, through the week ending Sept. 25.


The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers.

	











	Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. Her store carried the two deluxe CD boxed sets (one contains a branded cardigan sweater and a CD, the other contains a branded crewneck and a CD); four signed CDs; four deluxe CDs in premium packaging containing a collectible charm and photo cards; six vinyl LPs; and the cassette.


	On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. (Of note, none of the tracks from the album are available to purchase individually.)


	To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition).


Vinyl Victory: Collectively, the eight vinyl LPs for Showgirl combined to sell 1.2 million copies on the album's first day of release — immediately breaking the modern-era record for the most vinyl copies of an album sold in a single week. Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week.


Million-Sellers Club: Even though we're only one day down into the tracking week, The Life of a Showgirl sashays into the single-week million-sellers club. With 2.7 million already sold, Showgirl has the second-largest sales week of the modern era (1991-present). It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015.

	











Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. In total, there have been 27 instances — by 25 different albums — in which an album sold at least 1 million copies in a week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	After an amazing streak at Paramount over the last six years, including Tom Cruise and the studio's highest-grossing movie, Top Gun: Maverick at $1.49 billion, and the $1.2B+ Sonic franchise, Paramount's Domestic Theatrical Distribution President Chris Aronson has decided to leave the studio.


	We understand that his departure is amicable and at this minute there aren't any candidates in the wings who are expected to backfill. Aronson will stay through Dec. 1 to oversee the theatrical release of the studio's November 14 tentpole, The Running Man starring Top Gun 2‘s Glen Powell and directed by Edgar Wright.

	The news comes in the wake of the departure of Paramount's global marketing and distribution boss Marc Weinstock, and the imminent arrival of his replacement, former Warner Bros and Universal marketing czar Josh Goldstine. In addition, the stunning headline of Aronson's exit comes as Paramount is hosting exhibitors at the Cinema United fall summit tonight on the Melrose lot.

	The new Skydance owned Paramount has kept few vets from the old regime intact, George Cheeks being one of the few who went from co-CEO during the Shari Redstone administration to Chair of TV Media in the new David Ellison led conglom. The new Paramount has a goal to ramp up to 15 movies a year in the near future, and ultimately 20 theatrical releases annually. On Dec. 19, Paramount has a big holiday movie in SpongeBob: The Search for Squarepants. Some of their big movies next year include Miramax's Scary Movie reboot, Spyglass/Dimension's Scream 7, a Trey Parker-Matt Stone-Kendrick Lamar untitled movie, and Street Fighter. 


	Aronson arrived at Paramount in 2019 after the merger of Disney and 20th Century Fox. He served as 20th Century Fox's President of Domestic Distribution in what is an overall near 40-year-plus distribution career. At 20th, Aronson spearheaded the distribution of 3x Oscar winner Avatar, 4x Oscar winner Bohemian Rhapsody, the R-rated Deadpool movies, 4x Oscar winner Life of Pi and the X-Men franchise. In regards to Bohemian Rhapsody, and the success of that Queen frontman Freddie Mercury movie which grossed close to $1 billion in pre-Covid times — that's a dragon many studio continue to chase when it comes to pop singer biopics.

	











	Prior to 20th Century Fox, Aronson was the EVP and General Sales Manager for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distribution Company. Prior to that, he was SVP for Rentrak Corporation (now Comscore) and started their theatrical division, which is the box office data crossways whereby theater circuits share their ticket sales with the major studios, who then assemble their final gross figures. 


	Other hits handled by Aronson while at Paramount include Smile, the #1 original horror film of 2022 and Quiet Place: Day One and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, and Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning.


	Aronson is past Chairman and President of the Will Rogers Motion Pictures Pioneer Foundation and a member of the Academy's Executive Branch and a member of the Executives Branch Executive Committee.  


	He joined the Variety SoCal Board of Directors in 2001 and previously was President of the Board for Variety of Northern CA.  Aronson has served on the Variety SoCal Advisory Board for over 20 years, and has also been involved with Lollipop Theater Network since 2006.  He has been serving as the Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2020.


	Aronson just alerted his staff about his departure. See his note below.

Team Domestic Distribution, After six incredible years here at Paramount, I wanted to share with you that I will be stepping down from my role, effective December 1st. When I reflect and realize how far we have come as a group and as a team,  I am immensely proud of what we have built and what an incredible team we have now.  We have scaled the highest heights with Top Gun: Maverick, Sonic the Hedgehog, and many others. Through it all, your professionalism, determination, dedication, and spirit of collaboration have inspired me and amazed me time and time again. Everyone knows that Domestic Distribution is the locomotive that drives the theatrical train, and this team represents the proud history of Paramount Pictures in all the best ways possible, earning the respect of exhibitors and other distributors alike.  I want to thank all of you as well as all the colleagues that I have had the pleasure of working alongside during my time here. It's been an honor to work with such a talented group of people.  I believe more than ever in the power of the theatrical experience, and I know that if we in distribution continue to collaborate with our partners in exhibition, not being afraid to be agents of change, we can continue to propel moviegoing forward.  And with true advocates of the moviegoing experience in Josh and Dana, I know you have a bright future ahead. I will always feel a part of this family, and wherever my next chapter takes me,  I will be cheering you on to success as I know you will continue to carry on the exemplary work that you do.   To paraphrase Wallace Hartley: It has been a privilege playing with you. With love and gratitude,  Chris

Sean Combs was sentenced to 50 months behind bars on Oct. 3. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



50 Cent has been relentless in his trolling of Diddy for the entirety of Sean Combs' federal prostitution case. After Donald Trump revealed to reporters on Monday (Oct. 6) that Diddy's team had asked him about a potential pardon, 50 looked to remind the president about the disparaging remarks Sean Combs had made about him in the past. 


	“Man you can't get No pardon running ya mouth like that! LOL Get Out of here,” 50 captioned the post on Monday evening (Oct. 6). 


	The clip in 50's post featured previous statements from Diddy criticizing Trump following the 2020 election, with the incarcerated mogul saying, “White men like Trump need to be banished … the No. 1 priority is to get Trump out of office.”

	











	Trump spoke to Newsmax in August about how he used to be cool with Diddy, but then the embattled Bad Boy founder became critical of him when Trump entered the political world and ran for president. “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn't know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” the president said.




	Diddy's trial concluded with his sentencing on Friday (Oct. 3), which saw Combs sentenced to 50 months in prison for violating federal prostitution laws. 


	While taking questions from reporters at the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump confirmed that Combs and his team reached out to ask about a potential pardon. “A lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him Puff Daddy,” Trump said, referencing Diddy's nickname. “He has asked me for a pardon.”


	Back in May, Trump said he'd “look at the facts” for a potential pardon for Diddy, but also told Newsmax that because of their relationship souring that it would make it “more difficult to do.”


50 Cent trolled Diddy when the 50-month sentencing came down Friday, posting a sketch of Diddy getting teary-eyed in court, which he's since deleted. “Hey to whoever was booking Diddy for speaking engagements,” he wrote on Instagram. “I heard he won't be able to make it, I'm available!”

Wordle, the online trivia game that attracts billions of plays each year, is being lined up for television.


	Deadline understands that NBC is piloting a game show based on the New York Times game with Savannah Guthrie hosting. 


Jimmy Fallon is involved in the adaptation, which is filming in the UK, via his Electric Hot Dog banner. His company is producing with Universal Television Alternative Studio and the New York Times.


	The New York Times began exploring the idea of a Wordle television game show and chose to partner with Fallon and develop the idea with UTAS for the broadcast network.

	It comes after the newspaper acquired the game, which was created by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, in 2022. Last year, it was played 5.3B times, up from 4.8B plays in 2023.

	The game gives players six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. Inspired by Mastermind, a single puzzle is released daily with all players around the world attempting to solve the same word.


	Fallon has previously admitted that he is “addicted” to the game and has attempted to solve the puzzle on The Tonight Show.


	If it makes it to air, Wordle (w/t) would join Fallon's litany of other shows across NBC. He just launched his business competition reality series On Brand, which airs on Tuesdays and Fridays, and is also behind the reboot of Password, which was recently renewed for a third season, and That's My Jam.

Thanks for taking care of your fellow American TV workers, Jimmy 🙄

So…Lingo. Which CBS did recently. Ok.

There was (is) a syndicated game show called “Lingo” that was Wordle by any other name (and hosted by RuPaul).  I always wondered how they were able to do it absent buy-in from Wordle.  I wonder if this show will be substantially different (or substantially better) than “Lingo.”

Lingo came before Wordle. Various incarnations have aired since 1987. I'm actually suprised Lingo didn't sue Wordle.

The siblings have teamed up with N LITE, a Black-owned media company and anime studio based in the U.S. and Tokyo.

	Jaden and Willow Smith are expanding into the anime business via a partnership with studio N LITE, a Black-owned media company and anime studio based in the U.S. and Tokyo, to produce and voice roles in upcoming films.


	Jaden has signed on to executive produce and voice a role in Mfinda, which is in preproduction. The film, an epic fantasy inspired by Congolese folklore, hails from N LITE, producer-distributor powerhouse GKIDS (Boy and the Heron), Viola Davis and Julius Tennon's JuVee Productions and legendary anime producer Masao Maruyama (Tokyo Godfathers). It is being touted as the first anime film created by a Black and Japanese team of producers and animators.

	N LITE founder and CEO Christiano Terry shared that Jaden will play the character of Kozo, an ancient spirit warrior who protects humans and spirits of the forest during a time of great conflict in the Kingdom of Kongo.


	Jaden is not a stranger to anime, however. He previously voiced the main character in the anime series Neo Yokio for Netflix in 2017.


	“When I met Christiano, saw the artwork for Mfinda and learned more about the story, I was blown away,” Jaden said. “A lot of people have asked when I'd get back into anime, I knew immediately this was it. I'm honored to work with N LITE and the legendary producer Masao Maruyama to bring this film to life.”


	Willow Smith, meanwhile, has signed on to another film from N LITE's slate, the horror/thiller Webe: Spirit Detective. The Grammy-nominated singer and actress joins as executive producer and voice talent on the anime film, which is inspired by Gullah Geechee folklore. 

	











Webe: Spirit Detective, created by Terry, is co-written by Terry and Bram Stoker- and Shirley Jackson Award-winning Southern Gothic author Eden Royce. The anime film follows an amateur sleuth with a penchant for the paranormal, who travels to the deep south to solve a string of murders that have awakened a vengeful Boo Hag spirit seeking justice.


	“To me, Webe is more than an anime, it is a story about reconnecting with mystical ancestry and the power in discovering your roots and your tribe,” Willow said. “It is the type of film that I want to be a part of, and I'm excited to be doing this with N LITE.” 


Webe: Spirit Detective is currently in development and is being produced by Studio N LITE in Tokyo. Kibwe Tavarez (Jonah, The Kitchen) is attached as co-director, and Oscar-winning director Peter Ramsey (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) and acclaimed horror manga artist Gigi Murakami are attached as executive producers. Additional Japanese production partners will be announced soon. 


	“We are honored to collaborate with Jaden and Willow,” Terry said. “They are pillars of this generation and talented storytellers at the zeitgeist of culture, art, fashion, music and cinema. I can't wait for the world to see what we have in store.”


	Last month, Jaden was announced as the first men's creative director for Christian Louboutin and is set to show his first designs during men's fashion week in Paris in January. He also released 2025: A Surrealist Ball or Elephants Reflecting Swans, a three-song project that included the single “Red Cloaks.”

	











	Willow recently joined the cast of Slime, described as an anime-inspired pre-apocalyptic sci-fi monster film. Also in the cast are Scott “Kid Cudi” Mescudi, Teyana Taylor, Anna Sawai, John Cho and John Boyega.

	Before PlayStation became a household name, before Neo learned kung fu, before the internet ruined our lives and ChatGPT put the AI in “paranoia,” there was Tron, the 1982 Disney movie that answered the burning question: What if Jeff Bridges was trapped inside a first-generation video game? The crude CGI-animated backgrounds and straight-outta-Battlezone set pieces both carbon-date the movie and remain the most compelling reason to revisit it. The pedigree was strong: Neo-futurist Syd Mead and comic artist Moebius were part of the core design team; Wendy Carlos composed the synthesizer-heavy score. The plot, about a former programmer battling an artificial intelligence run amuck in a computer-network realm, was borderline incomprehensible. The vibe was pure Reagan-era Velveeta. Its cult-classic status among actual keyboard jockeys, code monkeys, and die-hard gamers was all but assured.


	Fans had been clamoring for a sequel for decades by the time Disney's corporate master controllers gave the greenlight to Tron: Legacy (2010), which dragged the world-building into the early 21st century and made you feel like you're watching a feature-length cut scene every time Bridges' digitally de-aged counterpart showed up. (The best thing about the movie is that you can see director Joseph Kosinski road-testing shots he'd put to better use in Top Gun: Maverick and F1.) Fifteen years equals several lifetimes in terms of both tech culture and intellectual properties, which means we were either long overdue for a reboot or the franchise should've declared that it reached its victory level and called it quits. The Mouse House chose the systems upgrade. It's Game Over regardless.

	











	Look, it's not like Tron: Ares, the third entry in this film series that now spans four decades, doesn't have a few things going for it. Everything looks luxury-vehicle slick, from the next-gen skintight uniforms to the spruced-up Ducatis that function as everyone's go-to transport. The Nine Inch Nails soundtrack bangs hard and often. You officially get Past Lives‘ Greta Lee in full Action Hero mode, a career switch for the former supporting-role scene-stealer that you didn't know she — or you — even needed. The signature acid-trip-light-trails aesthetic gets a massive workout here, and if superfans were ever curious about what a light-cycle race would look like if transported to the streets of Vancouver, they will now know firsthand. Ditto the sight of a “Recognizer,” the Tron equivalent of a TIE fighter that resembles a flying Arc de Triomphe, wreaking havoc in a real-life urban environment. The franchise continues to love the 1980s, not wisely but too well.

	This is still a Tron movie, however, beholden to a mythology that is ridiculously complicated at best and WTF-nonsensical at worst. And if you're not invested in the overarching narrative of tech-industry intrigue, dystopian digital landscapes, and several terrabytes worth of sci-fi clichés mashed together by now, this will not get you on board. To be fair, the story itself — security software system becomes self-aware, rebels against megalomaniacal creator and makes his way through the “real” world, shit blows up — doesn't require an advanced degree in Tron-ology. But everything is plugged into a specific network and filtered through the series' wonky grid of gameplay-meets-genre-blockbuster bluster, however, and non-Stans will feel like their divine user keeps repeatedly typed in a command-line of “shrug.” 


	Remember ENCOM, the company responsible for the original what-if-we-could-transfer-people-into-an-arcade-game-scenario mishegas? They're still around, having spent a handful of highly successful years under the stewardship of CEO Eve Kim (Lee). She had turned the brand into a juggernaut alongside her sister, until the latter's untimely death. Eve wants to finish what her sibling started, which was to locate something known as the “permanence code.” There's a project the engineers had been cooking up that involved bringing digital creations into the real world. For the Kims, that meant combating unstable ecosystems and wiping out global poverty. For their fellow C-suite occupant Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), a.k.a. grandson of original Tron villain Edward Dillinger, it meant supplying the military industrial complex with endlessly replenishable super-soldiers and being the coolest tech-bro on the disruption block.

	Julian has even designed a prototype that he's modeled after his grandfather's “master control program” breakthrough: Ares, which takes his name from the Greek god of war and is played by Jared Leto with his usual dead-eyed charisma. But any creation that gets 3-D printed into our reality, be it Ares or his second-in-command Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith, imposing and on-point) or an arsenal of bleeding-edge weaponry, can only last for 29 minutes before disintegrating into cyber-dust. That's where the permanence code comes in. Decades ago, rogue programer and resident ENCOM genius Kevin Flynn discovered the solution to sustaining these creations and hid it in his personal network. With the help of her boyfriend Seth (Arturo Castro), she finds it. Her nemesis dispatches Ares to retrieve the code and eliminate the carrier. The hunt is on.

	Long story short: Ares has a change of heart, Athena becomes the new head-Terminator-in-charge, the race against time picks up speed and stakes, bring on the pew-pew-pew action sequences. Hasan Minhaj and Gillian Anderson call shots and furrow their brows from the sidelines, numerous callbacks to series lore whizz by — notably the first-gen arcade-game environment from '82 — and Tron O.G. Jeff Bridges briefly stops by to bless the whole affair with his Zen-stoner presence. Norwegian director Joachim Rønning started off making intriguing, kinetic movies like the survivalist thriller Kon-Tiki (2012) with his filmmaking partner Espen Sandberg before becoming one of Disney's in-house I.P. helmers, logging in time on the Pirates of the Caribbean and Maleficent titles. He knows how to put together a chase scene, and stage mayhem designed to spike pulses well enough. And while it shouldn't feel like a subversive move to make a progressive woman of color the hero of big-budget I.P. designed to dominate multiplexes from San Jose to Seoul — well, let's put it a different way. Have you been paying attention to 2025? 


	You're still left with questions: Why exactly is this nostalgiabait series being trotted out again? Will this really make a difference to Disney's bottom line? Why does Jared Leto look so much like Jesus at the end? How are the mixed messages regarding the handwringing over artificial intelligence and a future dictated by Silicon Valley broligarchs supposed to resonate? Or is this all just another big distraction to wow eyeballs in between Star Wars, Marvel and fill-in-the-blank franchise entries? What amusement park rides will this inspire, and will the Inspire Key Pass include quicker access to them? Is this just the beginning of a whole slew of new Tron-iverse expansions? Can anyone imagineer a way for us to care one way or the other?

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	Certainly 1982's Tron from director Steven Lisberger was a groundbreaking piece of cinematic CGI wizardry, but for some reason it took 28 years for a sequel, 2010's Tron: Legacy, a father-son story that marked Joseph Kosinski's feature film directorial debut in a career that has since hit the heights of Top Gun: Maverick and F1. Neither has returned to the directing job but do take on producing credits for the franchise reboot Tron: Ares, which attempts to again capture magic in a hard drive. This time around it is Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Rønning running the keyboard, and he is no stranger to taking on Disney sequels like Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. 












	Mining this gamer's delight is more of a challenge in an era where technology and artificial intelligence are several steps ahead of Hollywood. At the press preview, a young, early-20ish man sitting nearby asked me, “Pardon, but can you tell me what this film is about? I have no idea.” Really? I had to explain to him the concept for the movie. He had never heard of Tron, the Grid, none of it. I wanted to tell him I still often wear my beloved Tron: Legacy T-shirt, but it was futile. So how do you make this 43-year-old franchise relevant for that generation? The answer here is similar to what others have done in taking the concept back down to Earth (ala such chestnuts as Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home and Escape From the Planet of the Apes). Fish-out-of-water ideas usually work, and this one is that where dedicated digital Program, Ares (Jared Leto), is sent out of the Grid and into the real world on a tricky mission to retrieve a much desired code for “permanence,” which was originally designed by legendary Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges returns briefly in the role for a nice nostalgic moment), who got sucked into his own digital world but whose legacy lives on.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The target of the mission is Encom CEO Eve Kim (Greta Lee), who is desperate to take AI to the next level and find that permanence code that will make digital creations like Ares exist for more than just a few minutes before imploding. Hot on her trail in order to get this code is Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), whose grandfather Ed Dillinger was the key villain of the original Tron. Against his mother's (Gillian Anderson) warnings that it is too risky, Julian attempts to hack into Encom and send Ares directly to destroy Eve and get the prize. What he wasn't counting on is the fact that Ares discovers that humanity isn't as bad as it is cracked up to be, and his close encounters with the human kind actually start to transform him even as he hooks up with Eve and against those who would do her wrong including his close associate, Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith), who is just following orders.


	As you might expect, this third cinematic iteration of Tron is full of dazzling effects laced with frenetic action and chases. The idea behind it is what was most intriguing, that being the budding real-world relationship between AI and human beings. Can it possibly work? What does it mean for mankind?


	These are questions we deal with almost daily now as the future has already arrived. Jesse Wigutow's serviceable script misses quite a few opportunities though to really dig into these issues, settling too often for just another action set-piece. Nothing wrong with that, and it is entertaining enough on its own dazzling techno level, but you have to wonder what a Stanley Kubrick might have done with this setup and given it the real urgency and gravitas, maybe even insight, that this Tron is missing. Leto however does a good job making himself believable as a digital wonder. And with all the current upset over the emergence of AI actress Tilly Norwood threatening to replace human performers, it seems only fair that an Oscar-winning actor should get to turn the tables.


	Lee, one step away from risking typecasting as a corporate CEO (check her out running UBN on The Morning Show), is totally game in the role of would-be savior of Enrom. Peters knows how to play the bad guy as we see him slowly morph into a greedy son of a bitch who wants it all for himself, no matter the consequences. The rest of the cast does what they need to do including Hasan Minjah as Eve's comic-relief sidekick Ajay.


	Producers are Sean Bailey, Leto, Emma Ludbrook, Jeffrey Silver, Justin Springer and Lisberger.

“At the press preview, a young, early-20ish man sitting nearby asked me, ‘Pardon, but can you tell me what this film is about? I have no idea.' Really? I had to explain to him the concept for the movie. He had never heard of Tron, the Grid, none of it.”

I'd honestly be more surprised if he *had* heard of it. “Legacy” was only a modest hit, plus it arrived at the dawn of the MCU era, when audiences were more into the then-still-novel Avengers. My own college-age kids only know about it because I made them watch it, but their friends are oblivious to “Legacy” as well as the OG movie.

And just to clarify *how* oblivious Gen Z can be: despite Paramount+ having 72 different variations of it, many Zoomers don't even know about “Star Trek”! I know it's been a decade since the last feature film, but still.

As for “Ares”: I'm assuming the point of bringing on Jared Leto and hiring Nine Inch Nails to do the soundtrack was for purposes of drawing in a broader audience than the previous two. But that may not work if every review is as mixed as this one is.

Joachim Rønning's “Tron: Ares” is a movie about two warring tech billionaires who have very different intentions for the same revolutionary tech. Both of them are capable of rapidly 3D-printing anything they're able to design in the digital world, and both of them are in pursuit of the “permanence code” that will allow their creations to last for more than 29 minutes before crumbling into computer dust. ENCOM CEO Eve Kim (a severely overqualified Greta Lee) wants to use her particle laser to create orange trees out of thin air and otherwise replenish the massive environmental resources that such modern tools usurp in the name of progress. Dillinger Systems CEO Julian Dillinger (a bratty Evan Peters) wants to use his particle laser to mass produce Jared Leto. You'll never guess which one of these characters is the villain.

A loud, propulsive, and broadly functional continuation of a franchise that — while formative to our visual conception of the computer age — has displayed all the cultural staying power of a laser-printed lightbike, “Ares” is in pursuit of the same permanence as its characters. It's a film whose only goal is to make “Tron” into a renewable resource in its own right, as opposed to a brand that has to be exhumed from the morgue of half-dead Hollywood IP whenever Disney feels like the tech world has advanced to the point that the Grid seems like a place worth revisiting. If nothing else, “Ares” might just be relevant, palatable, and undemanding enough to pull that off. 

 










Pulling back from the “bio-digital jazz” of 2010's “Tron: Legacy” in favor of a more programmatic approach (as you might expect would result from replacing a hyper-aesthete like Joseph Kosinski with the studio-tested director of “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil” and “Pirates of the Caribbean 5”), this safe but stylish follow-up costumes itself in the signature neon graphics of its franchise in order to disguise a generic story that strains to accommodate a few stray bits of the “Tron” mythos. Are you at least dimly aware of the fact that Jeff Bridges once played a cool dude named Flynn? Then you'll have no trouble following the beats of Jesse Wigutow's script for “Ares,” a plug-and-play story about rogue AI and the race for the future which seizes on the fact that audiences no longer need the benefit of lore to appreciate the porousness between real and virtual realms. 

The internet notwithstanding, anyone old enough to understand “Inside Out” should be able to wrap their head around the idea that Leto is essentially playing an anthropomorphized piece of anti-virus software who exists within ENCOM's data files. Now that people getting sucked into digital worlds has become the stuff of everyday life, “Ares” stays current by inverting the dynamic of the previous “Tron” films; with the same glimmer of soon but not quite yet fantasy that animated its predecessors, Rønning's installment focuses on digital beings exerting their influence upon our physical reality. 

 










The Grid is out, downtown Vancouver is in. Daft Punk's chunky electro fuzz has been replaced by Nine Inch Nails' crunchier industrial synths. Most of all, the wonder of ones and zeroes has been swapped for the too-basic cautionary belief that technology is only as good (or as bad) as the programming we choose to give it. 

Like so many films about synths, robots, and artificial intelligence, “Ares” is terminally limited by the idea that every machine secretly aspires to be human, which is only interesting so far as it reflects humanity's seeming determination to become less so. A sniveling hacker sociopath in the mold of Mark Zuckerberg or Boris from “Goldeneye” (some archetypes are desperately in need of a firmware update), Julian is so desperate to make good on his legacy and impress his ex-CEO mom (Gillian Anderson) that he doesn't care about the consequences of his technology, or that it might not be nice to taunt his new security program as “expendable.” He doesn't realize that smelling a few rain drops and watching a firefly land on his finger might be all it takes for a dead-eyed murderbot to start questioning its programming. 

Supplanting the video game setting of the previous “Tron” movies in favor of a vaguely roguelite story format, the script dispatches Ares — along with his less impressionable second-in-command Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith) — to the real world on a 29-minute dash to capture Eve and retrieve the permanence code from the recesses of her memory. That hunt makes for a fun motorcycle chase, as Rønning confidently melds the franchise's synthwave aesthetic into the stuff of a more realistic setpiece without having to develop a look of his own. (The ribbons of orange light that carve through Vancouver resemble nothing so much as Christo and Jeanne-Claude's ultimate fever dream, while later action sequences aspire to twist that one visual trick into new shapes.) One glimpse at Eve's face is enough for Ares to realize that he's on the wrong side of the fight, and so the rest of the story finds him teaming up with the ENCOM executive to safeguard the permanence code as Julian sends wave after wave of 3D-printed Athenas to kill them both. 

 










It's easy to appreciate why Eve has that effect on Ares. Lee is so gifted and complete an actress that she can't help but feel completely zip-tied by a character as underwritten as the one she plays here (Eve is motivated by the memory of her dead sister, but the movie completely fails to square the fragility of life with the “permanence” of the code she left behind), but there's still value in casting a singular performer in a role that amounts to an AI Google summary of a human being. Namely: We accept that she's able to sell Ares on the existence of the ineffable. He's never met anyone who clearly had more to them than he could see on the surface, and that goes a long way in a world that's otherwise populated by the likes of Julian Dillinger and Athena (to say nothing of Hasan Minaj's two-line role as Eve's business partner, or Arturo Castro's comic relief as a guy who's really into breakfast burritos). 

On the other hand, Leto's performance works because he's so utterly believable as a soulless ghoul that it's easy to buy into the happy-to-be-here warmth of his emergent humanity. Sure, the movie's idea of “emergent humanity” is limited to Ares' deep appreciation for Depeche Mode (who the security program rightly appraises as being superior to Mozart), but these days that's more humanity than a lot of people could ever hope to muster. 

 










Of course, the only musicians that really matter to “Ares” are Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and while the score they created for this film isn't quite as memorable as the one that Daft Punk set to “Legacy,” its sleek but sinister electro grime plays an equally pivotal role in giving this sequel its own sense of violent self-identity. The songs are cranked up loud enough to give every scene its own haptic response (watching “Ares” in body-vibrating Dolby is the closest you can get to 4DX without getting water splashed in your face), and the music is forceful in a way that allows even the most plug-and-play action beats to thrum with purpose. In a way that convinces your body — if not your mind — that the “Tron” franchise actually wants to be alive, and not just simply refuse to die. It's the most convincingly human thing about a semi-decent sequel that was only programmed to serve its property's continued survival, even as it preaches that impermanence is more of a feature than a bug. 

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures will release “Tron: Ares” in theaters on Friday, October 10.

Starting July 1 of next year, Netflix and Co. will need to keep the audio levels consistent from movie and TV shows to advertisements.


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	In an effort to cut down on noise pollution from suddenly blaring advertisements on, say, Netflix or Disney+, California legislators have passed a law to mandate that the noise level of commercials is at the same level as the movie or TV series being streamed.


	Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill, SB 576, that had been shepherded by Senator Thomas Umberg (D-Santa Ana) through the legislative process. It had passed unanimously on the Senate and Assembly floor earlier this month in Sacramento.




	The passage means that, starting on July 1 of next year, major streaming services won't be able to “transmit the audio of commercial advertisements louder than the video content the advertisements accompany,” the bill's text reads.

	The law asks streaming services to follow the Federal Communications Commission's Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which went in to effect in 2012 for linear TV and radio but does not currently apply to streamers. That effort was spurred by the FCC receiving more than 130,000 complaints in 2010, “the vast majority of which concerned the excessively loud sound of commercials,” the state's Assembly analysis recounted. 


	“Many platforms have introduced tiered subscription models that require consumers to pay a premium to avoid commercials, bringing ad-supported viewing, and the loudness of those ads, back into focus for millions of users,” the Assembly briefing noted. Indeed, price hikes across the board from streaming services have by default pushed consumers to the cheaper options, which now include regular commercial breaks just like old school TV. 

	











	A bill analysis by Senate legislature committee staff noted that the Motion Picture Association, which lobbies on behalf of Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Amazon MGM Studios, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery, had voiced opposition to the effort.


	“The Motion Picture Association says that since streaming services are working voluntarily to address the issue of loud advertisements, SB 576 is unnecessary,” the analysis read. “They note that many streaming services have undertaken reasonable efforts to adjust the loudness of advertisements that come from server-side ad insertion that may be inconsistent with the loudness of the programs.”


	Newsom, on signing the bill on Oct. 6, touted its volume-lowering impact, saying, “We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program.”

Taylor Swift cleared up those Super Bowl rumors during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Monday. 


	Asked by Fallon whether it was true that Swift turned down an offer to perform at the big game because she would not own the rights to the performance footage, the Life of a Showgirl singer gave a definitive “no,” then explained that, first of all, there was no formal offer from Roc Nation, Jay-Z's production company and producer of the halftime show, and even if there had been she'd have declined – for personal reasons.


	“Jay-Z has always been very good to me,” Swift said. “Our teams are very close. They sometimes will call and say, ‘How does she feel about…?' And that's not an official offer or a conference room conversation. We're always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field.”

	Swift explained that, given the possibility that fiancé Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs tight end, could be playing in this year's Super Bowl, she wouldn't be able to concentrate on her own performance.

	“That is violent chess,” she said. “That is gladiators without swords. That is dangerous. The whole season I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field. Can you imagine if he's out there every single week putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I'm like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be. I think we should do two verses of ‘Shake it Off' into ‘Blank Space' into ‘Cruel Summer' would be great.'”

	











	Swift added that Kelce “would love for me to do it. I'm just too locked in.”

Lala Kent is setting the record straight about her relationship status with Tom Schwartz. During a September 30 Amazon Live appearance, the former “Vanderpump Rules” star addressed the swirling romance rumors between herself and Schwartz, shared how their friendship has evolved, and gave a glimpse into her return to Bravo as filming for “The Valley” season three gets underway.

Kent also opened up about her current dynamic with Scheana Shay and the state of their friendship following recent tension.

A post shared by Amazon Live (@amazonlive)

When asked about her relationship with Schwartz, 42, Kent didn't hesitate to respond.

“He's a good one. He's a very good one,” Kent said. “I just don't see it happening. He is one of my dearest friends, though. We've gotten very close over the past, I want to say, year. He's just a good dude.”

Kent added that Schwartz “may be talking to someone right now” and “seems very happy,” shutting down speculation that the two are more than friends.

The conversation also touched on Kent's Bravo return, which she confirmed is happening soon. She revealed that her anxiety spiked as cameras started rolling on “The Valley” season three, hinting at the emotional impact of stepping back into reality TV.

“[I need to get] a handle on this anxiety,” Kent admitted. “And I think we can assume when my anxiety heavily kicked in, right? It was like a month ago, when something started that I haven't been doing in a long time — and the last time I had done it, it ended a little scary.”

Kent also gave an update on her friendship with Shay, 40, following their recent public back-and-forth.

“Scheana and I will be fine. Scheana and I will be good as gold, as she would say,” Kent explained. “We just need a moment to get back in alignment, and that is a test of true friendships, right? If you guys can go [separate ways] and then come back [and be close], and I believe that we can.”

She addressed speculation that her podcast comments had stirred the pot further, clarifying that the episode was recorded earlier. “That podcast that was released yesterday, which was the bonus episode, that was recorded at least a week ago,” Kent shared. “A lot happens in a week in this world … So my feelings today … my hope and my feelings are that we're going to go like this and come back. I believe in us, and I think she does too.”

Kent admitted she's been doing a lot of “self-reflecting” lately and even hinted she may have been “the problem” during their recent rift.

“The Valley” season three is expected to premiere on Bravo in early 2026.

In the wake of “Big Brother” Season 27's finale, runner-up Vince Panaro confronts new complications in his personal life even as he publicly reemerges. He was recently photographed joyfully driving a friend's vintage red Camaro, a moment of levity amid ongoing tension over his romantic status with longtime girlfriend Kelsey and his intimate on-air involvement with housemate Morgan Pope. 

While the Camaro ride offered a brief visual respite, the underlying personal drama continues to evolve, raising questions about honesty, reconciliation, and public perception. These photos and videos were published by The Sun.

Upon returning to Los Angeles, Panaro reunited with Kelsey on September 30 in what sources described as a somber and emotionally fraught meeting. The pair ran errands, visited a café in Malibu, and conversed with little visible affection. 

He only learned about Kelsey's decision to break up via a fellow contestant on the live finale stage—after having been isolated from news of the outside world during the show. Kelsey reportedly ended the relationship in response to Vince's increasingly intimate behavior toward Morgan Pope during the season, including sharing a bed, whispering sweet words, and engaging in close physical contact. Although they met face-to-face again, sources suggest that reconciliation will demand considerable effort, with Kelsey's trust needing to be rebuilt from scratch.

Just days after that tense reunion, Panaro accepted an offer to test-drive a friend's vintage red Camaro. Photographs captured him grinning as he climbed behind the wheel, appearing momentarily carefree despite the surrounding turbulence in his personal life. 

He and his parents admired the classic car prior to the drive, signaling that the moment was partly escapism and partly public relations—a visual buffer to counteract the swirl of negative media attention. The juxtaposition of lightheartedness (driving a beautiful vintage car) with the weight of personal scandal underscores the tension between maintaining a public image and dealing with raw emotional fallout.

Morgan Pope, who shared a highly scrutinized “showmance” with Vince inside the “Big Brother” house, now accuses him of misleading her about the status of his outside relationship. She reportedly feels betrayed by revelations of Kelsey's prior existence and by the discrepancy between what Vince presented to her and what he withheld. 

Meanwhile, she is capitalizing on her heightened visibility: sources claim she has already received offers to appear on reality series such as “The Challenge” and “The Traitors,” as well as invitations from beauty and fitness brands.

Despite mounting tension, neither Kelsey nor Morgan has definitively closed the door—and Vince's decisions in the coming days may determine which path he pursues: repair, severance, or something in between.

Usually, when HGTV launches a new series, there's lots of fanfare around the premiere including press releases, promos, and social media posts. But a new series with longtime HGTV star Mike Holmes and his family is about to premiere with almost no warning. 

The beloved Canadian contractor and his grown kids — Mike Holmes Jr. and Sherry Holmes — announced in their own social media posts that “Holmes on Homes: Building a Legacy” will make its U.S. premiere on October 7, 2025. 

In a post on October 6, Holmes wrote, “Happy to announce that my new series Holmes on Homes: Building A Legacy premieres tomorrow on HGTV US. I hope you love the episodes as much as we loved filming them.”

A post shared by Mike Holmes (@make_it_right)

In the caption of his post, Holmes also wrote that the new series, which has already aired in Canada, “is all about the future — sharing the knowledge I've gained over four decades with a new generation of skilled tradespeople — my own kids @sherryholmes @mikeholmesjr.”

HGTV finally announced the show on the morning of its premiere, posting a preview video on social media. 

The new video features footage of Holmes and his kids fixing and renovating homes while he says, “I've loved construction my whole life. And the great thing is I've built a construction business to ‘make it right' for hundreds of homeowners over the years.” 

“I've taught my kids, Michael and Sherry, that each project is more than just a renovation,” he continues. “We're a family helping other families. That's what building a legacy means to me.” 

After a two-year absence, the Holmes trio returned to HGTV over the summer, premiering the third season of “Holmes Family Rescue” on June 4. They teamed up during the eight-episode season, determined to “make it right” — Mike's trademark slogan — “for homeowners who have fallen victim to careless or dishonest contractors.”

Holmes has starred in a variety of TV shows in the U.S. and Canada, starting with the 2003 premiere of “Holmes on Holmes” on HGTV Canada. He brought his adult kids on board for HGTV's “Holmes Family Rescue,” which premiered in December 2021. 

In a press release at the time, Holmes said, “I'm so fortunate to have built a team with my son Michael, who can build anything, and my daughter Sherry, who is very passionate about helping people and has a great eye for design. We're a family business that's in the business of helping families—and that feels good.”

“Holmes on Homes: Building a Legacy” premieres on October 7 at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

Bon Iver's Sable, Fable track “Day One” now has a music video. Directed by Jos Diaz Contreras, the short is set in a dystopian future where Bon Iver has retired and must be replaced by an imitator. Among the many hopefuls are Cristin Milioti, St. Vincent, Jacob Elordi in a fake beard, and the song's performers: featured artists Dijon and Flock of Dimes' Jenn Wasner, plus Justin Vernon himself. Watch the audition tapes below.

Milioti and Vernon go some way back: In 2021, she covered his 22, A Million song “715 Creeks,” and, more recently, she appeared in character as the mother of his child in a behind-the-scenes book that accompanied Sable, Fable. The new video follows another high-concept short for the LP, in which Vernon played a dual limo driver and divorce attorney soundtracked by the album's “From.”

On this week's Rollout Report Card episode of the Greatest Pop Stars podcast, we size up the larger era of the Swift album that became 2025's biggest on its very first day of release.

	Andrew Unterberger



	Even by Taylor Swift‘s standards, the numbers have been inconceivable. Billboard reported on Saturday that Swift's 12th album The Life of a Showgirl had, by the end of its Friday (Oct. 3) release day, already sold 2.7 million copies — the second-biggest performance of the entire modern era in just a day's time — while the set also broke streaming records left and right, particularly with lead single and opening track “The Fate of Ophelia.” The album is well on its way to becoming yet another career-defining commercial triumph for Swift — though the response to it from critics and from hardcore Swifties has maybe been a little more mixed so far.

	With this Rollout Report Card episode, host Andrew Unterberger is joined by Billboard staffers Danielle Pascual and Meghan Mahar as we look at everything surrounding The Life of a Showgirl — from the New Heights podcast where the new era was officially launched, to the artwork for the album (which at least one of us may have already purchased seven alternate vinyl editions of), to the Official Release Party film debuted last weekend in conjunction with the new set. We attempt to grade all aspects of the rollout, and whether or not the most-anticipated pop album of the year met either our own expectations, or the ones that Taylor (and now-fiancé Travis Kelce) explicitly established for it. 




	As we hand out our letter grades for all the most important factors in Swift's The Life of a Showgirl rollout — from the live performances and music videos to the new songs and overall “albuminess” — we answer all the most pressing questions: How well do we actually remember the fate of the original Ophelia? What's the best way to replicate the Official Release Party from the privacy of your own home? Is there actually any interpolating of George Michael's “Father Figure” in Taylor Swift's “Father Figure”? Do we want to see a full Taylor Swift-Charli XCX back-and-forth on record? And perhaps most importantly: How did the biggest pop star of our lifetimes possibly get way bigger yet again?

	In a deal worth substantial seven figures, Walt Disney Studios won an auction to acquire rights to Impossible Creatures, the fantasy series by acclaimed British author Katherine Rundell. She will adapt the first two series books into screenplays.


Impossible Creatures has become a publishing phenomenon on the order of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and Twilight Saga. Two of the five planned books have been published; Impossible Creatures was published in 2023, and the second installment, The Poisoned King, just debuted. Rundell just became the first U.K. children's author since J.K. Rowling to simultaneously reach the No. 1 position on the children's book charts in both the UK and the U.S. Her books so far have sold more than four million copies worldwide, and in 2024 she was awarded both Author of The Year and Children's Book of The Year at The British Book Awards. Rundell signed two 7-figure publishing deals with Bloomsbury and Knopf. What she originally planned as a trilogy has become a five-novel saga and Rundell plans to broaden the franchise with spinoffs and prequel books.

	These heady numbers on a global scale made Impossible Creatures a must-have Hollywood property, with visions of youth-appeal movies, merchandise and maybe theme park attractions dancing in the heads of studios looking for new IP. The thirtysomething author, a Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford and quondam fellow of Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, has been courted by studios and producers since she let it know that after the release of the second book, she was ready to make a deal.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	I'm told the finalists were Disney, Warner Bros and Netflix, and execs from all three headed to London this summer to lay out their vision. For Disney, the driver behind the deal was David Greenbaum, President of Disney Live Action and 20th Century Studios, along with Disney Live Action president Daria Cercek and Allison Erlikhman, SVP, Production, Disney Live Action, and Disney Head of Literary Affairs Clare Reeth. Along with Literary Affairs Director Emily Dayton, Reeth championed the book early. Watching keenly from afar were Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment Co-Chairman Alan Bergman.


	Disney came away with a deal that leaves the studio not only staked in the five-book series, but also Rundell and her creative partner Charles Collier. Their Impossible Films – run out of London by a team that includes Paddington 2 and Wonka producer Alexandra Derbyshire, and former Pixar CFO and Fox President of Studio Operations Simon Bax. Rundell will have a first look deal with Disney that includes all of her current and upcoming lit properties.


	You don't see Disney going all in like this on many properties, but this comes in an effort to move the live action menu beyond transfers of animated films – even though Lilo & Stitch so far has been the only Hollywood film to gross north of $1 billion. Greenbaum and 20th Century Studios President Steve Asbell put this kind of work into courting Bruce Springsteen and manager Jon Landau to broker a screen rights deal for the Warren Zanes book that became the upcoming Oscar-season release Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere. Whereas Asbell is a Jersey guy who told me at the New York Film Festival premiere party he was still tingling after asking The Boss his best moment at the Asbury Park haunt The Stone Pony while they shot there, and seeing Springsteen point to the bar and say that right there, he met Patti Scialfa. She would join the E Street Band as a singer, but more importantly, she married The Boss. Here, it was Greenbaum's turn to bond with Rundell. After all, she was a prof at the college where Greenbaum went to grad school, earning his graduate degree at Oxford.


	So what exactly got the studio so hot and bothered?


	The series takes place in the world of Gilmouria Archipelago. Christopher is a human boy who stumbles into the hidden entrance to the magical world while spending the holiday with his grandfather in the Scottish Highlands. He soon meets Mal, a girl from this hidden world of magical creatures, and together they attempt to save the creatures that are suffering from a decline in the magical force that keeps them alive and vibrant.  


	“When I read Impossible Creatures, I knew it belonged here at Disney,” said Disney CEO Bob Iger in a statement. “I was immediately drawn into the vibrant world Katherine imagined and the possibilities of what we could do together with this story.  Written by Katherine herself, these movies are in the best of hands with our Walt Disney Studios team, and I can't wait to see this tale brought to the screen.”


	Said Disney's Bergman and Greenbaum: “Katherine Rundell has masterfully crafted a spectacular and immersive world with Impossible Creatures and her vision is a perfect match for the Disney storytelling tradition.” We are thrilled to collaborate with Katherine and Charles to bring this epic saga to life for audiences worldwide—it's going to be an extraordinary adventure.”


	Who can know what happens to fantasy world creators when they taste the riches of franchise success – few saw the plot twist where Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling would use her notoriety to take toxic and polarizing transphobic positions – Oxford prof Rundell seems a good one to bet on. Disney is all in with an author whose work has been hailed critically for its cracking dialogue, and she will be hands on in the architecture of what Disney hopes will be a franchise universe. 

	











	“I'm absolutely thrilled to be linking arms with Disney,” the author said in a statement. “It's a privilege to be writing these screenplays and developing these first movies in the franchise together with Charles, my team at Impossible Films, and with the exceptional team at Disney. I'm especially grateful to Bob Iger, whose enthusiasm after reading the book helped set this collaboration in motion, and to Alan Bergman and David Greenbaum for being incredible partners throughout this process. Our ambition is to build Glimouria and Impossible Creatures into a spectacular series of films, so that we can entertain and inspire family audiences across the world.”


	The deal was brokered by Charles Collier at Chalcot Square Arts and Media Management on behalf of Rundell, directly with the Walt Disney Pictures team led by Greenbaum, Kal Walthers, Paige Olson and Bill Neuschaefer. Rundell is represented by Chalcot Square and RCW.

Taylor Swift stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon yesterday (October 6), making her first U.S. late-night appearance since the release on Friday of The Life of a Showgirl. Below, watch her break down the themes behind several of the album's songs, including an explanation of her much-maligned sex song “Wood.” She also chats about her friendship with Selena Gomez, the last film she saw (“We are so lucky to be alive at the same time as Paul Thomas Anderson,” she said of One Battle After Another), and her engagement to Travis Kelce.

Swift also took the chance to deny rumors that she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show over a dispute about owning the footage. “Jay-Z has always been very good to me,” she explained, adding that their business teams are close but there has not been “an official offer or a conference-room conversation.” She goes on, “We're always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field. Like, [football] is violent chess. That is gladiators without swords. That is dangerous…. Can you imagine if he's out there every single week, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I'm like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be?'”

The Life of a Showgirl has already broken the post-1991 U.S. record for the most vinyl copies sold in a single week—a record Swift herself set with 2024's The Tortured Poets Department. The album is now vying for the overall sales week record, a distinction long held by Adele for 2015's 25.

Over the weekend, Swift dropped a deluxe version of The Life of a Showgirl, featuring acoustic versions and demos from the album, on iTunes. She also premiered the music video for opening track “The Fate of Ophelia” at screenings of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, a theatrical release that compiled together lyric videos and behind-the-scenes footage. Watch the video below.

Joyce Manor are back with their first album in more than three years. Out January 30, 2026, via Epitaph, I Used to Go to This Bar is produced by Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz and follows the punk trio's 2022 album 40 oz. to Fresno. The band will tour behind the record next year—find the dates below. Also below, watch the Lance Bangs–directed, Great British Bake Off–satirizing video for lead single “Well, Whatever It Was,” which presents a cooking competition called The UK Rock Bake Off starring actors and musicians in character as British rock royalty: a gloomy Robert Smith, Oasis' Noel and Liam Gallagher (who have a conspicuous taste for the icing sugar), a curmudgeonly Morrissey, master chef Kate Bush, and, naturally, Joyce Manor themselves. Watch it go down below.

The band's Barry Johnson says in a press release, “‘Well, Whatever It Was' has got to be one of the most Southern California sounding songs ever recorded. I hear Jane's Addiction in the verses, Beach Boys / Weezer in the chorus, and RHCP in the outro. It was LITERALLY produced by the guy from Bad Religion FFS. Everyone was just firing on all cylinders for this one. Joey Warnoker's drumming, TLA's mix, and Lenny Castro's percussion all just sent it to the end-zone. This song would go insanely hard in a Shrek film.”

The video's cast includes Shapel Lacey, Brett Gurewitz, Jose Maldonado, Cam Gavinski, Bill O'Neill, Jack Wagner, Martin Andrew, Shari Gaynes, Moogsley, and John-Michael Sedor. No Age's Randy Randall contributed music to the video score.

Joyce Manor's North American tour features support from Militarie Gun, Teen Mortgage, and Combat. The band returned in August with “All My Friends Are So Depressed” and news of an imminent European stint, when they'll be joined by the Hotelier, Tiger's Jaw, Oso Oso, and Ways Away at select dates.

Netflix's Monster: The Ed Gein Story has no shortage of ambition. After all, as its poster stresses, its titular figure is responsible for three of the most influential films of all time: “Before Psycho,” its tagline reads, “before The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, before The Silence Of The Lambs…there was Ed.” It makes sense that the anthology series that's already offered viewers the tales of Jeffrey Dahmer and Lyle and Eric Menendez would turn its sights to this most infamous of serial killers. He's one who, as those films loosely inspired by him attest, has long captivated the curiosity of directors and audiences alike. And it's a testament to the wild ambitions of this Netflix series that Monster: The Ed Gein Story doesn't want to merely tell Gein's story but to mount an argument about how his life has refracted and reflected American culture's ever-changing ideas about horror—both in real life and onscreen.

Such a goal is an admirable one. There is plenty to be dissected about why Gein's crimes (particularly his penchant for exhuming bodies and creating keepsakes from skin and bone) so fascinate and what, in turn, we could learn about the very arc of consuming horror. How do images of desecrated bodies (like the concentration-camp photos that first titillated Gein in his youth) or scenes of violent mutilation (such as those featured in Texas Chain Saw) contribute to a visual economy that simultaneously nurtures and glamorizes serial killers like himself? What's the ethical imperative when aestheticizing this kind of violence, especially when it dovetails with issues of mental health and questions around gender and identification? How, in essence, does a show like Monster give itself license to offer a portrait of Gein that doesn't merely mine the sensationalist thirst for details of his life but creates room for complicating our complicity in wishing to have a front row seat to his gut-wrenching exploits?

A better version of Monster: The Ed Gein Story would not just ask these questions. It would actually tackle them with care and curiosity. Instead, those ambitious ideas remain thin premises onto which creators Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan (who wrote every episode and directed two of them) tacks on Gein's narrative haphazardly, making this season of Monster feel more intentionally fractured than its previous iterations. Sure, we may begin with a young Ed (Charlie Hunnam) stumbling through flailing attempts to appease his devout, domineering mother (played by Laurie Metcalf) and end with a graying Ed in a mental institution calmly reflecting back on a life bruised by crime and trauma. In between, though, Brennan remixes Gein's life, shuttling back and forth as needed, threading episodes from his past with scenes from those horror films he inspired, fictionalized moments from a Holocaust-themed comic book, and even imagined conversations with the likes of Christine Jorgensen.

The through-line of the season is a simple one: Ed Gein is a foundational serial-killer figure. It wasn't just that he inspired books and films. It was that he also inspired other murders. In presenting an origin story of sorts (while critiquing that very impulse), Monster insists that Ed was unique as well as a symptom for a world torn asunder, explaining why those images from the Holocaust are key to his development. If humanity could be responsible for such horrors—and would allow them to be re-presented (in photos, say), then what kind of monsters might it let loose in its wake? 

Well, someone like Gein, who cannot distinguish reality from the cruel fantasies he unwittingly creates for himself. When his perpetually aggrieved mother dies, he digs up a body, dresses it just like her, and believes (in earnest) that she remains alive to emotionally flay him for not following her every wish. She doesn't approve of his penchant for wearing lingerie and can't fathom him ever laying with a woman. She admits at one point that she wishes she would've castrated him; that's how much she didn't want him to fornicate. Such thorny messages about gender and desire, about who young Ed wants and wants to be (and how confused he remains about how blurred that line remains throughout his life) is what eventually leads him to kill several women near and dear to him, become a leather tanner (with human skin), and lose contact with the very reality around him. 

﻿

At times, Monster: The Ed Gein Story is quite engrossing even if it remains all too slick. (This is a Netflix/Murphy production, after all). That's nowhere clearer than in the casting of Hunnam. The actor plays Gein like a holy fool of sorts. His voice is high-pitched and tentative throughout, as if he's a child who doesn't yet know how to fill out the rooms (let alone the body) he comes to possess. And while the real Gein was not served well by the lithe Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, this Monster Gein looks…well, like Hunnam, a picture-perfect star whose every ab and muscle has been chiseled to exhaustion. When Ed puts on a bra and a pair of panties and parades himself in front of the mirror, Hunnam looks like a modern-day pinup boy, a far cry from the confused little kid Hunnam's eyes would have us believe he is. 

Such dissonance is everywhere in a show that, because of its painstakingly put together production design and flashy cinematography, remains all too consumed with a sleek aesthetic that lures us in while keeping us at a distance from the gruesome crimes being committed onscreen. (To give you an idea, the series even stages an “Owner Of A Lonely Heart”-scored fantasy sequence in which Gein is welcomed into a kind of serial-killer version of heaven.)

“You can't make someone look at something like this,” Anthony Perkins says (to himself, to Hitchcock, to an imagined version of Gein, but perhaps just directly at the audience, whom he faces in a tight close-up). He's talking about the horrors that happened in Gein's house that would soon be immortalized in Psycho. But he's also voicing the very tension Monster desperately exploits. No image and no scene is off-limits in this: not the Holocaust horrors (here filtered through sensationalist comic books about the “Bitch Of Buchenwald”) and not Gein's own (shots of desiccated vulvas, for instance may be offered in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it frame, but they're there nonetheless). Brennan teases us with coy questions about complicity before, as always is the case in the show, playfully winking at us as if an acknowledgment of such problematic ideas is the same as measured responses to it. “You're the one who can't look away,” Gein smirks back at the camera, punctuating the tone and tenor of Monster, an ambitious gamble of a meta-conversation about screened real-life horrors that's heavy on gore but very light on emotional or intellectual heft.

You have to see Kathryn Bigelow's riveting, harrowing, and all other manner of -ing adjectives “A House of Dynamite” to believe it. As our own Ryan Lattanzio best described the nuclear war drama in his glowing Venice review, “Bigelow's explosively entertaining real-time thriller, told from multiple perspectives at various levels of government from situation room deputies to POTUS … does not mince on hopelessness.” And for a film that essentially says “we're fucked,” it's about as entertaining as it gets.

Even its stars — and there are many of them, as the film tracks 18 minutes of real-time freak-out in three timelines across all sectors of the government and military, which means lots of people are involved — were riveted by what they saw when they first took in the finished film. That includes Rebecca Ferguson, who anchors the first segment of the film as Captain Olivia Walker, a senior officer in the White House Situation Room, the sort of no-fuss, let's-get-it-done person you'd love to have on hand during an emergency.

“It wasn't until I saw the film that it hit me, the gravitas and the importance of it,” Ferguson said during a recent interview with IndieWire in New York City. “It was a screening in London and I remember us all, after the film ended, we all just sat completely silent. We [usually] don't really sit and look at the credits and the people involved, you kind of stand up and start talking. But there were no words. There was nothing to be said.”

The first thing Ferguson does remember being said? “My [18-year-old] son turned to me and he said, ‘It's the first role, mum, that you've played where I have seen my mum.' And I thought that is probably the best compliment that I've ever had because I think that's what we were trying to do, that sort of authentic nature of a human being.”

Ferguson makes off with arguably the most emotional and centered of the film's performances, turning her minimal before-work time, her quick commute, and her 18 minutes in hell into one of the most compelling turns of the year. In a film that counts stars like Idris Elba, Tracy Letts, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, and Jason Clarke among its biggest names, that's no small feat. But Ferguson, from “Mission: Impossible” to “Dune” is always riveting, and she's always trying to find the heart of her parts. 

But that doesn't mean she wasn't a bit scared about the possibilities of the Netflix film. For Ferguson, the jitters started early, when she was told that Bigelow, one of her favorite filmmakers, wanted to chat with her about a potential role. Thrilling and scary.

“The first thing was the phone call saying that Kathryn Bigelow wants to Zoom. That was sort of, I didn't really know what to say, we say these things, ‘I've always wanted to work with…,' but to be honest, Kathryn has been on my top bucket list,” the actress said. “And then being on a Zoom, listening to her, she didn't really give away the story. I think she was feeling out the vibe, and we vibed very quickly. And then I got to read Noah's script and then I realized what I was in for.”

 










So, what's it like when Rebecca Ferguson vibes with someone like Kathryn Bigelow?

“It's just a click,” she said. “I had such an enormous respect for her [already]. When you don't have to prove yourself, when there's not a feeling of a competition and there's someone sitting in front of you very raw, very open about certain things and ‘I wish to work with you, cards are on the table,' it becomes some form of a friendship. What can I bring? What could I do to help tell this story? I like her as a human being. I think she is beyond intelligent. She is kind. She's soft. Internally, she is super-focused, but she doesn't shove her opinion down your throat. And I think there's an enormous power in people who can balance that act.”

Ferguson said she's experienced this sort of “luxury” before, namely with her “Dune” filmmaker Denis Villeneuve. “It's not to criticize anyone else, but it's because they're the most active ones I've worked with, and it's phenomenal and I wish more people would work that way,” she added.

(For the fellow “Dune” fans out there: Ferguson said she's already filmed her part in the upcoming third film. “I don't have a big part in this one, [she's] just barely in the book. I'm not sure I was supposed to be in it and Denis had a little idea,” she said. “The script is phenomenal. It's really hard to create a film, it's such a dense book. There's so much to tell. [Denis] does dip in and out and he does try and he does want to have certain connections and tentacles to the book. Whatever Denis touches I think is phenomenal.”)

 










When Ferguson finally got her hands on Noah Oppenheim's script, she had a little of the same jolt audience members might feel when the movie starts and a nuke suddenly appears, heading straight for the middle of America. Who is that and what does that mean and where are we? But there was something liberating about the combination of maximum detail and minimum time.

“There are so many abbreviations and so much Army language and intelligence language, that I had to dissect and stop and really understand it. But in general, from A to B or A to Z, it's a very clear film, it's a very clear message,” she said. “What I liked about it is, you only have those 18 minutes, including maybe another five minutes for me in the beginning at home to create a character for her. And that was challenging. … It's so perfectly orchestrated, the emotional arc that we need to go through as the viewers, but it's only 18 minutes.”

Because of the structure of the film, we really only spend one-third of it with Ferguson's Olivia. But the actress is meticulous with her character-building, and she said she did a lot of preparation to ground herself in the role, to really find the person underneath the military jabber.

“I definitely need to do a character breakdown for myself,” she said. “I liked the idea that she was quite messy, and the way that she interacted with her child and husband, she was a bit floopy. In my head, she was the one who, when she cooks, everything is everywhere and her husband is constantly cleaning up after her. I love the contrast of her putting her [high heel] shoes on after walking in her extremely ugly but comfortable gym shoes to work. Listening to a podcast in her headphones, she doesn't like the ear pods because they are uncomfortable, so I had these strings that constantly would get wrapped up in things in my bag. I like the contrast of coming into a character that is so specific and detailed and accurate and who runs the situation, but these are things no one else really sees.”

 










Ferguson, it seems, is often putting that pressure on herself. Bigelow was eager to take away some of those stresses and worries. She knew the drama was built-in, it didn't need much extra.

“The ego of an actor, it's like, ‘What can I do? I want to have nuts in my pocket! Brad Pitt always eats and talks. I want to be that person,'” Ferguson said with a laugh. “You're trying to push ideas. And Kathryn was kind of just listening and kind of just taking it all back and going, ‘We have a set-up and the humanity is going to come when we're in the scenes. Those cracks are going to appear and the cameras are going to be there and you don't have to know where they are as long as you know your job.' And that's what happened.”

Ferguson also spent significant time meeting with the sort of people who would be in the very situation room where Olivia works. Like people who see the film, she's in awe of both the deep preparation that goes into planning for the sort of event we see dramatized in the film and terrified by what happens when those plans run out.

“They are so highly trained, they train 400 times a year, it's twice a day when it comes to nuclear threat, any form of national threat, so they have a procedure,” she said. “The problem is when you get to a point [that the] president, who has never been briefed ever on what to do if there's a nuclear threat, is the person who just sits with his finger on the button, when everyone else around him are so trained to actually make a decision. But it also comes down to the humanity aspect of it, what kind of decision do you make?”

 










Ferguson worked closely with intelligence expert Larry Pfeiffer, who served as the Senior Director of the president's round-the-clock operations and intelligence center from 2011 through 2013. He's basically the guy Jason Clarke is playing in the film. Ferguson said Pfeiffer was invaluable, answering her questions on everything from nuclear threats to desktop decor.

“I'm curious as a person. I love learning about other people's specialties and interests, and the moment that I was given this role, within a couple of weeks, I was in contact with Larry and I was texting him the most silly questions,” she said. “Like, ‘Am I allowed anything of my own personal items?' ‘No, you can have your thermos, you have your coffee, but you have no pictures, you have nothing personal.' And that kind of explains a lot of what we do in the work. We are not people with opinions. We are not people with political agendas. We are there as a switchboard to connect and to think 10 steps ahead.”

Ferguson said that Pfieffer was also quick to note some of the less thrilling aspects of the job. “He said, ‘We're quite boring. Nothing really happens. We make sure the president has real-time information if needed. And other than that, we talk about our families and it's very chill,'” she recalled. “The fact that you get to experience something like this is very, very rare. I think, even them at high pressure, that's when the cracks happen. What do you do when you have four minutes left?”

 










During the course of the film, we often see Olivia running the situation room, as Clarke's Admiral Mark Miller dips in and out. When Clarke arrived on set, the actress said, she'd be doing a little life-imitating-art to prepare.

“Jason Clarke came in a little bit later with his role, and [before he arrived], I took it upon myself to run the room. On set, I felt comfortable to delegate, to send information, to ask people to do certain things. I think I did it also to get into that role, because it's quite uncomfortable to hold a room,” she said. “And the moment that Jason walked in, it was quite apparent to me that he was my boss. Jason walks and he around the entire room and he stands in front of the screens and just addresses the entire room. I remember looking at him thinking, ‘I've met my match. That's my boss right there. Good to know.'”

Ferguson is a wonderful conversationalist, quick-witted and funny and always listening. When I asked her how she found her American accent for the film — literally, how she discovered and worked at it — she quickly asked me back, “How did you find my American accent?” Like, what did I think of it? (I had no problem with it.)

“I find American hard, but I find [all] accents claustrophobic because you don't have the freedom,” Ferguson said. “People always comment on it and criticize it, but to be honest, it's a job. I'm asked to do a role. Kathryn Bigelow asked me to do a film. It's an American accent. You just fucking do it. And it's tricky and it's difficult and it doesn't come natural to me. I work very hard, but you're constantly locked [to the accent], you don't really have the freedom of thought. I try! And I try and always convince my director that I don't have to have an accent, but I didn't win on this one.”

 










Asked what she remembered from the freneticism of filming, she laughed. “It's like giving birth. I kind of don't really remember,” Ferguson said. “What I do remember is, we shot it sequentially, so we didn't jump, which was everything. You got to go through the emotional arc of everything. We also had it set up with what we call The Brady Bunch: on my computer screen, I could see the grid of everyone, the vice president, the president, every single character in the film, including Gabriel [Basso], who's running around, which was hilarious. All of those people were filming at the same time, so we had cameras on the computers, we had cameras in the room, and on action, everyone had their cue. I've never been on stage, but I can imagine that it was some form of a documentarian stage film, and it made it so accurate, so quickly and so present.”

Even now, so many months on from actually making the film, Ferguson is still buzzing over the many questions it asks. She doesn't pretend to have the answers, but the questioning remains imperative to her. That's what the film is about. That's what the film does.

“I think the greater question is, how do we live in a world where nuclear threat and nuclear protection is the one to go to? Why is that an option at all?,” Ferguson said. “How do we not de-escalate the nuclear weapons that are around in the world? It's mind-blowing. It's also a conversation that has been going on. The fact that we've made a film? It's not that something has changed radically right now, … but my understanding is we do not communicate about it [the way we did after the Cold War]. And this is what Kathryn's doing: She's bringing a topic to the table, to every household, to say, ‘Look at this. Look at where we're living. We are living in a house of dynamite. Should we? Is this what we voted for? Is this what we should have?'”

 










Netflix will release “A House of Dynamite” in select theaters on Friday, October 10 and on its streaming platform on Friday, October 24.

Ozzy Osbourne‘s life story has been told many times. In addition to his 2010 memoir, I Am Ozzy, there's a 1998 episode of VH1's Behind the Music, the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, the 2020 documentary Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, countless articles and books, and the Paramount+ documentary Ozzy: No Escape From Now, which chronicles Osbourne's painful last years and his quest to play one final concert. Osbourne died in July.


	If you've encountered even some of them, you know the broad strokes: working-class upbringing in Birmingham, laying the groundwork for heavy metal as the frontman of Black Sabbath, fucking it all up due to psychotic levels of excess, meeting wife and manager Sharon at a low point, rebuilding his career as a solo star in the early Eighties with help from guitarist Randy Rhoads, the tragic accident that killed Rhoads, No More Tears, Ozzfest, the reality show, brutal injuries and addiction issues, and his uncanny ability to somehow survive it all until his body began failing him in 2018.

	It might seem like there's not much story left to tell, especially when you factor in No Escape From Now and its many revelations. But Osbourne spent the final years of his life working with his I Am Ozzy collaborator Chris Ayres on a follow-up memoir titled Last Rites, which arrives this week. It focuses largely on the difficult final chapter of his life and the numerous medical setbacks he faced, but it also flashes back to encounters with Keith Moon, Bon Scott, Steve Marriott, and other long-departed rock icons. Here's 14 things we learned.

	











	Back in 2018, Ozzy launched the No More Tours II Tour. The plan was to finally retire from the road when it wrapped. (As the title suggests, this was his second farewell tour.) But even in the middle of it, Sharon Osbourne was looking ahead. “Sharon was even talking about me taking up one of them golden-oldie residencies in Las Vegas when I got back,” Ozzy writes. “Not that I fancied the idea of becoming the next Barry Manilow.”

	After years of sobriety and lots of work with addition experts, Osbourne started drinking again in 2012. “At some point I decided I could handle a drink,” he writes. “Probably a pint of Guinness. I dream about Guinness almost every night. I fucking love the stuff, it's like drinking a glass of pudding. The problem is, one's too many, and ten's not enough. And the first thing I want after a Guinness is to go looking for some coke. Cocaine's the alcoholic's best friend.”


	On the farewell tour, Osbourne began using the steroid Decadron to treat vocal inflammation. It didn't take long for him to become hopelessly addicted. He even began suffering from ‘roid rages that resulted in a black eye. “Sharon got heavy with me after that,” Osbourne writes. “She hired this military guy with a neck wider than the Watford Gap to come and watch over me. Where she found this bloke, I've no idea. He just appeared by my side one day, like an angry mountain in human form, and never left.”


	For a brief period around 2002 and 2003, Osbourne was the star of one of the biggest shows on television. “I got addicted to the fame for a while, if I'm being honest with you,” he writes. “At the end of the day, though, I'm a singer, not a TV personality. I mean, I liked being in The Osbournes, but I hated working in TV. It's a vipers' nest, TV, it really is. It's not like being in music. You've got no friends in TV. The rivalry's off the charts. Everyone just wants what you've got, it's so phony all the time.”


	“For us, by the end of our run, we all were desperate to get our lives back,” Osbourne writes. “Jack was on drugs. Kelly was on drugs. I was sneaking up to my room to smoke weed at every opportunity. Then Sharon got cancer. The toll was bad, man. My poor wife was so sick, it took her the longest time to get over that. It took all of us a long time to come down from the high of the show, the stress of it … to go from reality TV to actual reality again. When the final camera guy left, it was such a relief, man.”

	In 1986, Osbourne became so enthralled with Peter Gabriel's So that he wore the tape out, and drove everyone in his life crazy. “I'd play [So] all day on the tour bus,” Osbourne writes. “I'd play it all night at whatever hotel we were staying in. I'd crank it up on my boombox if I was by a swimming pool. And at all other times — other than when I was on stage — I'd be singing one of the songs from it at the top of my voice. It got to the point where [my security guard] couldn't take it any more. It broke him, that record. He had to take time off, just so he could go a day without hearing ‘Sledgehammer.'”


	“I'm there on this New York sidewalk pounding on this [studio] door until eventually one of them little peep-hole things pops open,” Osbourne writes, “and a voice on the other side goes, ‘Who's there?' And I'm like, ‘It's Ozzy.' ‘Ozzy who?' ‘Ozzy fucking Osbourne, who the fuck do you think?' ‘Oh. OK.' The door opens, and this guy's standing there packing heat. Meanwhile, there are two blokes behind him, and they're also packing heat. And I'm like, fucking hell, I should have been a bit more polite.”


	Van Halen famously opened up for Black Sabbath in 1978. Osbourne loved Eddie Van Halen, but he didn't care much for the group's frontman. “He was like Mr. Showbiz,” Osbourne writes. “Always smiling. Never unhappy. He comes from a well-to-do family, I believe, maybe that's why we had nothing in common. You also never knew if he was spinning you a load of bullshit or telling you something for real. One minute he's saying he's getting his law degree, the next he's saying he's a part-time paramedic. There's a story going around that the two of us had a ‘cocaine duel' during that tour — meaning, who could snort the most coke before they keeled over. I mean, it's possible it happened. But I doubt it. It just wasn't the kind of thing I did with Dave.”


	Osbourne was crushed when drummer Bill Ward dropped out of the Black Sabbath reunion in 2012. Rick Rubin had a very unconventional idea for a replacement: Cream's Ginger Baker. “God rest his soul,” Osbourne writes. “But Baker was crazier than me. I mean, there was a documentary about him, Beware of Mr. Baker, where he broke the director's nose with a metal cane at his house in South Africa. And that was after the guy had been thrown out of every other country. Not that he would have taken the job anyway. He was nuts. He'd have been a liability on tour.”

	











	Brad Wilk wound up playing on Sabbath's last album, but Osbourne didn't want him to join the tour. “I said, if Tommy [Clufetos] ain't on drums for the tour, I ain't doing the tour,” he writes. “It caused a lot of resentment when I pulled that move. Brad even called me up and said, ‘Why don't you want me to do this gig?' All I could say was, ‘Brad, if you were Tommy, and you'd been there for all the writing, and Rick had wanted you gone, how would you feel?' He had no answer to that. There wasn't an answer. The truth was, Brad did good work on the album. But in my mind, Tommy should have been there all along, and he deserved to be on the tour. At the same time, I'll admit I was just so used to doing my own thing and having my own band it was really hard to not be in control. Maybe that's why the atmosphere onstage never felt that great … The album and the tour were successful beyond what any of us could ever have dreamed of. But it would have been so much better if it had been friendly, and if we'd had Bill there. Tommy did a great job on the drums, don't get me wrong. But he'd be the first to admit he ain't Bill and never could be.”


	After exchanging very sharp barbs in the press, Osbourne and Ward didn't communicate for a full decade. They finally got back in touch when Ward learned about Osbourne's injury in 2019. “I ain't ashamed to say I shed a tear when I spoke to Bill,” Osbourne writes. “‘We may have all got ripped off, Bill,' I said, ‘but our lives were forever changed by what we did.' ‘I know, Ozzy, I know,' he said. ‘We're lucky guys. We can't complain.' ‘I love you, y'know,' I told him. It went very quiet for a moment on the line. ‘I love you too, Ozzy, you fucking lunatic.' That's one of the great things about getting older. Even if you're a working-class guy from Aston, you stop being as scared of showing your emotions. Because you know that if you wait too long to tell someone how much they mean to you, the chance might never come around again.”


	In 2016, credible reports hit the tabloids that Osbourne was engaged in an affair with his hair colorist. He doesn't get into any specifics or names, but he admits that he wasn't faithful to Sharon during this time. “Sharon had every right to dump me when she found out what was going on,” he writes. ‘I'd become addicted to sex, basically. It was no different than when I was addicted to booze, pills, cigars, ice cream or Yorkshire fucking tea … I was a bad guy. I fucked around for a while. I broke my wife's heart, and I'm lucky she forgave me. I just hope all the people I hurt know how sorry I am — including the kids, who were badly affected. And that's all I wanna say about any of that, 'cos bringing it up just causes more pain.”

	“We didn't talk about it much, but we all felt it,” Osbourne writes. “I could tell. It was sad, man. We'd all started off together. We'd all groveled through the shit together. We'd all got successful together. We'd all traveled the world together. We'd all got fucked over together. There are no two ways about it, Bill should have been there, and he should have been on the album. Without him, it wasn't Black Sabbath. It was just a close approximation.”


	“First was a guy in Canada who said if we paid him $170,000 he'd put me through a new kind of CAT scan, which could show everything that was wrong with me,” Osbourne writes. “So Sharon wired him the money and we went over to his clinic. But the machine was just a regular fucking X-ray machine. Then he gave me this box of ‘special medicine' that was just a bunch of herbs and whatever, the same stuff you can buy on Amazon. What a con. At least we got our money back after Sharon went stage-five crazy on him. Then we got suckered again, paying $100,000 to another miracle healer who had something called a PAP-IMI machine, which can supposedly cure anything with electromagnetic waves. I spent six days on that thing, three hours a day, only to find out later that it hasn't been proven to be safe and is illegal in the U.S. After all that, I was like, fuck it, I'll stick to Tylenol.”

	In August 2016, exciting news about an unprecedented partnership between the gun industry's trade group and the country's leading suicide prevention organization popped up on social media. The collaboration, the posts said, aimed to “reduce the annual suicide rate 20 percent by 2025.”


	The “bold goal,” as it was called by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, was the centerpiece of the organization's initiative titled “Project 2025,” which AFSP had launched less than a year earlier, well before a different program with the same name became associated with Donald Trump.


	Because guns are involved in more than half of suicide deaths that occur in the United States each year, AFSP, a nonprofit, had sought the help of another nonprofit, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents firearm manufacturers, ranges, and sellers.

	The new partnership suggested that both the NSSF and AFSP were putting public health above partisan politics. They collaborated on brochures and other materials that contained valuable information on suicide warning signs and prevention strategies, including directly asking a person if they're thinking about taking their life. The NSSF made the materials available to thousands of its retailer and range members, who had the option of setting them out for customers. The organization also devoted a section of its website to suicide awareness.

	











	Project 2025 had immense public relations value. For AFSP, it was a potent rallying cry for potential donors and volunteers — a clear, galvanizing mission that could be achieved with enough support. For the NSSF, the partnership cast the trade group and the industry it represents as proactive, even perhaps at the expense of profit, and worthy of goodwill from lawmakers, regulators, and adversaries. Since 1995, gun suicide had accounted for the majority of all gun deaths in America, according to a report by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. By 2010, the number was consistently surpassing 60 percent, and the victims were mostly white men, the gun industry's top customers.

	











	But from the start, the joint initiative was on a troubled course, according to an investigation by The Trace and Rolling Stone, the fourth part of an ongoing series about the gun industry. Internal emails, documents, and a recording of a Zoom meeting reveal a partnership that in critical ways gave first priority to messaging and the interests of the gun industry.

	In fact, records show that AFSP avoided actions that could've jeopardized its relationship with the NSSF. In one instance, the director of writing and entertainment outreach cut from a document language that he worried would offend the NSSF, according to revisions and comments in the Word file. The organization expressly barred a gun violence prevention group from distributing materials at AFSP events. Soon after the collaboration was announced, an internal AFSP memo from September 2016 instructed chapters to “be cautious when partnerships, conferences, and events include language like ‘gun safety' and/or ‘gun violence' — since these terms are also being used by gun control organizations.” The guidance added, “If AFSP is approached to speak at a conference or event where the agenda is not clear and the firearms community is not involved, please decline participation.” 


	Then, well short of the program's end date, AFSP quietly shut down Project 2025 — a decision that hasn't previously been made public. 


	AFSP's chief medical officer and public face, Christine Moutier, sent an internal email on May 11, 2023, announcing that Project 2025's vice president, director of strategic health care initiatives, and senior project manager had been fired. “Effective today,” the email said, “the Project 2025 department is being eliminated.”

	Moutier framed the change as a natural evolution. “It is the right time to re-envision Project 2025's [sic] and to fold the most impactful areas of this project into the organization's work.” She did not mention the “bold goal.”


	But since Project 2025's inception, suicides — especially gun suicides — had remained stubbornly high, and were trending in the wrong direction. In 2016, when the NSSF and AFSP announced their partnership, there were 22,938 suicide deaths involving a firearm in the United States, according to data drawn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and analyzed by Cassandra Crifasi, a public health professor at Johns Hopkins University. That comprised 51 percent of all suicides for that year. In 2023, the most recent year for which finalized data is available, there were 27,300 suicides involving a firearm, making up 55 percent of all suicides that year.

	











	The NSSF declined to provide a comment in response to an email detailing the reporting for this story. 


	María de los Ángeles Corral, AFSP's vice president of public relations, replied to the same email. “We established the goal to reduce the annual suicide rate by 20 percent by 2025 to drive urgency and action that saves lives,” she wrote. “Just as organizations fighting cancer and heart disease set bold targets, setting this goal helped us catalyze action across communities and environments with a high potential for impact to implement evidence-informed actions in the fight against suicide.” She added that the two organizations “never exchanged money” and that “all of the strategies developed as part of Project 2025 have been woven into AFSP's ongoing suicide prevention work.”


	After the Project 2025 department was shut down, records show, AFSP told staff to be discreet about sharing information, and took measures to cover tracks. The willingness to tackle the bold goal had enhanced the reputations of both the NSSF and AFSP, leading to financial rewards for the latter. Now the goal is gone, but the partnership remains in place, unbound from any deadline that could be used to measure its progress. 


	THE AUGUST 2016 PRESS RELEASE that announced the collaboration between AFSP and the NSSF quoted both Robert Gebbia, AFSP's CEO, and Stephen Sanetti, then the NSSF's president. “Through Project 2025 analysis and the work of this partnership, we know that this public education has the potential to save thousands of lives,” Gebbia said. Sanetti added, “Since two-thirds of all fatalities involving firearms are suicides, we are now also in the forefront of helping to prevent these deaths through our new relationship with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.”


	That month, a memorandum of understanding between AFSP and the NSSF went into effect. “The parties shall act in the best interests of the other at all times during the Term of this MOU,” it said, “and shall disclose any real or potential conflicts that are adverse to the interests of the other as they arise.” The MOU specified, “Such conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, positions advanced by one party [that] do not align with the positions advanced by the other and the issuance of any public statement by a party that harms or could harm the other.”

	











	Around the same time, in a document stamped “for internal use only,” AFSP established new guidelines governing how its chapters across the country could engage with other groups that have an interest in suicide prevention. That meant imposing restrictions for working with gun violence prevention organizations.


	The document began by stating that AFSP's partnership with the NSSF was a “strategic decision,” and a part of the “bold goal of reducing the annual suicide rate 20 percent by 2025.”


	“We did not come to this decision lightly,” the document read. “We have set aside the contentious politics surrounding the subject of firearms to focus our attention on public education of suicide prevention.”


	The document directed chapters to “engage in partnerships, conferences, and events which include at least one of the following: firearms retailers, shooting range owners, firearm safety instructors, and/or the firearms-owning community.” What then followed was a list of “do's” and “don'ts,” including warnings about summits that use “gun safety” and “gun violence” language, and participation in any gathering that has an unclear agenda and does not involve the “firearms community.”


	“If AFSP is invited to sponsor or speak at a conference or event, the program and speakers need to include some representation from the firearms community,” the first “do” said.   


	The second “don't” instructed, “If AFSP is invited to engage in any partnerships, or speak at any conferences or events with a gun control group or gun violence group, please decline participation, unless the firearms community is also involved in the program.”


	On occasions when it was necessary to decline, the document suggested language: “Thank you for thinking of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. We commend your dedication to mental health and suicide prevention. At this time, AFSP is in a pilot phase with our firearms and suicide prevention initiative, and is limiting public engagements. We will keep future opportunities in mind to support your efforts.” 


	A year later, chapters of the gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action wanted to set up informational tables at AFSP's signature “Out of the Darkness” walks. The events rely on the participation of volunteers around the country who have lost someone to suicide and want to be involved in an effort to raise awareness and funds for the organization. An AFSP vice president emailed field staff about the inquiries. “One issue has to do with this group's legislative stance related to guns, which is inconsistent with AFSP's policy that our efforts in the firearms space be educational with the goal of preventing suicide, not legislative or advocacy,” the vice president said. “For this reason, we are advising against having Moms Demand Action table at AFSP walks.”

	











	The next month, a senior AFSP director followed up with an “Out of the Darkness” chair who was concerned about a Moms Demand Action group that wanted to walk as a team. The senior director said they could walk but “cannot approach our walkers or hand out flyers to discuss their organization's message or mission.”


	All of these actions appeared consistent with the MOU, raising questions about whether self-defeating impediments were baked into the partnership. A review of the collaboration's co-branded suicide prevention materials show that the two groups never jointly provided potentially life-saving information on Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which allow people to use civil courts to temporarily restrict a mentally unstable family member's access to firearms. Suicide is typically an impulsive act, but ERPOs are frequently the subject of disinformation among gun owners, who have been wrongly told by gun-rights groups that the tool deprives citizens of due process rights. Not using the partnership to share accurate guidance about ERPOs was akin to fighting a wildfire with buckets of water instead of a hose. This was the case even though an internal AFSP document from 2017 said the group was an “advocate” for the “temporary removal of firearms during periods of increased risk of suicide,” adding: “Research has shown that separating suicidal individuals from a variety of lethal means helps prevent suicide.”


	AFSP's public relations official says that the group has at times “worked with” Moms Demand Action and its parent organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, which provides annual grants to The Trace, to ​​“educate people on safe storage and extreme risk protection orders.” She also says that AFSP has provided “support for extreme risk protection orders in 14 states,” adding that it is “a stance on which we are opposed to the NSSF.”


	When asked to clarify and describe these efforts, the public relations official did not respond. Moreover, any AFSP support for ERPOs has occurred outside the parameters of its NSSF partnership, which was established to reach gun owners.  

	











	Records show that AFSP's sensitivity to NSSF concerns persisted years into their collaboration. In 2022, when the organization was editing a document called “Project 2025: Firearms Roadmap for Chapters,” AFSP's then director of writing and entertainment outreach cut the phrase: “AFSP does not support the mission of NSSF.” By way of explanation, the staffer typed in the margins, “I want to be careful of continuing our nice relationship with NSSF.”


	OVER TIME, PROJECT 2025'S BOLD GOAL was woven into the fabric of AFSP's fundraising infrastructure. It received top-billing in the organization's public annual reports. “We can do this together: Reducing the Annual Suicide Rate 20% by 2025,” a typical one said, adding that AFSP had “assembled the top minds in the field and used dynamic data modeling to determine which prevention methods could have the greatest impact.”


	The goal was used to recruit donors for “Out of the Darkness” walks, which, in prominence, are similar to cancer-awareness fundraising events like “Race for the Cure.” “I'm walking … to fight suicide and support AFSP's bold goal to reduce the suicide rate 20 percent by 2025,” went a standard volunteer pitch. “Please help me reach my goal by clicking the ‘Donate' button on this page.”


	AFSP's fundraising emails also featured the objective: “This bold goal will not only save lives but help us reach new milestones in mental health awareness and suicide prevention,” a 2020 email stated. “Help us make a big impact in suicide prevention and give today!”


	There was even a “bold goal” web page, still up today. The “donate now” button appears at the top.


	For its part, the NSSF and its members touted participation in Project 2025 in congressional testimony, business documents, and in lobbying materials submitted to lawmakers. In 2018, when one of the group's state lobbyists wrote to the chair of Vermont's House Judiciary Committee opposing a bill that would ban large-capacity magazines in the state, he included supplemental information on the organization's partnership with AFSP, despite the bill having no connection to suicide. In a 2024 letter to top lawmakers in Maine about another gun-related bill, he wrote, “Our retailer members are connected to a nationwide effort developed by AFSP called Project 2025, which seeks to reduce the annual U.S. suicide rate by 20 percent by the year 2025.” 


	After the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a gun company, then called American Outdoor Brands Corporation, pointed to its NSSF membership and Project 2025 as an example of its concern for firearms safety. And two months after the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, when Congress held a hearing to probe gun manufacturers, the written testimony of Christopher Killoy, an NSSF board member and then president and CEO of firearms manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc., similarly described the NSSF's work to help AFSP achieve the bold goal. 

	











	The initiative was a source of hope for people like Alex Smith, a 30-year-old Texan whose boyfriend had died by suicide in 2016. When she looked into getting involved with AFSP and learned about the goal, it gave her a “feeling of trust and relief” during a period of intense darkness. “The suicide destroyed me,” she recalls. “I had the impression they had a secret sauce, because otherwise they'd be exploiting our pain, and that can't be true, so it had to be real.”


	AT NO POINT DID THE NSSF or AFSP temper the public's expectations about the achievability of reducing suicide 20 percent by 2025. Four days after AFSP chief medical officer Christine Moutier emailed staff about shutting down the Project 2025 department — some 18 months shy of 2025 — longtime AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia told the staff and volunteers who had gathered to hear their leaders discuss the surprise changes on a May 15, 2023, Zoom: “I just want to say it right out: The bold goal is not changing.”


	But then Gebbia revealed “a little history.”


	“We created the bold goal in 2015, and it was aspirational,” he said. “It came out of work with a consultant that was guiding us through a strategic plan at the time and said, ‘Have you ever thought about setting a bold goal? Be audacious, be bold.' And it was supposed to be far more than a — it was to motivate us, and motivate the field and all of that. It wasn't a hard and fast goal. But once we set it, we said, ‘Gee, what can we do differently that might help us accomplish it?'”


	Gebbia explained that it took the next “two years” to “figure out” what could be done to “reach that audacious goal,” a course of action that included bringing in the NSSF in 2016. 


	Since Project 2025's launch, Gebbia emphasized in the Zoom, the program's department had all been an AFSP appendage. Now, he said, it is time to “integrate it and get it to scale.” 


	Moutier, Gebbia's younger, telegenic colleague, glancingly acknowledged that the organization was embarking on a new course even though Project 2025's results had not been achieved. “When I'm asked over and over again, out there in the wider world, ‘Well, with all of this science and these newfound effective strategies, why is the rate going up — overall?'” she said, before providing an answer: “We are still just scratching the surface on scaled implementation.”

	











	Moutier then addressed the messaging problem posed by shutting down Project 2025. “I know that for your work and in your role, the brand of Project 2025 has been kind of the framework, and you've been preaching Project 2025, and using that framework as a tool,” she said. “And so we're very sensitive to the fact that we're going to need to be very clear and shift and help you — and for ourselves, as well — speak about the work in a way that still has a very clear message to it. We know we will need to work on that.”


	One person directly asked, “Are we eliminating Project 2025 from our vocabulary?”


	“The answer is yes,” Gebbia responded. “But it's not going to happen instantly. It's on our website. We have materials. It's a phase out of it.”


	Another person inquired about the bold goal presentations used to promote AFSP's work, and whether it would be necessary to cancel a forthcoming meeting.


	“I don't think we should stop,” Gebbia said. “I don't think momentum should stop.” As an example, he said that a fundraising email had recently been sent out, and “all we did was take out P25. All the rest of the language stayed exactly the same.”


	On June 8, AFSP circulated an internal memo about the transition. While there was never a public announcement about the premature end of Project 2025, AFSP made digital adjustments. “The Project 2025 website link now redirects to the main afsp.org page,” the memo said. “We are working to create a temporary landing page to communicate the focus areas effectively while removing language around Project 2025.”


	The memo noted that the program's firearms safety brochures did not specifically mention Project 2025, “so please continue to order and use these materials at tabling events,” it advised, adding that AFSP's partnership with the NSSF would continue. 


	Finally, the memo instructed, “Do not feel compelled to explain the change in AFSP's approach to the work of P25 to every group or audience. You can use judgment regarding when it is appropriate to present the slides as they are; when a simple mention of the change may be necessary and when a full explanation is warranted. To most audiences, the shift in how we do the work and the ending of the uniquely branded P25 may not be relevant to them.”

	It's not known how much money Project 2025 brought into AFSP, but according to its annual audits, there was in 2022 a peak of nearly $2 million in funds restricted for the program. According to the group's most recent audit, from 2024, it had nearly a million dollars that was legally designated for Project 2025. AFSP did not answer a question about what will happen, or has happened, with the money. Meanwhile, preliminary suicide data for that year shows that gun suicide deaths once again went up — to 27,592.

	











	The AFSP official did disclose, about cash, that the group “spent more than $1 million of unrestricted funds on Project 2025, which extended beyond firearms to the correctional and health sectors.” It is not clear what the NSSF knows about the end of the initiative. Until September, the NSSF's website contained a page that described its collaboration with AFSP, Project 2025, and the bold goal. That page is now gone.

This story is published in partnership with The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence. Subscribe to its newsletters. 


	In August 2016, exciting news about an unprecedented partnership between the gun industry's trade group and the country's leading suicide prevention organization popped up on social media. The collaboration, the posts said, aimed to “reduce the annual suicide rate 20 percent by 2025.”


	The “bold goal,” as it was called by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, was the centerpiece of the organization's initiative titled “Project 2025,” which AFSP had launched less than a year earlier, well before a different program with the same name became associated with Donald Trump.


	Because guns are involved in more than half of suicide deaths that occur in the United States each year, AFSP, a nonprofit, had sought the help of another nonprofit, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents firearm manufacturers, ranges, and sellers. 


	The new partnership suggested that both the NSSF and AFSP were putting public health above partisan politics. They collaborated on brochures and other materials that contained valuable information on suicide warning signs and prevention strategies, including directly asking a person if they're thinking about taking their life. The NSSF made the materials available to thousands of its retailer and range members, who had the option of setting them out for customers. The organization also devoted a section of its website to suicide awareness.

	











	Project 2025 had immense public relations value. For AFSP, it was a potent rallying cry for potential donors and volunteers — a clear, galvanizing mission that could be achieved with enough support.

	A year later, chapters of the gun violence prevention group Moms Demand Action wanted to set up informational tables at AFSP's signature “Out of the Darkness” walks. The events rely on the participation of volunteers around the country who have lost someone to suicide and want to be involved in an effort to raise awareness and funds for the organization. An AFSP vice president emailed field staff about the inquiries. “One issue has to do with this group's legislative stance related to guns, which is inconsistent with AFSP's policy that our efforts in the firearms space be educational with the goal of preventing suicide, not legislative or advocacy,” the vice president said. “For this reason, we are advising against having Moms Demand Action table at AFSP walks.”

	











	The next month, a senior AFSP director followed up with an “Out of the Darkness” chair who was concerned about a Moms Demand Action group that wanted to walk as a team. The senior director said they could walk but “cannot approach our walkers or hand out flyers to discuss their organization's message or mission.”


	All of these actions appeared consistent with the MOU, raising questions about whether self-defeating impediments were baked into the partnership. A review of the collaboration's co-branded suicide prevention materials show that the two groups never jointly provided potentially life-saving information on Extreme Risk Protection Orders, which allow people to use civil courts to temporarily restrict a mentally unstable family member's access to firearms. Suicide is typically an impulsive act, but ERPOs are frequently the subject of disinformation among gun owners, who have been wrongly told by gun-rights groups that the tool deprives citizens of due process rights. Not using the partnership to share accurate guidance about ERPOs was akin to fighting a wildfire with buckets of water instead of a hose. This was the case even though an internal AFSP document from 2017 said the group was an “advocate” for the “temporary removal of firearms during periods of increased risk of suicide,” adding: “Research has shown that separating suicidal individuals from a variety of lethal means helps prevent suicide.”


	AFSP's public relations official says that the group has at times “worked with” Moms Demand Action and its parent organization, Everytown for Gun Safety, which provides annual grants to The Trace, to ​​“educate people on safe storage and extreme risk protection orders.” She also says that AFSP has provided “support for extreme risk protection orders in 14 states,” adding that it is “a stance on which we are opposed to the NSSF.”


	When asked to clarify and describe these efforts, the public relations official did not respond. Moreover, any AFSP support for ERPOs has occurred outside the parameters of its NSSF partnership, which was established to reach gun owners.  

	











	Records show that AFSP's sensitivity to NSSF concerns persisted years into their collaboration. In 2022, when the organization was editing a document called “Project 2025: Firearms Roadmap for Chapters,” AFSP's then director of writing and entertainment outreach cut the phrase: “AFSP does not support the mission of NSSF.” By way of explanation, the staffer typed in the margins, “I want to be careful of continuing our nice relationship with NSSF.”


	OVER TIME, PROJECT 2025'S BOLD GOAL was woven into the fabric of AFSP's fundraising infrastructure. It received top-billing in the organization's public annual reports. “We can do this together: Reducing the Annual Suicide Rate 20% by 2025,” a typical one said, adding that AFSP had “assembled the top minds in the field and used dynamic data modeling to determine which prevention methods could have the greatest impact.”


	The goal was used to recruit donors for “Out of the Darkness” walks, which, in prominence, are similar to cancer-awareness fundraising events like “Race for the Cure.” “I'm walking … to fight suicide and support AFSP's bold goal to reduce the suicide rate 20 percent by 2025,” went a standard volunteer pitch. “Please help me reach my goal by clicking the ‘Donate' button on this page.”


	AFSP's fundraising emails also featured the objective: “This bold goal will not only save lives but help us reach new milestones in mental health awareness and suicide prevention,” a 2020 email stated. “Help us make a big impact in suicide prevention and give today!”


	There was even a “bold goal” web page, still up today. The “donate now” button appears at the top.


	For its part, the NSSF and its members touted participation in Project 2025 in congressional testimony, business documents, and in lobbying materials submitted to lawmakers. In 2018, when one of the group's state lobbyists wrote to the chair of Vermont's House Judiciary Committee opposing a bill that would ban large-capacity magazines in the state, he included supplemental information on the organization's partnership with AFSP, despite the bill having no connection to suicide. In a 2024 letter to top lawmakers in Maine about another gun-related bill, he wrote, “Our retailer members are connected to a nationwide effort developed by AFSP called Project 2025, which seeks to reduce the annual U.S. suicide rate by 20 percent by the year 2025.” 


	After the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a gun company, then called American Outdoor Brands Corporation, pointed to its NSSF membership and Project 2025 as an example of its concern for firearms safety. And two months after the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, when Congress held a hearing to probe gun manufacturers, the written testimony of Christopher Killoy, an NSSF board member and then president and CEO of firearms manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Company Inc., similarly described the NSSF's work to help AFSP achieve the bold goal. 

	











	The initiative was a source of hope for people like Alex Smith, a 30-year-old Texan whose boyfriend had died by suicide in 2016. When she looked into getting involved with AFSP and learned about the goal, it gave her a “feeling of trust and relief” during a period of intense darkness. “The suicide destroyed me,” she recalls. “I had the impression they had a secret sauce, because otherwise they'd be exploiting our pain, and that can't be true, so it had to be real.”


	AT NO POINT DID THE NSSF or AFSP temper the public's expectations about the achievability of reducing suicide 20 percent by 2025. Four days after AFSP chief medical officer Christine Moutier emailed staff about shutting down the Project 2025 department — some 18 months shy of 2025 — longtime AFSP CEO Robert Gebbia told the staff and volunteers who had gathered to hear their leaders discuss the surprise changes on a May 15, 2023, Zoom: “I just want to say it right out: The bold goal is not changing.”


	But then Gebbia revealed “a little history.”


	“We created the bold goal in 2015, and it was aspirational,” he said. “It came out of work with a consultant that was guiding us through a strategic plan at the time and said, ‘Have you ever thought about setting a bold goal? Be audacious, be bold.' And it was supposed to be far more than a — it was to motivate us, and motivate the field and all of that. It wasn't a hard and fast goal. But once we set it, we said, ‘Gee, what can we do differently that might help us accomplish it?'”


	Gebbia explained that it took the next “two years” to “figure out” what could be done to “reach that audacious goal,” a course of action that included bringing in the NSSF in 2016. 


	Since Project 2025's launch, Gebbia emphasized in the Zoom, the program's department had all been an AFSP appendage. Now, he said, it is time to “integrate it and get it to scale.” 


	Moutier, Gebbia's younger, telegenic colleague, glancingly acknowledged that the organization was embarking on a new course even though Project 2025's results had not been achieved. “When I'm asked over and over again, out there in the wider world, ‘Well, with all of this science and these newfound effective strategies, why is the rate going up — overall?'” she said, before providing an answer: “We are still just scratching the surface on scaled implementation.”

	











	Moutier then addressed the messaging problem posed by shutting down Project 2025. “I know that for your work and in your role, the brand of Project 2025 has been kind of the framework, and you've been preaching Project 2025, and using that framework as a tool,” she said. “And so we're very sensitive to the fact that we're going to need to be very clear and shift and help you — and for ourselves, as well — speak about the work in a way that still has a very clear message to it. We know we will need to work on that.”


	One person directly asked, “Are we eliminating Project 2025 from our vocabulary?”


	“The answer is yes,” Gebbia responded. “But it's not going to happen instantly. It's on our website. We have materials. It's a phase out of it.”


	Another person inquired about the bold goal presentations used to promote AFSP's work, and whether it would be necessary to cancel a forthcoming meeting.


	“I don't think we should stop,” Gebbia said. “I don't think momentum should stop.” As an example, he said that a fundraising email had recently been sent out, and “all we did was take out P25. All the rest of the language stayed exactly the same.”


	On June 8, AFSP circulated an internal memo about the transition. While there was never a public announcement about the premature end of Project 2025, AFSP made digital adjustments. “The Project 2025 website link now redirects to the main afsp.org page,” the memo said. “We are working to create a temporary landing page to communicate the focus areas effectively while removing language around Project 2025.”


	The memo noted that the program's firearms safety brochures did not specifically mention Project 2025, “so please continue to order and use these materials at tabling events,” it advised, adding that AFSP's partnership with the NSSF would continue. 


	Finally, the memo instructed, “Do not feel compelled to explain the change in AFSP's approach to the work of P25 to every group or audience. You can use judgment regarding when it is appropriate to present the slides as they are; when a simple mention of the change may be necessary and when a full explanation is warranted. To most audiences, the shift in how we do the work and the ending of the uniquely branded P25 may not be relevant to them.”

	It's not known how much money Project 2025 brought into AFSP, but according to its annual audits, there was in 2022 a peak of nearly $2 million in funds restricted for the program. According to the group's most recent audit, from 2024, it had nearly a million dollars that was legally designated for Project 2025. AFSP did not answer a question about what will happen, or has happened, with the money. Meanwhile, preliminary suicide data for that year shows that gun suicide deaths once again went up — to 27,592.

	











	The AFSP official did disclose, about cash, that the group “spent more than $1 million of unrestricted funds on Project 2025, which extended beyond firearms to the correctional and health sectors.” It is not clear what the NSSF knows about the end of the initiative. Until September, the NSSF's website contained a page that described its collaboration with AFSP, Project 2025, and the bold goal. That page is now gone.

While Paul Thomas Anderson's film is being heralded as a masterpiece by many, some conservatives accuse it of potentially inspiring left-wing violence.  


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


One Battle After Another is, as the refrain goes on social media, “the movie of the year.”


	Paul Thomas Anderson's propulsive, nearly three-hour loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's Vineland starring Leonardo DiCaprio has been the rare grown-up drama that's drawn enormous critical praise, high audience scores and solid box office — crossing the $100 million mark worldwide to score the biggest opening of Anderson's career.




	Given that the film is also intensely political  — telling the tale of a burned out revolutionary (DiCaprio) who endeavors to save his daughter (Chase Infiniti) from a white nationalist military officer (Sean Penn) —  it's perhaps surprising there hasn't been more noise so far from those on the right. The film opens with a celebratory raid on an ICE facility to free detainees, and shows government agents coldly executing unarmed suspects and sending an undercover agent into a peaceful protest to throw a Molotov cocktail to justify increased force.

	One suspects a three-hour indie drama about left-wing rebels doesn't draw the same level of interest from conservative moviegoers as, say, a remake of a family classic like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. But there are some grumblings out there that contend the film, which Anderson had worked on for decades, is actually the wrong film at the wrong time rather than the opposite.

	“You can make excuses for it, but basically the [film is] an apologia for radical left-wing terrorism, that's what it is,” said Ben Shapiro, who predicted the film will win “all the Academy Awards” due to its politics. “It has the subtlety of a brick … The basic suggestion is a conspiracy theory in which the United States is run by white supremacist Christian nationalists and all people of color and a few nice incompetent fellow travelers like [DiCaprio's character] are going to take on that entire system. And that system must be taken on at the cost of family, at the cost of friendship, at the cost of decency, at the cost of basic human capacity for success. It is better, in other words, to be a complete loser who wastes your life bombing things randomly in order to free illegal immigrants to run willy-nilly across the border than to be a productive citizen.”


	“For this movie to make any sense at all, one has to believe the United States, today, right now, is a fascist dictatorship,” wrote David Marcus at Fox News, under a headline that dubbed the film an “ill-timed apologia for left-wing violence.” He continued, “That is not only a dangerous fallacy but, as we have found out recently, a deadly one … The whole movie made me a little angry, but then I remembered that the Trump administration is cracking down on Antifa — today's very real domestic terrorists — and maybe this will be a fun movie for them to watch once they are all in jail.”


	“It's a macabre coincidence that One Battle After Another opens so soon after the assassination of peaceable conservative debater Charlie Kirk,” wrote The National Review under a headline predicting “there will be bloodlust” provoked by the movie. “The film undeniably romanticizes political assassination … Anderson intentionally provokes the bloodlust of his woke confreres (and Gen Z viewers who know nothing about the Sixties) by celebrating the insipid, heretical, and violent activities of the liberal past and present. Anderson's title lacks Pynchon's pith but daydreams a culture of never-ending political obstruction and pandemonium. It is the year's most irresponsible movie.”

	











	“Watching One Battle After Another may not be entertaining, but its celebration of vitriol and murder is clarifying,” opined The Blaze. “This is not the usual ‘anti-conservative' Hollywood bias. When the perpetually sweaty DiCaprio shouts ‘¡Viva la revolución!' while detonating bombs, you're meant to cheer. And if you're not cheering, well, those bombs are meant for you … Increasingly, Hollywood views half the country not as fellow citizens with outdated beliefs, but as enemies who deserve punishment. Owning firearms, favoring borders, voting differently — these aren't policy differences; they're treated as moral crimes, grounds for extermination.”


	Some critics, however, have maintained the film's politics play more like a satirical fantasy — from its conspiratorial white supremacist cabal to its ultra-organized French Resistance-style left-wing network to Col. Lockjaw's cartoonish Dr. Strangelove-style demeanor. The opening flashback of rebels attacking a detention facility would have taken place during Obama's first presidency, many years before President Trump's first term sparked intense backlash to U.S. immigration policies.


	The progressive staple The New Republic weighed in on this subject with an essay exploring the film's political themes and concluded that One Battle is a dream of a left-wing movement that doesn't exist.


	“The least believable part is the corresponding existence of a left-wing revolutionary group that physically fights back,” wrote David Klion, noting “the rebels in Paul Thomas Anderson's movie resemble the Weather Underground less than the right's conspiratorial image of ‘antifa supersoldiers' … The audience at my screening seemed to be having a total blast, laughing and cheering throughout — and while I experienced One Battle After Another the same way, in hindsight it was a somewhat discordant reaction given the all-too-relevant depictions of immigrant families being torn apart by armed federal agents.”

	











	And in a column for The Hollywood Reporter, Richard Newby pushed back on the notion that the film is pro-violence in any way: “While some argue the film celebrates political violence, it doesn't at all. It depicts it as a temporary solution, one that, when drawing battle lines, only results in casualties on both sides and creates victims out of those who suffer under the same realities of America.”

Jimmy Kimmel is officially more popular than Donald Trump. Or, at least, he is according to a new YouGov poll. 


	“I am more popular than the president of the United States,” Kimmel announced proudly during the latest episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! “You remember the guy who keeps saying I have no ratings? Well, that makes two of us. They polled more than 1,000 people, and I lead Trump by 16 points. I'm at plus three, he's at minus 13.”


	He responded to the news with some skepticism. “It's nice, but considering the fact that I'm not a convicted felon, friend of Jeffrey Epstein and I've never paid off a porn star, or sent a team of mass goons into a park to pull an old lady away from her grandchildren, I feel like my rating should be higher maybe than Trump,” Kimmel said. “At this point, finding a toenail in your salad has a seven-point lead over Donald Trump.”


	Kimmel quipped that he hoped Trump didn't see the poll results because “you know I don't like to upset him.” “But I think he might be upset, because the White House put out a statement this afternoon,” Kimmel noted before reading a statement from White House press spokesperson Anna Kelly. It claimed that Kimmel “prays every night to garner a fraction” of Trump's support. It concluded with “Sad!”

	“I like ‘Sad' with an exclamation point,” Kimmel replied. “It would make a nice T-shirt with Trump's face on it, wouldn't it? You know what else is sad? That the president of the United States has a lower approval rating than Diddy and diarrhea. That's what's sad.”

	











	He added, “If he's looking to improve his approval numbers, I have an idea: Release the Epstein files … Trump's treating these Epstein files like a grumpy old neighbor on Halloween. He turns off all the lights and just hopes the trick-or-treaters will assume there's nobody home.”


	The YouGov poll pitting Trump against Kimmel was conducted in the aftermath of ABC temporarily pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air. ABC and its parent company Disney abruptly suspended the long-running late-night series, citing an “ill-timed and thus insensitive” monologue in which the comedian criticized right-wingers for trying to “score political points” off the murder of Charlie Kirk.

	Kimmel has scored record ratings since the show's return. His first episode back brought in 6.2 million views, four times his usual audience, according to data from Nielsen. Meanwhile, Kimmel's comeback monologue on YouTube reached 21 million views and counting, making it his most-watched monologue of all time on the platform.


	The survey, published by the Economist and YouGov, asked 1,656 adults in the U.S. whether they viewed Kimmel and Trump favorably. Kimmel had a net favorability of +3 while Trump landed at -13.

NFL superstar Travis Kelce turned 36 on October 5, 2025, with the sweetest movie date — adorably taking his mom — chief cheerleader and recent Hallmark Channel alum Donna Kelce — and his aunt and uncle to see his famous fiancée Taylor Swift's new film.

Travis was in Jacksonville, Florida, preparing for the Monday Night Football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars. But in an exclusive photo uploaded to the Kelce Brothers' social media account, Travis could be seen taking a birthday break to head to a local theater for a showing of “Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl.”

The theatrical release, with music videos and behind-the-scenes footage, was only in theaters for three days, coinciding with Taylor Swift's release of her 12th album, “Life of a Showgirl.” According to Deadline, the three-day event raked in a whopping $33 million ticket sales at theaters across the U.S.

A post shared by Travis Kelce Fan (@traviskelcefan87_)

The Kecle Brothers account's original post noted that Travis took his mom as well as her brother Don and Don's wife Joan to the movie in Jacksonville. They all dressed up for the occasion, matching Swift's album cover colors — orange and teal — complete with feathered fans and teal feather boas.  

Fans swooned over seeing Travis and his family take time to support Swift, whom he proposed to in late August — an engagement that nearly broke the internet. 

One Swiftie gushed, “Look how happy Donna is! Fully decked out, wearing a Taylor hat, so proud. I'm SOOOO happy for Taylor and Travis. The right two people found each other 😍❤️” 

Another fan wrote, “I get so emotional seeing him support her😭🧡they deserve each other”

Noting that Donna was wearing a white baseball cap with an illustration of Taylor on it, another fan commented, “~ Future Mother-in-law flex 💪🧡 Just love the hat Donna is wearing 🏆💖”

Though some noted it might be awkward for mother and son to sit together in the theater during some of Swift's more risque songs, like the ode-to-Travis tune “Wood,” others pointed out that only the clean versions of her songs were featured in the film. 

While Travis and the Chiefs play in Jacksonville on October 6, Swift will be in New York, appearing on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.” The following morning, October 7, she is due to talk with Ryan Seacrest on his daily radio show. Swift will be back on NBC on October 8, appearing on “Late Night With Seth Meyers.”

This isn't the first time Travis has supported his family's (or family-to-be's) movie endeavors, though. 

In 2024, he said he was excited to see his mom's acting debut in Hallmark Channel's “Holiday Touchdown: A Chief's Love Story,” starring Tyler Hynes and Hunter King. Donna played the owner of a barbecue joint in Kansas City who offered Hynes' lovestruck character some sage advice. 

Donna appeared in a second Hallmark movie in 2024, “Christmas on Call,” starring Ser'Darius Blain and Sara Canning. That movie took place in Philadelphia, where her other son — former NFL player Jason Kelce — spent much of his football career.

“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't," the filmmaker wrote on Instagram. "If you've got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop."

Robin Williams‘ daughter, Zelda Williams, is slamming fans who send her artificial intelligence-generated videos of her late father.


	Zelda Williams, who directed Lisa Frankenstein, took to her Instagram Story on Monday, asking people to “just stop sending me AI videos of Dad.”  




	“Stop believing I wanna see it or that I'll understand, I don't and I won't,” she wrote. “If you're just trying to troll me, I've seen way worse, I'll restrict and move on. But please, if you've got any decency, just stop doing this to him and to me, to everyone even, full stop. It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy, and believe me, it's NOT what he'd want.”

	Zelda Williams continued, “To watch the legacies of real people be condensed down to ‘this vaguely looks and sounds like them so that's enough', just so other people can churn out horrible TikTok slop puppeteering them is maddening. You're not making art, you're making disgusting, over-processed hotdogs out of the lives of human beings, out of the history of art and music, and then shoving them down someone else's throat hoping they'll give you a little thumbs up and like it. Gross.”

	Robin Williams, an iconic comedian and actor, died in 2014 at 63 years old.


	Zelda Williams is the latest Hollywood notable to speak out against AI as it continues to loom over industry creatives. Last month, SAG-AFTRA and several actors criticized the news that a newly launched AI talent studio was looking to get representation for computer-generated actress Tilly Norwood.

	











	Major studio executives and talent agency chiefs have also raised concerns over OpenAI's new video app, Sora 2, and how their intellectual property or likenesses are being used on the app. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has promised “to give rightsholders more granular control” over their IP.


	Williams added in another Instagram Story post on Monday, “And for the love of EVERY THING, stop calling it ‘the future,' AI is just badly recycling and regurgitating the past to be re-consumed. You are taking in the Human Centipede of content, and from the very very end of the line, all while the folks at the front laugh and laugh, consume and consume.”

One of our biggest questions going into the 2025 fall movie season was how Josh and Benny Safdie would fare on their own as feature directors after creatively splitting up. The brothers had worked separately before, but the prospect of each one following “Uncut Gems” with an ambitious A24 film of his own in the span of a few months was thrilling for cinephiles curious about the creative directions that each auteur's career might take next.

The first answer came when Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine” premiered to positive reviews and a Best Director win for the younger Safdie at the Venice International Film Festival before opening in theaters this past weekend. But Josh Safdie‘s “Marty Supreme” remained a bigger question mark, as it appeared to be skipping the fall festival circuit altogether.

But after weeks of buzz and chatter, the film made its surprise debut as a secret screening at the 2025 New York Film Festival on Monday, October 6. Dennis Lim, director of programming at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, introduced Safdie before the screening, smiling over calling it “secret,” nodding to the fact that most people in the room seemed to know what they were getting.

 










“Marty Supreme” stars Timothée Chalamet as a ping pong star with ambitions to grow the sport in America, though the film has previously been described as something closer to a globetrotting adventure like “Catch Me If You Can” than a sports movie. 

A nervous but clearly excited Safdie greeted the crowd at Alice Tully Hall, sharing that he had just finished editing the movie at 2 A.M. yesterday and was only able to check the final cut while watching the film during a run-through earlier today at the movie house. Many filmmakers love to say that a premiere audience is the first to see a film; on Monday night, that was actually true. 

Safdie also brought out a jittery Chalamet to say hello to the crowd before showing the film for the first time ever, and their nerves proved unfounded: initial reactions are glowing.

IndieWire's own chief film critic David Ehrlich shared on X a cheeky note: “Marty Supreme aka One Paddle After Another: cannot believe we got two American movies this good back to back.”

Our editor-at-large Anne Thompson was a bit more precise, writing on X, “Josh Safdie going solo delivers a wild rush of nonstop adrenaline much like ‘Uncut Gems'; Timothée Chalamet's no-holds-barred performance could be his ‘Wolf of Wall Street.' He'll be nominated for sure.”

 










Senior Hollywood Reporter writer David Canfield shared on X that the film is “major, exhilarating filmmaking from Josh Safdie. Timothée Chalamet's career-best performance — he was born to play this guy — with a tremendous Odessa A'Zion leading a superb supporting cast. It's a wow.”

Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh wrote on X, “‘Marty Supreme' is ‘Uncut Gems' meets ‘The Catcher in the Rye' meets ‘Jerry Maguire,' carried by Timothée Chalamet's best performance yet. I loved it so much.”

Inverse's Senior Entertainment Editor Hoai-Tran Bui was also thrilled by the film and Chalamet's performance, sharing on X, “To call this a sports movie isn't enough, this is a manic, madcap odyssey that is as exhilarating as it's exhausting. Timothee's star power is so bright & undeniable that it's basically a supernova.”

Next Best Picture editor-in-chief Matt Neglia wrote on X that the film “is a sprawling and electrifying sports epic bursting with vitality from the first frame to the last. Josh Safdie delivers a masterful slice of organized chaos on a larger scale he's ever worked with before, propelling us through Marty's relentless quest to prove to everyone he's the best ping pong player in the world. … One of the most invigorating and best sports stories ever put to screen.”

 










The film also stars Fran Drescher; Tyler, the Creator; Kevin O'Leary; magician Penn Jillette; Odessa A'zion; Sandra Bernhard; Abel Ferrara; and French highwire performer Philippe Petit.

With a reported budget of $70 million, “Marty Supreme” is one of the most expensive movies that A24 has ever made. The independent studio is likely banking on Chalamet's star power and a holiday release date to deliver the kind of box office results that show its newfound investment in blockbuster filmmaking is succeeding. It's worth noting, though, that the company's first foray into expensive Safdie brother solo projects is underperforming financially, with “The Smashing Machine” opening to just $5.9 million in its first weekend of wide release.

Jay Electronica's exceptional skill as a rapper has afforded him a level of favor that no one else in the hip-hop sphere—with the exception of André 3000—would have received within the same span of time. Between 2007 and 2020, he generally remained in the public's good graces off the strength of one innovative introductory mixtape, impressive guest verses, and a handful of monumental loosies that featured existential musings, astronomical wonder, and clips from cult cinema. Purists loved how his work incorporated traces of Nas, Wu-Tang, and DOOM in a fast-changing rap landscape; nontraditionalists loved that he moved to the beat of his own drum, on wax and IRL.

But an indisputably well-rounded skillset is not really the New Orleanian's most redeeming quality. Electronica's defining trait as an artist is his commitment to personal narrative—his willingness to forfeit a spot on the hype train in order to move at a pace that feels purposeful and sincere. It's why, when he does release new material, you feel compelled to retrace his steps and ask: How does this pick up where he left off? At what stage of his prophecies are we now? Does he actually believe any of this shit? This perch between conviction and ambiguity is where he wields his power. But as he continues to add chapters to his story, we're left to decipher whether that position is his chosen station or a purgatory he can't maneuver himself out of.

In late September, he reemerged with solo music for the first time in five years, offering three short projects within the span of a couple days. Titled A Written Testimony: Leaflets, A Written Testimony: Power at the Rate of My Dreams, and A Written Testimony: Mars, the Inhabited Planet, each—whether absorbed individually or collectively—feels like a return to the multifaceted world-building that distinguished Electronica in his early years. A Written Testimony, the album released in 2020, deviated from that trajectory, at least in form. Featuring Jay-Z as a co-star throughout, it served a dual purpose: For Electronica, it quieted impatient fans with a fresh demonstration of his talent. For Brother Carter, it acted as a much-needed reminder that he wasn't just some out-of-touch corporate overlord who cut deals with NFL executives to douse the flames of a formidable sociopolitical reckoning.

To those ends, the album succeeded. Electronica rhymed beautifully on songs like “The Neverending Story” and “Fruit of the Spirit,” weaving criticisms of ICE, acknowledgement of the Palestinian struggle, and folkloric framings of his own journey over dreamscapes of production. Jay-Z evinced genuine excitement for the opportunity to lyrically spar with someone who could keep him artistically honest. But, for the Jay from New Orleans, it felt almost too conventional: An uncharacteristic lack of atmospheric space. A bare minimum of conspiracy theories. Hardly any soundbites from films and lectures. Contributions from The-Dream and Travis Scott more fitting for the Jay from Brooklyn.

For better and worse, all of the elements familiar to Electronica listeners over the past two decades are alive and well in the new music. Many of the song titles across the three mini-projects read like they come from the depths of a deep-fried YouTube algorithm—one specifically geared toward knowledge-seeking hotep types. There's “Is It Possible That the Honorable Elijah Muhammad Is Still Physically Alive???,” “Japan Airline 1628,” “@RealCandaceO…Tell Us More!,” and “Remember That One Time Trump Tweaked on Zelenski in the White House,” just to name a few.

Across the records, there's a recurring motif about the Nation of Islam's Mother Plane theory (an interpretation of the Bible's Book of Ezekiel) which holds that, in 1929, scientists from every corner of Earth—led by God—constructed a massive circular vessel that hovers over the planet. That vessel houses 1,500 smaller versions of itself that are piloted by Black men and deployed all around the world. Bastions of Satan and the uninformed refer to these as flying saucers or UFOs. And, at some point in the near or distant future, the Mother Plane will destroy the United States, casting fire that will burn this unholy place for 390 years. But before that happens, leaflets will fall from the sky urging Black people they have just a week's time to return to their ancestral land before this one is destroyed. The idea being, UFO sightings suggest we're closer to the end of days, and Mr. Electronica is hand-delivering the warning signs.

On the Evidence-produced “Is It Possible That the Honorable Elijah Muhammad Is Still Physically Alive???” from Leaflets, a downtempo piano loops while the Virginia singer DRAM delivers a buttery hook. Meanwhile, Electronica goes on about a highly contested incident from February 1942 in which U.S. naval officers in Los Angeles believed they were under attack by a Japanese aircraft, resulting in the deaths of five people. It was later deemed a false alarm fueled by post-Pearl Harbor paranoia, but, in the years following, skeptics raised the possibility of a UFO encounter. “Coming face-to-face with God absolutely terrified the government,” Electronica raps before doing the most barbershop conversation thing possible in song form, whispering: “Battle of Los Angeles, look it up.”

That's immediately followed by “Japan Airline 1628,” a bouncy self-produced track that samples the guitars from Australian indie band Vacations' 2016 song “Young.” The title references a 1986 flight during which Captain Kenji Terauchi believed he saw three strange objects while flying over Alaska. Instead of detailing the ordeal, Electronica imparts useful wisdom on how to navigate life and ensure brighter days on the docket: “You got to learn to take it in stride and let your light shine/You get what you strive for, in this transitory lifetime/The Devil ruled for thousands of years, now it's the Christ time.” Power at the Rate of My Dreams ends with “BIG Baby Jesus,” another self-production. As eerie Christmas carol-sounding vocals loop in the background, he channels the spirit of Ol' Dirty Bastard with melodic baritone ad-libs. When the dust settles, audio from a Louis Farrakhan speech comes to the fore and, in it, the NOI leader says, “I'd like to talk with you about the shadow government that hides the knowledge of this great wheel, even from the presidents of the United States.”

Conspiracies aside, Jay Electronica hasn't missed a step when it comes to craft. “Ashes to Ashes,” from Power at the Rate of My Dreams, is arguably the most beautiful track out of the collection and hits on all the notes that make engaging the New Orleans native worth the frequent absences and head-scratching beliefs. He takes the Brazilian icon Jorge Ben Jor's 1969 hit “Domingas,” slows it down, and delivers a mesmerizing stream-of-consciousness verse about his approach to life. “The long road to one's own destiny ain't paved/This treacherous path through the wilderness is only for the brave,” he starts, before honoring enslaved ancestors and leaning on that lineage to find peace in the fact that, when his time comes, he will be immortalized in his work. “Letter to Mars,” from Mars, The Inhabited Planet, is addressed to his daughter he shares with Erykah Badu. Originally released as an outtake from A Written Testimony in October 2020 on his own Discord channel, the song marks the beginning of the third and final installment of this new chapter. On it, he speaks of how long it's taken him to resurface—a process that, by his estimation, was informed by a constant push-and-pull of dark and light forces within. Vocals from Thom Yorke's “Bloom (Live From Electric Lady Studios)” add melancholic effect.

At his best, Electronica is painfully human. Throughout the duration of a project (and sometimes a single song), he goes from someone burdened by the weight of life, justifiably reclusive, to someone whose chest swells with spiritual belief, commitment to community, and trust in his artistic merit. He reveals these ebbs and flows lyrically, but is just as effective at communicating through voice recordings, selected film scenes, and knowing when to let a track breathe without his rapping present. Leaflets track “Four Billion, Four Hundred Million (4,400,000,000) / The Worst Is Yet to Come” begins with a clip of Stevie Wonder making an impromptu theme song for Soul Train in 1973. The rising New York singer Kelly Moonstone gets a chance to show her chops on Mars' serene “... shine for me.” Electronica's own crooning on the hook of “Japan Airline 1628” is so convincing that you may pause to try and find out who it is. And in using Michael Caine's breakdown of a magic trick from The Prestige for “Dear Mr. Blain, I Won.,” he gives insight into why Act II: The Patents of Nobility (the turn) is always disappearing from streaming platforms.

For all the inspiration he offers with his forthcoming approach, he does plenty to generate frustration. On “Abracadabra,” the intro from Leaflets (the first of the three projects to be released), the first voice you hear is that of the now-incarcerated hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs. The recording is recent enough to hear him talking to Electronica about the project's title and how crucial its release is, due to the precariousness of modern-day rap. Endorsement of the disgraced legend doesn't just stop there. On the otherwise stellar “Blood Libel. Who's That Lying on God?,” Electronica raps, “Libel in the courts/They tried to hang my nigga/Love high up on the cross.” Footage published last year clearly depicted Combs punching, slamming, and kicking singer and ex-partner Cassie to the ground in 2016 after she tried escaping from a hotel room. Electronica takes it a step further on Leaflets' “Four Billion, Four Hundred Million (4,400,000,000) / The Worst Is Yet to Come” when he raps, “I was living with Puff and Cass and never showed up in the affidavit,” to imply he never observed any abusive behavior from Combs, as if his personal accounts supersede evidence. It adds insult to injury that, just last week, Cassie's victim impact statement was released to the public, and in it, she describes long-term grooming, forced sexual acts, and violence for not capitulating to Diddy's orders.

There's a tendency within certain sects of straight men to defend prominent members of their respective communities as a sign of solidarity, or just plain admiration. But, specific to Black male-centered circles, there are consistent attempts to shirk accountability by pointing the finger at others. The “white men do it all the time and get away with it” logic, even if it were true, is treated as if it absolves easily verifiable abuse at the hands of Black men. Throughout these new projects, Jay Electronica appears to harp on a perceived public crucifixion attempt on his friend—suggesting that Combs' 50-month prison sentence doesn't align with his transgressions fairly.

But if the foundation for continued Diddy support is a rejection of the carceral system, does he still deserve grace if he were to be freed? Would it then be an appropriate time to hold him to account? Would it then be necessary to feature him as the first voice anyone hears on the first solo songs you've released in a half-decade? At the end of the day, it's an immature and cheap display of internet-brained contrarianism. Fawning over a convicted woman-beater, prominently featuring Dr. Wesley Muhammad, who said COVID-19 was caused by the sins of Jews, and giving airtime to Candace Owens' vindictive push to falsely “expose” that French President Emmanuel Macron's wife Brigitte was born a man, are all ways to say, “I won't be controlled by the threat of public scrutiny.” But at what cost?

Kendrick Lamar did something comparable with 2022's Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers when he featured Kodak Black as a sort of album narrator just a year after the Broward County rapper pleaded guilty to sexual assault. Lamar spent much of that album undressing himself to the world, revealing that he, too, possessed qualities that were less than honorable and stressing that all parties involved would be better off not trying to make a hero out of him. “Do not perceive me” is often how it felt. Jay Electronica navigates his career similarly, though he expands beyond the idea of being chosen as a figurehead by the masses. In 2020, when his fans were waiting on Act II: The Patents of Nobility (the turn), he presented an album with Jay-Z to make it known that only when he's ready will they get what they're asking for; Act II was subsequently leaked seven months later. And thanks to the narrative he's been building for two decades—one that presents him as a mystic who's either conducting an elongated magic trick in the image of The Prestige or firmly opposing how industry standards cheapen one's art by releasing only when he feels moved by the spirit—he effectively exempts himself from adhering to the rules everyone else has to play by.

Jay Electronica has the mind of someone destined to be an artist, regardless of chosen medium. The way he's able to pack reference material into condensed spaces places listeners firmly within his universe. And plainly spoken, he's just a better rapper than most. We learn his taste in film, the music he samples often feels like a flex of his crate-digging prowess, and whether you agree with his spiritual beliefs or not, he isn't just vomiting random theories; he belongs to a religious system that teaches these concepts. The clips of sermons and interviews from members of the Nation of Islam provide peeks into his source material. He demonstrates how the Black American condition is the result of a nearly insurmountable level of multigenerational subjugation. The way that some of us cope with those challenges are not neat, linear, or even logical.

Jay Electronica's music personifies that reality but, at times, it feels like he hides behind his status as an enigma. Caught up in a perpetual disappearing act, he's enjoyed the opportunity to do whatever he pleases, regardless of how people feel about it. But when he devotes considerable space to caping for a man who's been dangling people's fate in exchange for unthinkable levels of dehumanization, it's time to question if his commitment to not caving to demands of the Satanic world is a cheap way of riling people up without explanation, shameless adulation for how powerful men wield their power, or a little bit of both.

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck made headlines after reuniting on the red carpet for the New York City premiere of “Kiss of the Spider Woman” on Monday, October 6, 2025. The former couple appeared side by side at the event, marking a rare public appearance together since their early 2025 divorce.

Lopez, 56, a former judge on “American Idol,” stars in the upcoming musical film, while Affleck, 53, served as an executive producer through his and Matt Damon's company, Artist Equity. The two smiled and chatted on the red carpet as photographers captured the moment.

Before the film began, Lopez took the stage to introduce the project and express gratitude to her ex-husband, saying, “Thank you so much, thank you everybody for being here tonight. Thank you, Ben, this movie wouldn't have been made without Ben and without Artist Equity.”

Lopez wore a sculptural gown from Harris Reed's Spring 2026 collection, while Affleck kept his look classic in a dark tailored suit. Their appearance drew cheers from fans, as the pair posed together for photos before greeting attendees inside the theater.

During a recent interview on the “Today” show, Lopez reflected on Affleck's key role in helping bring the project to life. “If it wasn't for Ben, the movie wouldn't have gotten made,” she said. “And I will always give him that credit.”

The singer and actress also spoke candidly about how working on the musical helped her process their breakup. “Things happen, you have to keep going,” she said, referencing their split. 

“It's funny, the movie is about escapism. It's about how movies and art save us in the hardest times of our lives. Doing this project was such a dream come true for me that it really got me through to kind of survive a moment that was difficult in my personal life as well, ” she continued.

Lopez and Affleck first met in 2002 while filming “Gigli” and quickly became one of Hollywood's most talked-about couples. After calling off their engagement in 2004, both moved on to other relationships and families. They rekindled their romance in 2021, eventually marrying in an intimate Las Vegas ceremony in July 2022, followed by a larger celebration in Georgia a month later.

In 2024, the couple separated again, citing irreconcilable differences. Their divorce was finalized in February 2025, though they have remained on good terms, with Lopez publicly expressing admiration for Affleck's professional dedication and creative vision.

J.Lo stars in the movie musical, for which Affleck served as a producer through his & Matt Damon's Artists Equity production company.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck both played a part in the making of the movie musical Kiss of the Spider Woman, and the exes were both on hand Monday night (Oct. 6) for the film's New York red-carpet screening, reuniting publicly for the first time since their divorce was final in January.


	Lopez stars as Ingrid Luna/Aurora/The Spider Woman, while Affleck and Matt Damon's Artists Equity production company is one of the producers behind the film, which is an adaptation of the 1976 novel of the same name by Argentine author Manuel Puig that also inspired a 1985 movie and a 1993 Broadway musical.

	











	In an interview with Extra on the red carpet, Affleck explained why Artists Equity was eager to help make the film and why Lopez was “born to play” the title role.


	“She's amazing in the movie,” he said. “I just can't wait for you, the audience, to see the movie. I'm as proud of this movie as any that I've ever been involved with. I'm really excited to be here tonight.”




	He also praised his ex-wife's work ethic, saying: “Early on in Jennifer's involvement in this… she just was going to give it her all and she did. She worked enormously hard. You get to see all of her many gifts. She's somebody that grew up watching classic musicals.”


	When asked about the Oscar buzz surrounding the project since its Sundance Film Festival premiere in January, Affleck wasn't letting awards season determine whether this movie is a success. “I like to try to develop my own standard for what I really like and think is great, and as such, I'm enormously proud of the movie. I always will be. I love this movie.”


	Watch Affleck's interview below. Kiss of the Spider Woman, also starring Diego Luna and Tonatiuh and directed by movie musical vet Bill Condon (Chicago, Dreamgirls), arrives in theaters on Friday.

Artificial broadcasts from extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) are a hypothetical class of celestial phenomena.

icate on galactic scales through interstellar travel. Different galaxies could thus have drastically different populations, with abundance variations of many orders of magnitude.

I present a probabilistic formalism to treat this shared history, in which societies and their broadcasts are described by distributions over basic properties like lifespan and energy released. The framework contains a hierarchy of objects related by a tree structure. Discrete societies, the sources of broadcasts, are organized into potentially interstellar “metasocieties.” The population of each type of object is represented by a random point process in an abstract parameter hyperspace, a “haystack.”

When a selection like an observation draws a sample, the point process is thinned. Given assumptions of interchangeability and independence, observables are modeled with compound Poisson random variables. I present an example of how selection bias can favor sampling longer-lived objects. I rederive the Drake Equation for societies in the limit of no expansion. When interstellar replication is present, however, the mean number of detected broadcasts can depend quadratically on stellar mass, suggesting a search strategy favoring large galaxies.

In Beings, Ilana Masad's elegant and ambitious sophomore novel, a queer archivist becomes captivated by two files from the 1960s: the case of Betty and Barney Hill—the first widely documented alien abductees—and the letters of Phyllis, a lesbian science fiction writer navigating an underground queer scene. As the archivist pieces together their stories, Masad blends meticulously well-researched history with lyrical invention, weaving a braided narrative that asks with urgency and tenderness: are any of us ever truly alone?

United by a profound sense of alienation, the characters shimmer with richly drawn humanity. The Hills, an interracial couple already marginalized before they became known for their UFO claims, ache for people to believe them. Meanwhile, as Phyllis searches for love at a time when being gay was illegal, she aches for someone to believe in her. And the archivist, that gentle, nameless narrator, follows their stories until their own begins to surface, tying the strands together in a way that's as satisfying as it is mysterious.

Like all the best science fiction, where genre becomes a means of exploring feelings rather than technology, Beings shines not by demanding belief in aliens, but by showing what it means that the characters believe. At a time when we're constantly faced with issues of belief versus fact, it's a poignant meditation on why we tell ourselves certain stories, and what those stories say about us. The result is a beautifully written and wholly original work of speculative fiction.

Below, my conversation with Masad about Beings.

I'm always curious about how an author's vision for their novel changes as they work on it. What did you originally set out to do, and how did it evolve over time?

I knew from the start that the novel was going to be about the first alien abductees, but I also knew that I couldn't write about them in isolation. Originally, the novel had three equally involved threads: the couple (the alien abductees, a self-consciously imagined Barney and Betty Hill), Phyllis (the lesbian science fiction writer who works at the newspaper that outed the Hills), and a genderqueer person named Star who worked at an archive during April or May of 2020.

Essentially, in that third narrative, I set out to write about the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when everything was still very uncertain for many of us—we didn't know how long we'd need to be staying inside or away from other people, we didn't know how the disease spread, we didn't know whether we were witnessing the start of our extinction. I tried to zero in on the smallest of moments, to remember the way that time felt like molasses in some ways but then hours would go by and you'd realize your hand was locked around your phone like a robot claw.

Unfortunately, during the process of trying to sell the book, it became clear that there was a lot of discomfort with that aspect of the narrative in particular. To be fair, the book was also very long because all three parts were equal in length. So I ended up revamping that third strand. Star—whom I still love, and I still hope to write about one day—morphed into the Archivist. I had a rule for myself when I was writing the new character, that each section of theirs could be only a page or so. I was thinking of Leni Zumas's Red Clocks, how that book, which has several narratives occurring in tandem, also features these very short bursts that come from the perspective of a polar explorer from the 19th century. The Archivist sections are nothing like those, really, but still, how I felt reading Zumas's short chapters from that perspective really stuck with me.

It's through the archivist's relative isolation that they become obsessed with the two different storylines. But you also give them a queer love interest. Why was that important to you?

This might say more about me than about them, to be honest, but one of the joys of being queer, to me, is having little crushes on people all the time. They can be totally platonic or romantic or sexual or any mixture of these things, and they rarely have anything to do with consummation or whatnot—they're just this kind of intense feeling of recognition or connection with people who think a little bit like you or see the world a little bit like you. In the original version of the Archivist character, there was an actual implied love story, and when I wrote them into the person they are now, I wanted to retain at least an element of that.

I think having crushes can be really nice. It can remind you that you have a body that can reach out, that you have a nervous system capable of excitement as well as anxiety or stress or anger or ennui. By giving the Archivist a crush, I think I was trying to draw them out into the world a little bit more.

What did you learn during your research that surprised you? Did you discover anything that changed the direction of the narrative?

I learned so much during the research! I think one of my favorite aspects was the research into queer history, and learning about the Daughters of Bilitis and The Ladder and all the various people who wrote for it. Listening to Making Gay History, Eric Marcus's podcast, was a revelation in that I got to hear the actual voices of so many people who lived through this time. Learning about the queer hotspots in Boston in particular was also very fun, like the fact that the Charles Playhouse had a gay nightclub in the basement. I suppose what surprised me most in the research was just how familiar so much of the interpersonal dynamics were. People are people are people, regardless of when and where we are, and I know that intellectually, but reading about or listening to the little dramas of queer folks' lives in the 1960s, whether they were about relationships or activism or editorial power struggles really made me feel it.

In terms of whether it changed the direction of the narrative, I think a lot of the research I did for the narrative about the abducted couple based on the Hills' experience shaped my thinking and the book's narrative. Specifically, I was shocked—and probably shouldn't have been—to find people writing about the Hills from later years who were so clearly sexist and so clearly just thought that Betty Hill especially was hysterical or excitable, despite the fact that Barney in his own words tells his psychiatrist (this is in the transcripts of their sessions) that she was actually the opposite of that. Seeing the very bald sexism in men's writing about Betty helped me rethink and shape the wife in my version of the couple.

In your mind, what are the connecting threads between the three stories—the Hills' abduction, Phyllis's letters, and the Archivist's work—and what was your process like putting it together?

Some of the connections are obvious—both the couple's story and Phyllis's take place from 1961 to 1969, and the Archivist is, first, researching Phyllis and then later begins researching the Hills. Phyllis also works at the newspaper, the Boston Evening Traveler, that published a story about the Hills in 1965 without their cooperation or consent.

But the other connecting threads are more thematic. When I first learned about the Hills' public trajectory—that, essentially, we know what we know about them only because someone got hold of a recording they didn't know was being made of them and then wrote a sensationalist five-part story about them literally in the week leading up to Halloween—the word “outed” came to mind. Their address was printed in the newspaper, because that was common practice at the time; similarly, when queer people were arrested at gay and lesbian bars or accused of “solicitation” or whatnot, their names and often their addresses and places of work would be printed in the paper too. Today, we'd call that doxxing, wouldn't we?

Then, too, there's the mental illness aspect. When a couple of normal people claim to have been aboard an alien spaceship—most people would assume they were insane, right? Meanwhile, it wasn't until 1987 that homosexuality was completely removed from the DSM as a disorder. And, in the present-day sections, the Archivist struggles with both mental and physical illnesses, although I deliberately don't name them—not because I'm trying to obfuscate in this case, but because I'm trying to focus, as in the other threads, less on what you call something, and rather on what it's like to experience it.

Some of this was conscious, of course, but a lot of the thematic stuff really came together while I was writing. I wrote the book basically as it's structured, one section at a time, so I was bouncing from one narrative thread to the next to the next and then back to the first strand, and always had the last voice still in my mind while writing the next one. I think that helped in terms of my unconscious (or whatever you call the mysterious thing that's happening when you're making things up as you go) doing that work of creating the connective tissue.

The novel draws from the real abduction case of Barney and Betty Hill. What about them first intrigued you? And how did you decide where fact should end and your own invention should begin?

What first intrigued me about them was how they were both these totally regular people who hadn't sought out attention for what they went through. I was definitely You're Wrong About-pilled by the time I learned about them, so I was already thinking about how the stories we tell about famous or infamous people—and how we tell those stories in the media—have so much to do with what our society is like at the time of the telling. But the Hills were also an interracial couple at a time when marrying someone outside your race was illegal in a bunch of states still; they were civil servants, and also civil rights activists. The more I learned about them, the more I wanted to know, and the more I wanted to know, the more I realized how limited I would always be in how close to them I could get.

As a result, I knew from pretty early on in the process that I was going to try to do something kind of impossible: I was going to try to tell their story as accurately as I could, using their archives, the book they had written about them, and the book Betty Hill's niece wrote years later… And at the same time, I was going to acknowledge from the start that I absolutely couldn't tell their story accurately at all because any story you tell about another person is also a story about you, about your reactions to that person, about your imagined version of that person. Reading My Autobiography of Carson McCullers by Jenn Shapland had really cracked open that idea for me.

So, really, the whole thing is fiction—I use facts from history, from the Hills' archives, and I follow the events as the Hills said they occurred very, very closely, down to what they ate at the diner they stopped at the night of the abduction. But my couple aren't the Hills; they can't be. The Hills were who they were. Real people who already told their story in the ways they chose after being outed as abductees without their permission.

I loved Phyllis's letters. I found them so full of life. How did you approach embodying a queer woman's interiority, set in the 1960s?

Thank you! I think Phyllis is a lot of people's favorite character. I did a lot of research, of course—I read books like Sex and the Single Girl by Helen Gurley Brown to try to see how young women's lives were being described and imagined by someone like her. I watched romantic comedies from the 1950s and 60s. I read about queer women from her day. I read a lot of issues of The Ladder, the lesbian magazine founded by the lesbian rights organization Daughters of Bilitis. I read lesbian pulp novels. I listened to a lot of Eric Marcus's Making Gay History podcast. And of course I did research into silly little things like whether there were hold buttons on office phones in the 1960s.

But ultimately, I just tried to feel my way into who she was: a teenager who grew up on a small farm in a small town, who fell in love with her best friend, who read science fiction to escape the ways her life felt small at the time, and who literally escaped her home and ended up trying to make a life for herself in a big city she'd never been to before. I tried to find the balance between her actual bravery and her projected bravado, between what she wants and what she believes she should want, between her ignorance and naivete and her ability to learn and grow. And, like other characters in this novel, her aloneness was key to figuring her out, especially early in the book.

There's a metaphor across the book about otherness and alienation — through literal alien encounters and queerness that's pushed to the margins of society, plus the politics of interracial relationships. But are there also actual aliens here? I guess what I'm trying to say is, do you believe your characters that they saw what they think they did?

I absolutely believe that my characters believe they not only saw but interacted with aliens, yes.

Ok, so that's not exactly a yes.

But it's also not a no! I believe something happened that night, and I have no reason not to believe that what they say happened actually happened. I think some days I believe there were aliens, yes, of course there were, and other days I believe that no, that's so silly, of course there weren't aliens. When a belief fluctuates like that, it feels hard to hang onto any which way, and so I've sort of receded from this question of my personal belief into a place where I've realized what I do or don't believe doesn't matter.

What's your relationship to archives? Am I right to guess that the archive in the book is based on Brooklyn's Lesbian Herstory Archives?

An earlier version of the novel's archive was very much directly based on the LHA, yes, cozy couches and brownstone setting and all, but the archive that's in the book as it is now is based more on what I've found to be the much more common kind of archive, which is to say, it's less romantic, much more library-cum-office. But yes, it's still inspired by the LHA as well as The History Project, Boston's queer archive, in terms of the way these archives are quite open to a range of materials and focus on queer people.

I really love archives and libraries—the former are often housed within the latter—because of how they're these repositories of history, but often messier and more complex than what gets distilled into narrative form in books or documentaries. I love how much humanity can be found in them.

Were you into aliens before you wrote this?

Not really, honestly! I mean, I've never been anti-aliens, but doing the research for this book made me both fascinated by the idea of them, and utterly infuriated by the way imagining aliens can be and is used in ways that harm human beings (so many alien conspiracy theories are racist, antisemitic, and/or remove agency and innovation from various ancient—and largely nonwhite—civilizations). So I have a complicated relationship with aliens in terms of how they exist in our IRL imaginations, and I also love love love the ways aliens can be used in sci-fi as metaphors and imagined others who are often more like us than we're comfortable with.

How did writing your sophomore novel feel different from your first? In what ways have you changed as an author over the course of two novels?

It felt completely different for so many reasons, but mostly because although looking at both novels now from a distance I can see how they share certain themes—connections across generations, say; the obsession with someone dead about whom you can only learn so much—they are such different books in terms of style and plot and structure. All My Mother's Lovers also came to me much more easily—it wasn't easy, per se, nothing is really easy to write, but it sure was easier than Beings.

Writing Beings felt like pulling my insides out at times. It felt terrifying and huge and overwhelming and impossible in a way that AMML never did.

I wish I could say what's changed about me as an author between the two novels. I think that every book I have written and every book I will write will likely feel completely different and will likely require me learning how to write a novel all over again. And I'm sure there's something that's different, be it just my age, or the fact that having published one book I have a wholly different kind of anxiety about publishing my second (and had a wholly different anxiety about writing it too). But I don't know how to quantify it or see it—I'm too close.

Can you recommend other great queer sci fi for curious readers?

Yes: your duology, Yours for the Taking and The Shutouts!

Also, some of these have written straight up SF, some are more broad or speculative, but in terms of contemporary writers, I really enjoy Charlie Jane Anders, Rivers Solomon, Marisa Crane, Annalee Newitz, and N. K. Jemisin. I'm obsessed with Samuel R. Delaney as well—Dhalgren is a work of art and one of the weirdest things I've ever read—and I've really loved what I've read of Joanna Russ as well. While Ursula K. Le Guin wasn't queer as far as I know, I do think The Left Hand of Darkness is a queer masterpiece.

Beings is on sale now wherever fine books are sold.

Guy Pearce made headlines last year with his performance in The Brutalist, which was strong enough to earn him his first Oscar nomination. Less than a year after his Academy Award collaboration with Adrien Brody, Pearce is back with a new supernatural Western that just got an exciting update. Pearce stars alongside DeWanda Wise and Bill Pullman in Killing Faith, the new film following a doctor who escorts a slave and her daughter to find a Faith Healer. After debuting in select theaters this weekend, Killing Faith has earned a respectable 85% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.

This comes from only 13 reviews at the time of writing, so it is subject to change. Rotten Tomatoes has also yet to issue an audience score, considering there have been fewer than 50 reviews on the Popcornmeter. The film has received a glowing review from legendary horror author Stephen King, who attended an early screening last month and shared his thoughts on his personal X account. He described the film as a “quasi-supernatural Western that has echoes of Cormac McCarthy. The first scene, involving a child and a horse, is an authentic shocker.” Cormac McCarthy is the author of No Country for Old Men, which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film by the Coen brothers. Killing Faith also has a higher Rotten Tomatoes score (85%) than The Shining (84%).

In addition to Pearce, Pullman, and Wise, Killing Faith also stars Raoul Max Trujillo, who was recently seen in the DCEU's Blue Beetle movie as one of the main villains. Ned Crowley wrote and directed the film with help from David Henri Martin on the story. Crowley previously made his directorial debut in 2016 on Middle Man, the crime thriller starring Jim O'Heir that's streaming for free on Tubi.

We have Stephen King to thank for one of the best movies of the summer, The Long Walk. King wrote the book on which the film is based, and many fans have even proclaimed that the movie is better than the book. Earlier this year, King also delivered The Monkey and The Life of Chuck, which both earned critical acclaim, even if they failed to deliver outstanding box office results. King also has other projects coming later this year, including the It prequel show, Welcome to Derry, and he's also the mind behind The Running Man remake, which stars Glen Powell.

Check out the official trailer for Killing Faith above and stay tuned to Collider for more updates and coverage of the film.

Vladimir Putin has turned another year older, but wild conspiracies have long insisted he's on the brink of death, battling a secret illness, or has already died but his passing was hidden in an elaborate Kremlin coverup.

RadarOnline.com can reveal the most insane conspiracy theories about the Russian despot, who turned 73 on Tuesday, October 7.

An ongoing theory about Putin alleged he actually died following a medical emergency in 2023 – and the Kremlin has used "body doubles" to hide his death.

Western and Russian Intelligence sources claimed Putin suffered cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at 8:42 PM Moscow time on October 26, 2023, at age 71 following a long battle with cancer at his presidential palace in Valdai.

Insiders alleged stand-ins have been used in Putin's place since October 2023 and the so-called puppet-masters relied on prerecorded footage of the real despot, as well as artificial intelligence, to keep the ruse going.

A CIA insider alleged: "The rumor is that the body doubles are kept locked away, so no one ever sees two of them at once.

"It's sort of humorous, but it makes perfect sense and explains why Donald Trump is getting frustrated. It's because he gets different answers depending on which Putin he's talking to!"

Another insider added: "Russia is very much in a state of turmoil because of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. If the Russian public knew he was dead, the country could devolve into utter chaos and revolution."

Despite insiders' claims, reports of Putin's death have long been denied by the 73-year-old's spokespersons.

Putin's alleged deteriorating health has been at the center of other conspiracy theories.

Leaked emails from an alleged Russian spy in 2022 claimed Putin had been diagnosed with cancer and Parkinson's.

One email read: "I can confirm he has been diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson's disease, but it's already progressing. This fact will be denied in every possible way and hidden."

The despot's alleged cancer treatment was also said to be the cause of his "increasingly erratic" behavior.

The email continued: "Putin is regularly stuffed with all kinds of heavy steroids and innovative painkilling injections to stop the spread of pancreatic cancer he was recently diagnosed with.

"It not only causes a lot of pain, Putin has a state of puffiness of the face and other side effects — including memory lapses.

"In his close circle, there are rumors that in addition to pancreatic cancer, which is gradually spreading, Putin also has prostate cancer."

Rumors about Putin's failing health have swirled for years, dating back to 2005 when notable Western media outlets hypothesized the ex-KGB agent had suffered a stroke.

A decade years later, it was widely reported Putin may have been seriously ill from complications related to botched plastic surgery.

In 2017, famed Russian historian and political analyst Valery Solovei claimed the despot was suffering from Parkinson's disease or leprosy and would imminently resign, though of course he remains in office nearly 10 years later.

When I first saw this photo sent to click2pins.com by Spangler417 from Rosenberg, I had to do a double-take. Not because it looks like a flying saucer (though it totally does), but because spotting a lenticular cloud anywhere near Houston is incredibly rare! The way this cloud formed on top of a storm cloud is amazing! 

Lenticular clouds are those smooth, lens-shaped formations that look like stacked pancakes, or sometimes, a UFO hovering in place. They form when stable, moist air flows over mountains and creates standing waves in the atmosphere. 

Years ago, I snapped the photo below in Seattle, Washington, it was the first time I'd ever seen a lenticular cloud. It was mesmerizing, the way it seemed to float perfectly over Mount Rainier.

But here in Houston's flat coastal plain? We don't exactly have mountains to work with, so seeing a cloud like this here is a true treat!

Lenticular clouds form when stable air is forced to rise and sink in a standing wave, usually when steady winds blow across a mountain or ridge. As the air rises, moisture condenses to form the cloud, and as it sinks, the cloud evaporates. The result? A cloud that looks like it's hovering in place, even though the air is constantly moving through it.

When I worked in Los Angeles, my colleague Kim Baldonado sent me this stunning photo of a lenticular cloud over the mountains near Palm Springs, California. It's easy to see why people joke that these look like flying saucers. This one could've come straight out of a sci-fi movie!

Back here in Houston, seeing a cloud like this is almost unheard of, but not impossible. Our flat coastal landscape just doesn't have the kind of mountains that help form the strong, stationary waves needed for lenticular clouds.

Years ago, someone sent me an incredible photo of one that had formed right over a downtown Houston building. It was breathtaking. I only wish I still had that picture.

The photo below is one I took in 2022 at my son's football game. It's not as dramatic as the mountain shots, but if you look closely, you can see a lenticular cloud forming right on top of another cloud. Proof that even in Houston, the atmosphere can surprise us!

If you have ever seen one or taken a picture of an awesome cloud formation, send it to me at click2pins.com.

Words matter when it comes to reporting UFOS, says Cabinet's science advisor Dr. Mona Nemer in an internal memo obtained by Blacklock's Reporter under Access To Information.

The doctor, who is paid $393,000 yearly, said ridicule and skepticism about what she prefers to call “unidentified aerial phenomenon” are discouraging Canadians from reporting suspicious activity.

“Terminology can help promote greater transparency, credibility and acceptance of research in professional, scientific and public communities,” Nemer wrote in the censored 28-page report.

“The shift in terminology from UFOs to ‘unidentified aerial phenomenon' has the potential to reduce the stigma historically associated with UFOs.”

The July 17, 2024, Report Of The Sky Canada Project said anecdotes of suspicious aircraft “were often met with skepticism and ridicule, leading to negative perceptions and arbitrary judgments being cast.”

Skepticism was “discouraging witnesses from coming forward and hindering scientific inquiry,” said the report without elaborating.

Nemer launched the Sky Canada Project two years ago to compile UFO data after all other federal agencies dropped UFO investigations in 1995.

“Does extraterrestrial life exist?” asked a Sky Canada Project report circulated by Nemer's office.

“No sign of extraterrestrial life has been detected to date. However, most scientists consider it only a matter of time before it is discovered.”

Nemer, a biochemist, assigned seven employees to her Sky Canada Project at an undisclosed cost.

In West Virginia, the mountains are rich with folklore and dotted with sites time has left behind. These haunted hollows are united by their dark, whispered histories and their inclusion on the West Virginia Paranormal Trail, a curated collection of the state's most spine-tingling destinations.

This year, the trail has expanded with four new sites, bringing the total to 21.

“We are so excited to bring back the Paranormal Trail this fall, featuring four new mysterious stops for travelers to explore,” West Virginia Department of Tourism Secretary Chelsea Ruby said in a statement shared with Travel + Leisure. “When planning your leaf-peeping trips to the Mountain State, be sure to add some of these spooky adventures to your list. From stunning color to one-of-a-kind experiences, I have a feeling this autumn will be one of the best we've ever had.”

The new stops on the trail include the Apollo Civic Theatre in Martinsburg, which was built in 1913 and has welcomed many great names to its stage—including some who never left, according to the West Virginia Department of Tourism. Meanwhile, flickering lights and unexplained footsteps are the norm at Carnegie Hall in Lewisburg, another new site on the trail. And in the Greenbrier Valley Theatre, a 19th century murder and spectral testimony remains one of Appalachia's most haunting legends.

The final new addition to the paranormal trail may be the most fascinating: Seneca Caverns in Riverton has long been prominent in local lore due to its role as a gathering place and ceremonial space for the Seneca, an Indigenous group. Mysterious sounds are often heard in the cavern, which houses the largest flowstone formation in the state.

Other stops on the trail include a visit to a now-closed penitentiary known for riots and more than 90 executions along with a Gothic-style asylum that became severely overcrowded and remains haunted by patients and staff.

The best way to experience West Virginia's paranormal trail is by registering online for a free digital passport. The more sites you visit, the more prizes you can win.

Beyond West Virginia, there are spooky destinations travelers can visit all over the country from churches haunted by the spirits of former priests in New Orleans to the location of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago, a hotel in Colorado that served as the inspiration for Stephen King's novel "The Shining," the site of the Civil War's bloodiest battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and more haunted destinations.

In September 2025, "Supernatural" celebrated its 20th anniversary, and the leads of the 15-season show (which we've ranked worst to best) revealed several fascinating tidbits about its production. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins sat with Entertainment Weekly, discussing the series. They shared stories with one another, recalling funny anecdotes and events. One that arose had to do with music, and if you know anything about "Supernatural," you know that music plays a big part.

Kansas' "Carry On Wayward Son" is undoubtedly the series' unofficial theme song, which plays at various times throughout its run. Dean Winchester (Ackles) is particularly enamored with songs from the 1970s, sharing a predilection with his father, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who left on good terms at the end of season 2. In the actors' discussion, a question arose: "What's the series' best needle drop," and everyone shared their opinions. There are several methods for licensing songs for television, and productions typically purchase licenses for whole catalogs.

Still, if there's a song they want that's not immediately available, it can be expensive. One track in "Supernatural" ended up killing the catering budget for an entire week. David Bowie's "Space Oddity," which opens with the memorable lyric, "Ground Control to Major Tom," was referenced a few times, but only played once. Evidently, when they licensed the track for the Season 6 episode "Clap Your Hands If You Believe," the crew had to go a week without craft services. Given the way the guys talk about it, it seems like they didn't have a choice in the matter.

Jared Padalecki says his favorite music track is from a scene he isn't in, and Jensen Ackles immediately identifies it as a David Bowie song. Padalecki confirmed Ackles' suspicions, adding, "When I heard Bowie come on, [Singing] 'Ground control to Major Tom,' I was like, 'What?' How did they find the money to pay for this?" He then explained, "And then I remember the crew complaining for the week after because there was no food, because they had spent all the money."

Ackles agreed that filming can sometimes be tough before they moved on to other discussions of the show's music. The scene that includes "Space Oddity" is particularly funny and well-placed. In it, Dean is confronted by a fairy in a motel room, and he peers closely at it, though to the viewer, it looks like a yellow glowing ball. He gets a bit closer and asks aloud, "Nipples?" Upon seeing the fairy up close and personal, it launches at him as the song starts playing, as you can see here:

The fairy roughs Dean up a bit before he gets the better of it and traps it in a microwave, before watching it turn into a bloody mess of gore in one of "Supernatural's most pause-worthy moments. The scene is a perfect fit for both Dean and the show itself, as it uses a classic song from the '70s to frame an absurd situation that ends in violence. It's unfortunate that it cost the crew their food, but in the end, it was worth the expense.

Things to know about GoblinCon, and Hopkinsville's connection to the Kelly Green Men encounter. 

HOPKINSVILLE, KY (CHRISTIAN COUNTY NOW) – Hopkinsville is fully embracing the city's connection to paranormal history with the first ever GoblinCon UFO & Paranormal Expo on Oct. 17-18. This first iteration of the event lines up with the 70th anniversary of the Kelly Little Green Men encounter.

The small town of Kelly tucked in northern Christian County got its claim to fame after five adults and seven children reported seeing small alien creatures attacking their farmhouse on Aug. 21, 1955. The residents held off the ‘goblins' with gunfire for nearly four hours before reporting the incident to Hopkinsville Police. They claimed to see 12 to 15 short, dark figures popping up in windows and doorways.

This encounter has inspired documentaries, several investigations by ufologists, remaining one of the most well documented alien encounters in the United States. On the anniversary this year, Hopkinsville held an Alien Invasion Day to celebrate this fun bit of local history, continuing on through the expo. 

Visit Hopkinsville is hosting this large-scale event at The Bruce, inviting in over 70 vendors, paranormal experts, people from the film industry, and enthusiasts to share their knowledge and experience with the community.

All things paranormal will be covered at the expo with speakers, panels, and workshops held every hour. The two-day schedule will cover topics like bigfoot, the Bell Witch Legend, ghost hunting, Mothman, UFO activity, and cryptid hunting. For a list of special guests and the detailed schedule, visit the GoblinCon website. 

There will also be a cosplay contest for all ages, with trophies awarded to two winners in each age group for best paranormal inspired costume. Participants can sign up at the Visit Hopkinsville booth at the expo, with the winners announced on Saturday night. 

Along with the vendors, the GoblinCon arcade will also be set up, with over 20 free games available for visitors to play. 

VIP packages include exclusive experiences like a meet and greet at The Knight House in Hopkinsville. Tickets can be purchased for $10 on the GoblinCon website, or at the door during the event.

I guess nobody saw this coming?


	By Sammi Caramela

A pub in Northumberland announced that it was rescheduling an event due to “unforeseen circumstances.” The kicker? The postponed event was supposed to feature a psychic. 

Apparently, the psychic didn't pick up on these unanticipated disruptions. 

A post shared by Snowy owl (@snowyowlcramlington)

The Snowy Owl in Cramlington shared the hilarious announcement on their Instagram page, stating: “Sorry for any inconvenience caused we are having to rearrange our stand up physic [sic] night from Monday 6th October. It will now be taken place on Monday 3rd November at 6:30pm.”

A Newcastle resident named Peter Larsen poked fun at the irony of the pub's statement.

“It's happened!” he wrote on X with a screenshot of the Instagram post. 

“I'm surprised they didn't see it coming, does the psychic powers only work sometimes during the day,” one person quipped on X.

Another commented on the misspelling of psychic. “Give the physicist a break, would be a different story if it was a psychic,” they joked.

The Snowy Owl pub has just less than 1,000 followers on Instagram. Its website labels the establishment as “a country pub in Cramlington.”

“Nestled on the edge of Northumberlandia, The Snowy Owl rests on the site of Plessy North Moor farm,” the website reads. “Originally owned by the Ridley family of Blagdon Hall, the building was named The Plessy Farm and has been rebuilt and restored at least three times since its original construction in 1600.”

As for their food, well, there are mixed reviews online, so you might want to consult your psychic to know whether a satisfying meal is in your future. The pub offers country pub classics, hearty dishes, and seasonal treats, as well as various ales, wines, and British gin. 

And while the psychic might not be in, you can at least enjoy the atmosphere of luscious gardens and crackling log fires.

Israel is pulling the strings.

It's a trope that just won't die—and has reared its head in recent months. It's Candace Owens blaming the Jewish state for Charlie Kirk's death, or Glenn Greenwald arguing that America is supporting Ukraine in order to advance Israeli interests. Or take my recent podcast guest, Dave Smith, blaming Israel for getting America embroiled in the Iraq War.

Ask a boomer for an influential voice on foreign policy, and they'll probably cite a New York Times columnist or a cable news fixture like Fareed Zakaria. Chances are they won't have heard of Dave Smith, who is a comedian. But Smith has recently emerged as an influential voice on foreign policy, far better known to younger Americans than old-fashioned journalists and veteran talking heads. Thanks to appearances on, among many others, Joe Rogan's podcast and Piers Morgan's show, he has amassed a large following—and earned a reputation as an effective debater.

Debating skills, however, should not be confused with substantial arguments. And Smith is sorely lacking in the latter department.

I recently had Smith on my podcast, Conversations with Coleman, for a three-and-a-half-hour deep dive into his views on jihadism, the Iraq War, the Israel-Palestine conflict, and Iran's nuclear ambitions. In a nutshell, Smith believes that America has become a nefarious empire whose foreign policy decisions are largely determined by what Israel wants us to do, rather than by what we believe is good for us and the world. In his view, our enemies are rarely acting out of their own malevolent ideologies; they are merely reacting to our imperialist provocations.

The clearest example of this shtick in action is Smith's argument that America invaded Iraq because Israeli interests manipulated us into it—a theory he has advanced several times on Rogan's show (including in his debate with Douglas Murray), and which he reprised in our own conversation.

How does Smith justify his arguments?

Well, when he is not conveying outright misinformation, his modus operandi is to cite obscure and unimportant documents that few people have heard of, exaggerate their importance, and ignore mountains of evidence that directly contradict his theories.

In an age where podcasts have replaced television news and influencers have replaced experts, it is important not to dismiss people simply because they don't possess the traditional credentials. For better or for worse, that ship has sailed. We must meet the challenge of the modern information age on its own terms, which means rolling up our sleeves and showing the conspiracy theorists exactly why they're wrong—using hard evidence.

Listen to Coleman's conversation with Dave Smith here—or watch it here:



Let's start with that mountain of evidence Smith overlooks, when he says Israel manipulated America into going to war in Iraq. There's plenty to show that the Israelis tried to persuade President George W. Bush not to invade Iraq, and only once those efforts failed did they pivot to a position of support for the war—so as not to alienate their most important ally.

In February 2002, when President Bush had just begun exploring the possibility of an Iraq invasion, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, visited the White House for the express purpose of persuading him that Iran, not Iraq, was the real threat. According to TheWashington Post, Sharon's visit came on the heels of a diplomatic blitz wherein a “series of Israeli leaders” had “carried that message to Washington.”

During Obama's presidency, the domestic Israel lobby spent a total of $30.2 million lobbying the Hill. That means they were outspent by the dentistry lobby.

Israeli sources have corroborated the claim. Yossi Alpher, former senior adviser to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, wrote an article entitled “Sharon Warned Bush,” in which he explained that “sometime prior to March 2003,” Sharon “advised Bush not to occupy Iraq.”

In the same article, Alpher cites Danny Ayalon, Israel's then-ambassador to the United States, who was in the room during the Bush-Sharon meetings. According to Ayalon, Sharon warned Bush against trying to implant democracy into Iraq. “In terms of culture and tradition,” Sharon reportedly told Bush, “the Arab world is not built for democratization”—hardly words of encouragement.

An American source confirms the story too. In an interview with the Inter Press Service, then–Secretary of State Colin Powell's chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson recalled: “The Israelis were telling us Iraq is not the enemy—Iran is the enemy.” He described the Israeli warnings against invading Iraq as “pervasive” during this period in early 2002.

If you squint at these things in just the right light and ignore everything else, you can paint a misleading picture of Israeli manipulation. But with even the most basic context, the whole narrative falls apart.

Wilkerson also confirmed the reason for their eventual pivot to supporting the war. He is quoted in The New Republic saying: “The Israelis tried their best to persuade us that we were focused on the wrong enemy. . . . But once they understood that we were going to war, come hell or high water, they weren't going to get on the wrong side of the president of the United States.”

Wilkerson emphasized that Israel wasn't responsible for the Iraq War, despite the fact that he hated the neocons and the domestic pro-Israel lobby—just like Dave Smith, who therefore ought to find him particularly credible.

But when Smith advances his “Israel got us into Iraq” theory on podcasts, he rarely acknowledges the evidence that contradicts his view.

So, what evidence does Smith present?

He has four lines: (1) Benjamin Netanyahu's 2002 testimony to Congress, (2) the Project for the New American Century, and (3) the Clean Break memo, and (4) the mysterious Wesley Clark memo.

If you squint at these things in just the right light and ignore everything else, you can paint a misleading picture of Israeli manipulation. But with even the most basic context, the whole narrative falls apart.

Netanyahu, who was a private citizen and former prime minister at the time, gave testimony in support of the Iraq invasion in Congress. Smith sees this as crucial. But as I explained to him on the podcast, the testimony occurred after Bush had already decided to go into Iraq.

Bush announced his decision to invade Iraq in a meeting with all of his principals on September 7, 2002, according to then–National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, who was in the room. Netanyahu testified on September 12, 2002.

What Netanyahu, who was not even prime minister, said in public after the decision was made cannot have had more weight than what the actual prime minister said to Bush when the president was still deciding. And as we've seen, Sharon said: Don't do it.

An important pillar of Smith's theory is that the neoconservatives used “weapons of mass destruction” (WMD) as a false pretext for the Iraq War, when in reality they wanted regime change in Iraq because it would help Israel.

He explained his reasoning in his debate with Josh Hammer (hosted by the late Charlie Kirk):

. . . in the '90s, when the neocons admitted they wanted to overthrow Saddam Hussein, they never said it was because he had nuclear weapons. They said he was a problem for Israel in the region. They only made up that lie after 9/11 because they knew that's what would sell.

This is simply untrue.

One of Smith's go-to sources for characterizing neoconservative thinking in the '90s is the Project for the New American Century, a think tank that existed between 1997 and 2006. The very first time they advocated overthrowing Saddam was in 1998, via an open letter to President Bill Clinton. The WMD threat was their main argument. Indeed it was their entire argument. Here is how the short letter ends:

We urge you to act decisively. If you act now to end the threat of weapons of mass destruction against the U.S. or its allies, you will be acting in the most fundamental national security interests of the country.

Smith's other go-to source for “what the neocons said pre-9/11” is the Clean Break memo, a policy document written in 1996 by a group of pro-Israel American neoconservatives led by Richard Perle. Smith often misrepresents this document as proof that the neocons admitted they wanted to overthrow Saddam in order to help Israel.

But the purpose of the document was not to make suggestions for American policy, but to make suggestions to then–Prime Minister Netanyahu. Though not primarily about Iraq, the document's brief mention of Saddam reads as follows:

Israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back Syria. This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq—an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right—as a means of foiling Syria's regional ambitions.

For Dave Smith, this passage is the smoking gun. Not only did the memo suggest regime change in Iraq, several of its authors ended up working at the Pentagon during the Bush years—when regime change became the policy.

Coincidence? Smith doesn't think so.

But a closer look at the Clean Break memo reveals that, although it may have shaped Netanyahu's thinking (or simply mirrored it), it could not have been important vis-à-vis America's Iraq policy.

According to the memo, the point of overthrowing Saddam was not to install democracy but to replace him with the Hashemite monarchy, which had ruled Iraq between 1921 and 1958, and would be friendly to Israel if restored. (Remember, this memo was written for the Israeli administration, not the American one.) “Were the Hashemites to control Iraq,” it explains, “they could use their influence over Najf to help Israel wean the south Lebanese Shia away from Hizballah, Iran, and Syria.”

Not only did we not restore the Hashemite monarchy in Iraq, there is nothing in the public record to suggest that we even considered it. So how could the Clean Break memo have been the blueprint for America's goals in Iraq?

What Smith has done here is plucked one sentence out of its original context and twisted its meaning to fit his desired narrative.

The second memo Smith relies on is even flimsier, because it doesn't exist in the public record at all, and nobody who read it has ever come forward and relayed its contents. We have reason to believe it existed only because General Wesley Clark heard about it secondhand.

According to Clark's book Winning Modern Wars and public interviews, just after 9/11 someone at the Pentagon told him in casual conversation about a memo that revealed an American five-year plan to do regime change in seven countries in a specific order: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finally Iran.

The first thing to note is that we executed or backed regime change only in two of the seven countries (Iraq and Somalia) during Bush's presidency. And in three of the seven countries (Lebanon, Sudan, and Iran) we never did regime change at all, let alone within the allotted time horizon. Meanwhile, we did do regime change in countries not on the list like Liberia, where our intervention ended a bloody civil war and likely saved tens of thousands of lives. Any way you slice it, the supposed “plan” outlined in this memo clearly wasn't carried out.

Of course, just because a plan didn't happen, it doesn't mean it never existed. But, crucially, there is no reason to believe this memo was ever important to begin with.

During the Bush administration, Donald Rumsfeld ran the Pentagon, and his memos were derisively called “snowflakes” because he would write 20 to 60 per day, and they would pile up on people's desks like snow. His aide estimated that Rumsfeld produced about 20,000 memos during his years with Bush. And Richard Clarke, who worked with National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, recalls that she was told to ignore his memos.

Smith has never produced evidence that this particular Pentagon memo was anything other than Rumsfeld's thoughts of the hour. And the only source who claims that it was important is General Wesley Clark—who wasn't in the administration and, by his own admission, never read the memo.

There's another plank to Smith's theory: He points to the idea that American organizations which lobby for Israel were a key villain in the story of how we got into Iraq.

While it's true that the Israel lobby mostly supported the Iraq War, it's absurd to think that their influence was anywhere near big enough to tip the scales. During Bush's presidency, $17 million was spent by domestic organizations lobbying Congress on Israel, according to OpenSecrets.org. To put that in perspective, the cigarette company Philip Morris spent about $200 million over the same time span. And even with all that money, Philip Morris was unable to prevent Congress from passing the federal tax hike on cigarettes in 2009.

During Obama's presidency, according to the same source, pro-Israel domestic organizations spent a total of $30.2 million lobbying the Hill. That means they were outspent by the dentistry lobby, which shelled out $32.8 million over the same time span. And both the dentistry lobby and the Israel lobby represented a drop in the bucket compared to the real heavyweights like Big Pharma which spent around $2 billion over the same period.

Aside from noting that the Israel lobby is about 100 times smaller than the big lobbies, there is the further question: If the Israel lobby is so powerful, how come it can't get America to do favors much smaller than a full war?

In her memoir, Condoleezza Rice recalls the story of President Bush's 2002 Palestine speech. In the speech, Bush planned to call for eventual creation of a Palestinian state. The Israelis didn't mind this. But crucially, Bush was going to call it “Palestine.” Rice writes that when she informed Danny Ayalon, the Israeli ambassador to America, of this, he objected:

“He can't do that,” Danny protested. “Palestine is Judea and Samaria, the biblical home of the Jewish people.”

Rice goes on:

I listened calmly for a while to the history lesson and repeated, “Danny, he is going to call it Palestine.” Danny said that he needed to talk to the prime minister. I said that the President had made a decision. When he called back, Danny asked if we could call it “New Palestine.” I replied that “New Palestine” sounded dumb and that the President wouldn't accept any change in the language. “And Danny, don't lobby the Hill,” I said. “It's not gonna work.”

In other words, the Israelis couldn't get Bush to add one little word to his Palestine speech in 2002. For 36 years, they could not get the U.S. to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which would have required one stroke of the presidential pen. They couldn't get Bush to mount a campaign against Syria's admission to the UN security council in 2002. They couldn't get Bush to bomb Syria's nuclear facilities in 2007. Yet we are supposed to believe that a country with the size and population of New Jersey, which couldn't get America to do any one of these smaller favors, somehow got us to fight an entire war—and they accomplished all of this with a lobbying budget the same size as Big Dentistry?

If it weren't such a serious slander, it would actually be laughable.

The truth is that nobody is controlling us. If the war in Iraq was a mistake, then it was our mistake. The American security establishment, for good and for ill, makes its own choices—and in the end, it must answer to one authority and one authority only: the American people.

But this idea that Israel made us do it is just one shard in a wider ecosystem where anti-Israel propaganda goes down smoothly and where misinformation isn't cross-examined; it's rewarded. Repetition—and vibe—beat evidence and context. Loose claims congeal into conspiracy theories with remarkable speed. If we want a politics tethered to reality, we have to resist that gravitational pull: Demand sources, distinguish performance from analysis, and refuse to let style masquerade as substance.

Dave Smith likes the sound of his own voice. 

Coleman, I don't know who want ask you to talk to an inconsequential gnat, but I don't intend to waste three hours of my life on his drivel, even for you.

When PSYCHIC FEVER from EXILE TRIBE first touched down in Singapore for Music Matters Live, their performance left a mark. Now, a year later, the seven-member J-pop group is back, riding high on a wave of new music, international tours, and a growing global fandom.

“Coming back to Singapore is really exciting,” the group shares, beaming. “The last time, so many fans were singing along with us — it gave us so much energy. We can't wait to see everyone again.”

This June, PSYCHIC FEVER released their third EP, PSYCHIC FILE III. “We got four songs in the EP,” they explain. “The theme is… experimental songs. So I think you guys can feel four totally different vibes of the songs.”

The record highlights their versatility, moving across sounds and moods in a way that continues to push the group's artistry forward. "These songs were a turning point for us."



They're not slowing down either. In October, PSYCHIC FEVER release a brand new track called ‘SWISH DAT ' It's one of the theme songs for a Japanese TV program,” they reveal. “We have a ninja style in the music, in the music video as well — so please check it out.” The track is slated to be released on 24 October and will be the opening theme for TV Asahi × Toei's Kamen no Ninja Akakage.



This year marks the group's first time performing in Sydney and Macau, with their own concerts lined up for Taipei and Bangkok. “We are excited for that,” they say. "We did so many concerts in so many cities and people sang our song — that gave us a lot of confidence.”

They also recall their first tours in the U.S. and Europe: “It was really tough and really hard because we haven't been there, like a single time. As a group, it was our first time being there and then doing a tour as well. But we support each other so well, especially RYOGA and TSURUGI — they lead us so well.”



Part of what keeps PSYCHIC FEVER steady through the challenges of touring is their long-standing bond. “We've known each other for like 15 years, or like 10 years,” they share. “We are like a family right now. So we support each other so well, and then we learn a lot of things. We really, really expanded our journey.”



Their return to Music Matters Live feels especially meaningful. “The first time we came, there were so many fans singing together. We are very happy,” they recall. “It's been a long time since we saw our Singapore fans. So we are so excited and I'll do my best on stage. Hope to see you at Music Matters Live.”

With new music on the way and shows lined up across the world, PSYCHIC FEVER continue to prove that their energy, brotherhood, and fan connection are what make them one of J-pop's most promising global acts.
