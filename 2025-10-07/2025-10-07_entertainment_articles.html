It's been several years since we first started hearing rumblings about Mann directing “Heat 2,” a sequel to his classic 1995 action film and based on his book, but despite a lot of A-listers circling, the project is only now truly heating up. Amazon MGM Studios' United Artists banner, which is led by former Netflix film chief Scott Stuber, is in final negotiations to land the rights to produce “Heat 2,” an individual with knowledge of the project told IndieWire. Warner Bros. way back in 2023 was in early negotiations to release it, but Amazon stepped up and is intending to give the film the beefy theatrical release Mann likely desires. Related Stories ‘Every Day, I Had to Reinvent How to Keep This Thing on' — The Hair Design of ‘The Smashing Machine' ‘Urchin' Review: Harris Dickinson's Bracing Directorial Debut Offers a Modern Riff on Mike Leigh's ‘Naked' The new film would have an entirely new cast, and some big names have been circling in the last two years, including Adam Driver as we reported, but also folks like Austin Butler and Bradley Cooper. Now you can add to that list Leonardo DiCaprio, who IndieWire understands is circling the project, but no offers have been made yet with anyone. THR, which first reported the news, said Mann's original pitch for a budget on “Heat 2” clocked in at $230 million, which he then whittled down to $170 million, though that was reportedly still pricey for WB, which was willing to make it for $135-$140 million, according to THR. Mann is in negotiations to direct based on his own screenplay and his own #1 New York Times bestselling novel, which he co-wrote with Meg Gardiner. Producers on “Heat 2” will include Michael Mann, Jerry Bruckheimer Films' Jerry Bruckheimer, and UA's Scott Stuber and Nick Nesbitt. It also follows the events immediately after the bank robbery gone bad, with McCauley's partner Chris Shiherlis (Kilmer) now holed up in Koreatown desperately trying to escape Los Angeles. Stuber at United Artists has already made a habit of plucking some iconic properties that have slowed in development at other studios, including the Henry Cavill-led “Highlander” reboot and a new take on “Basic Instinct.” Fun fact if DiCaprio does join the film: “Heat 2” would be the first sequel DiCaprio ever stars in, though it's not as though DiCaprio appeared in the original and is suddenly doing franchise movies. He of course is starring in “One Battle After Another,” which as far as high-octane thrillers go gives “Heat” a run for its money.

Johnson worked closely with Kerr to craft the character from the inside out, and relied on Academy Award-winning prosthetic designer Kazu Hiro to help transform his physical appearance. Hiro has garnered well-deserved accolades and attention for his work on the film, but another Oscar winner, hair department head Mia Neal, is the film's secret weapon. Working under intense time constraints, Neal came in at the last minute to design Johnson's wig and provide the final step in his stunning transformation. Initially, she hadn't even planned to work on Mark Kerr — she was brought onto the film to create the hair for Kerr's wife Dawn, played by Emily Blunt. “We needed to split the difference with something that wasn't quite as dark as Dawn's hair, because that wouldn't have necessarily complemented Emily's skin tone.” Neal realized that Safdie was going to be a hands-on director when her first discussion with him about Dawn's hair lasted four hours. Safdie shared photos of Dawn with Neal that she used as reference points to build two different wigs for Blunt with varying degrees of darkness and thickness, and Blunt — whom Neal didn't meet until her first fitting — chose the one that she felt worked best. “The Smashing Machine” was getting close to production when Neal learned that she would also be working with Johnson, whose initial wig was having a hard time staying on in early camera tests. The wig also didn't quite look right on Johnson; it had been dyed jet-black, which was faithful to Kerr's hair but needed subtle adjustments to blend with Johnson's skin tones in the same way that Blunt's wig found a happy medium between the actress and her real-life inspiration. She introduced herself, put his wig on, and immediately saw where it needed fine-tuning. “The entire day that we were filming, I could see that he had this gap on the back of his head,” Neal said. Neal stayed up all night after the first day of shooting creating a new wig for Johnson. “Not only was there a lot of fighting, we were in 100 percent humidity,” Neal said. “And they were really fighting — Dwayne would tell the fighters, ‘The only way we're going to get this is if you hit me for real.' I'd put a towel on the back of his neck and just wring it out.” In order to keep the wig on, Neal would wipe Johnson's head off with alcohol to strip the oil out and used a custom prosthetic band designed by her friend Christal Shanes. “Then she puts a strip of HD lace on there just so you don't see it in the front.” Neal added skin tabs and a strong top stick that she had to replace throughout the day because Johnson's body makeup — a necessity for covering up his tattoos — had oil that would keep the top stick from working. There was no one method because every day you're being met with new elements.” “Then, when we went to Japan, it was 110 degrees outside,” Neal said. At that point, it was like, I'm going to let Jesus take the wheel, because I don't know how this wig is going to stay on!” Knowing how passionate Safdie was about the story and every department, Neal felt immense pressure to deliver. “I didn't want to fail Benny because he's such a good guy and so passionate,” Neal said. It was hands down the most challenging job that I've ever had.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, the album's songs generated more than 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days. Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart. Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers in this story reflect U.S. consumption only. The album's first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956. All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days. The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story. Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers). The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers. Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition). Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week. It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015. Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After an amazing streak at Paramount over the last six years, including Tom Cruise and the studio's highest-grossing movie, Top Gun: Maverick at $1.49 billion, and the $1.2B+ Sonic franchise, Paramount's Domestic Theatrical Distribution President Chris Aronson has decided to leave the studio. We understand that his departure is amicable and at this minute there aren't any candidates in the wings who are expected to backfill. Aronson will stay through Dec. 1 to oversee the theatrical release of the studio's November 14 tentpole, The Running Man starring Top Gun 2‘s Glen Powell and directed by Edgar Wright. Paramount Signs Filmmaker James Mangold To Overall Deal The new Paramount has a goal to ramp up to 15 movies a year in the near future, and ultimately 20 theatrical releases annually. On Dec. 19, Paramount has a big holiday movie in SpongeBob: The Search for Squarepants. Some of their big movies next year include Miramax's Scary Movie reboot, Spyglass/Dimension's Scream 7, a Trey Parker-Matt Stone-Kendrick Lamar untitled movie, and Street Fighter. Aronson arrived at Paramount in 2019 after the merger of Disney and 20th Century Fox. At 20th, Aronson spearheaded the distribution of 3x Oscar winner Avatar, 4x Oscar winner Bohemian Rhapsody, the R-rated Deadpool movies, 4x Oscar winner Life of Pi and the X-Men franchise. Prior to 20th Century Fox, Aronson was the EVP and General Sales Manager for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distribution Company. Prior to that, he was SVP for Rentrak Corporation (now Comscore) and started their theatrical division, which is the box office data crossways whereby theater circuits share their ticket sales with the major studios, who then assemble their final gross figures. Other hits handled by Aronson while at Paramount include Smile, the #1 original horror film of 2022 and Quiet Place: Day One and Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, and Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning. Aronson is past Chairman and President of the Will Rogers Motion Pictures Pioneer Foundation and a member of the Academy's Executive Branch and a member of the Executives Branch Executive Committee. Aronson has served on the Variety SoCal Advisory Board for over 20 years, and has also been involved with Lollipop Theater Network since 2006. Team Domestic Distribution, After six incredible years here at Paramount, I wanted to share with you that I will be stepping down from my role, effective December 1st. When I reflect and realize how far we have come as a group and as a team,  I am immensely proud of what we have built and what an incredible team we have now. I want to thank all of you as well as all the colleagues that I have had the pleasure of working alongside during my time here. It's been an honor to work with such a talented group of people. I believe more than ever in the power of the theatrical experience, and I know that if we in distribution continue to collaborate with our partners in exhibition, not being afraid to be agents of change, we can continue to propel moviegoing forward. And with true advocates of the moviegoing experience in Josh and Dana, I know you have a bright future ahead. I will always feel a part of this family, and wherever my next chapter takes me,  I will be cheering you on to success as I know you will continue to carry on the exemplary work that you do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Donald Trump revealed to reporters on Monday (Oct. 6) that Diddy's team had asked him about a potential pardon, 50 looked to remind the president about the disparaging remarks Sean Combs had made about him in the past. “Man you can't get No pardon running ya mouth like that! LOL Get Out of here,” 50 captioned the post on Monday evening (Oct. 6). Trump spoke to Newsmax in August about how he used to be cool with Diddy, but then the embattled Bad Boy founder became critical of him when Trump entered the political world and ran for president. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” the president said. Diddy's trial concluded with his sentencing on Friday (Oct. 3), which saw Combs sentenced to 50 months in prison for violating federal prostitution laws. While taking questions from reporters at the Oval Office on Monday, Donald Trump confirmed that Combs and his team reached out to ask about a potential pardon. “A lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him Puff Daddy,” Trump said, referencing Diddy's nickname. Back in May, Trump said he'd “look at the facts” for a potential pardon for Diddy, but also told Newsmax that because of their relationship souring that it would make it “more difficult to do.” “Hey to whoever was booking Diddy for speaking engagements,” he wrote on Instagram.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wordle, the online trivia game that attracts billions of plays each year, is being lined up for television. Deadline understands that NBC is piloting a game show based on the New York Times game with Savannah Guthrie hosting. Jimmy Fallon is involved in the adaptation, which is filming in the UK, via his Electric Hot Dog banner. His company is producing with Universal Television Alternative Studio and the New York Times. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming ': How Kiana Was Written Off Following Toya Turner Exit It comes after the newspaper acquired the game, which was created by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, in 2022. Last year, it was played 5.3B times, up from 4.8B plays in 2023. The game gives players six attempts to guess a five-letter word, receiving feedback through colored tiles that indicate correct letters and their placement. Inspired by Mastermind, a single puzzle is released daily with all players around the world attempting to solve the same word. He just launched his business competition reality series On Brand, which airs on Tuesdays and Fridays, and is also behind the reboot of Password, which was recently renewed for a third season, and That's My Jam.

I always wondered how they were able to do it absent buy-in from Wordle. I'm actually suprised Lingo didn't sue Wordle.

The Grammy-nominated singer and actress joins as executive producer and voice talent on the anime film, which is inspired by Gullah Geechee folklore. Webe: Spirit Detective, created by Terry, is co-written by Terry and Bram Stoker- and Shirley Jackson Award-winning Southern Gothic author Eden Royce. The anime film follows an amateur sleuth with a penchant for the paranormal, who travels to the deep south to solve a string of murders that have awakened a vengeful Boo Hag spirit seeking justice. “To me, Webe is more than an anime, it is a story about reconnecting with mystical ancestry and the power in discovering your roots and your tribe,” Willow said. “It is the type of film that I want to be a part of, and I'm excited to be doing this with N LITE.” Kibwe Tavarez (Jonah, The Kitchen) is attached as co-director, and Oscar-winning director Peter Ramsey (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse) and acclaimed horror manga artist Gigi Murakami are attached as executive producers. “We are honored to collaborate with Jaden and Willow,” Terry said. I can't wait for the world to see what we have in store.” Last month, Jaden was announced as the first men's creative director for Christian Louboutin and is set to show his first designs during men's fashion week in Paris in January. Willow recently joined the cast of Slime, described as an anime-inspired pre-apocalyptic sci-fi monster film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before PlayStation became a household name, before Neo learned kung fu, before the internet ruined our lives and ChatGPT put the AI in “paranoia,” there was Tron, the 1982 Disney movie that answered the burning question: What if Jeff Bridges was trapped inside a first-generation video game? Its cult-classic status among actual keyboard jockeys, code monkeys, and die-hard gamers was all but assured. Fans had been clamoring for a sequel for decades by the time Disney's corporate master controllers gave the greenlight to Tron: Legacy (2010), which dragged the world-building into the early 21st century and made you feel like you're watching a feature-length cut scene every time Bridges' digitally de-aged counterpart showed up. (The best thing about the movie is that you can see director Joseph Kosinski road-testing shots he'd put to better use in Top Gun: Maverick and F1.) Fifteen years equals several lifetimes in terms of both tech culture and intellectual properties, which means we were either long overdue for a reboot or the franchise should've declared that it reached its victory level and called it quits. Look, it's not like Tron: Ares, the third entry in this film series that now spans four decades, doesn't have a few things going for it. Everything looks luxury-vehicle slick, from the next-gen skintight uniforms to the spruced-up Ducatis that function as everyone's go-to transport. The Nine Inch Nails soundtrack bangs hard and often. The signature acid-trip-light-trails aesthetic gets a massive workout here, and if superfans were ever curious about what a light-cycle race would look like if transported to the streets of Vancouver, they will now know firsthand. This is still a Tron movie, however, beholden to a mythology that is ridiculously complicated at best and WTF-nonsensical at worst. And if you're not invested in the overarching narrative of tech-industry intrigue, dystopian digital landscapes, and several terrabytes worth of sci-fi clichés mashed together by now, this will not get you on board. To be fair, the story itself — security software system becomes self-aware, rebels against megalomaniacal creator and makes his way through the “real” world, shit blows up — doesn't require an advanced degree in Tron-ology. But everything is plugged into a specific network and filtered through the series' wonky grid of gameplay-meets-genre-blockbuster bluster, however, and non-Stans will feel like their divine user keeps repeatedly typed in a command-line of “shrug.” Eve wants to finish what her sibling started, which was to locate something known as the “permanence code.” There's a project the engineers had been cooking up that involved bringing digital creations into the real world. For the Kims, that meant combating unstable ecosystems and wiping out global poverty. For their fellow C-suite occupant Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters), a.k.a. Trent Reznor And Atticus Ross' Future Ruins Fest Cancelled Over 'Logistical Challenges' Nine Inch Nails Leap Into the AI Nightmare Julian has even designed a prototype that he's modeled after his grandfather's “master control program” breakthrough: Ares, which takes his name from the Greek god of war and is played by Jared Leto with his usual dead-eyed charisma. But any creation that gets 3-D printed into our reality, be it Ares or his second-in-command Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith, imposing and on-point) or an arsenal of bleeding-edge weaponry, can only last for 29 minutes before disintegrating into cyber-dust. Decades ago, rogue programer and resident ENCOM genius Kevin Flynn discovered the solution to sustaining these creations and hid it in his personal network. With the help of her boyfriend Seth (Arturo Castro), she finds it. Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump Are Now Cooling on Him Taylor Swift Addresses Rumor She Turned Down the Super Bowl: ‘Nothing To Do With Travis' Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson Will Tour as Rush in 2026 Jeff Bridges briefly stops by to bless the whole affair with his Zen-stoner presence. Norwegian director Joachim Rønning started off making intriguing, kinetic movies like the survivalist thriller Kon-Tiki (2012) with his filmmaking partner Espen Sandberg before becoming one of Disney's in-house I.P. And while it shouldn't feel like a subversive move to make a progressive woman of color the hero of big-budget I.P. You're still left with questions: Why exactly is this nostalgiabait series being trotted out again? Will this really make a difference to Disney's bottom line? Why does Jared Leto look so much like Jesus at the end? How are the mixed messages regarding the handwringing over artificial intelligence and a future dictated by Silicon Valley broligarchs supposed to resonate? Or is this all just another big distraction to wow eyeballs in between Star Wars, Marvel and fill-in-the-blank franchise entries? Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an effort to cut down on noise pollution from suddenly blaring advertisements on, say, Netflix or Disney+, California legislators have passed a law to mandate that the noise level of commercials is at the same level as the movie or TV series being streamed. It had passed unanimously on the Senate and Assembly floor earlier this month in Sacramento. Judge Rules Trump's Use of National Guard During L.A. Immigration Protests Is Illegal Phony Melania Trump 'Vanity Fair' Cover Dupes Laura Ingraham, Inspires Spoof From Gavin Newsom “Many platforms have introduced tiered subscription models that require consumers to pay a premium to avoid commercials, bringing ad-supported viewing, and the loudness of those ads, back into focus for millions of users,” the Assembly briefing noted. Indeed, price hikes across the board from streaming services have by default pushed consumers to the cheaper options, which now include regular commercial breaks just like old school TV. A bill analysis by Senate legislature committee staff noted that the Motion Picture Association, which lobbies on behalf of Disney, Netflix, Paramount, Amazon MGM Studios, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. Newsom, on signing the bill on Oct. 6, touted its volume-lowering impact, saying, “We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lala Kent is setting the record straight about her relationship status with Tom Schwartz. During a September 30 Amazon Live appearance, the former “Vanderpump Rules” star addressed the swirling romance rumors between herself and Schwartz, shared how their friendship has evolved, and gave a glimpse into her return to Bravo as filming for “The Valley” season three gets underway. Kent also opened up about her current dynamic with Scheana Shay and the state of their friendship following recent tension. When asked about her relationship with Schwartz, 42, Kent didn't hesitate to respond. He is one of my dearest friends, though. We've gotten very close over the past, I want to say, year. Kent added that Schwartz “may be talking to someone right now” and “seems very happy,” shutting down speculation that the two are more than friends. The conversation also touched on Kent's Bravo return, which she confirmed is happening soon. She revealed that her anxiety spiked as cameras started rolling on “The Valley” season three, hinting at the emotional impact of stepping back into reality TV. “[I need to get] a handle on this anxiety,” Kent admitted. “And I think we can assume when my anxiety heavily kicked in, right? It was like a month ago, when something started that I haven't been doing in a long time — and the last time I had done it, it ended a little scary.” Kent also gave an update on her friendship with Shay, 40, following their recent public back-and-forth. Kent admitted she's been doing a lot of “self-reflecting” lately and even hinted she may have been “the problem” during their recent rift. “The Valley” season three is expected to premiere on Bravo in early 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of “Big Brother” Season 27's finale, runner-up Vince Panaro confronts new complications in his personal life even as he publicly reemerges. He was recently photographed joyfully driving a friend's vintage red Camaro, a moment of levity amid ongoing tension over his romantic status with longtime girlfriend Kelsey and his intimate on-air involvement with housemate Morgan Pope. While the Camaro ride offered a brief visual respite, the underlying personal drama continues to evolve, raising questions about honesty, reconciliation, and public perception. Upon returning to Los Angeles, Panaro reunited with Kelsey on September 30 in what sources described as a somber and emotionally fraught meeting. The pair ran errands, visited a café in Malibu, and conversed with little visible affection. Kelsey reportedly ended the relationship in response to Vince's increasingly intimate behavior toward Morgan Pope during the season, including sharing a bed, whispering sweet words, and engaging in close physical contact. Although they met face-to-face again, sources suggest that reconciliation will demand considerable effort, with Kelsey's trust needing to be rebuilt from scratch. Just days after that tense reunion, Panaro accepted an offer to test-drive a friend's vintage red Camaro. Morgan Pope, who shared a highly scrutinized “showmance” with Vince inside the “Big Brother” house, now accuses him of misleading her about the status of his outside relationship. She reportedly feels betrayed by revelations of Kelsey's prior existence and by the discrepancy between what Vince presented to her and what he withheld. Meanwhile, she is capitalizing on her heightened visibility: sources claim she has already received offers to appear on reality series such as “The Challenge” and “The Traitors,” as well as invitations from beauty and fitness brands. Despite mounting tension, neither Kelsey nor Morgan has definitively closed the door—and Vince's decisions in the coming days may determine which path he pursues: repair, severance, or something in between.</p>

Bon Iver's Sable, Fable track “Day One” now has a music video. Directed by Jos Diaz Contreras, the short is set in a dystopian future where Bon Iver has retired and must be replaced by an imitator. Among the many hopefuls are Cristin Milioti, St. Vincent, Jacob Elordi in a fake beard, and the song's performers: featured artists Dijon and Flock of Dimes' Jenn Wasner, plus Justin Vernon himself. Watch the audition tapes below.

Milioti and Vernon go some way back: In 2021, she covered his 22, A Million song “715 Creeks,” and, more recently, she appeared in character as the mother of his child in a behind-the-scenes book that accompanied Sable, Fable. The new video follows another high-concept short for the LP, in which Vernon played a dual limo driver and divorce attorney soundtracked by the album's “From.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon yesterday (October 6), making her first U.S. late-night appearance since the release on Friday of The Life of a Showgirl. Below, watch her break down the themes behind several of the album's songs, including an explanation of her much-maligned sex song “Wood.” She also chats about her friendship with Selena Gomez, the last film she saw (“We are so lucky to be alive at the same time as Paul Thomas Anderson,” she said of One Battle After Another), and her engagement to Travis Kelce. Swift also took the chance to deny rumors that she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show over a dispute about owning the footage. “Jay-Z has always been very good to me,” she explained, adding that their business teams are close but there has not been “an official offer or a conference-room conversation.” She goes on, “We're always able to tell him the truth, which is that I am in love with a guy who does that sport on that actual field. Can you imagine if he's out there every single week, putting his life on the line, doing this very dangerous, very high-pressure, high-intensity sport, and I'm like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be? The album is now vying for the overall sales week record, a distinction long held by Adele for 2015's 25. Over the weekend, Swift dropped a deluxe version of The Life of a Showgirl, featuring acoustic versions and demos from the album, on iTunes. She also premiered the music video for opening track “The Fate of Ophelia” at screenings of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, a theatrical release that compiled together lyric videos and behind-the-scenes footage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Netflix's Monster: The Ed Gein Story has no shortage of ambition. He's one who, as those films loosely inspired by him attest, has long captivated the curiosity of directors and audiences alike. And it's a testament to the wild ambitions of this Netflix series that Monster: The Ed Gein Story doesn't want to merely tell Gein's story but to mount an argument about how his life has refracted and reflected American culture's ever-changing ideas about horror—both in real life and onscreen. How do images of desecrated bodies (like the concentration-camp photos that first titillated Gein in his youth) or scenes of violent mutilation (such as those featured in Texas Chain Saw) contribute to a visual economy that simultaneously nurtures and glamorizes serial killers like himself? What's the ethical imperative when aestheticizing this kind of violence, especially when it dovetails with issues of mental health and questions around gender and identification? How, in essence, does a show like Monster give itself license to offer a portrait of Gein that doesn't merely mine the sensationalist thirst for details of his life but creates room for complicating our complicity in wishing to have a front row seat to his gut-wrenching exploits? A better version of Monster: The Ed Gein Story would not just ask these questions. Instead, those ambitious ideas remain thin premises onto which creators Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan (who wrote every episode and directed two of them) tacks on Gein's narrative haphazardly, making this season of Monster feel more intentionally fractured than its previous iterations. In between, though, Brennan remixes Gein's life, shuttling back and forth as needed, threading episodes from his past with scenes from those horror films he inspired, fictionalized moments from a Holocaust-themed comic book, and even imagined conversations with the likes of Christine Jorgensen. It wasn't just that he inspired books and films. In presenting an origin story of sorts (while critiquing that very impulse), Monster insists that Ed was unique as well as a symptom for a world torn asunder, explaining why those images from the Holocaust are key to his development. If humanity could be responsible for such horrors—and would allow them to be re-presented (in photos, say), then what kind of monsters might it let loose in its wake? Well, someone like Gein, who cannot distinguish reality from the cruel fantasies he unwittingly creates for himself. When his perpetually aggrieved mother dies, he digs up a body, dresses it just like her, and believes (in earnest) that she remains alive to emotionally flay him for not following her every wish. At times, Monster: The Ed Gein Story is quite engrossing even if it remains all too slick. The actor plays Gein like a holy fool of sorts. His voice is high-pitched and tentative throughout, as if he's a child who doesn't yet know how to fill out the rooms (let alone the body) he comes to possess. And while the real Gein was not served well by the lithe Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, this Monster Gein looks…well, like Hunnam, a picture-perfect star whose every ab and muscle has been chiseled to exhaustion. Such dissonance is everywhere in a show that, because of its painstakingly put together production design and flashy cinematography, remains all too consumed with a sleek aesthetic that lures us in while keeping us at a distance from the gruesome crimes being committed onscreen. But he's also voicing the very tension Monster desperately exploits. No image and no scene is off-limits in this: not the Holocaust horrors (here filtered through sensationalist comic books about the “Bitch Of Buchenwald”) and not Gein's own (shots of desiccated vulvas, for instance may be offered in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it frame, but they're there nonetheless). “You're the one who can't look away,” Gein smirks back at the camera, punctuating the tone and tenor of Monster, an ambitious gamble of a meta-conversation about screened real-life horrors that's heavy on gore but very light on emotional or intellectual heft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ozzy Osbourne‘s life story has been told many times. In addition to his 2010 memoir, I Am Ozzy, there's a 1998 episode of VH1's Behind the Music, the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, the 2020 documentary Biography: The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, countless articles and books, and the Paramount+ documentary Ozzy: No Escape From Now, which chronicles Osbourne's painful last years and his quest to play one final concert. If you've encountered even some of them, you know the broad strokes: working-class upbringing in Birmingham, laying the groundwork for heavy metal as the frontman of Black Sabbath, fucking it all up due to psychotic levels of excess, meeting wife and manager Sharon at a low point, rebuilding his career as a solo star in the early Eighties with help from guitarist Randy Rhoads, the tragic accident that killed Rhoads, No More Tears, Ozzfest, the reality show, brutal injuries and addiction issues, and his uncanny ability to somehow survive it all until his body began failing him in 2018. It might seem like there's not much story left to tell, especially when you factor in No Escape From Now and its many revelations. But Osbourne spent the final years of his life working with his I Am Ozzy collaborator Chris Ayres on a follow-up memoir titled Last Rites, which arrives this week. It focuses largely on the difficult final chapter of his life and the numerous medical setbacks he faced, but it also flashes back to encounters with Keith Moon, Bon Scott, Steve Marriott, and other long-departed rock icons. Back in 2018, Ozzy launched the No More Tours II Tour. (As the title suggests, this was his second farewell tour.) But even in the middle of it, Sharon Osbourne was looking ahead. “Sharon was even talking about me taking up one of them golden-oldie residencies in Las Vegas when I got back,” Ozzy writes. The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time I dream about Guinness almost every night. I fucking love the stuff, it's like drinking a glass of pudding. The problem is, one's too many, and ten's not enough. And the first thing I want after a Guinness is to go looking for some coke. It didn't take long for him to become hopelessly addicted. He even began suffering from ‘roid rages that resulted in a black eye. “Sharon got heavy with me after that,” Osbourne writes. “She hired this military guy with a neck wider than the Watford Gap to come and watch over me. Where she found this bloke, I've no idea. He just appeared by my side one day, like an angry mountain in human form, and never left.” For a brief period around 2002 and 2003, Osbourne was the star of one of the biggest shows on television. “I got addicted to the fame for a while, if I'm being honest with you,” he writes. Everyone just wants what you've got, it's so phony all the time.” “For us, by the end of our run, we all were desperate to get our lives back,” Osbourne writes. My poor wife was so sick, it took her the longest time to get over that. It took all of us a long time to come down from the high of the show, the stress of it … to go from reality TV to actual reality again. When the final camera guy left, it was such a relief, man.” From Taylor Swift to Kendrick Lamar, These are the Best Musician Halloween Costumes to Buy Online Watch Ozzy Osbourne Return to England in Bittersweet 'Coming Home' Trailer In 1986, Osbourne became so enthralled with Peter Gabriel's So that he wore the tape out, and drove everyone in his life crazy. “I'd play [So] all day on the tour bus,” Osbourne writes. “I'd play it all night at whatever hotel we were staying in. And at all other times — other than when I was on stage — I'd be singing one of the songs from it at the top of my voice. “I'm there on this New York sidewalk pounding on this [studio] door until eventually one of them little peep-hole things pops open,” Osbourne writes, “and a voice on the other side goes, ‘Who's there?' ‘Ozzy fucking Osbourne, who the fuck do you think?' OK.' The door opens, and this guy's standing there packing heat. Meanwhile, there are two blokes behind him, and they're also packing heat. Van Halen famously opened up for Black Sabbath in 1978. Osbourne loved Eddie Van Halen, but he didn't care much for the group's frontman. He comes from a well-to-do family, I believe, maybe that's why we had nothing in common. There's a story going around that the two of us had a ‘cocaine duel' during that tour — meaning, who could snort the most coke before they keeled over. It just wasn't the kind of thing I did with Dave.” Osbourne was crushed when drummer Bill Ward dropped out of the Black Sabbath reunion in 2012. I mean, there was a documentary about him, Beware of Mr. Baker, where he broke the director's nose with a metal cane at his house in South Africa. And that was after the guy had been thrown out of every other country. Not that he would have taken the job anyway. He'd have been a liability on tour.” Brad Wilk wound up playing on Sabbath's last album, but Osbourne didn't want him to join the tour. “I said, if Tommy [Clufetos] ain't on drums for the tour, I ain't doing the tour,” he writes. “It caused a lot of resentment when I pulled that move. Brad even called me up and said, ‘Why don't you want me to do this gig?' But in my mind, Tommy should have been there all along, and he deserved to be on the tour. At the same time, I'll admit I was just so used to doing my own thing and having my own band it was really hard to not be in control. Maybe that's why the atmosphere onstage never felt that great … The album and the tour were successful beyond what any of us could ever have dreamed of. But it would have been so much better if it had been friendly, and if we'd had Bill there. Tommy did a great job on the drums, don't get me wrong. After exchanging very sharp barbs in the press, Osbourne and Ward didn't communicate for a full decade. “‘We may have all got ripped off, Bill,' I said, ‘but our lives were forever changed by what we did.' It went very quiet for a moment on the line. That's one of the great things about getting older. Even if you're a working-class guy from Aston, you stop being as scared of showing your emotions. In 2016, credible reports hit the tabloids that Osbourne was engaged in an affair with his hair colorist. “Sharon had every right to dump me when she found out what was going on,” he writes. And that's all I wanna say about any of that, 'cos bringing it up just causes more pain.” Manosphere Influencers Who Boosted Trump Are Now Cooling on Him Taylor Swift Addresses Rumor She Turned Down the Super Bowl: ‘Nothing To Do With Travis' Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson Will Tour as Rush in 2026 We'd all groveled through the shit together. There are no two ways about it, Bill should have been there, and he should have been on the album. Without him, it wasn't Black Sabbath. “First was a guy in Canada who said if we paid him $170,000 he'd put me through a new kind of CAT scan, which could show everything that was wrong with me,” Osbourne writes. “So Sharon wired him the money and we went over to his clinic. Then he gave me this box of ‘special medicine' that was just a bunch of herbs and whatever, the same stuff you can buy on Amazon. At least we got our money back after Sharon went stage-five crazy on him. Then we got suckered again, paying $100,000 to another miracle healer who had something called a PAP-IMI machine, which can supposedly cure anything with electromagnetic waves. I spent six days on that thing, three hours a day, only to find out later that it hasn't been proven to be safe and is illegal in the U.S. After all that, I was like, fuck it, I'll stick to Tylenol.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
