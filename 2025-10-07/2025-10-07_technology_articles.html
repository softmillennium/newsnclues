                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has spent more than a year teasing that “more affordable models” of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The new versions, each dubbed “Standard,” get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. The release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla — before he ultimately killed that project. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There's no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Musk and other Tesla executives have joked in the past, and at length, about playing “Game of Thrones but [for] pennies” — an effort to describe the company's mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That sets up an interesting calculus for new-EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla. Ford is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard. Musk did tangible damage to Tesla's brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. Most recently, he was a reporter at Bloomberg News where he helped break stories about some of the most notorious EV SPAC flops. He previously worked at The Verge, where he also covered consumer technology, hosted many short- and long-form videos, performed product and editorial photography, and once nearly passed out in a Red Bull Air Race plane.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inside Colker's office at the incubator's new waterfront headquarters, a wall of framed founder photos is a visual reminder of the organization's track record — from alumni such as computer vision company Xnor.ai (acquired by Apple) and contract management software firm Lexion (acquired by Docusign) to newer startups including Ozette (biotech data), Yoodli (AI roleplay coaching), Vercept (automated desktop workflows), and Casium (immigration processing). Of more than 50 companies that graduated from AI2 Incubator, nearly a quarter have been acquired and 90% went on to raise venture funding. Founders who have gone through the program credit it for helping supercharge growth. “Overall, they were a huge accelerant for Lexion, giving us the talent, AI advice, and credibility to land a solid team, great investors, and customers,” said Lexion co-founder Gaurav Oberoi, whose company sold for $165 million last year. The new fund comes amid both record investor enthusiasm for AI startups and growing scrutiny over which ventures have real depth beyond the current hype. There is also stiff competition from various other venture firms, accelerators, startup studios, and incubators looking to find the next great AI companies. Colker said Fund III reflects lessons learned from the incubator's first two investment cycles. “We backed some developer tools and infrastructure plays, and we also supported a few teams that were commercially strong but didn't have deep technical foundations,” he said. “Both were useful experiments, but in hindsight, some of those companies plateaued.” Developer-focused startups faced fierce competition and long sales cycles, he said, while execution-first teams without deep AI expertise struggled to build real differentiation or become attractive acquisition targets. With its third fund, the incubator is doubling down on its well-worn strategy of pairing vertical, real-world applications with robust technical understanding. AI2 Incubator prides itself on AI expertise, rooted in its origins within the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), the Seattle nonprofit research institute founded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. “We started doing applied AI commercialization in 2015 — back then, it was largely theoretical,” Colker said. He described what he calls the “next chapter of entrepreneurship in the age of AI”: startups with specialized, vertical solutions led by founders with years of domain knowledge — people who understand the problems inside hospitals, factories, and financial systems, and are now pairing that knowledge with AI technology. Colker said it's getting harder to find clear signal in the “AI fog” as the line between novelty and real technical depth blurs. AI2 Incubator, which invests across various industries, pays close attention to a company's data access advantages, specialized distribution channels, workflow integration, and customer trust. AI2 Incubator typically works with founders at the earliest stage, sometimes even before they've incorporated a company. It invests up to $600,000 in each startup via a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) with a $10 million valuation cap and typically holds about 7% in common shares — the same class as founders, rather than preferred equity. The equity stake is in the same ballpark as Y Combinator, and lower than some studios and incubators that may take a more hands-on approach to building companies. “Staying small is not a limitation; it's our advantage,” he said. Unlike accelerators that move startups through fixed cohorts, AI2 Incubator accepts companies on a rolling basis. There are also no required board seats or relocation mandates. Founders can apply year-round and work either in Seattle or remotely. The model, Colker said, is designed for flexibility — to attract experienced entrepreneurs who may not fit the lifestyle of a three-month accelerator sprint. Colker expects that percentage to reach 50% with the new fund. AI2 Incubator companies are required to spend at least a week per quarter in Seattle, and some relocate or move part of their workforce to the city. Colker leads the incubator with fellow managing director Yifan Zhang, a longtime entrepreneur who spearheaded AI House, the sprawling new startup building at Pier 70 along Seattle's waterfront that serves as AI2 Incubator's headquarters along with event space and co-working offices. Since its launch in March, more than 15,000 people have passed through its doors, according to the incubator, drawn by a mix of technical deep dives and startup programming. AI House, supported in part by city and state government funding, is part of a broader effort to boost Seattle as a global AI hub. Colker said the region's strengths — deep technical talent, proximity to Microsoft and Amazon, and a collaborative research culture — give it an edge in building durable AI startups that solve real business problems. But he acknowledged that the Bay Area does have stronger community around entrepreneurship. “You can't walk down the streets of Palo Alto without hearing 15 startup pitches,” he quipped. New efforts like AI House and Foundations will help fill that void in Seattle, Colker said. Tim Porter, managing director at Madrona, cited the increasing national reach of the AI2 Incubator program and reputation as “a place where great AI founders can come to succeed.” AI2 Incubator spun out from the Allen Institute for AI after Allen's death in 2018, becoming an independent organization with its own governance and funding structure. AI2 Incubator is also led by technical directors Oren Etzioni and Vu Ha, who continue to guide founders on product development and technical strategy. Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) paid $825,000 earlier this year to a company that manufactures vehicles equipped with various technologies for law enforcement, including fake cellphone towers known as “cell-site simulators,” which can be used to spy on nearby phones. According to public records, the award dated May 8 “provides Cell Site Simulator (CSS) Vehicles to support the Homeland Security Technical Operations program” and is a modification for “additional CSS Vehicles.” The contract was signed with TechOps Specialty Vehicles (TOSV), a Maryland-based company. “We don't manufacture electrical, comms, and technology components, we integrate that product into our overall design of the vehicle,” said Brianas, who declined to say from where TOSV sources its cell-site simulators. Since then, stingrays have become a catch-all name for this type of technology, also known as IMSI catchers. (IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, a unique number that identifies every cellphone user in the world.) Some cell-site simulators can also intercept regular calls, text messages, and internet traffic. Stingray-like devices have been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade and have long been controversial because authorities do not always get a warrant for their use, and critics say these devices ensnare innocent people by default. In 2020, documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union showed that ICE deployed them at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019. ICE acknowledged TechCrunch's request for comment, but did not respond to a series of questions, which included: what ICE uses these vehicles for, whether and where they have recently been deployed, and whether the agency always gets a warrant when using cell-site simulators. Headquartered just outside of Washington, DC, TOSV sells a wide range of customizable vehicles to law enforcement, such as vans for SWAT armed response teams, bomb squads, and so-called “mobile lab” and “cover surveillance” vehicles. Among these vehicles for police forces, TOSV lists several “projects,” including one described as DHS Mobile Forensic Labs, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. Another project is the DHS Mobile Command Van,” which TOSV says it's “configurable for advanced surveillance and mission coordination.” ICE has other contracts with TOSV for mobile forensic labs, which don't specify what technologies are located in the vans.

We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life. This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. This compact kit includes all the essential tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx/Torx security, and many others. Get the Creality K2 at its lowest-ever price of just $1,049. Now you can buy one on Amazon at an all-time low price of $1,409, fully 25% off MSRP. Our number one 3D printer is a color FDM number with a PEI Spring Steel Sheet platform and fully automatic bed leveling. We love it for its large volume and enclosure for high-temperature printing, as well as the auto bed leveling. It'll print in four colors and is an easy-to-use printer right out of the box. But it does command a premium price for the privilege. It's an excellent choice if you seek the highest capacity currently available. This card is available at the major U.S. retailers, thus offering greater convenience compared to some other brands. Additionally, Lexar's limited lifetime warranty enhances the product's appeal by ensuring that your investment is consistently safeguarded. These benefits come at a higher price, though. The 256GB and 512GB models for this microSD Express card are also on sale, too. We have a feeling this deal won't last long, so if you're a new Switch 2 owner, the time to act is now. Not only is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K discounted during Prime Day, but the Ultra 7 265K also just got a hefty discount, and is now just $246. Often overshadowed by AMD, the Intel Core range starts to make a lot more sense with a hefty discount. Get a 20-core CPU with eight performance cores and 12 efficiency cores, with clock speeds of up to 5.5GHz and a 36MB cache. As you can see, the Core 7 sits below a lot of rivals in general gaming performance, including some older 14th-gen Intel gear. However, general multi-threaded performance is considerably better, and single-threaded performance on Windows 11 is some of the best we've ever tested, behind only the aforementioned Core 9 285K. So if you're looking for an LGA 1851 build but don't want to fork out on a Core Ultra 9, then this might be the processor for you this Prime Day - Stephen Warwick If you're looking for a little extra storage for your Nintendo Switch 2 handheld gaming console, then here are two deals on microSD Express cards that are available at the moment. The PNY fast flash memory cards have near SSD speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write. PNY's flash card has fast PCIe 3x1 storage speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write, perfect for loading games off of to play on the Nintendo Switch 2. Grab half a terabyte of storage with this 512GB microSD Express card from Addlink. Ample speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write mean more time playing games and less time loading, with smoother game streaming. With PCIe 3 x 1 speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write, this card has the speeds to be able to play games directly off of the card, a requirement for SD cards on the Switch 2. It's hard to find a cheap graphics card that's actually worth buying these days, but the Intel Arc B570 pulls it off. It's recently been possible to find these cards for Intel's $219 MSRP, but Amazon will do you even better during its Prime Big Deal Days event. It's knocking $10 off Sparkle's Guardian OC Edition Arc B570, bringing this card down to just $209. Intel's Arc B570 is one of the only cheap graphics cards worth buying, and at just $209 from Amazon during Prime Big Deal Days, it's even more attainable than ever. The Arc B570 can manage a solid 60 FPS experience even at 1920x1080 and ultra settings in some of today's most popular games, but we'd really recommend dialing settings back to high presets and enabling XeSS where it's available for the smoothest ride. This Arc card's 10GB of VRAM is nice insurance against more VRAM-hungry games in this oft-neglected segment of the GPU market. Just make sure your system supports Resizable BAR, and you'll enjoy a fine gaming experience on the cheap. Elegoo's Centauri Carbon is a capable and low-cost Core XY 3D printer that is both a work horse and detailed 3D printer. In our review, we loved the speed and precision that such a low-cost Core XY printer provided. But going further than the review, I can attest that this is a great printer because I put it through its paces to 3D print an entire NAS case for an Intel N100 powered file server. The Elegoo Centauri Carbon worked great, every single time! The Elegoo Centauri Carbon is a fully enclosed 3D printer, which means it can print filaments such as PETG and ABS without fear of warping. The brass-hardened steel nozzle can hit 320C and the extruder moves at 500mm/s and accelerates at 20,000mm/s², with a flow rate of 32mm³/s. From common PLA to tougher Polycarbonate filament, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon can handle it. Sending prints to the Elegoo Centauri Carbon is simple, using Elegoo Slicer, a fork of Orcaslicer our computer connects to the printer via Wi-Fi, and we slice and send the prints over to the printer and then sit back and relax. Prints are then stored on the Centauri Carbon and can be selected via the rather lovely and intuitive touchscreen. Seasoned 3D printer users will be calling out the lack of multi-color printing. Elegoo has announced that a mutli-color print attachment is coming soon, and it will connect directly to the Centauri Carbon, making this printer an expandable, low cost workhorse that produces excellent prints, in very little time. If you're on the hunt for a new gaming controller for your PC and or Xbox, then take a look at this deal on GameSir's G7 Pro controller. At a price point that pales in comparison to the official Xbox controllers, like the Elite Series 2 Core Wireless gaming controller ($129), the GameSir G7 Pro in a shadow ember color looks gorgeous with its semi-translucent shell, TMR joysticks, and hall effect triggers. Available for sale at Best Buy in their Techtober sale, the GameSir G7 Pro controller for Xbox and PC is reduced to $69.99. You're able to save $10 off the list price of $79.99, which you can then put towards a game to use your new controller on. Features like TMR joysticks eliminate issues such as “stick-drift,” and compared to hall-effect sticks, they suffer less from interference, have smaller magnets, and also use less power, whilst keeping the same levels of precision. The triggers use analog hall-effect switches that feature clicky micro-switch trigger stops. There are even four rumble motors, one in each handgrip and one in each trigger, plenty of haptic feedback for in-game events. Hall-effect trigger switches, micro switches on the D-Pad, and ABXY buttons, plus tri-mode connectivity with 1000Hz polling on wired and 2.4GHz connections. A handy charging dock keeps your controller powered up for the next gaming session. Use the convenient physical mode switch to select wired, 2.4GHz, or Bluetooth, and experience a 1000Hz polling rate on PC via both wired & 2.4GHz connections. I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly. The Olight IMINI2 EDC flashlight doesn't have many features. This compact and easy to use flashlight provides 50 Lumens of light, without the need to fiddle around for a button. Put the flashlight into any USB Type A port and it will charge up. The magnetic base of the flashlight also means it can be stuck to any ferrous metal, like a PC case, to give you hands-free illumination while you carry out a task. It is so handy and I have used it heavily for PC tasks, home DIY and taking the trash out on dark nights. Sure it doesn't have a means to focus the light, but it just works and gets me out of a pinch without any hassle. With modern Wi-Fi, there are plenty of speedy options these days for fast wireless networks. But of course, nothing beats wired connectivity for stability and getting around (rather than through) pesky things like concrete, stone, metal, and brick. And thanks to this deal at Amazon, you can connect your packet-hungry devices up to super-fast 10 Gigabit Ethernet for an all-time low price of $199. Unlike some cheaper switches that advertise 10Gb speeds, all five of the ports here are the full 10 Gigabits, letting you sling your packets as fast as possible to several devices on your network. But this is the lowest price we've seen it sell for on Amazon, by $30. Some of those are also on sale, with a Trendnet model selling for $69 and TP-Link's own TX401 selling for $74.Of course, you'll also likely need to run new CAT6 cables, especially if you're upgrading from Gigabit Ethernet, so consider that part of the expense and effort. No one said upgrading to the fastest home Ethernet tech was going to be easy, but once it's all up and running at a theoretical max speed of 1.25 gigabytes per second, you'll be glad you didn't cheap out and go for something comparatively pokey, like 2.5GbE. Bambu Lab's first foray in to low cost budget 3D printers is a knockout!The A1 Mini is what it says, mini. The 180 x 180 x 180mm build volume is much smaller than the norm, but that is not a bad thing. Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini. No, the original $299 price tag was good, but now at $249 it is excellent. It arrives 95% assembled, with just a few screws to remove before you get started. Ease of use?The touchscreen is simple to use and is only really used when loading new filament or when printing an object from micro SD. Typically, your 3D prints are sent to the A1 mini via Bambu Lab's custom slicer, Bambu Slicer, which is a fork of OrcaSlicer. Our reviewer, Denise Bertacchi ran a "speed benchy", a small tug boat toy that tests detail, overhangs, cooling and printer tolerances. In her test, Bertacchi recorded a 19m 15s benchy, that is really fast. My Elegoo Centauri Carbon manages 15 minutes, my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, 44 minutes!The build volume may be small, but this little printer is fast and produces great looking prints. We no longer need to slide a piece of paper under different areas of the build plate to guesstimate the Z-offset! Should you need to replace the nozzle, it is a cinch to remove the nozzle heat break and cooling fins which are held in place with magnets. Put the new unit in and you are good to go. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller, yet more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor. This 49" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts. MSI has some great bundles on offer, and this AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD are all available as a bundle for just $738.99. Also, you don't have to select the SSD, so you can trim off around $100 and bring this bundle down to $639.99. This deal won't last long, so make sure to jump on it if you're after the fastest CPU for gaming. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds. The SN770M, our "portable gaming king" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class. You can read more details about these drives here. The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale. This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface. The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage. The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly. The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty. The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price. This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports. We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP. Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere. For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build. If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model. The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage. As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that. Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an "Action Ring" menu. A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months. Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. There are many more 4TB SSDs on sale, as well as plenty of 8TB SSDs, which you can find in our constantly updated 4TB and 8TB SSD deals post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the centennial of modern quantum mechanics, the Nobel Committee awarded the year's most prestigious physics prize to an experiment that demonstrated how quantum effects play out on large scales—including inside your smartphone. John Clarke, Michel Devoret, and John Martinis conducted their initial experiments in 1984 and 1985, but their work has had a lasting impact, becoming “the foundation of all digital technology,” Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said in a statement. But what is quantum tunneling, and how has it brought this bizarre realm of physics into our everyday devices? Read on to discover why this quirk of quantum is so critical. Millennia of both scientific and anecdotal observations teach that the ball will likely hit the wall and bounce back. Size is a tricky concept in quantum mechanics, but very simply speaking, “microscopic” scales in this context generally refer to that of a single particle. By contrast, “macroscopic” refers to a large number of particles. Quantum mechanical effects appear to fade on the macroscopic scale, hence why a tennis ball—comprised of a gazillion particles—typically doesn't pass through walls. But the Nobel-winning experiment created a highly sophisticated, superconducting circuit that enabled electrons inside to move through the system as if they were a single particle, filling the entire circuit. To be clear, superconducting devices aren't here yet. As do transistors, nuclear experiments, and, of course, quantum computing. Tunneling taught engineers how energy leaks from very-large-scale integration, the process from which we get complex semiconductor transistors and chips. Tunneling is also considered a vital part of any nuclear fusion experiment. Not all of these applications are immediately apparent. Clarke, one of this year's physics winners, admitted during a press conference on Tuesday to being “completely stunned,” as it had “never occurred to me in any way that this might be the basis of a Nobel prize.” Still, there's no doubt that this Nobel-winning work perfectly demonstrates the remarkable presence of quantum mechanics in our everyday lives—just in time for the International Year of Quantum! The first reported demonstration of “unconditional” quantum advantage has little practical value—but that's perhaps why it matters. A simple yet intuitive approach to tracking tiny, quantum mechanical particles could inform the next breakthrough in quantum technology. Researchers created a strange quantum crystal from a material found in smartphones—the first of its kind visible to the naked eye. The feat makes the microscopic world more tangible, while offering tantalizing opportunities for deeper investigations into complex quantum systems.</p>

(Otherwise, he has no authority to be operating outside his state.) Having a barrier to accessing data can help prevent casual abuse in my opinion, so that officers can't look up say some ex girlfriend's license plate, but if they get a warrant they can look up some suspect's license plate. It was implied, both by our department and, more vaguely, by Flock, that sharing was reciprocal: if we didn't enable it, other departments wouldn't share with us. an offering for PDs to get access to the data without even hosting cameras of their own.That obviously leaves Flock's own attestations of client data separation, and I get the cynicism there too, but basically every municipality in the country relies on those same kinds of attestations from a myriad of vendors, and unlike Flock those vendors have basically nothing to lose (since nobody is paying attention to them).I think you can reasonably go either way on all this stuff.

For instance, just making it a rule that they are not allowed to lie to you about how things are being used -- we know that won't work because if they're willing to lie they are also willing to ignore contract violations.Instead, put in a rule that says misuse of the system costs $X for each documented case. Now the vendor has a financial incentive to detect misuse, and the purchasers have a FINANCIAL incentive to curb misuse by their own employees.It's not a magic fix, but it's the sort of thing that might help.

Very publicly revoke the licenses of people who break your rules. This is just a lame excuse for in action. It's amazing to me that people will still trust police narratives. Police behaviour in public inquiries (usually stonewalling and obfuscating) has been so bad that the government has just passed a law placing a "duty of candour" on the police and other civil servants, with criminal penalties for serious breaches.That was less than a month ago so we'll see how it works.

Ah yes, let's protect a suicidal person by charging them with a crime which they may eventually be able to expunge, but in the meantime will effect their livelihood. That will surely not create any problems which might complicate their lives and drive them further towards suicidal behavior.That makes perfect sense. Have you seen any examples of suicidal people being charged or prosecuted for attempted suicide? I can imagine that this could have opportunities for abuse, but not ones that are qualitatively different from probable cause writ large. The notion of criminalizing suicide attempts to protect a person is fundamentally absurd. I'm more inclined towards crimes being against specific persons or groups of distinct persons, in which case your thesis would be correct, but it's a minority opinion.</p>

When Phaidra CEO Jim Gao describes the AI agents that his Seattle company built to improve data center efficiencies, one can imagine an army of behind-the-scenes digital minions working away. “We live in a power constrained world,” Gao said, noting that data centers are being rapidly built to meet AI demands, but energy supplies can't keep up. As big tech and data center operators plan to spend billions of dollars in coming years building more energy-intensive facilities — or “AI factories” as Gao calls them — the additional cash will help the startup push its tech further to make larger energy cuts. An emerging area of focus is coordinating the AI agents to optimize functions system-wide. Alternately, the facilities should take advantage of slow times for certain jobs when that's available, Gao said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a good job then that Geralt is on the hunt for her and has a new party of allies to help him. Oh, and a shiny new face, to boot. Obviously, no one is going to address it in this trailer—although a fun voiceover line plays with this, teasing that “the Witcher is in a state of flux… you are becoming something new,” although whether that's about Geralt or perhaps even Ciri's own prior uncompleted attempts to undergo the transformation to become a mutant swordslinger is left unknown. Meanwhile, Hemsworth's Geralt is here to do Geralt things, which are mostly to stab people, stab monsters, wonder where Ciri is, and harumph at all the things a Witcher would typically harumph at. Suffice to say, that means it's a pretty typical trailer for The Witcher at this point. Time will tell if the new season manages to capture some of the spark of the show's early output, but at least it shows that even in changing its hero's face, The Witcher by and large doesn't have to change much else to keep its swords-and-sorcery fantasy ticking on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AMD locks in multi-year supply agreement with OpenAI, tying it to a $600 stock price target. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. OpenAI has secured up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPU compute in a landmark supply agreement that could see the ChatGPT maker take a 10% stake in AMD. The deal, announced on October 6, begins with AMD's next-generation Instinct MI450 series and spans multiple future product cycles. The first one-gigawatt tranche is scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2026, with follow-on deployments ramping up based on delivery and performance milestones. OpenAI's warrant vests in stages and caps out at 160 million shares — almost a tenth of AMD's outstanding stock — assuming the full 6GW is deployed and AMD's share price triples from current levels. That would make OpenAI one of AMD's largest shareholders, and it gives both sides a reason to scale the partnership fast. But the partnership doesn't represent a break with Nvidia. OpenAI, for its part, has reportedly already evaluated AMD's current-gen MI300X parts and is believed to be running production inference workloads on them now. While most high-profile model training still happens on Nvidia H100 clusters, the MI300X's larger memory pool and high bandwidth design make it particularly well-suited to LLM inference. AMD has pitched that advantage before, but this is the first time it's landed a customer of this size to prove it. MI450 is expected to push those numbers even further, and will arrive around the same time Nvidia's Blackwell-based GB200 platforms begin volume deployment. If it can deliver, AMD stands to capture not just incremental demand but also new market share. Nvidia's H100 is already allocation-bound, despite Nvidia saying it has plenty of supply, and its upcoming Blackwell parts are expected to face similar constraints. AMD, starting from a smaller base, may have more headroom to scale in 2026 and 2027. For OpenAI, that flexibility may be more valuable than squeezing every last bit of throughput per watt. It's not the first time OpenAI has used its purchasing power to secure financial upside. Microsoft's initial investment in the company included infrastructure credits and profit participation. But this is the first time a chip supplier has offered equity in exchange for volume, and the first time OpenAI's compute roadmap has been tied to a public stock price. It only vests if OpenAI buys and the market responds. AMD doesn't hand over a single share until the first gigawatt is installed, and even then, only partially. That structure also helps insulate AMD from the downside risk of OpenAI's custom silicon efforts, which are still in development with Broadcom and have reportedly slipped behind schedule. Its first Stargate data center campus in Texas is being provisioned with nearly a gigawatt of on-site power generation just to keep pace with internal demand. That kind of buildout creates long lead-time demand not just for GPUs, but also for HBM, substrates, packaging, and data center cooling systems. It's likely to pull from TSMC's advanced packaging lines and may tap Intel Foundry or U.S.-based subcontractors if TSMC's U.S. fabs aren't ready in time. AMD's ROCm platform has made progress, and OpenAI's endorsement will accelerate that. Running the same model across Nvidia, AMD, and OpenAI's future custom chips will require new levels of framework abstraction and operator portability, something OpenAI will need to tackle head-on as it balances workloads across suppliers. The company isn't walking away from Nvidia, but it's not waiting around either.

WIRED's top smartphone recommendation for most people is Google's Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends), thanks to its incredible balance of performance and features for its $499 MSRP. But Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days October sale event has brought the first major discount on Google's smartphone, slashing the price to a mere $349. Check out our Absolute Best Prime Big Deal Day Deals roundup for all the top discounts, and our lively Prime Day liveblog for up-to-the-minute deals on our favorite gadgets. Google's A-series Pixel phones have been our top recommendation for a few years, because these devices pack a lot of capabilities despite the mid-range price. In recent years, Google has added the same processor as its flagship sibling. It may not be the best option for heavy mobile gamers (who play the most demanding titles), but it'll handle most apps with ease. Pixel phones are known for their cameras, and you will be hard-pressed to find another dual-camera system like this for $350, let alone $499. The 48-megapixel main camera can deliver sharp, colorful, and bright photos, even in low light, and you get a 13-MP ultrawide for good measure. The selfie shooter ain't too bad, either. The 6.3-inch display gets incredibly bright and has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate (something Apple finally added to its iPhone 17). And Google stuffs a lot of nice-to-have features, like Qi wireless charging, an IP68 water resistance rating, day-long battery life, and 7 years of software updates. That last one is a big deal because software updates mean your phone can last longer and stay secure. Google Pixel phones have tons of genuinely useful smart software features, and many of them are available on the Pixel 9a. For example, Google's excellent Call Screening technology is present here, helping limit the number of robocalls that ring your phone. It can automatically detect the music that's playing around you and surface it on the lock screen, and Assistant Voice Typing delivers a more accurate voice-to-text transcription than what you'll find on most smartphones. You can read more about these features here. It doesn't seem like that will happen to the Pixel 9a, as Google has introduced a plan to lower the charging speed gradually after 200 charge cycles, which will help maintain battery performance for longer, but it's still something to keep in mind. The Pixel 9a's screen isn't very durable and will scratch easily, so a screen protector is a smart investment.

If you're in the market for a new Kindle, the best Amazon Prime Day Kindle deals are underway right now. This is the best time—well, now and any other Amazon sale event—to get a new Kindle, no matter what model you're looking for. You could still wait for Black Friday to see if the sales are just as good. Amazon's October Prime Day, dubbed Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, is upon us and comes stacked with an amazing range of Kindle deals. It's the last big deal event before the holiday shopping season officially kicks off, so don't miss your chance to get a great-priced Kindle. Some new Kindles are coming out later this fall, but the second-gen Kindle you can get right now is a great deal and still a great device while we wait to see how the new model compares. Nearly all of Kindle's lineup is on sale, along with many other Amazon gadgets, and we've shared below which deals are worth shopping out of the options. If you need more Kindle advice, don't miss our guides to the Best Kindles, Best E-Readers, How to Change Your Kindle's Language, and How to Get Free Kindle Books With Your Library Cards. Don't miss our guide to the Absolute Best Prime Day Deals for October 2025 and check in on our Prime Day liveblog, where we're tracking deals and trends all event long. The Kindle Colorsoft has a beautiful screen, but it leaves something to be desired with its high price tag. With these sale prices, though, it's finally worth splurging on. I especially love the kids' version, but that unfortunately isn't on sale. It's worth spending an extra $10 to get the Signature edition, which comes with wireless charging, an auto-adjusting front light, and twice the storage. The second-generation Kindle Scribe is both an e-reader and a digital notebook, so you can get the best of both worlds in a single device. The three-month battery life makes it actually usable, since you aren't constantly recharging it when you suddenly have an idea to write down or map out. It doesn't have color, but most digital notebooks don't without a large price tag, and the writing experience is super smooth. It's got extra features like a warm light and a larger screen, and the Signature edition has an ad-free lock screen, auto-adjusting front light, and wireless charging like the Colorsoft Signature. It's a great buy for just about anyone, and the one we recommend most if you aren't interested in extra features like a color screen or digital notebook capabilities. The adorable base Kindle is still a great buy, even if it doesn't have all the features of other Kindles. You'll still get snappy performance, dark mode, and a front light, though it won't be warm like more expensive models have.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lilac Solutions is pioneering a new type of lithium extraction that could double US production in two years and shake up the industry. BOX ELDER COUNTY, Utah – On a bright afternoon in August, the shore on the North Arm of the Great Salt Lake looks like something out of a science fiction film set in a scorching alien world. The landscape all around is ringed with jagged red mountains and brown brush. This otherworldly scene is the test site for a company called Lilac Solutions, which is developing a technology it says will shake up the United States' efforts to pry control over the global supply of lithium, the so-called “white gold” needed for electric vehicles and batteries, away from China. Before tearing down its demonstration facility to make way for its first commercial plant, due online next year, the company invited me to be the first journalist to tour its outpost in this remote area, a roughly two-hour drive from Salt Lake City. The startup is in a race to commercialize a new way to extract lithium from rocks, called direct lithium extraction (DLE). This approach is designed to reduce the environmental damage caused by the two most common traditional methods of mining lithium: hard-rock mining and brining. This results in ponds rich in dissolved lithium, which are then allowed to dry off, leaving behind lithium salts that can be harvested and processed elsewhere. The range of methods known as DLE use lithium brine too, but instead of water-intensive evaporation, they all involve advanced chemical or physical filtering processes that selectively separate out lithium ions. While DLE has yet to take off, its reduced need for water and land has made it a prime focus for companies and governments looking to ramp up production to meet the growing demand for lithium as electric vehicles take off and even bigger batteries are increasingly used to back up power grids. China, which processes more than two-thirds of the world's mined lithium, is developing its own DLE to increase domestic production of the raw material. New approaches are still being researched, but nearly a dozen companies are actively looking to commercialize DLE technology now, and some industrial giants already offer basic off-the-shelf hardware. In August, Lilac completed its most advanced test yet of its technology, which the company says doesn't just require far less water than traditional lithium extraction—it uses a fraction of what other DLE approaches demand. Technology originally developed by Koch Industries, for example, uses some Chinese-made components. Lilac's beads are manufactured at the company's plant in Nevada. But Lilac's tech could offer significant advantages over what's currently on the market. And forgoing plans to become a major producer itself could enable the company to seize a decent slice of global production by appealing to lithium miners companies looking for the best equipment, says Milo McBride, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who authored a recent report on DLE. If everything pans out, the pilot plant Lilac builds next to prove its technology at commercial scale could significantly increase domestic supply at a moment when the nation's largest proposed lithium project, the controversial hard-rock Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, has faced fresh uncertainty. Despite bipartisan government support, the prospect of opening a deep gash in an unspoiled stretch of Nevada landscape has drawn fierce opposition from conservationists and lawsuits from ranchers and Native American tribes who say the Thacker Pass project would destroy the underground freshwater reservoirs on which they depend. Water shortages in the parched West have also made it difficult to plan on using additional evaporation ponds, the other traditional way of extracting lithium. In California's Salton Sea, developers such as EnergySource Minerals are looking to build a geothermal power plant to power a DLE facility pulling lithium from the inland desert lake. And energy giants such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum are racing to develop an area in southwestern Arkansas called the Smackover region, where researchers with the US Geological Survey have found as much as 19 million metric tons of untapped lithium in salty underground water. In between, both geographically and strategically, is Lilac: It's looking to develop new technology like the California companies but sell its hardware to the energy giants in Arkansas. A measure I call the Green Premium reveals where we can invest in climate progress for maximum impact. The Great Salt Lake isn't an obvious place to develop a lithium mine. The Salton Sea boasts lithium concentrations of just under 200 parts per million. “It's 70 parts per million,” Raef Sully, Lilac's Australia-born chief executive, tells me. “So if you had a football stadium with 45,000 seats, this would be three people.” For Lilac, this is actually a feature of the location. Showing that Lilac's hardware can extract lithium at high purity levels from a brine with low concentration, he says, proves its versatility. “Utah is a mining friendly state,” says Elizabeth Pond, the vice president of communications. When I accompanied Sully to the test site during my tour, our route following unpaved county roads lined with fields of wild sunflowers. It's off the grid, relying on diesel generators that the company says will be replaced with propane units once this location is converted to a permanent facility but could eventually be swapped for geothermal technology tapping into a hot rock resource located nearby. But it depends on its connection to the Great Salt Lake via that lengthy hose. Pumped uphill, the lake water passes through a series of filters to remove solids until it ends up in a vessel filled with the company's specially designed ceramic beads, made from a patented material that attracts lithium ions from the water. The lithium solution, meanwhile, is stockpiled in tanks on site before shipping off to a processing plant to be turned into battery-grade lithium carbonate, which is a white powder. “As a technology provider in the long term, if we're going to have decades of lithium demand, they want to position their technology as something that can tap a bunch of markets,” McBride says. “To have a technology that can potentially economically recover different types of resources in different types of environments is an enticing proposition.” During my visit, Lilac's crew was starting to pack up the location after completing its demonstration testing. The results the company shared exclusively with me suggest a smashing success, particularly for such low-grade brine with numerous impurities: Lilac's equipment recovered 87% of the available lithium, on average, with a purity rate of 99.97%. If everything goes according to plan, Lilac's first US facility will begin commercial production in the second half of 2027. Once it's fully online, the project should produce 5,000 tons per year—doubling annual US production of lithium. But a full-scale plant using Lilac's technology would produce between three and five times that amount. Utah regulators this year started cracking down on mineral companies pumping water from the Great Salt Lake, which is shrinking amid worsening droughts. “But if it's just being used as a trial for the technology, that makes sense.” What makes Lilac stand out among its peers is that it has no plans to design and manufacture its own DLE equipment and produce actual lithium. The pilot plant is just intended to test and debut its hardware. “Lilac is trying to be a technology vendor,” he says. “I wonder why a lot more people aren't choosing that route.” “We think our technology is the next generation,” he says. “And if we end up working with an Exxon or a Chevron or a Rio Tinto, we want to be the DLE technology provider in their lithium project.” Plus, scientists are fighting back against the administration's climate misinformation.
