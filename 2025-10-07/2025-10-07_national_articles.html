                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lawsuit was filed Monday, just as troops prepared to deploy and just hours after a federal judge blocked their deployment to Portland, Oregon. Also late Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon at all. Illinois has followed California and Oregon in filing lawsuits to stop President Donald Trump from sending in hundreds of National Guard troops to Democrat-led big cities.

ELWOOD, Ill. (AP) — National Guard members from Texas were at an Army training center in Illinois on Tuesday, the most visible sign yet of the Trump administration's plan to send troops to the Chicago area despite a lawsuit and vigorous opposition from Democratic elected leaders. Greg Abbott posted a picture on social media showing National Guard members from his state boarding a plane, but he didn't specify where they were going. There was no immediate comment from the office of Illinois Gov. But the Democrat had predicted that Illinois National Guard troops would be activated, along with 400 from Texas. Pritzker has accused Trump of using troops as “political props” and “pawns.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told reporters that the administration isn't sharing much information with the city. A federal judge gave the Trump administration two days to respond to a lawsuit filed Monday by Illinois and Chicago challenging the plan. The lawsuit says, “these advances in President Trump's long-declared ‘War' on Chicago and Illinois are unlawful and dangerous.” Trump's bid to deploy the military on U.S. soil over local opposition has triggered a conflict with blue state governors. Officials in Illinois and Oregon, however, say military intervention isn't needed and that federal involvement is inflaming the situation. Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act if necessary. It allows the president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law. The sight of armed Border Patrol agents making arrests near famous landmarks has amplified concerns from Chicagoans already uneasy after an immigration crackdown that began last month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas. The Chicago mayor signed an executive order Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property, such as parking lots, garages and vacant lots, as staging areas for enforcement operations. Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois is also suing the federal government, accusing it of unleashing a campaign of violence against peaceful protesters and journalists during weeks of demonstrations outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in suburban Broadview. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in response to the lawsuit that the First Amendment doesn't protect “rioting.” In Oregon, the Portland ICE facility has been the site of nightly protests for months, peaking in June when local police declared a riot, with smaller clashes occurring since then. Most violent crime around the U.S. has declined in recent years. In Portland, homicides from January through June decreased by 51% to 17 this year compared with the same period in 2024, data shows. In Chicago, homicides were down 31% to 278 through August, police data shows. Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to 10 cities, including Baltimore; Memphis, Tennessee; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. A federal judge in September said the administration “willfully” broke federal law by deploying guard troops to Los Angeles over protests about immigration raids.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Republican justices seem eager to kill state bans on anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court broke from its increasingly common practice of deciding important cases without holding an oral argument or even explaining the reasoning of its decision, to hear a case about whether states may ban a practice known as “conversion therapy” — therapy sessions which seek to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. Realistically, there was never any chance that this Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 Republican supermajority, would uphold the Colorado law at issue in Chiles v. Salazar. That said, two uncertain questions did emerge from the Chiles argument. One is whether the Supreme Court will immediately strike down Colorado's ban on conversion therapy, or whether it will send the case back down to lower courts to apply a test known as “strict scrutiny,” which nearly all laws fail. The more important question is to what extent the Court will strip state governments of their longstanding power to regulate health care and other professionals, at least when those professionals give dangerous advice to their patients and clients. Her lawyer, James Campbell, said at oral argument that she wants to have “full conversations exploring issues of identity and gender,” and that “includes considering chang[ing]” a patient's identity. Therefore, Colorado cannot prevent her from providing conversion therapy. Colorado, meanwhile, points to the long history of states regulating the advice that licensed professionals give to their clients. A lawyer cannot tell a client that it is legal to rob banks, for example, even though this bad legal advice is just speech. Under that rule, Colorado's ban on conversion therapy is lawful because, as one federal appeals court explained, “every major medical, psychiatric, psychological, and professional mental health organization opposes the use of conversion therapy.” At least two of them seemed to doubt whether medical expertise is actually something that can be relied upon at all. In one of the most dramatic moments in the Chiles argument, Justice Samuel Alito compared Colorado's ban on conversion therapy to an infamous Virginia law calling for “feeble minded” individuals to be sterilized. He pressed Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Wells Stevenson on whether the consensus within the medical profession is sometimes “politicized.” And he even quoted his Court's statement in Buck v. Bell (1927) that forced sterilization laws are acceptable because “three generations of imbeciles are enough.” Buck involved a woman who was confined in a state-run “Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded” and who was sterilized by order of the government. Justice Neil Gorsuch, however, did raise a more sophisticated version of the “can we really trust health care professionals?” question. So, under Colorado's proposed rule, which permits states to ban treatments that do not align with the standard of care within a profession, couldn't states have banned therapists from affirming their gay patients' sexual orientations in the 1970s? Stevenson conceded that they could have back then. Relying on people who don't know what they are talking about? As even some of the Republican justices conceded, state malpractice laws have long punished licensed professionals who do not meet the standard of care within their profession. And this rule in malpractice cases is widespread for a very good reason. And they are far more likely to be correct than lay people. Significantly, the mental health profession abandoned its erroneous view of homosexuality decades ago. Unlike Alito and Gorsuch, Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed to accept that malpractice laws are valid during some of her questioning. But Gorsuch also tried to distinguish malpractice suits from the Colorado law at issue here by labeling the Colorado law a “prior restraint,” a term that refers to laws that attempt to ban speech before it is uttered. Malpractice suits, by contrast, typically arise after a doctor, lawyer, therapist, or other professional gives substandard advice to a patient or client. Thus, the Court could potentially decide Chiles relatively narrowly by striking down affirmative bans on conversion therapy, while still allowing patients who are harmed by this discredited treatment to sue their therapists. For what it is worth, Stevenson argued that it's not clear that Colorado's law actually functions as a prior restraint. Both of these procedures occur after the substandard care has been provided. So, even if the Court accepts the distinction between malpractice suits and more precisely drawn bans on professional misconduct like Colorado's, it may find it difficult to police this line in future cases. One other question that came up is whether the lower courts should be given another chance to look at this law before it is struck down. And, in this case, a majority of the justices appeared ready to impose a new rule: Bans on conversion therapy must overcome strict scrutiny. For a law to survive strict scrutiny, the government must show that it is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” interest. Stevenson argues that, had Colorado known it had to overcome this very difficult test to defend its law, it would have introduced more empirical studies into the record demonstrating why the law is justified. And she said the state should be given a chance to provide that evidence to a lower court before the law is struck down. But, of the Court's six Republicans, only Barrett appeared open to this argument — though Justice Brett Kavanaugh was silent during the argument. So it's far from clear that there are five votes who would support remanding the case to a lower court. (Notably, Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, asked some questions at the end suggesting that she may be willing to join the Republicans in applying strict scrutiny if they agree to a remand). This Supreme Court is often sloppy when it hands down decisions that pit the religious right against LGBTQ Americans. If they interpret the First Amendment to bar any specific restrictions on what professionals can tell their clients, then states could lose the power to prevent doctors from giving dangerous advice to their patients. But now, the most important question is whether the Court will concede that medical expertise has some role to play in regulating speech between health providers and patients. Trump is attempting to deploy the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. The latest on Trump's Gaza peace plan, briefly explained. The president's relationships with Netanyahu and Putin have something in common.</p>

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on Tuesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago on Tuesday. "Why do you want to keep this secret?" The word is, and I think it's been confirmed by the White House, they are going to transfer Texas National Guard units to the state of Illinois. "As you shut down the government — you voted to shut down the government, and you're sitting here — our law enforcement officers aren't being paid. They're out there working to protect you. If you're not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will," Bondi responded. Attorney General Pam Bondi is sworn in before a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025. The pair continued to argue as Durbin claimed Trump's budget plan cut funding for certain law enforcement programs in Illinois. Bondi said she would "work with" his office if he named the specific programs. "Tell me a specific grant that I turned off in Illinois that would help law enforcement, and I will work with you, but you have not done that," Bondi said. Right now, as we speak, so is [FBI Director Kash] Patel and deputy director Todd Blanche. You're sitting here grilling me, and they're on their way to Chicago," she added. Durbin responded, "It is my job to grill you." FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed in an X post that he was Chicago bound on Tuesday morning. "Chicago will be saved, and this FBI will continue to crush violent crime there, and all around the country. Heading to the Windy City now," Patel wrote. Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks at an oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025. The exchange between Bondi and Durbin comes just days after Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sued to block Trump from deploying troops to Chicago. State and city leaders are seeking both an emergency restraining order to immediately head off Trump's effort and longer-term injunctive relief. J.B. Pritzker speaks during a press conference amid reports of federal deployments to Chicago. "We must now start calling this what it is: Trump's Invasion," the Democratic governor said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lawsuit was filed Monday, just as troops prepared to deploy and just hours after a federal judge blocked their deployment to Portland, Oregon. Governor JB Pritzker talks to media at a news conference in Chicago, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. The Democratic governors of California and Illinois are threatening to leave the National Governors Association because of its silence on President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops across state lines despite objections from the receiving states' leaders. “If we cannot come together, on a bipartisan basis, on this basic principle of state sovereignty, what purpose does the National Governors Association serve?” California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked in a letter to the nation's other governors. The bipartisan governors' group, founded in 1908, advocates for issues on which governors find common ground and hosts meetings where they can exchange ideas. JB Pritzker, both potential 2028 presidential candidates, contend Trump's troop deployments should be a matter of concern for all governors. But some Republican governors have supported Trump's actions, and the national governors' group has not taken a position. Mike Kehoe, who co-chairs the organization's task force on emergency management and public health. Laura Kelly said she didn't think the roughly $100,000 annual dues paid by the state were a good investment and encouraged the group to push back against canceled federal grants. The bipartisan governors' organization is far from the first institution to face division and doubts over how it should respond to sweeping changes in Trump's second term. Since returning to office, Trump has been using executive power in ways that presidents usually don't. Democratic officials in those states have sued over the efforts, as has California. Newsom and Pritzker have argued the National Guard deployments are not just a policy difference but an infringement on state sovereignty that must be condemned. “The credibility of the National Governors Association — and our integrity as state executives — rests on our willingness to apply our principles consistently, regardless of which administration attacks them,” Pritzker said in a letter Monday to Oklahoma Gov. Stitt did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment from The Associated Press. But he said in a news conference last month that the group should steer clear of areas where there's not a consensus and leave those to the Democratic Governors Association and Republican Governors Association. Greg Abbott, who authorized the call-up of 400 Texas National Guard members, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. On Monday, he posted a cartoon on his X account showing the Democratic governors of California, Illinois and New York telling Trump, “LEAVE OUR CRIME ALONE.” Some topics where governors have found common ground include disaster preparedness, workforce development and expanding broadband access. Last week, Stitt and NGA vice chair Wes Moore, the Democratic governor of Maryland and a possible 2028 presidential candidate, condemned the then-looming federal government shutdown, calling for dialogue but not a specific policy solution: “We urge federal leaders from both sides to work to set aside political games and pass a budget that reflects the values and promises states commit to every day.” But no unity has emerged on Trump's immigration and crime-fighting policies. Kehoe said no one has asked him to sign onto a statement denouncing Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to states against a governor's will. “Certainly Chicago could use some help,” Kehoe said.

Gavin Newsom action's on crime and San Francisco Police Department's guidelines for I.C.E . A career criminal is asking to swap prison time for a drug-treatment program nearly five years after his New Year's Eve rampage in downtown San Francisco allegedly killed two pedestrians – reigniting fierce debate over California's woke criminal justice practices. On Friday, Troy McAlister's attorney, Scott Grant, asked the court to grant mental-health and substance-abuse diversion under California Penal Code §1001.36, which could allow McAlister to enter treatment instead of facing decades in prison if Judge Michael Begert rules that he qualifies. In deep-blue San Francisco, residents rallied to protest what they say would undermine accountability. "91 felonies, 2 deaths, No more chances," signs read outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice. The case of McAlister, 50, has long been a lightning rod of restorative justice reform, forcing elected officials to confront whether policies meant to show compassion to offenders put the public at risk. This undated photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) shows Troy McAlister, a parolee who was intoxicated when he ran a red light in a stolen car on New Year's Eve, killing two pedestrians. The motion has sparked protests outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice, with community members and victims' families calling the diversion request an "insult to justice." Some have even threatened to recall Begert if diversion is granted. "Troy McAlister has been charged with 91 felonies over the course of his multi-decades career here in San Francisco, and we don't think that someone should be given infinite chances to ultimately correct course," Scotty Jacobs, director of Blueprint for a Better San Francisco, told KTVU-TV. "While there's certain people who should be granted diversion and ultimately given the opportunity to rebuild their lives, Troy McAlister has demonstrated that despite being given that opportunity multiple times, he has continued to pose a threat to San Franciscans, and we believe he needs to be in jail." Michael Isaku Begert is a judge on the San Francisco County Superior Court. McAlister was on parole on Dec. 31, 2020, when he allegedly drove a stolen car while intoxicated, ran a red light, and killed Hanako Abe, 27, and Elizabeth Platt, 60. McAlister's long rap sheet has become a symbol of the larger question facing San Francisco – whether repeat offenders should get one more chance at rehabilitation or finally face life in prison. Police said he got out of the car after the crash and ran into a nearby building, where he was arrested within minutes. McAlister is facing a slew of charges, including manslaughter in connection to the crash. Following the incident, the senseless deaths caused outrage after critics argued he should have been behind bars given his lengthy criminal record. McAlister previously served five years in county jail for robbing a market with an airsoft gun. His subsequent arrests while out of parole came for allegedly stealing cars near the Balboa BART Station, bashing down a door of a vacant apartment building claiming the owner gave him permission to use drugs there, and for jumping into a car and grabbing at the driver's pockets until the driver exited the vehicle. The district attorney's office never formally filed charges in connection to those offenses. Former San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, who was recalled in 2022, claimed that his city is experiencing a "hard turn to the right." The tragedy fueled the 2022 recall of District Attorney Chesa Boudin, as critics accused him of being too lenient with repeat offenders. Following the hit-and-run incident of 2020, Boudin said that "hindsight is 20/20." "Every single law enforcement agency that has had contact with Mr. McAlister wishes they had done something different that might have prevented this tragedy, and that certainly includes my office and my staff." Under current DA Brooke Jenkins, prosecutors are fighting the diversion motion. California Penal Code §1001.36, which was enacted in 2018, allows certain criminals with a diagnosed mental health or substance-use disorder to enter court-supervised treatment instead of facing trial. The judge has not yet ruled on whether McAlister is eligible for court-supervised treatment. Fox News Digital has reached out to Boudin, the San Francisco County Superior Court and Grant for comment. Courtney Boose, 41, is accused of stabbing a 69-year-old man at a Lawrence gas station, and it's far from his first run-in with police. According to Fox 59, records show he's been arrested 99 times over the years for charges ranging from theft to battery, yet he's never served prison time. His latest arrest has sparked outrage among Indianapolis leaders who say his case exposes deep flaws in the criminal justice system's handling of repeat offenders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Attorney General Pam Bondi is appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee this morning. • Bondi has deflected questions from Democrats on a variety of issues. “Senator, I am not going to discuss that with you,” she said to a question about internal DOJ discussions on prosecuting a Trump political opponent. • The hearing comes after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey by a federal grand jury, an extraordinary escalation in President Donald Trump's effort to prosecute his political enemies. The official specifically pointed out Bondi's exchange with Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono, when the AG was asked whether she approved closing an investigation into border czar Tom Homan allegedly accepting a bag of cash from undercover FBI agents. “You are also on video outside the White House protesting with a group called CASA, where Antifa members were. Comey indictment and DOJ firings: Bondi repeatedly told senators she wouldn't discuss her conversations with Trump regarding James Comey's recent indictment and refused to answer questions regarding DOJ attorneys who were fired following their work on January 6 cases or for refusing certain prosecutions of anti-Trump figures. Acting at the behest of Trump: In response to questions about whether she considered a social media post from Trump a directive to prosecute several perceived enemies of the president, Bondi replied simply: “Trump is the most transparent president in American history, and I don't think he said anything that he hasn't said for years.” Because of executive privilege, cabinet officials largely decline to share their conversations with the president without authorization. Tom Homan investigation: Bondi stonewalled questions for details about the reports that her department closed an investigation into border czar Tom Homan after he allegedly accepted a bag of cash from undercover FBI agents, testifying that investigators “found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing” and warning Democrats to “look at your facts.” US military strikes on boats in the Caribbean: Democratic Sen. Chris Coons asked Bondi about decision making behind US military strikes on boats traveling off the coast of Venezuela, which the administration has said were “affiliated” with drug cartels designated as terrorist organizations. “I'm not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may, or may not, have given or issued at the direction of the President on this matter,” Bondi said. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying her deflections and challenging responses possibly represent a “new low” for her position. “I think it is possibly a new low for attorneys general testifying before the United States Congress, and I just hope my Republican colleagues will demand more accountability than what we have seen so far.” We agree on both sides of the aisle that weaponizing justice to target political adversaries, or opponents, or people disliked by the president ought to stop,” he added. “We need to come together and stop this kind of absolutely venomous, vile attacks on people who legitimately question whether the Department of Justice has been used for political or personal ends,” he said. During Tuesday's hearing, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz criticized a federal judge for handing down an eight-year sentence to the person who plotted to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following the leaked opinion that later overturned Roe v. Wade. Bondi and Republicans have highlighted that the individual, Sophie Roske, is a transgender woman and have argued that the judge unfairly considered this fact when determining her sentence. Roske, who called the police on herself down the street from Kavanaugh's home in Maryland one summer night in 2022, had brought with her a loaded firearm, knife, pepper spray and burglary tools – telling law enforcement she intended to kill the Justice and then herself. The judge credited Roske for turning herself in and voiced concern that given recent executive orders from President Donald Trump on the treatment of transgender people in custody, prison would be additionally punitive for Roske. Attorney General Pam Bondi would not discuss specifics of the Justice Department's indictment of former FBI Director James Comey last month, but she did defend the effort by arguing the indictment was handed up by a liberal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia. Asked by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, whether career prosecutors found insufficient evidence to indict Comey, Bondi responded: “I am not going to discuss pending cases because Comey was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia by, I may point out, is one of the most liberal grand juries in the country.” He was charged by US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan – a Trump loyalist who was appointed after the prior US attorney, Erik Siebert, resigned under pressure for not bringing charges against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Bondi was asked about a social media post from President Donald Trump in September, addressed directly to the attorney general, where Trump asked directly why several Democrats and a former federal official had not been prosecuted by the Justice Department. “They're all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” Trump wrote. “We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility.” Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar asked Bondi whether she considered the post “a directive to the Justice Department” to prosecute those individuals, including Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Attorney General Pam Bondi came prepared for challenges from Senate democrats, using quick one-liners and prepared arguments to dodge questions on the Epstein investigation, national guard deployments, and accusations that she has used the Justice Department for political purposes. The attorney general fended off questions about her firing of senior prosecutors for what Democrats allege were political reasons, saying “the personnel issue that I'm having right now is that all of my agents, all of my lawyers, are…working without a paycheck because your party voted to shut down the federal government.” As Democratic senators pushed her on President Donald Trump's connections to accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, the attorney general repeatedly claimed that those same Democrats had connections to another alleged associate of Epstein's, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. She also questioned why Democrats hadn't raised concerns about the Epstein investigation before her term, at one point challenging senators with “did you ask Merrick Garland any of this over the last four years when he sat before you?” In one exchange during which Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse accused Emil Bove of prosecutorial misconduct during his brief stint as principal associate deputy attorney general, Bondi interrupted Whitehouse to say that his “time has expired.” Attorney General Pam Bondi skirted specific questions about reports that White House border czar Tom Homan accepted $50,000 before the 2024 election over promises of government contracts, stating simply that the investigation was closed. “They found no credible evidence of any wrongdoing,” Bondi said as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, continued to ask what, exactly, happened to the $50,000 Homan reportedly received. “So having you respond with completely irrelevant far-right internet talking points really is not very helpful here.” “You know Senator Durbin, I find it very interesting that you refused repeated Republican requests to release the Epstein flight logs in 2023 and 2024,” Bondi shot back. “Why did you fight to not disclose the flight logs, Senator Durbin?” Durbin asked why Bondi had claimed on Fox News in February that the infamous “client list” from Epstein was sitting on her desk to be reviewed but never released such a list. “Our memo on Epstein clearly points out that there was no client list,” she added. Bondi responded she would not disclose conversations with the White House. If you're not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will,” she added. Durbin responded that he had asked a “simple question” on the legal rationale for deploying the National Guard and it became “grounds for a personal attack.” Bondi said later during Durbin's questioning that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and FBI Director Kash Patel were “on the way to Chicago,” too. Attorney General Pam Bondi addressed allegations from Republican senators that the Biden administration improperly spied on them, calling it a “betrayal of public trust.” Senate Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, said Monday that the FBI, as part of special counsel Jack Smith's January 6 investigation, used court orders in 2023 to obtain the phone records of nine GOP lawmakers. “They were playing politics with law enforcement powers and will go down as a historic betrayal of public trust,” she said. Attorney General Pam Bondi is set to testify Tuesday on a Justice Department faced with increasing accusations of chaos and politicization. That accusation came to a head in late September, when the DOJ secured an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime adversary of the president. Lawmakers are still pushing for unreacted documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Justice Department officials are participating in long-running efforts by the Trump administration to crackdown on cities it says has high rates of crime. Efforts are currently underway in Washington, DC, Chicago, Memphis and Portland. And a similar crackdown took place in Los Angeles over the summer. Bondi and other top DOJ officials have reported an increased number of arrests in the cities, and say that officials are seizing a large amount of illegal firearms. After releasing some documents early this year to conservative influencers and promising more, the Justice Department and FBI in July released a memo stating that there was no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was murdered. Bondi has stated there are no additional files that can be made public, as many include identifying information of victims or uncharged individuals that legally cannot be made public. The battle reached Capitol Hill as lawmakers demanded all case files be made available to them for review. The DOJ has since released documents, though most of them were already publicly available. Lawmakers are still working to get more information on two fronts: a probe is already underway by the House Oversight Committee, and there is an effort by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is seeking to compel the DOJ to release a full, unredacted version of the documents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live as Attorney General Pam Bondi faces lawmakers at a congressional hearing. The session comes amid growing questions about political influence over a Justice Department that has already criminally charged one of President Donald Trump's longtime foes and is under intense White House pressure to prosecute others. WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Pam Bondi repeatedly deflected questions as she sought during a combative congressional hearing on Tuesday to defend herself against growing criticism that she's turning the law enforcement agency into a weapon to seek vengeance against President Donald Trump's political opponents. Bondi brushed aside with seeming disdain questions about her tumultuous tenure, flatly refusing to answer time and again as Democrats pressed her on politically charged investigations, the firings of career prosecutors and other matters. Her refusal to engage on the questions meant little if any fresh insight was offered about her actions and decisions, with Bondi instead opting to respond to Democrats' attacks by echoing conservative claims that President Joe Biden's Justice Department — which brought two criminal cases against Trump — was the one that had been weaponized. “They were playing politics with law enforcement powers and will go down as a historic betrayal of public trust,” Bondi said of the Biden Justice Department. We will work to earn that back every single day.” They pointed to revelations from a day earlier that the FBI had analyzed phone records of several Republican lawmakers as part of an investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, a Democrat. “This is an outrage, an unconstitutional breach and ought to be immediately addressed by you and Director Patel,” Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the committee, told Bondi, referring to FBI Director Kash Patel. In eight short months, you fundamentally transformed the Justice Department and left an enormous stain in American history. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, reminded Bondi of that commitment and asked her if she thought she had upheld it. “I pledged that I would end the weaponization also of the Justice Department and that America would once again have a one tier system of justice for all,” Bondi said. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Pam Bondi says she will not allow justice to be weaponized. “Madam Attorney General,” Durbin replied, “it's my job to grill you.” She refused repeatedly to discuss matters, including a bribery investigation into Trump border czar Tom Homan that was shuttered under the Trump administration. That drew the ire of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, who accused Bondi of responding with “far-right internet talking points.” She also declined to say whether she talked to the president about the case against Comey, who was charged last month with lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee when he said he had not authorized anyone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about a particular investigation. His indictment came just days after Trump appeared to publicly implore her on social media to take that action against him and other perceived political enemies. “This is supposed to be an oversight hearing in which members of Congress can get serious answer to serious questions about the coverup of corruption, about the prosecution of the president's enemies,” Sen. Adam Schiff of California, a Democrat from California, said as Bondi repeatedly interrupted him. “And when will be that the members of this committee on a bipartisan basis demand answers to those questions and refuse to accept personal slander as an answer to those questions?” The Justice Department under Bondi has opened criminal investigations into other vocal critics of the president, including Schiff on accusations of mortgage fraud, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor and current mayoral candidate.

Portland business owners Loretta Guzman and Amy Nichols react to the idea of deploying National Guard troops to help mitigate the crime crisis in the city. President Donald Trump said he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy federal troops in U.S. cities after a federal judge blocked his administration from sending National Guard units to Portland. So far it hasn't been necessary. But we have an Insurrection Act for a reason," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I'd do that. We have to make sure that our cities are safe," he added. U.S. President Donald Trump looks on during a meeting at the 80th session of the UN General Assembly at the United Nations headquarters on Sept. 23, 2025, in New York City. If invoked, it would grant Trump the authority to federalize the Guard and deploy active duty forces to restore order. "If we don't have to use it, I wouldn't use it," Trump later said on Newsmax, before adding, "If you take a look at what's been going on in Portland, it's been going on for a long time, and that's insurrection. The comments came after a federal judge on Sunday blocked the Trump administration from deploying California and Texas National Guard troops to Portland's streets amid protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The same court earlier had denied Trump from deploying Oregon's own Guard to the city. "Portland's been on fire for years — and not so much saving it," Trump told reporters Monday. "We have to save something else, because I think that's all insurrection. But Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, said there was no evidence recent protests against ICE made the federalized Guard troops necessary. About 100 National Guard troops had already arrived in Portland to handle increasingly contentious protests outside an ICE facility, and that deployment had been expected to double by the end of the day before the judge issued her order. A protester reacts as law enforcement officers deploy smoke grenades to disperse people outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters in south Portland, Oregon, Oct. 5, 2025. California and Oregon had sued over the deployment. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller tore into the judge's ruling, calling it "one of the most egregious and thunderous violations of constitutional order we have ever seen." "There is no legal distinction between a state volunteering guardsmen to guard the border and volunteering guardsmen to guard a federal immigration facility," Miller said. A demonstrator in an inflatable Capybara costume stands outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters in Portland, Ore., Oct. 6, 2025. Trump has also ordered Guard troops from other states to deploy to Chicago and Memphis. JB Pritzker suggested Trump was trying to sow unrest so he could deploy the Insurrection Act at a news conference Monday. "The Trump administration is following a playbook: cause chaos, create fear and confusion, make it seem like peaceful protesters are a mob by firing gas pellets and tear gas canisters at them," Pritzker said. To create the pretext for invoking the Insurrection Act so that he can send military troops to our city."

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports after test votes fail in the Senate as Democrats continue holding out for healthcare subsidies. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., needs at least eight Senate Democratic caucus members to join Republicans to reopen the government, given that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has consistently voted against the GOP's bill. So far, a trio of Democratic caucus members, Sens. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Oct. 3, 2025. That group has joined Republicans in nearly all five attempts to reopen the government. But, as time drags on and a deal remains out of reach, at least one is considering changing his vote. "I think this problem is urgent, and just saying, as the leader did on Friday, ‘well, we'll have conversations about it,' is not adequate," he said. King's possible defection comes as Republicans and Democrats engage in low-level conversations on a path out of the shutdown. Those impromptu dialogues have so far not morphed into real negotiations, however. Three senators who all caucus with the Democratic Party bucked their party by supporting a Republican-led appropriations package that Democrats refused to agree to, leading to a federal government shutdown. Senate Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., want a firm deal in place to extend expiring ObamaCare subsidies. Senate Republicans have said that they will negotiate a deal only after the government is reopened and want reforms to the program that they charge has been inflationary and further increased the cost of healthcare for Americans. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has circulated an early plan that includes a discussion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies that could be a way out of the shutdown, but so far, it's in its preliminary stages. "But there will be a commitment to having that discussion." President Donald Trump signaled on Monday that he would be open to a deal on the subsidies, and he said that negotiations with Democrats were ongoing. President Donald Trump makes his way to board Air Force One before departing from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Sept. 21, 2025. However, Schumer pushed back and called Trump's assertion "not true." "So ending this shutdown will require Donald Trump to step in and push Speaker Johnson to negotiate." A new memo reported by Axios suggested that furloughed federal employees may not have to receive back pay, running counter to a law that Trump signed in 2019 that guaranteed furloughed workers would receive back pay in future shutdowns. That comes on the heels of a memo from the Office of Management and Budget last month that signaled mass firings beyond the typical furloughs of nonessential federal workers, and it follows the withholding of nearly $30 billion in federal funds for blue cities and states. Thune argued that "if you're the executive branch of the government, you've got to manage a shutdown." "At some point, you're going to have to make some decisions about who gets paid, who doesn't get paid, which agencies and departments get priorities and prioritized and which ones don't," Thune said. Now, hopefully that doesn't affect back pay … but again, it's just that simple: open up the government." Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

Prince Harry had multiple close encounters with a stalker during his recent trip to the U.K. Last month, a woman — who is believed to be struggling with mental health issues — was able to come within feet of the Duke of Sussex on two separate occasions, according to The Telegraph. Prince Harry, pictured arriving at the WellChild Awards at the Royal Lancaster Hotel on Sept. 8, 2025, in London, came within feet of his alleged stalker. She was evicted from the hotel and allegedly photographed near his car as he arrived. One day later, she reportedly came near Harry as he visited the Centre for Blast Injury Studies in west London. A representative for the Duke of Sussex told Fox News Digital that they "do not comment on security issues." A security source told Fox News Digital, "These incidents are not uncommon for members of the Royal Family. It differs however, because there was no police presence or close protection — it was left to two staffers from his private office to intervene. This time they got lucky, recognizing the fixated individual. Relying on luck is not a long-term fix." The Duke of Sussex was in London to support key causes and charities. "It feels like there is an inevitable foreboding looming over this whole issue. Earlier this year, the 41-year-old lost his appeal challenging the U.K. government's decision to strip him of his publicly funded security after he stepped back as a senior royal. He also paid tribute to his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, on the third anniversary of her death, visiting her grave in Windsor and laying flowers. Prince Harry also reunited with his father, King Charles III, marking a turning point in their relationship. Sources close to Harry previously told People magazine that Charles, who was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in 2024, was not answering his calls or letters. Royal experts told Fox News Digital that Harry and his brother Prince William, heir to the British throne, are not on speaking terms. In May of this year, Harry told the BBC that he wanted to reconcile with his family. There's no point in continuing to fight anymore," Harry told the outlet. "I don't know how much longer my father has." Harry has been estranged from his family since he and his wife Meghan Markle stepped back as senior royals in 2020 and moved to California.

(AP Photo/Wade Payne, File) A 69-year-old truck driver who was seriously injured in a fight that prosecutors say was started by former NFL quarterback and sports analyst Mark Sanchez is now suing Sanchez and his employer, Fox Corporation, in Indiana state court. Lawyers for Perry Tole filed the lawsuit Monday seeking an unspecified amount in actual and punitive damages, as well as attorney's fees. The lawsuit accuses Sanchez of instigating a fight with Tole late Saturday night outside a downtown Indianapolis hotel, leading to “severe permanent disfigurement, loss of function” and other injuries and emotional distress. Tole also stabbed Sanchez several times in the fight, according to police. A media contact for Fox Corporation did not immediately respond to an email Tuesday seeking comment. Attorneys representing Sanchez in his criminal case declined to comment on the lawsuit. Attorneys representing Tole in the lawsuit, which requested a trial by jury, did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Sanchez is facing a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanor charges, for what prosecutors said Monday was a fight over parking. “We are literally talking about people fighting over a parking space and-or a dispute about where people are parking, and it resulted in someone receiving just incredibly significant injures,” Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears said at a news conference Monday. A police affidavit says the 38-year-old Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis. When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said. He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Capitol is illuminated at dawn in Washington, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. The Capitol is illuminated at dawn in Washington, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. A sign that reads “Closed due to federal government shutdown,” is seen outside of the National Gallery of Art on the 6th day of the government shutdown, in Washington, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration warned on Tuesday of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a government shutdown, reversing what has been long-standing policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a memo being circulated by the White House. Trump signed into law after the longest government shutdown in 2019 legislation that ensures federal workers receive back pay during any federal funding lapse. But in the new memo, his Office of Management and Budget says back pay must be provided by Congress, if it chooses to do so, as part of any bill to fund the government. “There are some people that don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way,” Trump said during an event at the White House. He said back pay “depends on who we're talking about.” Refusing retroactive pay to the workers, some of whom must remain on the job as essential employees, would be a stark departure from norms and practices and almost certainly would be met with legal action. While federal workers — as well as service members of the military — have often missed paychecks during past shutdowns, they are almost always reimbursed once the government reopens. What questions do you have for them? Johnson, a lawyer, said he hadn't fully read the memo but “there are some legal analysts who are saying” that it may not be necessary or appropriate to repay the federal workers. “Another baseless attempt to try and scare & intimidate workers by an administration run by crooks and cowards,” said Murray, who is the ranking lawmaker on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “The letter of the law is as plain as can be — federal workers, including furloughed workers, are entitled to their backpay following a shutdown.” In a single-page memo from Trump's Office of Management and Budget under Russ Vought, first reported by Axios, the office's general counsel seeks to lay out a legal rationale for no back pay of federal workers. The memo explains that while the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 says workers shall be paid after federal funding is restored, it argues the action is not self-executing. For now, Congress remains at a standstill, with neither side — nor the White House — appearing willing to budge. Democrats are fighting for health care funds to prevent a lapse in federal subsidies that threaten to send insurance rates skyrocketing. Republicans say the issue can be dealt with later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tropical Storm Jerry formed over the central Atlantic Ocean Tuesday and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday. Jerry is the 10th named storm of a late-blooming season that has produced three hurricanes in just over two weeks. Jerry could bring rain and wind to these islands, depending on its exact track. Tropical storm watches could be issued for parts of the islands by Tuesday night. East Coast cold fronts like these become more common in October, so more worrisome for the US are late-season storms that often form in the Gulf and Caribbean. Since these regions are closer to land, any storms that form have a greater chance to cause dangerous impacts. There is a low chance a system could try to develop in the southwest Gulf later this week, but of greater interest is a storm-spawning weather pattern that might develop by mid-October. A broad area of stormy weather is likely to form around that time and rotate around the western Caribbean region, according to an outlook issued last week by Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Known as the Central American Gyre, this area of stormy weather and spin is notorious for generating late-season storms. It's too early to know if this weather pattern will produce a storm this October, but forecasters will be monitoring the region deeper into the month. Four named storms typically form in October and November, but some hurricane seasons can have a stronger finish while others mostly shut off. The last few years illustrate this year-to-year ebb and flow. While there are usually fewer storms at the tail end of the season, recent years show how destructive they can still be. And maybe most notorious of all:  Hurricane Sandy morphed into a hybrid superstorm in late-October 2012 and walloped the East Coast. Last year's late-season run began in late-September when Hurricane Helene ravaged the Southeast with its catastrophic flooding and winds. It was punctuated by Hurricane Milton's exceptional burst to Category 5 strength before weakening as it struck the Florida Peninsula in early October. After Hurricane Erin rapidly intensified into a Category 5 monster in mid-August, the Atlantic mostly went to sleep. Then came a barrage of three hurricanes — Gabrielle, Humberto and Imelda — forming in a two-week-stretch to end September, breaking an unusual quiet spell. Hurricanes Gabrielle and Humberto also rapidly intensified like Erin. Still, no hurricanes have made a US landfall this season. If that luck continues through the end of November, it would be first hurricane landfall-free season in a decade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Benjamin Netanyahu has now served as prime minister of Israel longer than anyone in history — three non-consecutive stints over 18 years, or almost a quarter of the time Israel has been an independent country. Netanyahu was facing possible indictment over a bribery scandal involving his attorney general — though, as the Washington Post noted in an editorial headlined “Can Mr. Netanyahu hang on?,” he was already “hip-deep in controversy” before that scandal erupted. After an embarrassingly botched assassination attempt targeting Hamas' Khaled Meshal that damaged relations with Israel's most important Arab ally, the Economist dubbed him “Israel's serial bungler.” While Netanyahu's “easy eloquence” appealed to supporters abroad, particularly American Republicans, the British weekly noted, “as the wayward decisions mount up, his support is starting to dwindle. Polls show Netanyahu's coalition would be out of power if elections were held today. That coalition is itself divided and in danger of falling apart at nearly any time over the contentious issue of military service for the ultra-Orthodox. He is facing potential jail time in a long-running corruption trial, as well as a commission of inquiry over the security failures that led to October 7, the most violent day in Israel's history. He evidently takes these charges seriously enough that his flight to the UN General Assembly in New York month took a circuitous route to avoid countries that might enforce the ICC's arrest warrant. Israel itself is increasingly isolated on the world stage, threatened with expulsion from international projects ranging from important scientific research consortiums to the Eurovision song contest. Then, last week, Netanyahu was effectively strong-armed by President Donald Trump into accepting a peace deal for Gaza that short-circuits a military operation he had already ordered and that undercuts his vow to continue fighting until Hamas is completely eliminated. (Hamas has already agreed to hand over political power but is still negotiating on other parts of the deal, including the crucial question of whether it will give up its weapons.) Whether he knows it or not, the prime minister certainly looks like he was gifted yet another (almost literal) get-out-of-jail-free card by the US president. As Trump reportedly put it himself in a conversation with Netanyahu, “I don't know why you're always so f***ing negative. It's been widely alleged, with a great deal of reported evidence, that Netanyahu has prolonged the war in order to maintain his grip on power. Accepting a hostage deal that entailed a withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, or left either Hamas or the Palestinian authority in charge of Gaza, would likely have led to a government collapse, elections, likely political defeat, and potential jail time. Throughout his career, when faced with a seemingly impossible political dilemma with no good choices, Netanyahu's general move has been not to choose at all. So, too, has it been in this case; as the killing continued, Netanyahu waited. As of this writing, the success of the peace plan is still an open question, but Netanyahu probably benefits either way. Hamas responded positively, if somewhat noncommittally, to the plan on Friday. In fact, the language of the plan is vague as to when, if ever, Israeli troops will have to be entirely withdrawn from Gaza. The language on Palestinian statehood is even vaguer; the Palestinian Authority would take power in Gaza only after a period of “reform” that could go on indefinitely. Any countenancing of a two-state solution or a role for the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza is unacceptable to them, no matter how vaguely worded. But both men are currently in positions of enormous power and influence after years in the political wilderness when they were shunned by the mainstream. They're likely to think twice about giving up their current positions. Even if they do, opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz have enthusiastically backed the Trump peace plan and offered to support Netanyahu's government temporarily if his far-right partners bolt. In any event, Netanyahu can head into Israel's next elections — which are scheduled for October 2026 but could be called sooner — campaigning as the leader who defeated Hamas, brought the hostages home, and bombed Iran's nuclear program too. Yes, Netanyahu may have looked less than Churchillian as he effectively took orders from Trump over the past week, but Israel is one of the few countries where the US president polls well, so that may not be as much of a liability as it would be elsewhere. On the other hand, if Hamas ultimately balks at releasing its hostages, or tries to stretch on negotiations indefinitely, Trump has indicated he will give Israel carte blanche to “finish the job” in Gaza. This would be a catastrophe for Gaza and the remaining hostages and deepen Israel's international isolation, but it would allow Netanyahu to maintain the current status quo. While this would be a disappointing outcome for Israelis, if Hamas refuses, it will allow the prime minister to make the case — which is likely to be more effective at home than abroad — that he has given the group an opportunity for a diplomatic way out and that the only option left is to continue crushing it by military force. The prime minister has been on trial since 2020 on a variety of corruption charges that could potentially bring up to 10 years jail time. (In Israel, this is not an idle threat: Netanyahu's predecessor, Ehud Olmert, was sentenced to six years in prison on bribery charges after leaving office and served 18 months.) A scathing independent commission last year blasted Netanyahu “for accepting the doctrine of ‘money for quiet,' and utterly ignoring all other perceptions.” But two months after fellow International Criminal Court-indictee Vladimir Putin walked the red carpet in Alaska, with the war in Ukraine still raging, it's hard to imagine that Netanyahu's international isolation will be permanent. Last year, the New York Times' Thomas Friedman opined that Netanyahu would have to choose between “Rafah or Riyadh” — doubling down on the destruction of Gaza or deepening relations with neighboring powers like Saudi Arabia. With Arab countries taking part ownership of Trump's peace deal, it seems at least possible that he won't have to choose. More consequentially, the brutal war in Gaza has deepened Israel's political isolation. Even if governments may lose interest in sanctioning Israel, it has lost an enormous amount of public support, including among constituencies like American Jews, who were once among its staunchest supporters. Though Netanyahu has made plain his preference for having Trump in office, rather than any Democrat, he has also found this president much more difficult to defy than Barack Obama or Joe Biden. This could pose problems for him down the road. But if we've learned anything after Netanyahu's two decades in power, it's that, for him, those are problems for another day. Trump is attempting to deploy the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. The latest on Trump's Gaza peace plan, briefly explained. The president's relationships with Netanyahu and Putin have something in common.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suspected Chinese government operatives asked ChatGPT to help write proposal for a tool to conduct large-scale surveillance and to help promote another that allegedly scans social media accounts for “extremist speech,” ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said in a report published Tuesday. The report sounds the alarm about how a highly coveted artificial intelligence technology can be used to try to make repression more efficient and provides “a rare snapshot into the broader world of authoritarian abuses of AI,” OpenAI said. But the new report shows how AI is often used by suspected state actors to carry out relatively mundane tasks, like crunching data or making language more polished, rather any startling new technological achievement. “There's a push within the People's Republic of China to get better at using artificial intelligence for large-scale things like surveillance and monitoring,” Ben Nimmo, principal investigator at OpenAI, told CNN. “It's not last year that the Chinese Communist Party started surveilling its own population. But now they've heard of AI and they're thinking, oh maybe we can use this to get a little bit better.” In one case, a ChatGPT user “likely connected to a [Chinese] government entity” asked the AI model to help write a proposal for a tool that analyzes the travel movements and police records of the Uyghur minority and other “high-risk” people, according to the OpenAI report. Chinese firm DeepSeek alarmed US officials and investors in January when it presented a ChatGPT-like AI model called R1, which has all the familiar abilities but operates at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI's model. Asked about OpenAI's findings, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, said: “We oppose groundless attacks and slanders against China.” China is “rapidly building an AI governance system with distinct national characteristics,” Liu's statement continued. The OpenAI report includes several other examples of just how commonplace AI is in the daily operations of state-backed and criminal hackers, along with other scammers. Suspected Russian, North Korean and Chinese hackers have all used ChatGPT to perform tasks like refining their coding or make the phishing links they send to targets more plausible. For instance, Chinese and Russian state actors have often struggled to avoid basic language errors in influence operations on social media. “Adversaries are using AI to refine existing tradecraft, not to invent new kinds of cyberattacks,” Michael Flossman, another security expert with OpenAI, told reporters. Meanwhile, scammers very likely based in the Southeast Asian country of Myanmar have used OpenAI's models for a range of business tasks, from managing financial accounts to researching criminal penalties for online scams, according to the company. OpenAI estimates that ChatGPT is “being used to identify scams up to three times more often than it is being used for scams.” CNN asked OpenAI if it was aware of US military or intelligence agencies using ChatGPT for hacking operations. The company did not directly answer the question, instead referring CNN to OpenAI's policy of using AI in support of democracy. US Cyber Command, the military's offensive and defensive cyber unit, has made clear that it will use AI tools to support its mission.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Audrey Murray is losing sleep over the government shutdown that could soon derail her paychecks. Murray, 65, has worked as a cleaner at the Smithsonian Museum of American History for nearly three decades. Now she is among the hundreds of thousands of federal government contractors whose livelihoods are being threatened by the political dysfunction in Washington, DC. “It's so sad that they think they can play with people's lives,” Murray told CNN while fighting back tears. Unlike federal employees, contractors typically don't receive backpay when the government reopens from a shutdown. Low-wage service workers, including cleaners, janitors, security guards, cafeteria workers and other staffers who keep buildings operating, are often out of luck. If that happens, Murray worries how she will provide for her three children and grandchildren in Capitol Heights, Maryland. However, those federal workers get backpay once the lapse in funding is over. But there is no such obligation for government contract workers, according to legal experts. “Not only are they not guaranteed backpay, they rarely — if ever — get it,” said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project (NELP), a nonprofit advocating for an inclusive economy and worker rights. This is especially painful for lower-wage workers, who often live paycheck-to-paycheck and may have minimal savings for emergencies. Union officials say this problem has an even greater impact on women and people of color, who make up a bigger proportion of the low-wage workforce and often have fewer financial resources to bridge the gap. Tiara Roberts, a single mom in Maryland with three children, is concerned about how she will get by if her contract job providing security at a Smithsonian museum is derailed by the shutdown. “I have a lot on my plate already, and this is just an added-on stressor.” Nichole Atallah, a partner who specializes in labor and government contracting at the law firm PilieroMazza, said the general rule is that contract workers aren't made whole after a shutdown. It's lost,” Atallah told CNN in a phone interview. Although employers can decide to pay contract workers despite the shutdown, experts say that's rare when it comes to hourly workers in blue-collar jobs. Atallah said contract employers  will sometimes work to compensate workers in highly skilled positions who are hurt by the shutdown. “If I have a more highly skilled person working on contract, I'm more likely to bend over backwards to make sure someone doesn't find another job than I am with a janitor,” Atallah said. Although there is often a waiting period before someone can apply for unemployment benefits, Atallah urged impacted contract workers who get furloughed to immediately apply because some unemployment systems in the DC area are already strained by federal layoffs. “They should apply for unemployment as soon as possible so they're first in line if the shutdown lasts,” Atallah said. The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) estimates that more than half a million employees of federal contractors were without work and not provided backpay during the record-long shutdown of 2018-2019. A campaign to get backpay for contract workers failed to make headway during that shutdown, which lasted 35 days. Last week, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts introduced legislation to provide backpay for federal workers who face furloughs and lose income during a shutdown. The bill, called the Fair Pay for Federal Contractors Act, would provide backpay for contract workers, including low-wage service workers for an amount equal to their weekly compensation up to $1,442. “This is about fairness—contract workers and their families should not miss a paycheck because of a government shutdown they did nothing to cause,” Smith said in a statement about the legislation. Jamie Contreras, executive vice president at 32BJ SEIU, which represents about 2,400 federally contracted security officers, office cleaners and food service workers, urged the Trump administration and Republicans to avoid “punishing working-class families” in this shutdown. “Many are single mothers and the sole providers for their families who were forced to rely on public assistance to survive and fell further behind on bills during previous shutdowns.” White House spokesman Kush Desai declined to say whether the Trump administration supports paying federal contract workers who get furloughed during the shutdown. “American contract workers are another casualty of the Democrats' needless and destructive government shutdown,” Desai said in a statement to CNN. Maria Madonado, a single mother of three who lives in New Carrolton, Maryland, told CNN through a translator that her work as a contracted cleaner at the IRS headquarters is being impacted by the shutdown. Madonado, who is from El Salvador and has lived in the United States for 26 years, said it's “not fair” that she won't get paid because “it's not that we're not working because we don't want to.” Due to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, Madonado — who holds a green card — is reluctant to go on unemployment or apply for other aid out of fear it will hurt her chances of eventually becoming a US citizen. “It's really strange because you think you're more secure in a government job than in a regular job,” she said. “And today I realized that's not the case.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.
