                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bolavip, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective. Soccer will once again take over one of the most iconic places in New York City this weekend. The tournament, featuring more than 300 kids (ages 4-18) as well as adult and corporate teams, will set up 4v4 matches from morning to night (10am–10pm) as Duffy Square transforms into a pop-up soccer stadium. “We take a lot of pride in having that opportunity to give back to the kids, and to show the world that we are working with the communities,” says Marc Lingenhoff, Managing Director of BVB Americas, in an exclusive interview with Bolavip. Borussia Dortmund's emblematic Black and Yellow colors taking center stage at Times Square for the fourth consecutive year speaks volumes of the club's impact within the U.S., where it now has a New York City office. “We saw a lot of demand from fans, from partners to be more present here, and service our fans and our partners. Now you can register as an official fan club. We have over 47 now in the United States. We have over 6,000 boys and girls in our academy system, with roughly 122 academies,” Lingenhoff explains. That rise in popularity could be explained by American star Christian Pulisic, who gave soccer fans in the U.S. a reason to keep an eye on Dortmund from 2016 to 2019. But even after “Captain America” left, the Black and Yellow managed to maintain a loyal fanbase. According to Lingenhoff, having that exposure has been a strong factor: “That, I think, contributed to our awareness of the club and having such a big fan base here, is that we are consistently seen on European biggest stage.” Even though Pulisic and Reyna may have given Dortmund an edge over other Bundesliga or European clubs without American players, the interest in the Bundesliga giants has transcended nationality. The likes of Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham, just to name a few of the most recent stars to don the Black and Yellow kit, have made Dortmund a relevant team to watch for soccer fans around the world. “I would love to have more American players on the team, and to be able to, you know, use that and draw attention, but it really is an international team, an international fan base that we have,” Lingenhoff adds. All about the Champions League trophy: Dimensions, materials, history and more But the interest in Borussia Dortmund isn't just related to active players. Fans in the U.S. still admire legendary goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who established himself as a team icon during his 16-year stint at the club. “Dortmund is also known for players just like Roman, who are very loyal to the club. Weidenfeller will be a high-profile presence at the Times Square Cup, where he once again will receive the affection from a Dortmund fan base that only seems to grow in the U.S. A few months back, the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 also allowed Borussia Dortmund to continue making a name for themselves in American territory. “To sum it up, we look back at the Club World Cup, as being a very successful event for us,” Lingenhoff tells Bolavip. We played well against Real Madrid in the last game, with drama at the end, but drama is part of who we are as a club. “But overall, we were very happy with how we were able to engage with current fans, but also attract new fans in those cities where we were present: Atlanta, New York, Cincinnati. So we were very happy with how things worked for us during the Club World Cup.” Borussia Dortmund are certainly building on that momentum, once again taking over Times Square with an event that bridges the gap with fans overseas by giving back to a community that seems seriously connected with the club.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Final call rests on qualifying and may be shaped by draw John Stones reveals he considered retiring when injured Thomas Tuchel's side are closing in on qualification for the finals tournament next summer and plans are being put in place for warmup games. Talks over potential opponents for the March international break have taken place, although it is understood the Football Association is yet to make a final decision. However, it is understood there is a big possibility of Wembley friendlies against Uruguay and Japan, both of whom have qualified for the World Cup. England have mostly faced European opposition since Tuchel took charge at the start of this year and there is a need to test themselves against different styles before the World Cup. They have not faced a side from the Asian Football Confederation since beating Iran at the 2022 World Cup. England play Latvia in a qualifier in Riga on Tuesday after a friendly against Wales at Wembley on Thursday. An England victory in Latvia would secure a World Cup place with two games to spare, if Serbia fail to win at home against Albania on Saturday. England's John Stones has said he considered retiring while struggling with foot and hamstring injuries last season that restricted him to 24 appearances – none after mid-February. “Last season was tough for me, to the point where I thought about stopping,” the Manchester City defender told BBC Radio 5 Live. I had had enough of being so professional and trying to do everything right in my power, to then keep breaking down and not having the answers. It was a very difficult place to be in … my emotions were high.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So far, 19 teams have officially booked their place at the 2026 World Cup: Host nations: Mexico, United States, Canada AFC (Asia): Japan, Uzbekistan, South Korea, Jordan, Iran, Australia CONMEBOL (South America): Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Uruguay, Colombia, Paraguay CAF (Africa): Morocco, Tunisia OFC (Oceania): New Zealand Several African nations are just one result away from clinching their World Cup berth during this window: Algeria will qualify if they win away to Somalia, or if they draw and both Uganda and Mozambique fail to win. Ivory Coast will book their ticket if they beat Seychelles and Gabon lose to Gambia. Egypt qualify if they defeat Djibouti and Burkina Faso fail to win in Sierra Leone. Ghana secure their spot if they beat the Central African Republic and Madagascar don't defeat Comoros. Senegal will qualify with a win over South Sudan if DR Congo fail to beat Togo. In Europe, the qualifying picture is tightening, with several big names and dark horses nearing confirmation: The path is narrower in North and Central America, but a couple of teams could seal early qualification: Honduras will qualify if they defeat Costa Rica and Haiti, provided those two sides draw in their head-to-head meeting. Group A: Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Oman battle for two direct tickets. Group B: Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Indonesia are locked in a similar race. The third-place finishers in each group will advance to an intercontinental playoff, keeping their World Cup hopes alive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Next year is World Cup year, and excitement is building as the draw for the group stage draws nearer. Initially, the idea was to have 16 groups of three, but FIFA changed tack and returned to the four-team group format. Argentina are the reigning world champions after their dramatic penalty win over France in Doha, Qatar back in 2022, as Lionel Messi lifted the sport's top team honour for the very first time. The draw will take place in Washington, DC, on Friday, December 5 2025. It will kick off at 5pm BST from the Kennedy Center. The US, Canada, and Mexico automatically qualify as hosts. From Asia, Japan, South Korea, Iran, and Australia have all booked their places, while Jordan and Uzbekistan will make their World Cup debuts. The European qualifying campaigns started much later than the other confederations, and as such, they are some way behind. However, England will qualify for next year's tournament with victory over Latvia should Serbia drop points against either Albania or Andorra. Norway hold a near-unassaiable six-point lead over Italy, with their goal difference 16 healthier than their counterparts after a huge 11-1 win over Moldova. Erling Haaland, Martin Odegaard and co. are also five wins from five, and are waiting on the Azzurri to play their game in hand before their qualification is confirmed. Wales are in with a chance of either automatic or play-off qualification in Group J, lying in third place behind North Macedonia on 11 points, and tied with Belgium on 10. The home nation's goal difference is what is letting them down, however, although that group will go down to the final matchday. The Netherlands, Austria, and Croatia are all also closing in on automatic qualification.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The next FIFA World Cup doesn't start until 2026, but you can already buy the official soccer ball on Fanatics. The red (Canada), green (Mexico) and blue (United States) colors represent the three host countries. The design helps for a flashy look, but the ball's best features go far beyond what you can see. The ball passed FIFA tests for many important criteria. Its texture is designed to retain less water in wet or rainy conditions, while also having strong shape retention over time and usage. If the certified FIFA World Cup ball is too pricey, there's plenty of alternatives in the Fanatics shop. The Adidas 2026 FIFA World Cup Competition Soccer Ball looks identical, but sells for $64.99. There's also the World Cup mini and mini+ soccer balls, which are perfect for little ones or for using around the house. They're sizes 1 and 2, compared to the regulation size 5 ball that is normally used in professional soccer. There's also a black Trionda ball T-shirt, which is available for $34.99. The shirt is available in sizes from S to 3XL, and is one of the many World Cup shirts that Fanatics has in-stock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Response to strained schedule has been more football than ever, and a danger that the best will have nothing left to give at the World Cup Cole Palmer and Ousmane Dembélé looked great when they were photographed sitting on Top of the Rock on the eve of the Club World Cup final but it is not being wise after the event to suggest that both might have been better off spending their summer lying on sunbeds. Top players struggling with fitness issues was foreseeable before the first edition of Fifa's expanded tournament took place. “The worst idea ever,” was Jürgen Klopp's take, citing concerns over the long-term impact of squeezing even more football into an ever expanding calendar. That means no recovery for the players involved.” Fifpro, the global players' union, has repeatedly warned about rising injuries and player burnout. The response, though, has been more football than ever. The authorities do not take players and managers seriously. The suspicion is that Palmer has played too much. He has been troubled by a groin injury for a year and although there is yet to be any indication that the forward requires surgery it is hard not to feel that he is, as Arsène Wenger used to say of Jack Wilshere, in the red zone. He is an outrageous talent but everyone has physical limits. It is absurd that Palmer has gone three consecutive summers without a proper rest. Palmer played 57 games for club and country in the 2023-24 season, his first full year as an established international and Premier League player. He had also represented England in their World Cup qualifier against Andorra at the start of June. So don't be surprised that Palmer has missed a host of games this season. His is a longstanding problem but it surely could have been dealt with if he had been allowed a holiday last summer. There was no special treatment for Chelsea, who had a compressed, two-week pre-season. The PSG game was on 13 July and Palmer started when a weary, undercooked Chelsea opened the campaign by drawing 0-0 with Crystal Palace on 17 August. Enzo Maresca was at a loss to predict how the extra workload and lack of preparation time would affect his players. By now, though, it is clear that Chelsea are struggling. Levi Colwill tore an anterior cruciate ligament on the first day of pre-season. Moisés Caicedo, Enzo Fernández and João Pedro are playing through the pain barrier. Fifpro's annual player workload monitoring report concluded that players who competed in the Club World Cup after completing a domestic league campaign were among hundreds at the top of the men's game who did not have adequate pre-seasons, hurting performance levels and increasing the risk of injury. Last week Maresca said in relation to the volume of injuries at Chelsea and PSG: “Probably it's some consequences from the Club World Cup.” Arsenal's Noni Madueke, who left Chelsea after the Club World Cup semi-final, is out for two months with a knee injury. PSG were without Marquinhos, Kvara Kvaratskhelia, Désiré Doué and Dembélé when they beat Barcelona last week. João Neves and Fabián Ruiz have also had injury issues. Alexander-Arnold came off a draining title-winning season with Liverpool, signed for Madrid, featured in their run to the last four of the Club World Cup and is out with a torn hamstring. Thomas Tuchel was saying in May that Bellingham should have had surgery on a shoulder injury. This is not an adequate defence for the Club World Cup. Injuries and fatigue have been on the rise. It still feels inadequate when authorities are shoving in more games, in essence jeopardising the product they wish to sell. And yes, Igor Jesus played for Botafogo at the Club World Cup and has since looked promising for Nottingham Forest. Yet Botafogo had not played a full season before entering the tournament and went out in the last 16. They were done at the end of June. Igor Jesus was not playing in as intense a league. Chelsea are even at a disadvantage to PSG, who are by far the richest club in France and are not placed under as much pressure in domestic games. There is a reason why Tuchel tipped Arsenal and Liverpool to have an advantage over Chelsea and Manchester City this season. City have not appeared to be suffering, perhaps because they went out of the Club World Cup in the last 16, but Chelsea look mentally and physically drained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current set of players are charged with leading their country into a home World Cup next summer, but previous generations, appearing on television and podcasts, have been unimpressed by the team's under-performance at Copa América, in the Nations League and subsequent exhibition matches, while also being frustrated by big names choosing not to play at this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Past heroes have not been shy in making their feelings known. The exchanges have included headline-making ripostes from Christian Pulisic and his entourage. More recently, Tim Weah accused the former pros of chasing checks and even going so far as saying their behavior has been “evil.”  The chorus of ex-pros includes figures such as Clint Dempsey and Alexi Lalas, as well as Landon Donovan and Tim Howard, the latter of whom co-host the “Unfiltered Soccer” podcast. Howard, formerly of Manchester United and Everton, is the most-capped goalkeeper in USMNT history, making 121 international appearances and he was selected for three World Cups between 2006 and 2014. As well as his podcast with Donovan, he is also an analyst on NBC's Premier League coverage. “I was always conscious of it,” he tells The Athletic. “I'm more conscious of it based on the reaction, that is normal. What I say oftentimes gets a reaction, but I don't say it for that. So I get it, players are sensitive. It doesn't change the way I think. Inside of U.S. Soccer, there was this idea that you have to believe in this team, that you have to be one of us — I've always been one of them — but the core principle is that the team needs to give us reasons to believe. It's not just this blind belief in a team. There is professional integrity (as an analyst). If the team's playing like crap and I know what's going on, I can't just not say it.” Howard says he saw improvement in the USMNT's last performance, a 2-0 win over Japan, but plenty is still to be resolved ahead of the World Cup. The countdown is now on, and Howard was talking to The Athletic after attending the opening of a soccer park in East Harlem in New York City, which had been jointly created by FIFA sponsors Visa and Bank of America, as well as Street Soccer USA, to provide community spaces for young people to play ahead of the World Cup. As for USMNT's anxieties ahead of that tournament, the obvious place to start is the goalkeeper. During Mauricio Pochettino's 15 games in charge, he has given a starting slot to four goalkeepers, all of whom are currently playing in MLS. Matt Freese, uncapped before the pre-Gold Cup friendlies this past summer, has started nine of those, including the past eight in succession. Whom would Howard choose as his starter at the World Cup? Based on what we are seeing, I think Matt Freese going to be in goal. I think Matt Turner will get an opportunity (at some point prior). But here is a separate question: If you ask me who do I think will be in goal and here's a bag full of money betting on it – not based on (my) own beliefs – I think it'll be Freese.” I love watching him develop and he is a great kid. I just find it very difficult, having played at that level and seen a lot, that your starting goalkeeper at the World Cup is going to have maybe 13 international games (by the World Cup) and of those 13 international games, he's going to have had five really hard ones. They're gonna get to the World Cup and if you're expected to get out of the group (and progress), you're going to get maybe five of the hardest games ever played. “I've always said I think Zack Steffen is the most talented one in the pool based on a bunch of different factors,” Howard counters. “But he wasn't able to be fit in the summer and then he hasn't really been selected recently. Matt Freese is harder to read because he's very steady. We haven't seen a lot of him at this level. Matt Turner has been in bigger moments. But again, I think that's probably doing Freese a disservice because we just hadn't seen enough of him at that level.” The U.S. having goalkeeping issues is a change from previous decades when the national team was spoiled for choice by options including Howard, Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller. Kids aren't getting enough touches on the ball, because the game has evolved and every goalkeeper needs to play like Ederson played at Man City. I even see it in the Premier League; there's goalkeepers who are brought into clubs because they are supposed to be really good at playing out of the back. A lot of these kids have grown up and they're just not getting the reps and the coaches aren't giving them the reps or teaching them. They're spending hours on footwork as opposed to actually saving the ball. Tyler Adams captained his country during the World Cup in Qatar, but veteran defender Tim Ream has taken the armband for much of Pochettino's tenure, including during the Gold Cup. Tim Ream is the most experienced, he (acts) like a captain in every sense of the word. The team is inspired by its heartbeat. And its heartbeat is Tyler Adams, point-blank.” Howard says that Ream, who was frozen out of the setup until breaking back in ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, is key to the squad's culture. “Tim Ream is a perfect example of U.S. Soccer's shortcomings since we failed to qualify for the (2018) World Cup. U.S. Soccer did a media campaign to say go and forget about that and focus on the next generation, because that (failure to qualify) was a black stain on U.S. Soccer. They didn't retain Jozy Altidore or Michael Bradley. They didn't bring older players in to say, ‘Look, you're not gonna be a part of this full cycle, but get us through the next 12-24 months. I learned from Kasey Keller, Brian McBride and Claudio Reyna. When Claudio Reyna was our captain, he did some amazing things and he did some things where he said, ‘I hold my hands up, my bad.' And I was like, ‘Oh, OK. That's how a player is supposed to act.' They were tough and it was a hard-fought loss against Mexico in the final. Tim was a big part of that group.” Ahead of the next round of exhibition games this month against Ecuador and Australia, Howard was uplifted by USMNT's win in their last game against Japan. “In the second game, we got some really good performances and that's all that really matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tournament, taking place from September 27th to October 19th, is a major showcase for young talent, and Barça are making sure they leave no stone unturned. Among the young talents drawing attention is Pedrinho, a Brazilian left winger currently playing for Corinthians, who is known for his exquisite technique. From La Liga, Vladyslav Krapyvstov, the Girona goalkeeper, will be in the spotlight for his potential to develop into a top-level shot-stopper. Barcelona will be keeping an eye on Gilberto Mora. Other players on Barcelona's radar could be Pablo Garcia, an 18-year-old attacking talent from Real Betis who has already made his first-division debut, and Iker Bravo, a strong and powerful striker from Udinese. Mexico's Gilberto Mora, an attacking midfielder, is also attracting interest from Barcelona. Recent reports suggest that Barça are keenly tracking Mora's development, joining other major European clubs already interested in him. At just 16, Mora has been on the radar of Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Ajax, while clubs like Arsenal, Manchester City, and even Lionel Messi's Inter Miami from MLS are also watching his progress. Barcelona's focus on these young talents shows a clear commitment to identifying and nurturing the stars of tomorrow. Meanwhile, the U-20 World Cup is expected to be a stage where young prospects make their mark, and Barcelona's presence ensures they will have firsthand insights into who might be ready for the next step in their careers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is employing an alternative review system that allows coaches to appeal two referee's decisions per match at the Under-20 soccer World Cup in Chile The football video support (FVS) is a “simplified version” of VAR and has transformed the youth tournament into a testing ground for new technologies. FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. Since then, the review system has had a role in several matches. It proved decisive in Norway's 1-0 victory over Nigeria after a review of a handball by Nigeria defender Ahmed Akinyele, which American referee Joe Dickerson had ignored. FVS also disallowed a goal in Argentina's 4-1 win against Australia — the review denying a tying goal for the Socceroos. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso González being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim. Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance. According to world soccer's ruling body FIFA, the FVS system aims to “democratize football by introducing video review technology as a complementary option,” not only for top-level competitions but also for those that “could not afford VAR infrastructure,” thanks to its low cost and simplified operation. Coaches can only appeal in four specific situations: whether or not there was a goal; whether or not there was a penalty, over a direct red card, or in case of suspicion that a card was not shown to the correct offender. The system had already been tested by FIFA in other competitions, such as the 2024 Youth Championship/Blue Stars in Switzerland and the 2025 Under-20 Women's World Cup in Colombia, and it is expected to be expanded to other youth categories. Some fans, however, have criticized the long waiting periods until a decision is made. “In a game like this, we had 10 extra minutes because they stopped the whole time to review things that clearly hadn't happened,” Brazilian fan Tiago Dias said after his country lost 2-1 against Morocco. Some coaches, such as Morocco's Mohamed Ouahbi, said they would make extensive use of the tool, regardless of whether there was a violation or not.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its opening in 2017, the stadium has hosted a string of massive events, from Super Bowls to international soccer matches. After hosting six matches at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the home of the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United, Atlanta Drive GC, and PGA TOUR Superstore will stage eight World Cup games in 2026. World Soccer Talk spoke with AMB Sports and Entertainment Chief Operating Officer Dietmar Exler, the former Mercedes-Benz USA CEO. Even beyond the Club World Cup, operations never slow down. Mercedes-Benz Stadium currently hosts 55 to 60 public events each year, ranging from international soccer to NFL preseason games and concerts in between. And according to Exler, every single event is treated with the same importance. Whoever is the promoter, even if it's a relatively small event in the international scale, for that promoter is a huge event. We always as a stadium have to give that promoter and everybody our full, undivided attention. Some events are bigger than others, there's no doubt about that. Mercedes-Benz Stadium's preparation for 2026 has been shaped by its role in hosting major international soccer events, including the Club World Cup and Copa América. “We had a few different things, but for us, this was the ideal setup. The Club World Cup 6 matches and in the FIFA 2026 World Cup will be 8 matches, that allows us to work with CONMEBOL, with CONCACAF, with FIFA, and to really get to know each other.” Exler stressed that collaborating with confederations ahead of time has been crucial for ironing out logistics and creating a better experience for both fans and players. But for the opening they were all here, so it was a process to get to know each other. “From Copa to CWC we did change some things: Media checking, we addressed it; operational behind-the-curtain topics, and then on the CWC, we just finished a meeting with FIFA last week, longer discussions about what worked, what didn't work, what should be adjusted for 2026. Artificial turf has long been a complaint among soccer players, particularly in NFL stadiums. “We can grow grass here even if the roof is open.” The 2024 Copa América final was marred by chaos at Hard Rock Stadium, where fans broke through barriers, delaying the match by 82 minutes and creating dangerous overcrowding. Determined to avoid a repeat, Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Atlanta authorities have been preparing thoroughly. Exler highlighted the contrast between American football and international soccer, and the steps his team has taken: “In American football you can go to every game with your wife and children and pretty much sit in every part of the stadium, we don't have to separate fans, they might say things to each other, but there's really no violence. Mercedes-Benz Stadium also enforces a strict anti-fireworks protocol, confiscating items at entry or ejecting fans who sneak them in. The policy has been effective, and organizers have been working with FIFA and fan groups to coordinate safe arrival routes to the venue alongside law enforcement, another method to be implemented in 2026. With PSG planning to leave Parc des Princes for a new stadium, Atlanta's venue has served as a model. “I ended talking a lot with the business director of Paris Saint-Germain, they played here twice, and they wanted a private tour of the stadium. After the first time here, they called me and said, ‘We're building a new stadium for PSG, we're taking a look at other stadiums, I would like to walk through the whole stadium, show we what you think it works really well, but also what you'd not do again.' They also asked me for a visit to the Atlanta Falcons locker room, so I gave them a tour: Family areas, medical areas, what kind of equipment is used. It works really well, the grass was great, and that they could see a difference from a great stadium in Europe. World Soccer Talk, like Futbol Sites, is a company owned by Better Collective.
