                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protected areas of defined geographic zones can slow biodiversity loss and bolster conversation efforts, but they may have unintended impacts on the diets of children who live nearby, according to new research from scientists at Penn State. The same association did not persist in non-Indigenous areas. Understanding how proximity to protected areas relates to vitamin A-rich foods can help conservation and public health planners align strategies as nations expand protection goals, said Lilly Zeitler, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Geography at Penn State who led the study. In some places, local communities rely directly on nearby lands and ecosystems for food. They manage these food systems under customary tenure - local rules enforced by tradition and social norms rather than formal laws. Creating protected areas can disrupt that customary tenure, with negative effects on how people get food. Alternatively, tourism can boost local incomes near protected areas in ways that alter households' food purchasing patterns. Lilly Zeitler, doctoral candidate, Department of Geography, Penn State A large share of protected land overlaps with Indigenous territories in Cambodia and Myanmar, the researchers said, explaining that this allowed them to compare patterns across two countries with contrasting approaches to Indigenous rights. "A cross-country comparison is interesting to see whether there are different relationships between protected areas, diets and Indigeneity in these two very different contexts," Zeitler said. The analysis showed a non-linear pattern: the highest predicted dietary diversity occurred around 80 kilometers from protected areas, where landscapes commonly mix forests and agriculture. "For our analytic sample, mid-distances from protected areas had about a third of forest cover," Zeitler said. "One-third forest cover indicates a mix of different land uses at an 80-kilometer distance, including forest cover and agriculture, in what other researchers call an 'agroecological matrix.' These mixed landscapes appear to be associated with higher dietary diversity among young children." In Indigenous population areas, children were most likely to eat vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables at about 80 kilometers from protected areas, with different distance patterns for pulses. "We think this is because common vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables in the region, such as mango, passionfruit, sweet potato and squash, are often grown in mixed landscapes," Zeitler said. "Mixed landscapes with swiddens and home gardens might be more important sources of vitamin-A rich fruits and vegetables for Indigenous populations in the region." According to Zeitler, the findings offer insight for conservation planning as countries pursue the United Nations' Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's 30-by-30 target, a goal to conserve at least 30% of land, inland waters and oceans by 2030 with emphasis on effective management and Indigenous rights. The results point to the potential benefits of conservation approaches that recognize mixed land uses in some contexts rather than strict separation of farms and forests. "Our results can inform conservation efforts seeking to minimize negative relationships between protected areas and local populations' health and diet quality," Zeitler said. "The results indicate that an 'agroecological matrix' approach to conservation, rather than the binary 'land sparing' model that separates people and agriculture from forests, could support local diet quality in some contexts." Zeitler emphasized that more research is needed to fully elucidate the identified patterns of children's diet quality near protected areas. "Because this study is based on secondary pre-existing anonymized datasets, we could not interview people in Indigenous and non-Indigenous population areas on why their consumption of some food groups differed at different distances from protected areas, for instance," Zeitler said, explaining that they could not draw causal inferences from the study, either, because the data are snapshots in time rather than tracking changes over time. The team was also unable to link country-level differences between Cambodia and Myanmar to specific policies without longitudinal data and additional analyses. Zeitler said she hopes the findings inform conservation and health discussions as protected areas expand. "The perceived need to separate forest and agriculture for conservation can be challenged by recognizing the importance of mixed land use systems for local diets, especially among Indigenous populations in some parts of the world."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on August 27, 2025, titled, "Deregulated miR-145 and miR-27b in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome: implications for adipogenesis." In this study, led by first author Felix Quirin Fenzl and corresponding author Karima Djabali from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), researchers identified that miR-145-5p and miR-27b-3p interfere with the formation of fat cells in children with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare and fatal premature aging disorder. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a genetic condition that causes rapid aging in children, often leading to early death due to heart disease. Although affected children appear healthy at birth, they soon develop signs of accelerated aging, including hair loss, stiff joints, and a significant reduction in fat tissue. While certain treatments can slow disease progression, many aspects, such as the loss of fat tissue, remain poorly understood. This study focused on how microRNAs-tiny molecules that help regulate gene expression-contribute to the disease. To explore this, the researchers used skin-derived stem cells from both healthy individuals and HGPS patients. This difference was linked to unusually high levels of miR-145-5p and miR-27b-3p. These molecules were found to silence important genes required for fat cell growth and function. When the researchers blocked these microRNAs, fat cell formation improved. The team also examined fat tissue from a mouse model of HGPS. These results confirm that these two microRNAs play a central role in the loss of fat tissue seen in the disease. Importantly, reducing their activity could become a promising therapeutic strategy for restoring fat tissue in affected individuals. Although further research is needed before developing treatments, this study represents a step forward in understanding the molecular causes of lipodystrophy, a condition in which the body cannot form healthy fat tissue, in HGPS. In the long term, similar approaches might benefit people with other metabolic diseases, such as obesity or diabetes, where fat cell function is also disrupted.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s dismantling of federal vaccine policy continues to roil the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some Democratic-led states have struck out on their own, setting up new systems to help them assess the science and maintain immunization access for their residents. Minnesota made a similar change, and Massachusetts is requiring insurance carriers to pay for vaccines recommended by its health department, not only those recommended by the CDC. Traditionally, states have looked to the CDC for expertise and guidance on public health issues — including, in addition to vaccines, workplace safety, water fluoridation, vaping, and sexually transmitted infections. Now, amid concerns that Kennedy is undermining trust in vaccines and public health science, some states are charting new paths, seeking out new sources of scientific consensus and changing how they regulate insurance companies, prescribers, and pharmacists. Colorado has been at the front of this wave. On Sept. 3, state officials issued a standing order to let pharmacists provide covid shots without individual prescriptions. “I will not allow ridiculous and costly red tape or decisions made far away in Washington to keep Coloradans from accessing vaccines,” said Democratic Gov. “You could see the writing on the wall that it was just becoming overly politicized rather than relying on actual science with this new HHS director,” said state Sen. Kyle Mullica. “We decided to protect Colorado,” Mullica said, so it “wouldn't be as vulnerable to political upheaval that we're seeing right now.” Polis signed it into law in April, despite having praised Kennedy's selection last fall. “Colorado I think is really leading the way on this,” said David Higgins, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado who was part of a stakeholder group that helped craft the bill. Higgins pointed to a companion bill, signed in May, that he said makes Colorado's push even stronger. It deals with insurance coverage for preventive health care services, aiming to ensure state-regulated insurance plans cover the cost of some vaccines, regardless of future moves by the CDC. The Colorado chapter of Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine advocacy group that Kennedy led before taking over HHS, did not respond to a request for comment. Another co-sponsor of the first bill, Democratic state Rep. Lindsay Gilchrist, said the circulation of so much false information about vaccines, including for covid, makes it important to hear from a range of trusted medical experts. Like other states, it had tracked the recommendations of a CDC panel known as Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Kennedy fired all 17 members in June and replaced them with 12 new appointees, some of whom critics warn are vaccine skeptics and aren't qualified to provide critical guidance for Americans. He expects that the national professional physician groups that Colorado is now empowered to consult will likely be aligned in their overall guidance and will “look at the last evidence-based recommendations that were provided by the ACIP” before Kennedy replaced its members. In May, Kennedy announced the federal government had removed covid vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children. But Colorado is still recommending a covid vaccine during pregnancy, Calonge said. “So, we're telling providers that our recommendation is to continue to follow the recommendation as it was in place in January of 2025.” In a statement on its website, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommended pregnant individuals get vaccinated against covid. “ACOG continues to recommend that all pregnant and lactating individuals receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or ‘booster,'” it said. Likewise, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in August that all children from 6 to 23 months old get vaccinated against covid, as well as older children in certain risk groups. For now, Colorado is following the same immunization recommendations it used last year. The most recent ACIP meeting, on Sept. 18 and 19, was chaotic, with members admitting they did not understand what they were voting on and even opting to redo a vote on pediatric MMRV vaccine access. Doctors and vaccine scientists have expressed alarm at the splintering national consensus on vaccines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A good night's sleep has long been understood to help us consolidate new memories, but we don't understand how. Associations with negative feelings like fear or stress can improve recall, but intentionally trying to remember can also be effective. They found that instructions improved recall more than emotion. "What we intend to remember and to forget can be powerful," said Dr Laura Kurdziel of Merrimack College, lead author of the article in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience. Researchers performed two matching studies - one where 45 participants completed the task online, and one where 53 participants visited the lab. Half of each group received their words to remember in the morning and then tested their memories that evening. For the evening group of lab-based participants, the team supplied electroencephalogram (EEG) headbands that measured their brain activity while they slept. All participants took part in two sessions. At the first session, participants watched 100 words appear on a screen, each followed by a cue to remember or forget. Immediately afterwards, participants were shown another set of 100 words and asked if they recognized them. They found that when it comes to memory, instructions do indeed work better than emotion. However, emotions did play a part: words participants had been asked to remember that had negative connotations were more likely to be remembered. This suggests that although instructions were the primary influence on recall, emotional cues could amplify the effect of instructions. Emotions also increased the chances of false memories: negative foils were more likely to be misremembered as words participants had been asked to remember. "During encoding, we will devote more attentional resources to words that we are told explicitly to remember," said Kurdziel. Along similar lines, cognitive control systems can 'tag' information as relevant, biasing the hippocampus to prioritize it. Lastly, instructions don't just enhance relevant items, they also suppress irrelevant ones. By inhibiting competing memories, remember-cued items face less interference, which improves recall." "Sleep spindles were associated with better recall of negative, remember-cued words," said Kurdziel, referring to a kind of brain wave that looks like a burst of spikes on the brain wave recordings. "Sleep spindles are widely implicated in the transfer of information from temporary hippocampal storage to more stable representations in the neocortex." "By contrast, slow wave sleep was negatively correlated with total recall," Kurdziel continued. "This was somewhat unexpected - slow wave sleep is often associated with improvements in declarative memory. However, it has also been theorized to facilitate active forgetting of irrelevant or redundant information." This could indicate that sleeping only consolidates some memories - prioritizing things you're motivated to remember over things which are emotional - and that sleeping in general is less significant than your brain's activity during sleep. However, more research is needed to confirm this. "The number of participants who provided usable EEG data was relatively small, which reduces confidence in the strength of sleep–memory associations," explained Kurdziel. "Additionally, the sample consisted primarily of college students, making it difficult to generalize the findings to broader populations." Kurdziel, L. B. F., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since launching with three digitized versions of NCCN's benchmark evidence-based clinical practice guidelines earlier this year, NCCN has quickly expanded availability to more than a dozen topics. The interactive format makes recommendations easier to navigate and search and links directly to other NCCN digital resources. "The NCCN Guidelines Navigator enables health care providers to quickly find and understand the best available evidence-based options for treating each individual person," said Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, Chief Executive Officer, NCCN. We are pleased to be able to honor Breast Cancer Awareness Month by making some of our most widely used guidelines available in multiple formats, ultimately leading to better outcomes for people facing cancer and their loved ones." Crystal S. Denlinger, MD, Chief Executive Officer, National Comprehensive Cancer Network NCCN Guidelines® cover everything from cancer prevention, to screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and supportive care. The new format incorporates seamless movement, advanced search and filter capabilities, color-coded navigation links, and other digital enhancements. "The NCCN Guidelines were accessed more than 16 million times in the last calendar year overall-with the breast cancer treatment guidelines accounting for about 10 percent of that total," said William J. Gradishar, MD, Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University, Chair of the NCCN Guidelines Panel for Breast Cancer. "Breast cancer prevention, screening, and management is based on complex and rapidly evolving information, impacting millions of people worldwide. We've seen survival rates improve dramatically thanks to scientific advances that help health care providers match the right approach to the right person. The new NCCN Guidelines Navigator format allows us to integrate different resources for improving care into one hub for clinical guidance, patient/caregiver empowerment, and professional development." The NCCN Templates® standardize patient care, reduce medication errors, and help providers to anticipate and manage treatment-related adverse events. Additionally, people who access the NCCN Guidelines in any format, including via the NCCN Guidelines Navigator™, can earn CE/MOC credits in real time with an NCCN Guidelines in Practice™ subscription. According to a survey response: "The NCCN Guidelines Navigator does a great job of making the existing NCCN Guideline searchable and accessible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For each disease and condition included in the Elimination Initiative, the Best Buys are presented as one-page documents with clear, accessible information. Each Best Buy summarizes expected impact goals, disease elimination targets, key operational indicators, and priority interventions that have proven to be cost-effective in different contexts. To achieve this, efforts must focus on keeping test positivity rates below 5%, ensuring that more than 70% of cases are diagnosed and treated within the first 72 hours of symptom onset, and guaranteeing that over 80% of cases are investigated and classified in areas working towards malaria elimination or at risk of reestablishment. The Best Buys include expanding access to rapid diagnostic tests and timely treatment at all levels of care, engaging communities in early detection, consolidating malaria-free territories through microplanning, distributing insecticide-treated nets at no cost, and strengthening surveillance to respond to imported cases. These actions aim to accelerate elimination and ensure that achievements are sustainable over time. During the presentation at PAHO headquarters in Washington D.C., Suriname was recognized for having eliminated the transmission of malaria—a significant achievement and the first Amazonian country to reach this milestone. Delegates from Guyana, Paraguay, and Suriname shared concrete experiences in implementing the Best Buys—from integrated care for vulnerable populations to intersectoral partnerships—that are making a difference. The Best Buys documents are part of PAHO's Disease Elimination Initiative and are designed to support decision-makers, program managers, technical teams, health workers, cooperation agencies, partners, and donors. Their purpose is also to strengthen strategic planning, the design and implementation of interventions, coordination, and efficient allocation of resources. PAHO's Disease Elimination Initiative aims to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Region of the Americas by 2030.
