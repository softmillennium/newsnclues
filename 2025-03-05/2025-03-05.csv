 Karachi/Islamabad, Five people were killed and five others injured in an improvised explosive device blast in the Khuzdar district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Wednesday. 

 Naal police Station House Officer Bahawal Khan Pindrani said that the explosion took place after an IED attached to a motorcycle was detonated by a remote device. 

 “The blast took place at Naal Market and the injured have been moved to the hospital,” he said. 

 District Health Officer Rafiq Sasoli said the condition of two of the injured was serious and they had got five bodies in the morgue. 

 Khan said the bomb disposal squad was present at the spot and inspecting the site. 

 Khuzdar Senior Superintendent of Police Javed Zehri told a television channel that the blast occurred near a college in the market’s vicinity and burnt vehicles too. 

 He said security forces’ timely action prevented another terror attack in Balochistan’s Pishin area. 

 “Acting on intelligence, four terrorists were arrested in Pishin as they were planning a terror attack on Wednesday,” he added. 

 Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the blast in a statement, adding that orders were issued to provide the injured with the best medical care available. 

 “Terrorism will be eradicated in all its forms,” Bugti was quoted as saying. “Elements hostile to peace will fail in their nefarious objectives and those involved in this incident will be brought to justice.” 

 Balochistan has been braving violence for more than two decades. On January 26, two people were killed and seven others injured in a car bomb explosion close to a passenger bus travelling from Khuzdar to Rawalpindi. 

 The Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, has said that the country has already witnessed 79 terrorist attacks last month, resulting in the deaths of 55 civilians and 47 security personnel, while 45 civilians and 81 security personnel were injured. 

 It said during counter-terrorism operations, 156 terrorists have been killed, 20 injured and another 60 arrested.

Coldplay performed at the 2016 Super Bowl half-time show with Beyonce and Bruno Mars

The 2026 World Cup final will stage a Super Bowl-style half-time show for the first time, with Coldplay helping to pick a ""list of artists"" to perform. 

The tournament, which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, concludes with the final on 19 July 2026 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 

Though pre-match performances at showpiece occasions such as the Champions League final have become commonplace, there has never been a half-time show at a World Cup final. 

Half-times in the regular NFL season last around 15 minutes but they are extended up to 30 minutes at the Super Bowl in order to accommodate a half-time show. 

Fifa president Gianni Infantino says Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and band manager Phil Harvey will help to establish a set of artists to perform in the 15-minute break at next year's final. 

""I can confirm the first ever half-time show at a Fifa World Cup final in New York New Jersey,"" Infantino wrote on Instagram.

""This will be a historic moment for the Fifa World Cup and a show befitting the biggest sporting event in the world.""

The 2026 World Cup final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey 

Rap artist Kendrick Lamar headlined this year's Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, which drew record audience figures of 133.5m across the United States. 

The performance surpassed the long-standing record set by Michael Jackson in 1993. 

The likes of Rihanna, Beyonce and Lady Gaga have also performed in recent years, while Coldplay headlined in 2016. 

Between 25 to 30 minutes are allocated for Super Bowl half-time shows so that the various stages and equipment can be built and dismantled.

The Trump administration's list of federal properties that could be offered for sale quickly shrank from 443 to 320 in the span of hours Tuesday, as the General Services Administration pulled some iconic buildings - including some agency headquarters - from the website.

Buildings housing the departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, Justice, Labor and Veterans Affairs were all taken off the list. The headquarters for the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Office of Personnel Management were also removed.

Also withdrawn was a group of buildings in northern Virginia that doesn't officially appear on the federal property rolls but has long been associated with the Central Intelligence Agency.

A GSA spokesman didn't immediately offer comments on why more than a quarter of the buildings were no longer being considered for sale. Bloomberg News first reported on the contents of the list Tuesday.

Most of the properties removed from the inventory of ""non-core"" real estate assets were located in the Washington, DC area, which is struggling with office vacancies.

The effort to sell off federal real estate is part of President Donald Trump's attempt to dramatically reduce the number of federal employees - and the need for office space. But the plan has been met with pushback from Democrats, who said that the sale of federal buildings could hurt small businesses, as well as veterans, Social Security recipients and others who rely on in-person service from federal agencies.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Trump and his billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, were trying to ""dismantle our government, piece by piece, and sell it for parts.""

The 123 properties removed from the list also included a Suitland, Maryland facility that controls weather satellites for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - the kind of specialized facility that the administration said it would seek to avoid selling given how critical it is to operations.

In Silver Spring, Maryland, the Trump administration is no longer listing the 3.1 million-square-foot (288,000-square-meter) campus of the Food and Drug Administration, including 10 office and four laboratory buildings.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The US has stopped sharing all intelligence with Kyiv, a Ukrainian source has told Sky News.

Previously the source, with knowledge of the situation, said the halt in the flow of intelligence had been ""selective"", only affecting information that could be used for attacks inside Russia.

""A few hours ago, the exchange of all information was stopped,"" the source said.

Earlier, the Ukrainian source indicated the ""selective"" pause meant US intelligence would still be shared with Ukraine that could be used to attack Russian forces on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory.

The move is another blow for Kyiv after US President Donald Trump decided to pause all military aid to Ukraine following a bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the White House.

US national security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington had ""taken a step back"" in its relationship with Ukraine and CIA director John Ratcliffe called the suspension a ""pause"" and said American intelligence and military aid could begin flowing again once Mr Trump knows Mr Zelenskyy is serious about peace.

""I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause I think will go away,"" Mr Ratcliffe told Fox Business Network.

""I think we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have to push back on the aggression that's there, but to put the world in a better place for these peace negotiations to move forward.""

The US has provided Ukraine with significant intelligence since Russia invaded in 2022, including critical information its military needs for targeting Russian forces.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,5 key takeaways from Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress,https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/03/04/trump-speech-congress-joint-address/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 08:03:45 GMT","

Trump defended tariffs and deportations, announced a possible deal with Volodymyr Zelensky, praised Elon Musk, blamed Joe Biden for the economy, made major policy announcements and mocked Democrats in attendance.

President Donald Trump leaned into his base during a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, portraying the administration’s actions — from renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America to removing the “poison of critical race theory from public schools” — as part of a “common sense revolution” that is “sweeping the world.”

The nearly 90-minute speech was a marked departure from attempts at unity in previous joint addresses to Congress, but it was not unexpected, according to Northeastern University political science experts.

Pablo Calderon-Martinez, associate professor of international relations, likened the speech more to a Trump political rally than an aspirational speech about coming together. 

“He’s trying to reinforce his message and really reinforce his vision of America to what he sees as his main constituents and the people that voted for him and the Republican Party in particular,” Calderon-Martinez said.

Nick Beauchamp, associate professor of political science, said the speech was more akin to Trump’s 2017 “American carnage” inaugural address than in the style of a State of the Union. 

“Overall, I’d say this was about what you would expect if you based your expectations on campaign speeches and not previous joint addresses,” Beauchamp said.

Democrats — who protested both silently and, in one case, so vociferously that the congressman responsible was removed from the chamber — were taunted by the president, who warned them that not supporting his tax cut proposal would mean they would “never get elected again.”

The president even promoted some proposals that have not been universally popular — for example, tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, or the work of Elon Musk  — who was seated in the House gallery — and the Department of Governmental Efficiency.

Here are five takeaways from the speech:

The biggest news of Trump’s speech came toward the end when he said he had received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky indicating that the Ukrainian president is ready to sign a minerals deal — just days after an Oval Office confrontation and Trump’s freeze of aid to the country. 

“The letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,” Trump said.

“I appreciate that he sent this letter, I just got it a little while ago,” he added.

Aside from U.S. Rep. Al Green of Texas who was removed from the chamber, Democrats protested Trump mostly through signs, messages on T-shirts, and whiteboards and walkouts. 

The varied strategy suggests the party remains at a loss on how to react to Trump, Calderon-Martinez said.

“They haven’t changed at all,” he said. 

Beauchamp concurred. 

“Democrats tried to be disruptive, but were largely unsuccessful,” he said. “Al Green did manage to do something new in being escorted out by the sergeant at arms, but the rest of it — the shouting, the signs, the gradual departures — had little effect.”

Trump described the Middle East as a “rough neighborhood,” but he did not elaborate on his idea to “take over” Gaza and redevelop it into the “Riviera of the Middle East” — an idea which has resulted in significant pushback from Middle Eastern allies as well as from aid organizations. 

It stood in contrast to his statements toward Greenland — about which he said, “we’re eventually going to get it” — and his repeated belief that the longstanding Panama Canal deal was unfair and that the canal should be under American control.

“For (the Middle East conflict), it’s clearly difficult for them to figure out what to tout,” Beauchamp said. 

From rising egg prices to hints of a slowing economy, Trump placed any blame squarely on his predecessor Joe Biden repeatedly, calling the prior administration a disaster and referring to the withdrawal from Afghanistan as the lowest moment in American history. 

Beauchamp noted that in mentioning his “weaker issues,” Trump “dodged and caveated.”

On inflation and prices, he cast blame then “quickly pivoted” and barely mentioned how he would bring inflation down despite it being a main campaign topic, Beauchamp said. 

And while Trump discussed tariffs at length, he also said “there may be a little bit of adjustment,” “there will be a little disturbance,” and “just bear with me.”

Similarly, Beauchamp said Trump basically admitted that he couldn’t do anything about mass deportations until Congress passes funding for it. There was almost no mention of the upcoming budget fight, shutdown and debt ceiling.

Trump referenced his assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania — pointing out the family of the man who was killed in the shooting as his guests — and said that he believes he was saved to “make America great again.”

French President Emmanuel Macron has told his country Russia threatens all of Europe, in a televised speech about Ukraine and security. Earlier, the US cut off intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which led to talk of new meetings. Listen to the latest episode of The World below.

Wednesday 5 March 2025 19:32, UK

Quite the statement from Emmanuel Macron now. 

The French president earlier mentioned France's nuclear deterrent (see our last post), but now returns to the subject. 

He cites the words of Germany's all-but-confirmed next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who said last month he wanted to discuss with France and the UK the possibility of extending their nuclear umbrella to cover his country. 

The UK and France are the only two nuclear powers in Europe. 

""We need reforms, we need to make choices, and we need to be brave,"" Macron says. 

""[Merz] has called for a strategic debate on providing that same protection to our European allies... whatever happens the decision will be in the hands of the president of the Republic and the heads of the army.""

Macron also says he will hold a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week. 

""We need to prepare,"" the French president Emmanuel Macron continues. 

He repeats his willingness to commit French troops as a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine if a ceasefire is reached.

He then addresses the American-sized elephant in the room. 

""I want to believe that the US will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case.""

He previews tomorrow's European Council meeting, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend, and says it is a great opportunity for the nations of the continent to commit to rapidly increasing their defence spending. 

""France has to recognise its special status - we have the most efficient, effective army in Europe,"" he says, also noting that Paris has nuclear weapons to call on if necessary. 

Despite this, he says, it doesn't go far enough - so Macron now unveils new investments, but doesn't outline how it will be spent, although he appears to be referring to the defence sector. 

""These are new investments which will allow us to mobilise private financing and public financing without increases in tax.""

""We are entering a new era,"" Emmanuel Macron tells his countrymen in a televised address. 

He quickly turns to Ukraine. 

""If a country can invade its neighbour in Europe and go unpunished, nobody can be sure of anything. 

""Beyond Ukraine, the Russian threat is real - it affects the European countries.""

He also says that Russia is looking to rearm itself and is ramping up its defence spending. 

""President Putin is violating our borders to assassinate opponents, manipulate elections.""

He also mentions how Russia has broken previous promises and guarantees.

It feels like the French president is gearing up to make some sort of announcement. 

The French president is set to address his nation in the next few minutes. 

Emmanuel Macron's pre-recorded speech, which you can watch below, is thought to be focused on the Ukraine crisis, European security and the threat of a transatlantic trade war amid the chaos wrought by Donald Trump in the US.

We've been following a White House press briefing which started just before 6.30pm UK time, and finished just now.

In our last few posts, we brought you the breaking news on Ukraine from the briefing. There was surprisingly little.

But Donald Trump's entire presidency is impacting the global economy and international affairs at the moment - so, if you're interested, we'll summarise some of the other key points from the news conference here.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt started by touting polling from YouGov for broadcaster CBS, which said 76% of Americans approved of Trump's speech to Congress last night.

She also attacked Democrats who opposed Trump's Congress speech - saying that one of the few moments when they applauded was for Ukraine - ""not America"".

Her answers also included:

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has just said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement yesterday is a ""positive step forward"". 

The Ukrainian leader said Ukraine is ""ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible"" in the search for a ""lasting"" peace with Russia - and also that the disastrous White House meeting was ""regrettable"". 

Leavitt notes the statement, and says it can only be a move in the right direction. 

On the pause blocking US aid for Ukraine, she says: ""They are reconsidering the funding for Ukraine... it's a pause for a review.""

Talks on the minerals deal are happening ""as we speak"", she adds, but isn't drawn on when it could be signed.  

We're finally getting a few questions on Ukraine at this White House briefing. 

One reporter asks Karoline Leavitt why Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision not to wear a suit in the Oval Office riled up White House officials - and potentially even Donald Trump himself - when ally Elon Musk didn't either. 

""Elon Musk wore a suit last night,"" she replies, dodging the fact the billionaire donned a T-shirt under a jacket and a cap during his visit to the Oval Office last month. 

Karoline Leavitt has taken to the podium for today's White House media briefing. 

She quickly recaps Donald Trump's marathon speech to Congress last night, but doesn't mention Ukraine.

As has become usual, she turns first to a reporter from a right-wing publication, this time the Daily Wire - which was set up by the outspoken Ben Shapiro about a decade ago.

The Wire's White House correspondent asks predictably friendly questions about how the Democrats reacted to Trump's speech last night and then on transgender people in sports - and we're forced to wait for any questions on what is arguably the biggest story of the day - Ukraine. 

Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Brussels tomorrow for a meeting of the European council, sources in Ukraine have told Sky News. 

It's a special summit - focusing on strengthening support for Kyiv and ""European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine"".

We're shortly going to be turning our attentions to the White House, where the daily media briefing is about to begin. 

It's being led by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

She'll be addressing the fallout from Donald Trump's major Congress speech last night. 

During the marathon address, the US president said Ukraine is ready to sign a minerals deal that Washington sees as key to reaching a peace agreement.

We'll bring you any key lines right here in this blog, but you can watch along in the livestream below...

Portugal PM Calls Confidence Vote He Cannot Win, Election Looms

By Sergio Goncalves and Andrei Khalip

LISBON (Reuters) -Portugal's prime minister said on Wednesday he would submit his year-old minority government to a confidence motion, a move that could lead to its dismissal as the two main opposition parties have vowed to reject it.

At the centre of the political crisis that could trigger a third snap election since 2022 is a consultancy firm owned by Prime Minister Luis Montenegro's family, which has made contracts with private companies that the opposition says have benefitted the premier.

Montenegro has denied any conflict of interest.

""The country needs political clarification and this is the moment. ... The country cannot remain a prisoner of selfishness and tactics on the part of the opposition,"" Montenegro told parliament, adding that while a new election was not what Portugal needed, his party was ready to go to the polls.

""Having an early election would be a necessary evil ... to end the atmosphere of permanent insinuations and intrigues,"" he told lawmakers debating a no-confidence motion presented by the Communist Party, which parliament was expected to throw out.

It was not immediately clear when parliament would vote on Montenegro's motion, which first needs cabinet approval.

If lawmakers reject it, the government would fall and assume a caretaker role, pending a decision by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on whether to dissolve parliament and call fresh elections, which some analysts consider likely. The president will make a statement later on Wednesday.

Montenegro's party has said he would lead it in any new election.

The main opposition Socialists and far-right party Chega, which together have more than half of all parliamentary seats, said they would reject a motion of confidence.

Such an outcome, according to the constitution, would require the government's dismissal, although since the restoration of democracy in 1974, only one out of 11 such motions has been rejected by Portugal's parliament, in 1977.

""The prime minister knows that the Socialists will reject the confidence motion. The responsibility for the political crisis is yours alone,"" said Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, asking Montenegro, ""Why don't you just resign?""

Portugal, Western Europe's poorest country, is growing faster than most EU members, at around 2% with budget surpluses, but is struggling to contain a housing crisis.

The centre-right coalition has 80 seats in the 230-seat parliament. The Socialists have 78 and Chega 50.

LEGAL WRANGLE

Montenegro founded data protection consultancy Spinumviva in 2021 when he had no political job.

The following year, he was elected leader of the centre-right Social Democratic Party and left the management and ownership of the company, whose annual revenue peaked at 415,000 euros ($431,558) in 2022, to his wife and sons.

The opposition said that since Montenegro is married and assets acquired after marriage, under Portuguese law, belong to the couple, the transfer of ownership to his wife is invalid.

Nuno Santos has accused Montenegro of receiving payments from companies while he was prime minister for several months.

Montenegro denied any wrongdoing or ethical shortcoming and said his income and all assets were included in the declarations of interests he submitted when he became prime minister.

His wife's ownership has since been transferred to their sons.

	The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning an aggressive reorganisation that includes cutting 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care for retired military members, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.


	The VA's chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top level officials at the agency that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would require terminating tens of thousands of employees after the VA expanded during the Biden administration, as well as to cover veterans impacted by burn pits under the 2022 PACT Act.

	The memo instructs top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganisation in August to resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.

President Donald Trump urged Greenland to choose to join the United States but vowed to take the Danish-ruled island ""one way or the other"" -- a bid Denmark swiftly rejected on Wednesday.

""That won't happen,"" Danish Defence Minister Trouls Lund Poulsen told public broadcaster DR.

""The direction that Greenland wants to take will be decided by Greenlanders,"" Lund Poulsen said.

In a partisan speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump offered only passing lines on world affairs, focusing on his domestic goals like rounding up undocumented immigrants and slashing government spending.

But he underlined his expansionist vision of the United States, as he repeated his aspirations to take Greenland and claimed an initial victory on retaking control of the Panama Canal.

One week before general elections in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark with an independence movement, Trump said he had a message for the ""incredible people"" of the sparsely populated but mineral-rich and strategically-placed island.

""We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,"" Trump said.

But he made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: ""One way or the other we're going to get it.""

""We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.""

China and Russia have been stepping up activity in the Arctic as climate change opens further sea routes.

'Taking it back'

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called for cool heads to prevail.

""I think everyone, including us, should be cautious about having all kinds of opinions about the future"" of Greenland, he told Danish television TV2.

US threats to take Greenland would once have been thinkable, with Denmark a treaty ally of the United States under NATO.

But Trump has made clear he has little patience for European allies, which he again denounced for not spending more on their militaries, with Trump instead seeing a return to an era of big powers taking what they want.

He has similarly vowed to take back the Panama Canal, the crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that the United States handed to Panama at the end of 1999.

Trump declared triumph after Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison decided to sell its Panama ports to a US-led consortium.

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had complained that rival China had gained too much influence over the canal and could shut it down in a conflict with the United States.

""To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,"" he said, as he mentioned the port deal.

""We didn't give it to China. Gave it to Panama -- and we're taking it back,"" he said.

Trump had earlier not ruled out military force to seize either the Panama Canal or Greenland.

Trump has paradoxically sought to cast himself as a peacemaker. He has vowed to end the war in Ukraine and has rattled allies by suspending aid to the country, which Russia invaded three years ago.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he visited the White House on Friday, calling him ungrateful.

Addressing Congress, Trump read a message from Zelensky in which the Ukrainian leader sought to repair the damage and voiced a willingness to a sign a deal in which the United States would take much of Ukraine's mineral wealth.

""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" Trump said.

Overseas aid

The Trump administration at the same time has canceled more than 90 percent of US development assistance, traditionally a key source of US non-military influence.

Trump has described aid as not in the US interest, with his advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, pushing massive cuts to make way for tax cuts.

Trump rattled off a list of previous aid grants and reserved mockery for a project in the landlocked African country of Lesotho, which has one of the world's highest rates of HIV/AIDS.

""Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho,"" Trump said, struggling with the pronunciation.

""Which nobody has ever heard of,"" Trump added to laughter from Republican lawmakers.

In a sharp retort to US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs charge, the Chinese embassy in the US said Beijing is ready to ""fight till the end"" in any type of war the US wants. ""If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,"" the Chinese embassy's official handle posted on X after Trump's explosive remarks in a joint session at Congress.

If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end. https://t.co/crPhO02fFE

Trump said other countries have used tariffs against the US for decades. "" Now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher,"" he said.

""This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was... That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them,"" he said.

Trump has increased previously imposed 10 per cent levies on Chinese goods to 20 per cent. China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US.

""The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation,"" Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement.

While imposing the tariffs, Trump accused China of not doing enough to halt the trafficking of fentanyl and other highly potent opioids into the US.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has contested this. ""The fentanyl issue is a flimsy excuse to raise US tariffs on Chinese imports. The US, not anyone else, is responsible for the #FentanylCrisis inside the US. In the spirit of humanity and goodwill towards the American people, we have taken robust steps to assist the US in dealing with the issue. Instead of recognizing our efforts, the US has sought to smear and shift blame to China, and is seeking to pressure and blackmail China with tariff hikes,"" it said in a statement.

""They've been PUNISHING us for helping them. This is not going to solve the US's problem and will undermine our counternarcotics dialogue and cooperation. Intimidation does not scare us. Bullying does not work on us. Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China. Anyone using maximum pressure on China is picking the wrong guy and miscalculating. If the US truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China by treating each other as equals,"" it added.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US President Donald Trump addressed a joint Congress Tuesday (local time).

Donald Trump has vowed to construct a 'Golden Dome' - similar to Israel's 'Iron Dome' missile defence - as he build :""the most powerful military of the future"". The first step, he told a joint sitting of the United States Congress is to fund a ""state-of-the-art missile shield to protect our homeland"".

Trump - who made a raft of eyebrow-raising declarations, many of which were fact-checked by American media and found to be false or incomplete, including comments about the price of eggs under his predecessor, Joe Biden - was referring to a shield against ballistic missiles, while are among the most complicated weapons systems to design, develop, and operationalise.

He claimed Ronald Reagan, the 40th US President, who served from 1981 to 1989, wanted to build a similar system but lacked the technology to do so. ""Israel and other places have it... and the US should too,"" he said, ""This is a very dangerous world. We're going to protect our citizens like never before.""

Trump may have been referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative, announced in 1983 by Reagan to defend against Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles by intercepting and shooting them down. Plans for the system included space-based 'laser' weapons to track the missiles.

There were significant technological and even ethical challenges to the programme, which was eventually rendered obsolete after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

A ballistic missile defence shield consists of interlocked systems designed to detect, track, and intercept incoming ballistic weapons at various stages of flight - boost, midcourse, terminal.

The goal, though, is simple - to detect and shoot down a missile before it hits a target.

To begin with, the Space-Based Infrared System, or SBIRS, aids detection of missiles and aerial threats. This is accomplished by relying on SBIRS satellites for early warning of missile launches, and paired with a host of ground-based radars. Without these, detecting the launch of an incoming ballistic missile becomes almost impossible.

Space-Based Infrared System

The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, is the backbone of the US' defence against intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. The GMD uses ground-based interceptors deployed at locations in Alaska and California to stop missiles during their midcourse phase.

The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, or BMD, is a sea- and land-based system that employs warships to engage short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, is a mobile, land-based system that intercepts short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. The THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology; i.e., how defensive missiles collide head-on with incoming threats to destroy them.

The THAAD system, incidentally, is also in Israel; in December last year it was used to intercept a ballistic missile reportedly fired from Yemen by the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group.

Terminal High Altitude Area Defense

A standard THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers with up to eight interceptors each, a radar that can detect threats up to 3,000km away, and a fire control system.

For shorter range ballistic missiles and other air threats in the terminal phase, the US relies on the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, or PAC-3, interceptor missiles. These are also part of a plan to counter possible deployment of Chinese hypersonic weapons in the Pacific region.

Patriot Advanced Capability-3

Development of the Israeli version - operation of which was on TV news channels at the height of Tel Aviv's war on Hamas and Hezbollah - began in 2007. It was up and running by 2011.

VIDEO | Israel's Air Defence System In Action To Intercept Iranian Missiles

This is a multi-tiered system with the 'Iron Dome' at the heart. The other layers are 'David's Sling' for mid- to long-range missiles, and Arrow-2 and Arrow-3, which shoot down long-range ballistic missiles.

The United States funded roughly half of the annual development costs of the Arrow 2 system. By 2020, the total US. financial contribution toward the Arrow Weapon System exceeded $3.7 billion.

Greenland's prime minister on Wednesday hit back at President Donald Trump's pledge to take the Arctic territory ""one way or the other"", insisting that islanders did not see their future with the United States or even Denmark.

Mute Egede rejected Trump's expansionist ambitions to annex the sparsely populated but mineral-rich and strategically placed island, in a partisan address to the US Congress in Washington on Tuesday.

""We don't want to be Americans, or Danes either. We are Greenlanders. The Americans and their leader must understand that,"" Egede wrote in a Facebook post.

""We are not for sale and can't just be taken. Our future is decided by us in Greenland,"" he said, six days before the island's legislative elections where the longstanding question of independence tops the agenda.

Trump offered only passing lines on world affairs in his speech, focusing on his domestic goals like rounding up undocumented immigrants and slashing government spending.

But he repeated his aspirations to take Greenland and claimed an initial victory on retaking control of the Panama Canal.

Denmark, of which self-governing Greenland is part, also rebuffed Trump's aspirations to take the island, with China and Russia increasingly active in the Arctic, as climate change opens up sea routes.

In Copenhagen, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told public broadcaster DR that US annexation of Greenland ""won't happen"".

Lesotho was taken aback by US President Donald Trump's mockery of the southern African nation, its foreign minister said Wednesday, as the country's main LGBTQ rights organisation denied receiving funds from Washington.

Trump called Lesotho a country ""nobody has ever heard of"" as he defended his sweeping cuts in aid during an address to Congress Tuesday.

He singled out a past US aid project of ""eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho"".

""Which nobody has ever heard of,"" he added, as Republican lawmakers laughed.

The Lesotho government was ""shocked and embarrassed"" by the comments, Foreign Minister Lejone Mpotjoane told AFP.

""We did not expect a head of state to refer to another sovereign nation in such a manner,"" he said.

The US has an embassy in the capital Maseru, and American volunteers serve in the popular Peace Corps programme.

""We are not taking this matter lightly,"" Mpotjoane said, adding that they will send an official protest letter to Washington.

- 'Not receiving' US grants -

Which exact programme Trump was referring to remained unclear on Wednesday.

Lesotho's main LGBTQ rights organisation, the People's Matrix, denied receiving eight million dollars in US funding.

""We are literally not receiving grants from the US,"" People's Matrix spokesperson Tampose Mothopeng told AFP.

""We have no idea of the allocation of eight million (dollars),"" he said. ""We do not know who received or is going to receive that money.""

""We do not have such moneys or a contract that would even reach a quarter of half of that money,"" he added.

The US government foreign assistance website did not list any financial support for LGBTQ rights in Lesotho, a nation of 2.3 million people.

Instead, it indicated that about 120 million dollars had been spent on ""health and population"" programmes in the country in 2024, including $43.5 million to tackle HIV/AIDS.

The small mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa has one of the highest rates of the disease in the world, with almost one in four adults HIV-positive.

The US has committed more than $630 million since 2006 to anti-HIV/AIDS efforts in Lesotho, according to the US embassy there.

More than 30 non-governmental organisations warned in mid-February that the country's HIV programmes were at risk of collapse following the loss of US foreign aid.

On Wednesday morning, Lesotho residents woke up confused at Trump's jab at their country.

""Ever heard of Kingdom in the Sky? Guess not, too busy golfing to notice,"" journalist and activist Kananelo Boloetse posted on social media platform X.

""Lesotho's the only country in the world entirely above 1,000 metres elevation, higher than your approval ratings ever got,"" he posted, adding: ""We're here, we're proud, and we're not your punchline.""

China warned it is ready for any “type of war” with the US in an alarming escalation as President Trump’s tariffs went into effect.

“If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said late Tuesday.

Tensions grew stiff between the two nations on Tuesday as Trump bumped up a 10% tariff on Chinese imports to 20%, claiming the trade measure would halt the flow of fentanyl into America.

Jian’s statement, reiterated on X by the Chinese embassy in Washington, cautioned that “intimidation” and “bullying” would not work — as China also imposed a 15% tariff on American agricultural goods.

“Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China. Anyone using maximum pressure on China is picking the wrong guy and miscalculation,” the spokesperson said.

Trump has justified his tariffs — 25% on Canadian and Mexican products and 20% on Chinese goods — by blaming the foreign nations for the fentanyl and opioid crisis in the US, saying they haven’t done enough to crack down on deadly and illicit fentanyl imports to justify pausing the tariffs.

China fired back, saying if the US “truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue,” the “right thing to do” would be to consult China with mutual respect.

Jian also defended China’s retaliatory 15% tariff on American goods, saying the country “has made clear its opposition” to the tariffs but must “defend our rights and interests.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to China’s threats early Wednesday, telling Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” the US is “prepared” and doing everything he can to deter conflict with China.

“Those who long for peace must prepare for war,” Hegseth said. 

“That’s why we’re rebuilding our military. That’s why we’re re-establishing deterrence in the warrior ethos. We live in a dangerous world with powerful, ascendant countries with very different ideology.” 

“They’re rapidly increasing their defense spending, modern technology, they want to supplant the United States,” he continued. “If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.”

Hegseth’s warning came as Trump doubled down on his decision to roll out sweeping tariffs, claiming “other countries have used tariffs against us for decades.”

“And now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries,” Trump told Congress.

Meanwhile, experts fear the cost of food and automobiles, among other goods, will swell as a result of the tariffs.

The tariffs will apply to about $1.4 trillion in Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. 

Trump also announced Monday that he would be adopting agricultural tariffs on April 2 to slap “reciprocal” levies on other countries, including European allies and Japan. ","{'href': 'https://nypost.com', 'title': 'New York Post'}"

With President Donald Trump's suspension of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, European nations are again looking at how to utilise some $300 billion of Russian state assets frozen by the Group of Seven rich democracies after Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Here is what has been done so far and some of the other ideas under consideration:

ACTIONS TAKEN SO FAR

The Group of Seven (G7) agreed last year to provide Ukraine with $50 billion via a series of bilateral loans that Kyiv could pay off using windfall profits from the frozen Russian assets.

The European Union estimates that 210 billion euros ($221.5 billion) of the roughly $300 billion worth of frozen Russian assets are held in the EU, mainly in the form of government bonds that Russia's central bank had stored as reserves.

Euroclear, the securities repository in Belgium where the bulk of those bonds are held, made provisions last year for 4 billion euros worth of interest earnings to go into a specially created Ukraine fund.

An initial tranche of 1.55 billion euros for the first half of 2024 was paid into the fund last July. A further payment of approximately 2 billion euros covering the second half of 2024 is expected this month.

Those payments should keep flowing for years.

The EU has said it expects the assets to yield about 15-20 billion euros ($16-$22 billion) in interest earned by 2027, although falling euro zone interest rates will gradually decrease the amounts, Euroclear has said.

The United States committed to provide $20 billion of the G7's overall $50 billion of support loans. But Trump's move to suspend his country's military aid to Ukraine means it is now unclear whether Washington will stick to the plan.

The G7 groups the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Britain, France and Italy.

FULL CONFISCATION?

British foreign minister David Lammy recently restated the UK's long-standing position that Europe should move from just freezing Russian assets to seizing them.

However, other European countries, including France and Germany, remain far more wary about the confiscation idea.

The European Central Bank is also among the sceptics, fearing any move to seize the Russian assets would dent confidence in the euro and hurt financial stability.

The ECB wants to ensure that it is not only the euro that is affected if other countries such as China or Saudi Arabia started repatriating their reserves from European jurisdictions as a precaution against them potentially being frozen.

CEASEFIRE LEVERAGE

Speaking alongside Trump last week, France's President Emmanuel Macron said the frozen Russian assets could be part of negotiations with Russia to end the war.

According to a report in the Financial Times this week, French officials have discussed a proposal for European capitals to seize the assets if Moscow were to violate a future ceasefire deal.

Some top lawyers argue that, legally, there is little difference between siphoning off the interest earned from the bonds and seizing all of the estimated $300 billion of Russian assets.

They suggest the latter option could be done under a doctrine of international law known as ""countermeasures"". The assets would then be sold or collateralised and the proceeds handed to Ukraine, or to its dedicated reconstruction fund.

Previous examples of such seizures, such as of Iraqi assets after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and of German assets after World War Two, happened after those wars had ended, not while they were still raging - as with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

RUSSIAN PROPOSAL

Sources told Reuters last month that Russia could agree to using the $300 billion of frozen money for reconstruction in Ukraine but will insist that at least some of it is spent in the parts of the country that Moscow's forces now control.

Reuters could not establish whether the idea of using the frozen funds was discussed when Russian and U.S. officials held their first face-to-face talks in Riyadh last month on ending the war in Ukraine.

Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the bank was not part of any talks on lifting sanctions or unfreezing of Russia's reserves.

Moscow has previously said the West's plans to use the frozen funds for Ukraine amounted to robbery and that it could retaliate by seizing Western assets on its territory.

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump’s first address in his second term to the joint session of the US Congress on Tuesday confirmed he is making five big bets straddling politics, foreign policy and the economy. How these play out in the next year is the big question.

Trump’s first bet is that he can dramatically downsize the US State and its regulatory apparatus, scale back its services, and reduce its international footprint. His support for the Department of Government Efficiency, praise for Elon Musk and recital of what Trump considered instances of waste, abuse and fraud on Tuesday show that this remaking of the American State will continue. This stems from an ideological conviction against big government, an economic calculus that this can help reduce the deficit, strategic logic that the US hasn’t gained from its commitments abroad, and a worldview that the US needs a far more focused set of interests. That much is now known.

What remains uncertain is whether Trump can do this without affecting core governance functions, sparking political backlash or harming America’s interests abroad. After all, abolishing agencies creates vacuums. Removing federal workers means work that no longer gets done. Eliminating regulatory oversight increases the chances of market failure and public harm. Withdrawing development assistance diminishes global influence and networks.

Trump’s second bet is that he can work with Russia, force Ukraine to accept peace terms that Washington and Moscow are comfortable with, and get Europe to handle its own security. Trump’s insistence that Ukraine offer a share of its minerals to the US, his rebuke to Volodymyr Zelensky last week, suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing, slight willingness to reopen doors to Zelensky after his somewhat regretful approach, open advocacy of direct talks with Russia, defence of Vladimir Putin, and consistently sharp messages to Europe all form part of this wider strategic play. This reflects his conviction that European security isn’t America’s perennial responsibility, his faith that the Atlantic can insulate America, and his belief that Russia poses no real threat to core American interests. This much is known.

The unknown is whether Trump can execute this balancing act without geopolitical costs. Maintaining dominance over the western alliance becomes difficult if Europe acts autonomously. Sustaining intelligence sharing across the Five Eyes network grows challenging if allies lose trust. Ensuring peace terms that leave a sovereign Ukraine intact becomes harder if Moscow feels emboldened. Preventing an empowered Russia from eyeing other Eastern European territories becomes more difficult if DC signals NATO commitment isn’t sacrosanct. And preventing this reset from signalling to China that territorial adventurism pays becomes harder.

Trump’s third bet is that he can reorder the international economic order to incentivise both American and foreign companies to invest in the US, force other countries to open markets to American goods, make the American market less accessible to foreign producers, and operate through bilateral deals rather than multilateral regimes. Trump’s attribution of recent US investment announcements to tariffs, his announcement of reciprocal tariffs from April 2, his message that non-tariff barriers will factor into determining reciprocal tariffs, and his defence of tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China all form part of this strategy. This reflects Trump’s conviction that others have exploited American openness, globalisation destroyed American jobs by making China the world’s production hub, and his faith in tariffs as the policy instrument to correct this while fulfilling his political promise to revive manufacturing and boost employment. This much is known.

The question remains whether this deliberate disorder will yield Trump’s hoped-for gains without corresponding costs. Increased tariffs shift burdens to importers and consumers, raising prices—contradicting Trump’s promise to keep prices low. Tariffs on close neighbours with intricate supply chain relationships can disrupt domestic industrial production. When tariffs trigger retaliation, American exporters including farmers—key parts of Trump’s coalition—suffer. Indiscriminate tariffs affect markets, that in turn concerns the New Yorker businessman in Trump. And if he appears too unpredictable as the self-styled “tariff king,” the world may pivot toward China rather than withdraw from it.

Trump’s fourth bet is to establish American dominance over the Americas. His instruction to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, from the stage, to take over the Panama Canal; repeated references to acquiring Greenland; criticism of Mexico as a den of cartels exporting illegal immigrants and fentanyl; earlier references to Canada as America’s 51st state; and reiteration of plans to build an iron dome to protect the homeland all align with this strategy. This appears to stem from Trump’s conviction that America’s core security interests require insulating the Americas from external (particularly Chinese) influence and ensuring that the US can call the shots from Greenland, through Canada, down to Mexico and Central America, all the way to Chile. This much is known.

The uncertainty is whether Trump’s strategy of coercion and vocabulary of threats will succeed in bringing countries into line, or whether American ultra-nationalism will trigger nationalist backlash among neighbours. Threatening to take over Canada angers even the most pro-American Canadian politicians. Calling Mexico cartel-controlled despite its reconciliatory actions alienates Mexican citizens. Forcing South American countries—many with China as their biggest trading partner—to make binary choices rather than offering incentives may backfire.

Trump’s four bets may succeed, given America’s immense power and Trump’s willingness to exercise it. So far, countries have sought bilateral deals with Trump to avoid his wrath. Those who had provoked him quickly sought reconciliation. Friends are nervous but value the relationship. Adversaries are wary but sense an opportunity to redirect American policy in their favour.

This reveals Trump’s hidden fifth bet. His address was conspicuously lacking a coherent policy statement on China. To be sure, the US has imposed an additional 20% tariff on China and there has been an absence of direct communication between Trump and Xi Jinping. But this marked the first time in years a US president didn’t characterise China as a peer-level adversary, mention the Indo-Pacific construct, address China’s military and economic threats in Asia, or even reference Taiwan—all against the backdrop of Trump’s signals that a deal with Xi is possible and desirable. How Trump ultimately plays his China hand, and how China responds, remains the major unanswered question after Tuesday. But the bets he has already made will transform America and the world in both anticipated and unanticipated ways.

Nine students who went missing on vacation in Mexico have been found dismembered by the side of the road along with a ""bag of hands"". According to the New York Post, the group, from the Mexican town of Tlaxcala, went missing on February 27. They had been travelling to the beaches in Oaxaca to celebrate their graduation. On Sunday, the cops found their remains in a truck of an abandoned vehicle in San Jose Miahuatlan on the border of the Mexican states of Puebla and Oaxaca.

According to the Post, four of the bodies were in the truck, while the other five bodies were left under the tarp. A bag of eight pairs of hands were also discovered at the scene, with two more hands left in the truck. Cops said that the bodies of the four women and five men, ages 19 to 30, all had bullet wounds and signs of torture. 

The victims, identified so far, are Angie Lizeth, 29, Brenda Mariel, 19, Jacqueline Ailet, 23, Noemi Yamileth, 28, Lesly Noya Trejo, 21, Raul Emmanuel, 28, Ruben Antonio, and Rolando Armando. The ninth victim has yet to be identified. 

A video capturing the last time they were seen alive showed their car driving along the Atlixcayotl highway, around 90 miles west of where their remains were eventually found, according to the outlet.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news,Key highlights from President Donald Trump’s joint address to Congress,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/key-highlights-from-president-donald-trumps-joint-address-to-congress-9869255/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 08:23:23 GMT","

In a high-stakes speech before a joint session of Congress, President Donald Trump outlined his vision for his second term, doubling down on trade policies, economic reforms, and cultural issues while drawing strong reactions from both Republicans and Democrats. His address, which came just weeks into his return to the White House, underscored his commitment to reshaping American policy both domestically and abroad.

One of the major takeaways from Trump’s speech was his announcement of reciprocal tariffs on foreign imports, set to take effect on April 2. Targeting India, China, and the European Union, Trump criticized the “unfair” trade practices that have harmed US businesses.

“India charges us tariffs, 100%. The system is not fair to the US, it never was,” Trump declared, adding that the new tariffs would level the playing field for American exporters. Under this policy, any country imposing high duties on US goods will face equivalent tariffs in return. Analysts warn that this move could strain trade relations, especially with India, which maintains significant tariffs on key sectors like automobiles, agriculture, and textiles.

The announcement of tariffs sent financial markets into turmoil, with stocks plummeting amid fears of an escalating trade war. Despite concerns about inflation, Trump remained steadfast in his approach.

“Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that,” he stated.


He also blamed rising egg prices on his predecessor’s energy policies and pledged that his administration’s “National ENERGY Emergency” would boost domestic drilling and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources.

Trump aimed at progressive policies, making sharp comments about transgender rights, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. He reiterated his commitment to banning transgender women from women’s sports and declared, “Our country will be woke no longer.”

He also called for making English the official language of the United States and criticized government spending on projects he deemed unnecessary, such as funding for LGBTQ+ rights in foreign nations.

Trump touted his administration’s “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.” His remarks were met with chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” from Republican lawmakers. He blamed his predecessor for what he described as “insane and very dangerous open border policies.”

His administration has vowed to intensify deportations, further tighten asylum policies, and restrict immigration in ways that align with his “America First” vision.

On the foreign policy front, Trump made headlines with his remarks on Ukraine and US strategic interests.

With a sweeping policy agenda, Trump is poised to push for additional tax cuts, a repeal of the CHIPS and Science Act, and deep government spending cuts. His administration also continues to push for tighter immigration controls and trade policies aimed at reducing foreign competition.

In a harrowing incident, the severed bodies of nine students, who went missing while on a vacation in Mexico last month, were found by the side of a local highway.

The bodies were found in the trunk of an abandoned vehicle and underneath a blood-covered tarp in San Jose Miahuatlan on the border of the Mexican states of Puebla and Oaxaca.

Alongside the body, a bag with eight pairs of severed hands was also found. Two more hands left in the trunk reported Periodico Central.

As per the report, four of the bodies were in the trunk, while the other five corpses were left under the tarp.

The bodies found in the trunk belonged to four women and five men aged between 19 to 30. They reportedly have signs of bullet wounds and torture.

President Donald Trump's Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress highlighted several of the initiatives he's started in his first six weeks in office, but many of his comments included false and misleading information.

Here's a look at the facts:

He overstated the numbers on his immigration crackdown

Trump: ""Illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever.""

The Facts: Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday that Border Patrol apprehended 8,326 people on the U.S.-Mexico border last month. But U.S. government data show that Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s.

While February marked the lowest arrest total in decades, Border Patrol averaged less than February 2025 for the first seven years of 1960s. The government website does not track U.S.-Mexico border totals before 1960. Border Patrol's monthly average was 1,752 arrests in 1961.

He inflated the number of people who entered the U.S. illegally under President Joe Biden

Trump: ""Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members.""



The Facts: That figure, which Trump cites regularly, is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 10.8 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through December 2024.

But that's arrests, not people. Under asylum restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or people with mental illness across the border, despite this frequent line from Trump.

Economists differ with Trump on tariffs

Trump: ""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much.""

The Facts: Trump is banking on the idea that taxing imports is the road to riches for the United States. Most economists say Trump's tariffs would hurt the country, as they're tax increases that could raise the costs of goods in ways that could also harm economic growth. Trump suggests that the impact on inflation would be minimal.

When the Yale University Budget Lab looked at the tariffs that Trump imposed Tuesday on Canada, Mexico and China, it found that inflation would increase a full percentage point, growth would fall by half a percentage point and the average household would lose about $1,600 in disposable income.

There's no evidence Social Security money is being paid to many people over age 100

Trump: ""Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. ... 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we are searching right now.""

The Facts: The databases may list those people, but that does not mean they are getting paid benefits.

Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn't use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.

Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as dead. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits.

The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.

Trump did not inherit an 'economic catastrophe'

Trump: ""Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.""

The Facts: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 under President Joe Biden, but Trump did not inherit a disastrous economy by any measure. The unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4% in January, the month he took office, while the economy expanded a healthy 2.8% in 2024. Inflation-adjusted incomes have grown steadily since mid-2023. And inflation, while showing signs of stickiness in recent months and still elevated at 3% in January, is down from its 2022 peak.

Trump's reference to an 'EV mandate' is inaccurate

Trump: ""We ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.""

The Facts: There was no federal mandate to force the purchase of EVs, as Trump has falsely claimed many times before.

Biden had set up a non-binding goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal.

Biden's policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.

A closer look at Army recruitment numbers

Trump: ""I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years.""

The Facts: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Army's recruiting turnaround is tied to his time in office.

In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total coming in August 2024 - before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers.

A significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army's decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training.

 Former tank commander Eyal Zamir will on Wednesday become Israel's new armed forces chief, inheriting the task at a crucial time for the military after it acknowledged its ""complete failure"" to prevent Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack. 

 Previously director of the defence ministry, Zamir will replace outgoing chief of staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halev, who resigned admitting he failed to fulfil his mandate. 

 Zamir, 59, is being sworn in at a sensitive time in Israel's war with Hamas, with the ceasefire that took effect on January 19 hanging in the balance. 

 Announcing his appointment last month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had high hopes that Zamir would help achieve Israel's goal of ""absolute victory"" against Hamas. 

 Zamir will also take over operations in the occupied West Bank, where the military has deployed tanks in recent weeks for the first time in 20 years. 

 His appointment also comes at a moment of high tension for Israel with its arch-foe Iran. 

 Zamir wrote in a 2022 policy paper for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy that Israel needed to adopt a tougher approach in order to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons. 

 Pushing for greater cooperation with the United States against what he called the ""Iran axis"", Zamir advocated ""offensive action"" in order to guarantee success. 

 His position on Iran mirrors that of Netanyahu, who recently said that Israel plans to ""finish the job against Iran's terror axis"". 

 Zamir, who led key operations during the second Palestinian intifada or uprising, served as Netanyahu's military secretary from 2012 to 2015. 

 He is the founder of the right-wing think tank Israel Defence and Security Forum . 

 In contrast to Halevi, who avoided the spotlight, Zamir comes across as a powerful figure. 

 At a defence ministry event a day after his appointment, Zamir, a father of three, was quoted as saying that 2025 would be ""a year of continued fighting"". 

 ""The war has demonstrated that we must be self-reliant,"" he said. 

 As head of the defence ministry, Zamir is credited with some of Israel's biggest and most significant defence procurements. 

 ""He understands very well what big wars are all about and how to fight them,"" said Amir Avivi, a former Israeli general who now runs a network for former security officials.

 Zamir cuts a powerful frame, his burly build sending a clear message that he means business. 

 Avivi, who has known Zamir for more than 20 years and spent a year with him at the Israeli College for National Security, described him as being ""mission-oriented"", ""detail-oriented"" and ""strict"". 

 He said Zamir has a ""deep understanding"" of the Gaza front and even authored ""a very detailed plan to conquer all of Gaza"" while serving as head of Southern Command from 2015 to 2018. 

 Saying he had spoken with Zamir since his appointment, Avivi added: ""I think he has a very clear understanding that he was chosen for one thing to bring total victory to Israel on all fronts."" 

 Jonathan Conricus, a former Israeli army spokesman who served with Zamir, also said the incoming chief would have to ""navigate strategic challenges of the most sensitive nature"", including restoring public trust. 

 Born in Israel's southernmost city Eilat, Zamir, whose paternal grandfather immigrated from Yemen and whose mother's family arrived from Syria, joined the military in 1984. 

 Unlike previous chiefs of staff, who served in the distinguished paratroopers' unit or in the Golani infantry brigade, Zamir began his career in the Armoured Corps. 

 He served through the first and second intifadas holding senior combat and command roles. 

 In 2002, he led a brigade that captured the refugee camp adjacent to the West Bank city of Jenin, a hotbed of Palestinian militancy. 

 The army laid siege to the camp for more than a month amid fierce fighting that saw hundreds of homes levelled, and 52 Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers killed. 

 Zamir was later appointed head of the army's southern command, where he led efforts to cut off Hamas tunnels. 

 From 2018 to 2021, he served as deputy chief of staff under Lieutenant General Aviv Kochavi, tasked with implementing the military's multi-year plan.

 Further U.S. tariffs on imports would cause prices to rise and consumers to buy fewer products, Adidas chief executive officer Bjorn Gulden said on Wednesday as the business navigates higher levies implemented by President Donald Trump's administration on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Adidas has not estimated the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on Vietnam, its top manufacturing country, which President Donald Trump has threatened with higher levies, Gulden said.

""If there are 25% duties coming and it is on more countries, inflation will go up and volumes will go down,"" Gulden told journalists after reporting results. ""We know that, but how much? I mean, we can give you a number, but the only thing we know is we will have to adjust very, very quickly.""

Vietnam produces 27% of Adidas' total volume of products, followed by Indonesia at 19% and China at 16%.

But Gulden shrugged off the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, saying only a small portion of its product sold in the U.S. is made in China.

""We have less than 5% of our volumes going to the U.S. is (produced in) China,"" he said.

AFTER AMERICA announced on March 3rd that it is suspending military aid to Ukraine, it looks increasingly likely that Ukraine will have to depend on Europe. Donald Trump might be persuaded to reverse the suspension, for instance if Volodymyr Zelensky agrees to sign a deal on its minerals industry. A statement by Mr Zelensky on March 4th said that he was ready to sign, and to start peace talks, though it is not clear what Mr Trump’s response will now be. But the events of the last few days suggests that relying on America for weapons is no longer wise. A back-up is surely needed.

Could Europe fill the gap? On March 4th the European Union announced a programme to “Rearm Europe”. And even notoriously cynical financial markets are betting on a response of sorts. The combined market capitalisation of big European defence firms such as BAE Systems, Rheinmetall and Thales has soared by €40bn ($42bn), or 21%, in the past ten days. These firms are expected to raise their capital investment significantly in the next two years. That reflects optimism that defence spending will rise and that Europe’s military-industrial complex will be reinvigorated. Whether all that translates into a substitute for American aid for Ukraine is far less clear.

Start with money. Although it has given Ukraine €132bn in military and financial aid (more than America’s €114bn), Europe’s big countries could afford to do more. Over the past three years Germany and Britain have allocated less than 0.2% of one year’s GDP to Ukraine, about the same as America has. France, Spain and Italy have managed only half that. Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, a think-tank, points out that Germany spends three times as much subsidising diesel fuel. Europe has frozen €210bn of Russian assets, which could also be seized to help Ukraine.

As well as individual countries signalling a rise in defence spending as a share of GDP, on March 4th the head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the Rearm Europe plan. It aims to unlock up to €800bn ($845bn) by relaxing the EU’s debt rules so that members can boost annual military spending by 1.5% of GDP towards a new target of around 3.5%; creating a €150bn loan fund for programmes such as anti-missile systems; allowing more of the EU’s own budget to be spent on defence; and tapping bond markets and allowing the European Investment Bank to finance military projects. The plan will not immediately raise new funds but it could galvanise higher spending in time.

How will more cash change Europe’s defence posture and the course of the war in Ukraine? The good news is that Ukraine is not about to run out of crucial weaponry. Unlike in early 2024, when a freeze on aid by America’s Congress created severe difficulties, Ukraine should be able to keep fighting into the summer without fresh American supplies. An American officer says that the Biden administration shipped a lot of materiel before Mr Trump’s inauguration.

Ukraine is also rapidly expanding its own defence industrial base. During the Soviet era it had a mighty arms industry. Mr Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with American and European defence firms, such as Rheinmetall, of Germany and the Franco-German KNDS. Sir Lawrence Freedman, a British strategist, puts the figure even higher. Ukraine’s defence firms focus on producing drones of all shapes and sizes, electronic warfare systems and artillery.

Europe can funnel cash using an approach pioneered by Denmark in which it finances contracts between the Ukraine government and Ukrainian manufacturers. Last year Denmark in this way bought 18 domestically-produced Bohdana howitzers for the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s defence firms are fast-moving. Nico Lange, a former chief of staff in Germany’s defence ministry, says you can buy three Bohdanas for the price of a French Caesar gun, admittedly a more capable system.

Yet America was until this week still providing a large chunk of Ukraine’s military aid, the elimination of which will gradually cause serious strains. Because Europe emptied its military stockpiles early in the war, it will struggle to give Ukraine armoured fighting vehicles, howitzers and precision munitions. Tom Waldwyn, an expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says: “There is no point in rummaging around in a cupboard that has already been scraped clean.”

Europe’s defence industry is not expanding fast enough to fill key gaps. Sir Lawrence says the kit America has provided, such as Patriot interceptors and HIMARS rocket launchers, “is at the high end in quality”. Along with intelligence and logistics support, this is hard for Europe to replicate quickly. Cranking up complex, multinational programmes takes time. Eric Béranger, the boss of MBDA, a missile-maker that had record order books last year, admits that a system like the Franco-Italian Aster air-defence missile had been “developed in an era where time was not important”. Since 2022, however, “suddenly, brutally time matters”. The delivery time of the Aster has been cut from 42 months, but is still 18 months.

Plugging the gaps by buying off the shelf from abroad, often from American or South Korean companies, is tricky. Mr Waldwyn says that much of South Korea’s production over the next few years is already earmarked either for Poland, which has signed $16bn-worth of contracts since 2022, or for the country’s own armed forces. Good luck persuading Poland, which sees itself as a front-line state and has raised defence spending to 5% of GDP, to defer purchases of tanks and missile launchers.

Buying from America would appear to be the obvious step and one that the notoriously transactional Mr Trump might approve of. But Keir Giles, author of “Who Will Defend Europe?”, warns that if Mr Trump continues to regard Ukraine as the main obstacle to his peace deal, he might refuse American firms export permissions or demand limitations on the capabilities of any weapons they sell.

By far the best bet, says Mr Giles, is for Europe to use its own cash to invest heavily in Ukraine’s own defence companies. They are working at the cutting edge and know how to get new equipment to the front line within weeks or months. As one EU official notes: “Europe realises that it cannot produce the weapons that Ukraine needs. The easiest way to fill the deficit is for the Ukrainians to do it themselves.”

As for western Europe’s own defence, which America no longer seems committed to, the struggle is just beginning. Their armed forces, hollowed out by decades of neglect, have yawning capability gaps that must somehow be filled if America suddenly withdraws critical “enablers”. These include aerial refuelling, heavy lift, logistics and both airborne and space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. In addition, Europe is going to have to invest a lot in ground-based precision strike capabilities and air defence. For all of that, the EU’s package is not going to be enough. But it could be a start.

Russia has finished issuing passports to Ukrainians living in parts of the country seized by Moscow's army, officials said on Wednesday -- a process slammed by Kyiv as an illegal attempt to scrub the area of its Ukrainian identity.

Since launching its full-scale military offensive in February 2022, Moscow has pushed Ukrainians that live in the south and east of the country to become Russian citizens.

Those who refuse face restrictions on their movement and difficulties accessing public services, like healthcare and education provided by the Russian-installed authorities. Ukrainians who do not secure a Russian passport are classified as foreign citizens.

""Last year, the passportisation of residents living in the liberated areas of the Lugansk and Donetsk republics (and) Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, was virtually fully completed,"" President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of interior ministry officials in Moscow.

Russia claimed in 2022 to have annexed those four regions, despite not having full control over them.

Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said that 3.5 million passports had been handed out in total.

Even before its full-scale offensive, Russia was offering easy citizenship to residents of parts of Ukraine's Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under the control of Moscow-backed separatists.

Kyiv has called the process ""illegal"" and a ""gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty"".

It has also been slammed by Western governments and rights groups, while the European Union does not accept the passports as legitimate travel documents.

Lesotho, a small, landlocked African nation, unexpectedly found itself in the global spotlight after President Donald Trump mocked an $8 million US government grant supporting LGBTQ+ initiatives in the country.

""$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of,"" Trump declared during his fiery address to Congress on Tuesday, dismissing the funding as unnecessary.

During his speech, Trump declared his commitment to cutting what he called a ""flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars."" He announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency tasked with eliminating excessive spending, led by billionaire Elon Musk.

""To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. To that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE.""

Trump listed several spending programmes -- funds allocated to housing for undocumented immigrants, diversity scholarships in Burma, an $8 million grant for LGBTQ+ initiatives in Lesotho -- he considered wasteful.

Why Does the US Fund Programmes in Lesotho?

Contrary to Trump's claim, Lesotho is not an unknown entity in international relations. The landlocked country, surrounded entirely by South Africa, has long been a recipient of US aid, primarily through initiatives focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, LGBTQ+ rights, and economic development.



Lesotho has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, with an estimated 22 per cent of its adult population living with the virus. US-funded programmes, such as PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), have played a crucial role in addressing the crisis. LGBTQ+ rights initiatives, which Trump dismissed as wasteful, often support marginalised communities facing discrimination in healthcare access and social services.

Lesotho in the Global Arena

The country has also made significant strides in LGBTQ+ rights compared to many African nations. Same-sex relationships were decriminalised in 2012.

 WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that U.S. officials have had “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas officials. 

 Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. Leavitt declined to provide detail on the the substance of talks. 

 ""Look dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what’s in the best interest of the American people is something that the president has proven is what he believes is good faith, effort to do what’s right for the American people,"" she said. 

 Leavitt added that the Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, but noted that there are “American lives at stake.” 

 Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. 

 The continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. President Donald Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn’t agree to terms to a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 

 Adam Boehler, Trump’s nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, participated in the direct talks with Hamas. 

 The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. 

 The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials was first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios.

 JERUSALEM - Israel swore in a new commander of its military on Wednesday as a standoff over the fragile ceasefire in Gaza increased the risk of a resumption of fighting without an agreement to bring home the rest of the hostages still held by Hamas. 

 Eyal Zamir, who retired after 28 years with the rank of Major General, was promoted to Lieutenant General, before formally assuming command from General Herzi Halevi, who stepped down over the security disaster of Oct. 7, 2023. 

 ""The mission I have been given is clear, to lead the IDF to victory,"" he said. 

 Fighting in Gaza has been halted since January under a truce brokered by Qatar and Egypt and supported by the United States that has allowed the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages and 5 Thais for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. 

 A related war in southern Lebanon, which broke out after Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces launched missile strikes against Israel after the October 7 attack, has also been silenced by a separate ceasefire agreement. 

 But Israeli ministers and officials have warned that their forces could resume fighting if there is no agreement on bringing back the 59 hostages that remain. 

 Israeli troops have pulled back from some of their positions in Gaza but talks that were intended to agree the release of the hostages and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces before an end to the war have not begun. 

 Israel has called for an extension of the truce until after the Jewish Passover holiday in April to allow the release of the remaining hostages, while Hamas has insisted on proceeding to talks on a permanent end to the war bafore agreeing to any further releases. 

 Zamir's appointment comes as a series of official inquiries have begun to examine the failures that allowed thousands of Hamas-led gunmen to storm Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages in one of the biggest military and security disasters in Israel's history. 

 Halevi led the military during the Israeli campaign in Gaza that killed more than 48,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the enclave, leaving most of the population sheltering in tents or bombed-out buildings. 

 But he announced in January, soon after the Gaza ceasefire deal was agreed, that he would step down from his command, accepting responsibility for the military's patchy and uncoordinated response to the Oct. 7 attack. 

 Both the Israel Defence Forces and the Shin Bet security agency have acknowledged that their failures allowed the attack to take place but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far resisted a more general inquiry that would look at the responsibility of his government. 

 The new commander will also have to respond to accusations from international bodies including the United Nations that Israeli troops committed war crimes during the campaign in Gaza. 

 Israel rejects those charges, which it says are motivated by political hostility towards the state of Israel but it has indicted some individual reservist soldiers for severe abuse of detainees. 

 Israel says Hamas, which has also been accused of war crimes by United Nations bodies, committed multiple atrocities during the October 7 attack and severely abused Israeli hostages in Gaza. Hamas denies the accusations.

What's even better than a gold medal? U.S. soccer sensation Sophia Wilson announced her pregnancy shortly after marrying her college sweetheart, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson. 

Most fans might know Sophia Wilson by her maiden name, Smith, after she dominated the Paris Olympics with the U.S women's national soccer team. She was one of the squad's star forwards alongside Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman — affectionately referred to as ""Triple Espresso.""  

The Wilsons shared an Instagram post on Wednesday showing off their baby's sonogram. 

""Life just keeps getting sweeter,"" the couple's post read. 

The pair met while they were both freshmen student-athletes at Stanford University. Sophia Wilson went pro the next year while Michael Wilson stayed on to play football. 

He was selected by the Cardinals in the third round of 2023 NFL Draft, but she played in Oregon for the Portland Thorns. They made long-distance work, though, and were married in January during both their off seasons.

Their announcement Wednesday was full of excitement from fans, friends, and teammates. Fellow Stanford alum and U.S. national team star Naomi Girma commented ""MY HEART."" 

Rodman chimed in that her ""life is complete."" 

""OMG YAYYYY,"" wrote Morgan Weaver, a fellow Thorns forward. ""Can’t wait to meet baby Wilson."" 

The National Women's Soccer League solidified a new bargaining agreement with the players union that expanded parental and childcare benefits last year. Former player Alex Morgan, who retired last year after announcing her second pregnancy, said those benefits were a point of pride. 

Morgan told Good Morning America last year that the union had to think ""outside of the box"" as these issues are not prevalent in most men's leagues. 

 ""We're able to now travel with our children and bring [a] child care provider, but also look at future planning as well for our families, and that's providing players with access to fertility clinics and a lot of other resources that weren't available to us before,"" Morgan said.

Sophia Wilson is in the final year of her contract with the Portland Thorns, and she'd be a free agent once it expires. There are currently no NWSL teams in Arizona, but there is a team in San Diego and a new team was approved for Denver earlier this year.

A colossal winter storm was slamming the East Coast on Wednesday after tearing across the central U.S., unleashing a barrage of dangerous weather disruptions from hurricane-force winds to blizzard conditions and leaving three people dead in Mississippi.

The storm impacts have been felt from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast as whiteout conditions forced people off the roads in the High Plains and wildfires broke out amid bone-dry conditions in south Texas. Over 400,000 homes and businesses across half the country were without power from Texas to North Carolina.

While many areas will see a respite as the weekend arrives, AccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the potential for multiple rounds of severe weather next week. One possible storm that could develop late next week could spark a ""significant outbreak of severe weather"" across the central U.S. for several days, AccuWeather said.

For Wednesday, forecasters expect severe weather to wallop much of the Eastern Seaboard from the Mid-Atlantic to Jacksonville, Florida. The worst conditions were anticipated across southeast Virginia and the eastern Carolinas, where authorities already are dealing with an outbreak of wildfires that began last weekend.

""The rain will be intense enough to knock down or cease the wildfire threat temporarily but will also trigger localized urban flooding of city streets,"" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Bill Deger said.

The downpours, gusty winds, severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes hitting the Atlantic Seaboard through Wednesday night will create a risk to lives and property and could trigger power outages and ""significant"" travel delays, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

The harsh weather driven by an advancing cold front will span about 100 miles in width but extend more than 1,000 miles from north to south. The heaviest rain and the greatest risk of thunderstorms may only last 6 hours or less, but chaos could be widespread.

Developments:

∎ In Florida, Tallahassee schools opened an hour late Wednesday amid concerns tornadoes could develop. The region remained under a wind advisory into Wednesday night; gusts were expected to reach 45 mph.

∎ In Texas, a weather service damage survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado occurred Tuesday in the Fort Worth area. Peak winds were estimated at 110 mph for the tornado, which remained on the ground for about a half mile.

The Weather Channel warned that damaging winds and tornadoes were possible all day Wednesday from Pennsylvania to far northern Florida. Charleston, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are among a slew of cities facing the threat into Wednesday night.

""L​arge hail and perhaps an isolated tornado could accompany storms that develop in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia,"" the Weather Channel said.

In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said three people died as high winds swept across the state Tuesday.

""Please pray for their family during this difficult time,'' Reeves said on the X platform, adding that six other people have been reported injured.

The National Weather Service in Mississippi posted video of the roof ripping off a building at the Clay County Jail. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph on Wednesday could topple large branches and some trees could fall, resulting in more power outages and making travel risky, forecasters said.

In Iowa, crews from the Des Moines Fire Department's Hazardous Materials assisted with clearing an accident scene along Interstate 80 near Wednesday morning. The driver of a semitruck collided with another truck that had previously jackknifed under an overpass, the Des Moines Register reported.

Strong winds were expected throughout the day, leading to blizzard conditions and making winter roads dangerous. A blizzard warning was in effect for much of Iowa. Conditions overnight left roads in western Iowa ""nearly impassable"" and visibility Wednesday morning was near zero at times, according to the National Weather Service.

The dangerous conditions come as thousands try to descend on Des Moines for the Iowa girls' high school state basketball tournament, a major winter event in the state.

South-central Texas was facing ""near critical"" fire weather conditions Wednesday because of the dry air and wind gusts forecast for the area. A Rangeland Fire Danger warning was in effect as 20-mph wind gusts were likely to combine with a minimum relative humidity of 15% to 25%, the weather service said.

Areas of New Mexico and Texas were temporarily shrouded by a brown mist earlier this week, when dust storms known as haboobs swept across the southern Plains on Monday afternoon. More than a dozen fire reports were received by the National Weather Service office in San Antonio and Austin.

Blizzard conditions are expected ""at times"" Wednesday from north of Kansas City, Missouri, to Iowa and Illinois and up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and several inches of snowfall combined with strong winds are likely, the National Weather Service said.

""The main concern today will continue to be the high winds with gusts expected to range between 50-65 mph through this evening,"" the NWS office in Kansas City said on X. The office in Marquette, Michigan, said strong winds along Lake Superior ""will result in blizzard conditions, possible tree damage, and potential for power outages.""

The president's speech lasted about 1 hour and 40 minutes, including pauses for clapping, applause and other reactions. 

That makes it the longest address to a joint session of Congress since at least 1964, including State of the Union speeches, according to The American Presidency Project by the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The president ended his speech with an optimistic vision for the future. 

""We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world,"" he said. ""We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.""

He continued: ""And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew [the] unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.""

Mr. Trump honored the family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed during the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

""Gunfire rang out, and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people,"" the president said. ""My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky.""

The president said Comperatore was ""a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector"" who, when the sound of gunshots rang out, ""knew instantly what it was and what to do.""

""He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters, and shielded them from the bullets with his own body,"" the president said, while noting that Comperatore's wife and daughters were in the gallery. 

""Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selflessness devotion of a true American patriot.""

The president added that he believes his life was saved in Butler that day ""for a very good reason.""

""I was saved by God to make America great again, I believe that,"" he said, reiterating a line he said in his inaugural address.

The president recalled the 13 American service members killed during a suicide bombing at the airport in Kabul during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling the withdrawal under the Biden administration ""disastrous and incompetent.""

""Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country,"" he said.

Mr. Trump then said he was pleased to announce that his administration has ""just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.""

He credited the government of Pakistan for helping to arrest ""this monster.""

Mr. Trump, who has suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland, had a message for the Denmark-owned territory.

""I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America."" 

Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is ""working with everybody involved to try and get it."" 

""And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security."" 

Recent polling in Greenland showed 85% of residents did not support becoming part of the United States.

The president called on Congress to fund a ""Golden Dome missile defense shield,"" similar to Israel's.

""As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future,"" Mr. Trump said. ""As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the USA.""

He added: ""Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right?""

The president called on Congress ""to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body."" 

""This is a big lie,"" he said. ""And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you."" 

Mr. Trump's message is an extension of the anti-transgender policies he vowed to enact during the campaign. 

In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. Schools not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive. The order also affects U.S. visa policies for athletes who travel to the country to compete in the Olympics or other sporting events. 

Mr. Trump signed another executive order in January to halt federal funding for providers of gender-affirming care for transgender people under the age of 19. The order put restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures. Two federal judges have blocked the order. 

In a touching moment, the president highlighted a 13-year-old boy in the gallery who he said was diagnosed with cancer and ""truly loves our police.""

""His name is DJ Daniel, he is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer,"" Mr. Trump said. 

Daniel waved and held up his hands in the shape of a heart before being hoisted up by his father to see the chamber.

The president said Daniel suffered from brain cancer and had once been given five months to live. Now, more than six years later, Mr. Trump said Daniel and his father have ""been on a quest to make his dream come true — and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer.""

Mr. Trump then instructed the director of the U.S. Secret Service to officially make Daniel an agent, to cheers from the chamber. 

Mr. Trump previously signed an executive order encouraging the U.S. attorney general to push for the death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. On Tuesday night, he called on Congress to make that executive order a law. 

""I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer,"" the president said. ""And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law."" 

The executive order the president signed doesn't require the death penalty, but it does call on the attorney general, wherever possible consistent with law, to seek the death penalty for every federal capital crime involving the murder of a law enforcement officer. 

Mr. Trump said law enforcement deserves ""support, protection and respect,"" though he issued sweeping pardons for those convicted or facing charges of assaulting police officers during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. 

""We're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous,"" Mr. Trump said. ""The problem is, the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it."" 

Hours after he was sworn into office in January, Mr. Trump granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the Capitol, including those who were convicted of violent and serious crimes. More than 140 police officers were injured during the attack.

The president also directed the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot. 

One day after announcing new investments in the U.S. by a Taiwanese semiconductor company, the president called on Congress to ""get rid of"" the CHIPS and Science Act, which was enacted under the Biden administration. The law is intended to boost semiconductor chip manufacturing in the U.S., both for economic and national security reasons. 

The bill had significant bipartisan support when it passed in 2022. 

""You should get rid of the CHIP Act, and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to,"" Mr. Trump said. 

The president touted his administration's work to address border security and immigration so far, celebrating what he called ""the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.""

""The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying, 'We needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border,'"" Mr. Trump said. ""But it turns out all we needed was a new president.""

The president thanked his border czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem for their work so far. And he honored Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an immigrant in the U.S. illegally whose story became a rallying cry for Republicans on the campaign trail, declaring that ""America will never ever forget"" her. Riley's mother and sister were seated in the gallery.

Mr. Trump also shared the story of a 12-year-old girl who he said was killed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He addressed her mother in the gallery and highlighted an order he said he signed earlier to rename a wildlife refuge in her daughter's name. The president displayed the order, holding it up to applause from Republicans. 

Throughout the speech, a number of Democratic lawmakers have been holding up signs with slogans like ""Musk Steals,"" ""Save Medicaid,"" ""Protect Veterans"" and ""False."" Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has a whiteboard that she has used to respond to Mr. Trump in real time:

The president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on U.S. exports. 

""If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases, a rather large one,"" he said. ""Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada — have you heard of them? — and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair.

""India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%,"" he continued. ""China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that. Four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea but that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. The system is not fair to the United States and never was.

""April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in, and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them,"" the president said. ""That's reciprocal. Back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.""

Mr. Trump praised American farmers, insisting the tariffs targeting imports from Canada and Mexico will benefit them. 

""I love the farmer, who will now be selling into our whole market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you,"" he said. ""Because those goods that come in from other companies and countries, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting. And they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.""

Mr. Trump said he wants to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, ""but only if the car is made in America."" 

""By the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen,"" he said. ""Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made."" 

He said that his policies would allow the U.S. auto industry to ""absolutely boom."" 

Mr. Trump said last month that he could impose hefty tariffs on automobile imports, but would have more to say in early April. At the time, he said that the tariffs could be ""in the neighborhood of 25%."" 

""Already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America,"" he said. 

The president urged Congress, especially Democrats, to vote for tax cuts for ""everybody."" 

""The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody,"" he said, referring to the House GOP's budget plan. ""They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote.""

""And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right but my right right here, I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts,"" the president told Democratic members. ""Because otherwise, I don't believe that people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing a big favor by telling you that."" 

Mr. Trump said they're ""seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board,"" which would carry a price tag of at least $4.5 trillion over the next decade.

The president also called on Congress to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. 

Mr. Trump claimed he would soon balance the budget, but he has endorsed a plan by Republicans in Congress to extend tax cuts and enact spending reductions that would add trillions to the nation's budget deficit. 

""In the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years, balance the federal budget,"" Mr. Trump said. 

Last week, the House narrowly adopted a budget proposal that paves the way for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense and energy priorities. Mr. Trump has dubbed it a ""big, beautiful bill."" 

The House Republican resolution instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending over the next 10 years, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

The president said his administration is preparing a ""gold card"" that would allow foreigners to pay $5 million to be placed on a pathway to citizenship, and said it would go on sale ""very, very soon."" Administration officials have said they won't discriminate based on country of origin, but candidates will be vetted. 

""For $5 million, we will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship,"" he said. ""It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. These people will have to pay tax in our country.""

""They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them being forced out,"" he added. ""They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money."" 

Mr. Trump, who has overseen a dramatic overhaul of the federal government, touted the changes that have been directed by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 

""Perhaps you've heard of it,"" Mr. Trump said as he mentioned the task force. ""Perhaps."" 

Mr. Trump said Musk, who is in attendance, has been ""working very hard."" 

""He didn't need this. He didn't need this,"" he said. ""We appreciate it."" 

The president then listed various programs, particularly foreign aid-related programs, that his administration has terminated and claimed that the task force has found billions in fraud and waste.

""By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families,"" Mr. Trump said. 

The president falsely claimed that DOGE has found ""hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud."" DOGE claims on its website that it has saved $105 billion by slashing contracts and finding fraud. But as of Monday, the data DOGE has made available only itemizes a total of $8.86 billion in canceled federal contracts, and CBS News found this data contains numerous errors and often overstates the amount that was saved. 

The president acknowledged that Americans are hurting from inflation and blamed former President Joe Biden for higher prices. 

""Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families,"" he said. ""As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans.""

Mr. Trump said he's fighting to reverse inflation, the same day his tariffs went into effect that economists predict will contribute to higher prices.

""As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again,"" the president said to applause from Republicans.

The president then blamed Biden for the price of eggs, which has continued to skyrocket under Mr. Trump as bird flu spreads. 

 ""Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control,"" he said. ""The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down.""

Mr. Trump listed off the litany of executive orders and other changes he's made in the first six weeks since the start of his second term, including renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America,"" banning transgender women from playing in girls and women's sports and making English the official language of the U.S. 

""Our country will be woke no longer,"" he said, adding that workers should be hired based on ""skill and competence, not race and gender."" 

""We've ended the tyranny of so called 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion' policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military,"" Mr. Trump said. 

The president touted his administration's swift deportations of illegal immigrants, saying Democrats seated in the chamber should celebrate what he is doing. 

""This is my fifth such speech to Congress,"" Mr. Trump said. ""And once again I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do.""

He continued: ""I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it, no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.""

Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was escorted from the chamber after he heckled the speech and refused to comply with directions to be quiet and sit. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson warned raucous Democrats to be quiet before Green was escorted out. 

""Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions. That's your warning,"" Johnson said. ""Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session."" 

When Green declined to take his seat as Johnson asked, Johnson directed the sergeant at arms to restore order and ""remove this gentleman from the chamber."" 

The president quickly touted his election victory, but was met with jeers and boos from Democrats.

""The presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades,"" Mr. Trump said, noting that he won all seven battleground states. 

""We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country,"" Mr. Trump said, as Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas rose to interrupt him. Republicans quickly stood, coming to the president's support with chants of ""USA.""

Speaker Mike Johnson rose and instructed the chamber to maintain decorum.  

After greeting Johnson, Vance, the first lady and Congress, the president began his address. 

""America is back,"" the president said, to applause and chants of ""USA, USA.""

""Six weeks ago I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started,"" he said.

Mr. Trump entered the House chamber at 9:13 p.m. as Republican lawmakers applauded. Members of Congress lined the aisle to shake hands with Mr. Trump as he made his way to the dais.

House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Vice President JD Vance are seated behind the lectern where Mr. Trump will deliver the speech. First lady Melania Trump and members of the Cabinet took their seats before Mr. Trump's entrance. 

Many Democratic women in Congress are wearing bright pink in a display of defiance against the president. 

Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, who leads the Democratic Women's Caucus, told Time magazine that the color signifies ""our protest of Trump's policies which are negatively impacting women and families.""

""Pink is a color of power and protest,"" she told the magazine. ""It's time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear.""

The 96-member group spoke about their opposition to the president outside the U.S. Capitol prior to the address on Tuesday, where Leger Fernández asserted, ""Women cannot afford Trump.""

The following Supreme Court justices are attending the president's speech, and entered the chamber before Mr. Trump was introduced:

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Sonya Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson are not in attendance.

Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m., accompanied by first lady Melania Trump. 

Billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk was in the president's motorcade, although not in the same vehicle.

Moments earlier, Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol, shaking the hands of the senators who not long ago were his colleagues. 

Doug Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, is tonight's ""designated survivor,"" the member of the president's Cabinet who is not attending the speech. The practice, which originated in the Cold War, calls for an official in the presidential line of succession to stay away from the proceedings in case a catastrophe strikes the House chamber.

The Constitution says the president shall, ""from time to time,"" give a report on the ""State of the Union"" to Congress. This speech typically takes place in January or February, and gives presidents the opportunity to tout their accomplishments over the past year and lay out their agenda for the months ahead.

Since Mr. Trump has only been in office for six weeks and a day, his address is not technically considered a State of the Union. Rather, it's known as a joint address to Congress. But it will look and sound much like a State of the Union, with the president addressing lawmakers from the House chamber, and Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance seated behind him.

Mr. Trump is expected to address what he views as his accomplishments so far before discussing the economy, immigration and foreign policy.

President Donald Trump vowed to keep up his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” in reorienting the nation’s economy, immigration and foreign policy as he delivered an unyielding address Tuesday night to Congress and the nation.

President Donald Trump doubled down on his divisive agenda Tuesday night, vowing to continue his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” as he delivered a joint address to Congress and the nation - the first of his second term.

President Donald Trump has begun his address to Congress and the American people, laying out his plans for the months ahead. Trump said he’s stamped out diversity and inclusion initiatives nationwide. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said.

House Democratic leaders had been urging their members to show restraint during Trump’s speech. Rep. Al Green did not heed that at all. But after the early outburst, most Democrats in the chamber have been silently sitting, holding up small signs that protest Trump’s policies and words.

Republicans cheered President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night. Democrats expressed their disapproval, both during the speech and afterwards.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump vowed to keep up his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” in reorienting the nation’s economy, immigration and foreign policy in an unyielding address before Congress that left Democratic legislators to register their dissent with stone faces, placards calling out “lies,” and one legislator’s ejection.



Trump’s prime-time speech Tuesday was the latest marker in his takeover of the nation’s capital, where the Republican-led House and Senate have done little to restrain the president as he and his allies work to slash the size of the federal government and remake America’s place in the world.



The president’s address, clocking in at a record 99 minutes, added up to a defiant sales pitch for the policies that Trump promised during his campaign and leaned into during his first weeks back in office. Trump pledged to keep delivering sweeping change to rescue the nation from what he described as destruction and mistakes left by his predecessor. He seldom addressed his comments directly to the American people, who are trying to keep up with the recent upheaval, while repeatedly needling the Democratic lawmakers seated before him.



Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response following Trump’s speech, allowed that “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.”



Emboldened after overcoming impeachments in his first term, outlasting criminal prosecutions in between his two administrations and getting a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress, Trump has embarked on a mission to dismantle parts of the federal government, remake the relationship with America’s allies and slap on tariffs that have sparked a North American trade war.



“It has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action,” Trump said of his opening weeks in office. “The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.”



Trump, who has billionaire adviser Elon Musk orchestrating his efforts to slash the size and scope of the federal government, said he is working to “reclaim democracy from this unaccountable bureaucracy” and threatened federal workers anew with firings if they resist his agenda.

Musk, who was seated in the House gallery, received a pair of standing ovations from Republicans in the chamber, as Trump exaggerated and shared false claims about alleged government abuse uncovered by the Tesla and SpaceX founder and his team of disrupters.



Trump repeated false claims that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, prompting some Democrats to shout, “Not true!” and “Those are lies!”



Trump spoke at a critical juncture in his presidency, as voters who returned him to the White House on his promise to fix inflation are instead finding economic chaos. All the gains the S&P 500 have made since Election Day are now gone, while consumer sentiment surveys show the public sees inflation as worsening. 



Trump seemed prepared to double down on his trade policies, which experts have warned will raise prices for consumers.



“Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,” Trump said. At the same time, he tried to ease concerns about the resulting price increases, saying, “There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that. It won’t be much.”



Trump said one of his “very highest priorities” was to rescue the economy and offer relief to working families. He promised to organize the federal government to lower costs on eggs and energy, blaming his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden for the situation and offering scant details of his own plans.



Trump also called for the extension of his first-term tax cuts and additional federal funding for his border crackdown, including for his promised efforts at “mass deportation” of people in the U.S. illegally. 



He celebrated his crackdown on migration, saying, “But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.”



Speaking about his promised tax cuts, Trump seemed to goad Democrats, saying: “I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office.”



The backdrop was the new economic uncertainty unleashed after the president opened the day by placing stiff tariffs on imports from the country’s neighbors and closest trading partners. A 25% tax on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday — ostensibly to secure greater cooperation to tackle fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration — triggering immediate retaliation and sparking fears of a wider trade war. Trump also raised tariffs on goods from China to 20%.

Republicans were boisterous as Trump stepped to the lectern in the House, chanting “USA! USA!” as the president basked in the cheers. The GOP lawmakers were jubilant, having won a trifecta of the White House, Senate and House in the elections. However, they face the challenging task of delivering on Trump’s agenda as well as avoiding a government shutdown later this month.



Across the aisle, out-of-power Democrats set the tone early, with most remaining seated without applauding or making eye contact with Trump as he was introduced in the chamber.



After several interruptions, House Speaker Mike Johnson jumped in and called for decorum to be restored in the chamber as Republicans shouted “USA” to drown out the cries from the other side of the aisle. Johnson then ordered Texas Rep. Al Green removed from the chamber.



“It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up” to Trump, Green told reporters after being thrown out of the chamber.

Other Democrats held up signs criticizing like “Save Medicaid” and “Protect Veterans” during Trump’s remarks, seeking to drive public awareness to elements of Trump’s agenda they believed might offer them a pathway back to the majority.



Some Democrats chose to highlight the impact of Trump’s actions by inviting fired federal workers as guests, including a disabled veteran from Arizona, a health worker from Maryland and a forestry employee who worked on wildfire prevention in California. 



Trump also used his speech to address his proposals for fostering peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, where he has unceremoniously upended the policies of the Biden administration in a matter of just weeks. On Monday, Trump ordered a freeze to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, ending years of staunch American support for the country in fending off Russia’s invasion. 



Trump recited a letter he received earlier Tuesday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the wartime president wants to come back to the table after a explosive Oval Office meeting last week broke down negotiations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. “We’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace,” Trump said. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?”



He also announced the arrest of a suspect in the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed U.S. troops during the withdrawal from Afghanistan.



Trump’s 1 hour and 39 minute speech was the longest annual address a president has ever delivered to Congress, breaking Bill Clinton’s record of 1 hour and 28 minutes. 



Watching from the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were guests including 15-year-old Elliston Berry, of Aledo, Texas, who was the victim of an explicit deepfake image sent to classmates.



Other White House guests included relatives of Corey Comperatore, the former Pennsylvania fire chief who was killed as he protected his family during an assassination attempt on Trump last summer.



Republican lawmakers cheered the conclusion of Trump’s address with chants that echoed his words after he was struck in the ear by a bullet: “Fight! Fight! Fight!”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump touted his newly imposed tariffs and basked in Republican applause for his administration's swift early actions, while he drew a wave of protests from Democrats as he spoke to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.

Leaning into culture wars, Trump inveighed against transgender rights, “they/them” pronouns and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed “insane and very dangerous open border policies” and offering little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.

“Wokeness is bad,” Trump said. “It’s gone.”

Congressional Democrats in the room heckled and disrupted Trump, demanding that he not cut Medicaid, waving an eclectic mix of signs to protest him and periodically shouting antagonistically at him.

Here are five takeaways from the speech — and how it sets up the rest of Trump's 2025.

Trump defended the sweeping 25% tariffs he imposed Tuesday on products from Canada and Mexico, saying “now it’s our turn” after other countries have levied them against the United States.

“It’s very unfair,” Trump said as scores of Republicans stood to applaud his tariffs, which he said “are about protecting the soul of our country.”

It's a sign of how Trump has transformed the traditionally pro-free trade GOP, though there is some unease in the party about the tariffs' effects on prices and the broader economy.

“There’ll be a little disturbance,” Trump added. “But we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” 

The tariffs sent stocks tumbling Tuesday, and some Democrats shouted “stock market!” as Trump spoke.

Trump also promised an economic revival and blamed ongoing problems like inflation and egg prices on Biden.

Trump spent significant time on issues from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.

Trump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year — specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals as they seek to pass a big party-line bill to advance core pieces of Trump's agenda. They are still seeking to find room for the trillions of dollars in tax breaks Trump has called for.

Trump also called for repealing the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that passed the Senate 64-33 and was signed by Biden in 2022.

“We should get rid of the Chip Act,” Trump said, referring to the law that invests in domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing.

Within minutes of Trump’s beginning, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, interrupted and heckled him, yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.” He was escorted out after he refused to stop shouting. There were other unintelligible shouts from Democrats during the speech. At another point, several Democratic members walked out in protest.

A group of House Democrats waved signs that read “MUSK STEALS,” “SAVE MEDICAID” and “PROTECT VETERANS.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought a whiteboard and wrote different messages on it through Trump’s speech, including “NO KING” and “LIES.”

Some Democrats laughed out loud when Trump said the era of rule by “unelected bureaucrats” is over, and they pointed at Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who watched from the gallery.

Other Democrats skipped the speech entirely, including Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, who wants to lead his party’s strategy, and Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and the recent former Senate president pro tempore.

The top three Democratic leaders in each chamber attended. They, like most others in the party, sat quietly and listened without disrupting Trump’s remarks, as Democrats work through their loss last year and how best to advance their agenda and oppose Trump's in 2025 and beyond.

It has been months since Trump played to the crowd at one of his signature political rallies. He got a hero’s welcome and a standing ovation from Republicans in the Capitol, who regularly leaped to their feet to applaud him.

As Trump said he is waging the “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history” and touted actions he has taken, the GOP side of the aisle erupted into chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump.”

Trump had no olive branch to offer his opponents, instead needling Democrats at the beginning of his speech, saying there was nothing he could say that would make them clap or smile — and later blasting “radical left lunatics” whom he called weak on crime. In response, some Democrats yelled, “January 6th!” referring to Trump’s pardons of rioters who stormed the Capitol, some of whom attacked police officers.

Biden offered during his first address to Congress to team up on “bipartisan” goals — a word he used multiple times in 2021 — like infrastructure, cancer research and access to education.

Trump, meanwhile, chided Democrats early in his speech for refusing to give him enough. He set the tone early by calling Biden “the worst president in American history” and played to a longtime presidential tradition: blaming his predecessor for problems facing the country.

“Everybody here — even this side — I appreciate you,” Trump quipped, drawing laughter from the GOP side of the aisle.

A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans and packing in applause lines in Trump’s address.

The return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention. But Trump didn’t delve much deeper into the broader issues facing Israel, its current ceasefire agreement with Hamas or the rebuilding of Gaza, about which he has repeatedly posted on social media.

As the GOP’s budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid — a major part of the federal budget that could be a target for changes — or health care generally, beyond a brief endorsement of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

And while Elon Musk got a shoutout and Trump listed off spending the Department of Government Efficiency was seeking to cut, Trump didn’t delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public. He did note that federal workers have been ordered to return to in-person work or be fired, and broadly, Trump said his “administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy” of “hundreds of thousands” of federal workers who he said haven’t been showing up.

Trump also appeared to ignore the looming government shutdown next Friday, which congressional leaders are struggling to avoid.

Trump lamented the billions of dollars the United States has spent to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s incursion, drawing ironic and extended applause from Democrats who support the military and economic assistance.

“You want to keep it going for another five years?” Trump asked.

“Pocahontas says yes,” he said, using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., which prompted numerous Democrats to walk out of the chamber.

Trump also kept up his calls to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland into U.S. control.

“We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama. We’re taking it back,” Trump said of the Panama Canal.

“We need Greenland for national security and international security,” he continued, calling it a “very, very large piece of land.”

“I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” he said as Republicans applauded and laughed.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news,"US pauses intelligence sharing with Ukraine, national security adviser says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygxvvrd8do,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:27:29 GMT","

The US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine, the White House national security adviser has said.

When asked whether intelligence sharing had been put on hold along with military aid, Mike Waltz told reporters on Wednesday: ""We have, we have taken a step back.""

He added that the administration was reviewing all aspects of its intelligence relationship with Kyiv.

The US has shared intelligence with Ukraine since the early stages of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

It paused military aid to Kyiv on Monday following a dramatic breakdown in relations in the Oval Office last week, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was told to leave after an angry meeting with US President Donald Trump.

It remains unclear if the intelligence sharing pause is partial or complete, and how long it will remain in effect. The move was first reported by the Financial Times.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe also appeared to confirm the decision in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday, saying Trump ""had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said 'let's pause I want to give you a chance to think about that'.""

He said the response came swiftly with Zelensky's statement saying he was ready for peace.

Ratcliffe then added: ""On the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, will go away and we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine.""

Waltz also suggested a more conciliatory tone was emerging between the US and Ukraine, adding that the military aid and intelligence sharing pause could be lifted in the near future.

""I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,"" he told Fox News.

He also said he had ""good talks"" with his Ukrainian counterpart about the location and substance of potential negotiations, adding there will be movement in ""very short order"".

Ukraine has heavily relied on the US for military assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, and the decision to pause aid may have a significant effect on the war. 

Halting intelligence support, too, would likely have serious consequences on the battlefield.

The information is believed to help Ukraine both strategically understand Moscow's next moves and also tactically, for example providing information on Russian troop positions for weapons guidance and targeting.

Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC that cutting off intelligence to Ukraine ""will have an immediate impact"" on its ability to defend itself.

""There is no way to replace the capabilities that the US intelligence can provide from our European allies,"" he said. 

""This will likely inspire Russia to push harder on their efforts to take more terrain from Ukraine and away from the negotiating table.""

Ten Chinese hackers have been charged alongside two Chinese law enforcement officers in a global hacking campaign that targeted dissidents, news organizations and U.S. agencies, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.

The hacking by workers of I-Soon was done in some cases at the direction of China's Ministry of Public Security, which received the stolen information and selected targets for the intrusions as part of what U.S. officials say was a massive intelligence-gathering operation.

Among the targets of the hacking was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year.

I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an Associated Press investigation last year, of private hacking contractors are companies that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada’s efforts to tighten security at the border are “not good enough,” a day after triggering a North American trade war.

Trump spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday and the two leaders discussed “trade and fentanyl,” according to a readout from the Prime Minister’s Office.

“Both countries will continue to be in contact today,” the readout adds.

All eyes are on Washington after Trump slapped a sweeping 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods.

Trump said in a post Wednesday on his Truth Social platform that Trudeau called to ask him what can be done about the tariffs.

“I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped,” Trump wrote.

“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!”

Trump went on to write in another post he told Trudeau that he largely caused the problems the U.S. has with Canada because of his “weak border policies.”

In response to the U.S. tariffs, Canada is imposing an immediate 25 per cent tariff on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with additional tariffs on another $125 billion in American goods to follow three weeks later.

Trump has repeatedly cited the flow of fentanyl as the reason for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. At a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau said that excuse was “completely bogus.”

“So we actually have to fold back on the one thing he has said repeatedly — that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us, is the second half of his thought.”

Trudeau met with premiers virtually on Tuesday to discuss the “unjustified” tariffs and Canada’s response, according to a readout from his office.

“The Prime Minister and the premiers denounced the U.S.’ decision to impose unjustified tariffs and committed to stand united against this economic threat,” the readout said.

“They underscored that tariffs would weaken both of our countries, put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk, and make life less affordable for both Canadians and Americans alike.”

Canadian provinces have swiftly responded to the U.S. tariffs, announcing a range of retaliatory measures on Tuesday.

According to the PMO, Ottawa will soon announce an initial support package to reduce the impact of U.S. tariffs on Canadian workers, families and businesses.

“First Ministers also discussed progress to reduce barriers to internal trade and labour mobility within Canada,” the readout said.

Meanwhile, Ottawa has requested consultations with Washington on Trump’s tariffs at the World Trade Organization, Canada’s ambassador to the WTO in Geneva said.

“The U.S. decision leaves us with no choice but to respond to protect Canadian interests,” Ambassador Nadia Theodore said in a statement posted on LinkedIn.

Business groups in Canada have raised concerns about the impact of the trade war and economists are warning that the Canadian economy is poised to plunge into a recession this year if the U.S. tariffs remain in place.

“No one wins in a trade war and the tariffs imposed today by the Trump Administration will hurt workers, farmers and families across North America — especially those in the United States,” Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said in a statement Tuesday.

Liberal MP John McKay, co-chair of the Canada-U.S. interparliamentary group, is in Washington, D.C., meeting with lawmakers Wednesday.

In an interview with Global News, McKay said: “It’s very difficult to know how to move forward” on the tariff tensions.

“It is .. a function of, ‘You poke me in the eye, then I poke you in the eye,’ and then back and forth, and we both end up blind,” he said.

“It doesn’t make any sense. And indeed, even with the Republicans, they can’t give you a coherent explanation of what Mr. Trump is trying to do.”

The U.S. move has angered many Canadians, with “elbows up” becoming a rallying cry online and on the streets.

Tariff tensions have also given rise to a “buy Canadian” movement in recent weeks, with consumers ditching U.S. products for local ones and businesses giving more prominence to local options.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she is expecting to speak with Trump on Thursday, but said on Wednesday if tariffs continue following that call, Mexico “will reach out to Canada and other nations.”

“It is a very definitive moment for Mexico,” Sheinbaum said. “Our economy is fine, but there will be no submission. … Depending on the circumstances, we will look to Canada and other countries.”

Trump may announce a deal on Wednesday with the two countries and meet them “in the middle,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday.

“Both the Mexicans and the Canadians were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better, and the president is listening because he’s very, very fair and very reasonable,” Lutnick said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday.

“So I think he’s going to work something out with them.

“It’s not going to be a pause. None of that pause stuff. But I think he’s going to figure out, ‘You do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle someway,’ and we’re going to probably be announcing that tomorrow.”

A day into Donald Trump's North American trade war, the U.S. president remained adamant that tariffs would benefit America even as a key member of his team has floated that a compromise could materialize Wednesday.

Trump addressed a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, for the first time since he returned to office in January, by making a case for his massive tariff agenda. 

""We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth and we will not let that happen any longer,"" Trump told lawmakers in Washington.

The president's executive order hitting Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent across-the-board tariffs, with a lower 10 per cent levy on Canadian energy, took effect Tuesday. 

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the continental trade war ""dumb"" and said Canada was forced to push back. He framed Trump's ultimate tariff goal as ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.""




Ottawa introduced immediate 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of American products, which will expand to cover another $125 billion in U.S. goods in 21 days.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government would announce duties on targeted products and other measures Sunday. She said ""there is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations.""

The tariffs caused immediate market turbulence as many business and industry groups condemned devastating duties against America's closest neighbours. 

Clips of Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatening to cut off electricity to the United States played repeatedly on U.S. TV stations. Images and video of American liquor being pulled off the shelves in Canadian stores signalled what could come if Trump continued his trade war path. 




Minutes after the U.S. stock market closed, following a second day of sharp decline, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said there could be a ramp off the devastating duties. Lutnick told Fox Business that the government was looking to ""work something out"" in a deal that could be announced on Wednesday. 

""It's not going to be a pause. None of that pause stuff,"" he said. ""Somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome.""

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc spoke with Lutnick on Tuesday but Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told CBC News she had not heard about any ""middle"" deal. Joly was to speak with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

It was unclear what Trump would consider as a concession. 

Lutnick tied the deal to the Canada-U.S.-Mexico agreement, which was negotiated under the first Trump administration to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. 




Trump has previously connected duties to wide-ranging complaints from defence spending to trade deficits. Trump has repeatedly claimed he wants to make Canada a U.S. state.

Lutnick's comments give additional credence to Canadian officials' supposition that tariffs are not actually connected to the flow of deadly fentanyl over the border -- the legal backing Trump is using for the duties. U.S Customs and Border Protection data shows the volume of drugs crossing from Canada into the United States is minuscule compared to Mexico.

""We think it's a bogus argument,"" Joly said. 

Tuesday was the first big test of how the markets would react to Trump's massive trade agenda — and it could signal how the president moves forward in his plan to upend global trade. 




Trump also ordered 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States on March 12, which the White House has confirmed would stack on top of the other duties imposed on Canada.

Trump signed an executive order to implement ""reciprocal tariffs"" starting April 2. Other tariff targets include automobiles, copper, lumber and agricultural products.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said President Donald Trump is considering a deal that would offer exemptions from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, including potentially for carmakers.

The possibility of a rollback, which he said could be announced on Wednesday, came as many US businesses raised concerns about Trump's decision to hit US imports from its two closest trade partners with a 25% import tax. 

After two days of declines, the main US stock indexes were trading slightly higher early on Wednesday. 

Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly told the BBC's Newsnight on Tuesday that her office had not been contacted about any plans around reducing tariffs.

US officials ""can say many things"" but ""the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump,"" Joly said.

The US president used a large part of his speech to Congress on Tuesday to outline his trade policies, but he did not say whether he planned to cut the tariffs that came into effect this week.

Canada and Mexico announced retaliatory import levies on the US after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday.

Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.

Trump says he wants to protect American industry and boost manufacturing, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.

On Wednesday, Lutnick said tariffs would be in place, but suggested some goods could be ""left out"".

""There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2,"" Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday. 

""It will be 25% but there will be some categories left out - it could well be autos. It could be others as well,"" he added.

A day earlier on Fox News, Lutnick had raised the possibility of a compromise and reduction of tariffs for Mexico and Canada, saying Trump was weighing offers to meet his allies ""in the middle"". 

Trump has said he would move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has slammed Trump's sweeping tariffs on his country, calling it a ""very dumb thing to do"" and vowed to conduct a ""relentless fight"" to protect its economy.

Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.

But Trump pushed even further in a post on his Truth Social platform, saying: ""Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!""

Trudeau accused the US president of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us"".

""That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state,"" he told reporters.

Washington also ramped up its trade war with Beijing on Tuesday as a new 10% levy on Chinese imports that came into effect - which adds to existing levies from Trump's first term and those announced last month.

""China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war,"" a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said after their country announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.

The man allegedly swallowed two pairs of earrings worth $769,500 (£597,000) hoping to avoid being charged with theft.

Israel was consulted prior to the talks, according to the White House, after reports said the two sides were discussing the release of hostages.

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



With Wall Street focused on the impact of July's global IT outage on customer contract renewals, CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) delivered fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates. The cybersecurity firm's fiscal 2026 sales and profitability outlook for CrowdStrike stock underwhelmed.

The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based cybersecurity firm reported January-ended quarterly earnings after the market close on Tuesday.

CrowdStrike earnings climbed 8% to $1.03 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue, including acquisitions, rose 25% to $1.06 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $1.035 billion.

With CrowdStrike, Wall Street analysts focus on annual recurring revenue, or ARR. It's a key financial metric tied to subscription services growth. Analysts have lowered estimates for ""net new"" ARR amid expectations that many customers will seek price discounts when renewing contracts to help cover the cost of business disruptions. A software upgrade caused the IT outage.

In Q4, total ARR increased 23% to $4.24 billion. Analysts had predicted total ARR of $4.21 billion. But net new ARR fell 20% to $224.3 million.

""CrowdStrike put up strong Q4 results with $224 million in net new ARR coming in ahead of expectations, but offering little in the way of clarity into the timing or magnitude of a second half (fiscal 2026) reacceleration,"" said UBS analyst Roger Boyd in a report. ""In addition, while the revenue guidance for 21% year-over-year growth was ahead of consensus, the outlook for margins was below expectations, with CrowdStrike guiding to 20% operating margin.""

For fiscal 2026, which starts with the current quarter ending in April, CrowdStrike predicted revenue in a range of $4.744 billion to $4.805 billion vs. estimates for $4.768 billion.

CrowdStrike said it expects adjusted EPS of $3.39 at the midpoint of guidance, well below estimates of $4.40. CrowdStrike plans higher investments in marketing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Higher taxes also will impact profitability

Also, CrowdStrike did not provide an outlook for total ARR versus estimates of $5.058 billion.

At William Blair, analyst Jonathan Ho noted that CrowdStrike management said it no longer is offering customers perks related to the IT outage.

""Guidance for revenue was offered only slightly above the consensus for 2026 with pro forma EPS guidance well below, due primarily to tax rate and incremental investments,"" Ho said in a report. ""Fiscal 2026 is expected to be back-end loaded from an ARR perspective as customer commitment package — related revenue is expected to be renewed, but it is unclear at what levels.""

He added: ""CrowdStrike has been clear that it expects the business to accelerate in the back half of the year as it converts CCP-free products to be paid.""

At Jefferies, analyst Joseph Gallo said in a report: ""While risk remains on whether customers actually pay for free modules eventually, we have confidence in CrowdStrike's market position driving a fiscal second half 2026 net new ARR re-acceleration.""

On the stock market today, CrowdStrike stock fell 7.5% to near 361 in early trading. Heading into the CrowdStrike earnings report, shares were up 15% in 2025.

""The company changed the accounting of employee payroll related to stock based compensation, hiding another 500 to 600 basis points of operating mrgin pressure, but management noted it now uses the same accounting practices as peers,"" said Bank of America analyst Tal Liani in a report. ""Similar to other software vendors and to Zscaler (ZS), management raised the assumed tax rate from about 5% to 22.5% to account for full taxes post historical loss credits.""

Further, CrowdStrike recently said its sales through Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com (AMZN), had surpassed $1 billion in 2024.

CrowdStrike competes with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), SentinelOne (S), Microsoft (MSFT) and others in the ""endpoint"" market. Endpoint security tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.

Also, CrowdStrike is building a broad, threat-detection cybersecurity platform called XDR, which stands for extended detection and response. It monitors endpoints as well as web/email gateways, web application firewalls and cloud business workloads.

The data-driven news brand 538 will be shuttered in the cuts.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	The Walt Disney Co. is slashing just under 200 jobs at ABC News and at its Disney Entertainment Networks division as the traditional TV business continues to face economic headwinds, a source familiar with the decision tells The Hollywood Reporter. The cuts represented about 6 percent of the division’s workforce.


	ABC News will be hit particularly hard, with the data-driven digital news brand 538 being shuttered, teams from Nightline and 20/20 being consolidated, and all three hours of Good Morning America moving under the same top producer, Simone Swink. The company is also merging its digital and social operations.

	











	Disney’s entertainment networks will see cuts in program planning and scheduling, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the cuts there. Disney’s channels include FX and Freeform. The newsletter Status first reported the looming cuts at ABC News.

	ABC News last saw job cuts last fall, when around 75 jobs were eliminated. The news division had announced Almin Karamehmedovic as its president last August.


	Broadcast news divisions in general are grappling with the changing economics of TV, with structures increasingly consolidated in divisions alongside local TV stations, and the role of network news president being a smaller role than it was in they heyday of TV. Disney writ large announced structure-driven job cuts last September.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news,Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lpjqg2mp5o,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:08:30 GMT","

The chancellor has earmarked several billion pounds in draft spending cuts to welfare and other government departments ahead of the Spring Statement.

The Treasury will put the proposed cuts to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Wednesday amid expectations the chancellor's financial buffer has been wiped out.

Sources said ""the world has changed"" since Rachel Reeves's Budget last October, when the OBR indicated she had £9.9bn available to spend against her self-imposed borrowing rules.

The OBR's forecast is likely to see that disappear because of global factors such as trade tariffs, as well as higher inflation and borrowing costs in the UK.

The Treasury will on Wednesday inform the OBR of its ""major measures"" -essentially changes to tax and spending in order to meet the chancellor's self-imposed rules on borrowing money.

The government has committed to get debt falling as a share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, and to only borrow to fund investment, not to cover day-to-day spending.

Such rules, put in place by most governments in wealthy nations, are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are ""non-negotiable"".

The spending cuts drafted by the Treasury will help plug the gap that has emerged in recent months, ahead of the OBR publishing its forecast and Reeves giving a statement on 26 March.

The Treasury has blamed several global factors, including trade tariffs and the war in Ukraine for pushing up government borrowing costs. 

""Clearly the world has changed a lot since the autumn Budget. People are watching that change happen before their eyes,"" a government insider told the BBC.

""The Office for Budget Responsibility will reflect that changing world in its forecasts later this month and a changing world will be a core feature of the chancellor's response later this month.""

Insiders expect ""politically painful"" new welfare cuts that are designed to reduce the huge growth in health-related benefits, which will be outlined in a forthcoming speech from Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.

Asked on Wednesday if welfare cuts were the right approach, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a ""huge rise in the welfare budget"" and there were ""too many"" young people not in work, education or training.

""There's a moral case here for making sure that people who can work are able to work and there's a practical point here as well, because our current situation is unsustainable,"" she added.

Reeves has previously pledged ""fundamental"" reform of the welfare system, with concerns over rising spending on health-related benefits.

Last year, the government spent £65bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the Covid pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around £100bn before the next general election.

Some of that is a legacy of Covid, but ministers have complained about incentives which encourage some to ""game the system"". 

People on universal credit must show evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.

Steve Wright, Fire Brigades Union general secretary, said any welfare cuts ""would be an outrageous attack on the poorest and most vulnerable"".

The chancellor will argue she hasn't changed her plans and that the government was always going to ""fix welfare to get people back to work"" and ""make the NHS more productive"".

""Headroom or no headroom, the chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous, with the whole government making that argument in the coming weeks,"" an insider told the BBC.

This week, US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on its three biggest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China. 

Trump has indicated that the UK could avoid border taxes, but Reeves has told the BBC that even if the UK is not hit by tariffs, a global trade war would lower growth and raise inflation.

Uncertainty over the war in Ukraine also remains, with the UK deciding to boost defence spending by cutting international aid.

In the run-up to the Spring Statement, Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden and Health Secretary Wes Streeting will also outline a significant efficiency drive within the civil service, which they hope will lead to significant headcount and cost savings.

It is understood that the euro area economy stagnating and lower UK productivity numbers have affected the OBR's forecast.

But there have also been concerns raised about the impact of Reeves's previously announced tax rises on businesses, which are set to take effect in April, on the UK economy. 

Inflation, which measures the rate of price rises over time, is expected to rise in the coming months as households are hit with increases to energy, water and council tax bills.

February marked the 100th anniversary of The Fisher Companies, a family-owned group of businesses that has grown from humble beginnings into a diversified, multi-million-dollar enterprise. 

Founded by Ralph and Zelda Fisher in 1925, the company’s journey is rooted in the principles of hard work, determination, unwavering faith, and community — values that continue to drive the company forward as it enters its second century.

""Looking back over the past century, we are incredibly proud of how far we've come,"" said J.W. Fisher, president of Fisher Contracting. ""Our continued success is a testament to the vision of my grandparents, Ralph and Zelda Fisher, and to the dedication of every person who has contributed to this journey. As we celebrate 100 years, we are more committed than ever to upholding the values that made our company strong and we’re looking forward to the next century of growth and innovation.”

What began as a small sand and gravel operation in Midland has evolved into a diverse group of companies, covering a wide-range of industries and geographic regions. Today, The Fisher Companies span multiple sectors, including heavy civil contracting, concrete, asphalt, heavy haul transportation, aggregate production, diesel engine systems, freshwater ports, and even a championship golf course.

With operations now extending across the Midwest and the Southeast, The Fisher Companies are still managed by the third and fourth generations of the Fisher family. 

To celebrate this milestone, The Fisher Companies have planned a year-long series of events and initiatives, including:

President Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners — and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods. 

The U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%. 

Businesses ranging from automakers to alcohol producers have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy. While some companies will look to source their goods from other countries or move production to the U.S., those moves could take years. 

In the meantime, companies have said they will have to pay the tariffs and then pick from two options: either pass the added costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorb the fees and either cut costs elsewhere or take lower profits. 

On Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month, which includes products such as electronics, footwear, medicines and cosmetics. Those tariffs are in addition to tariffs already put in place during Trump's first term in office.

Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.

Late Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. In an appearance on Fox Business News, Lutnick said an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree could come as soon as Wednesday.

""The Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better,"" Lutnick said. ""And the president is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable. So I think he's going to work something out with them.""

Lutnick continued: ""It's not going to be a pause, that pause stuff, but I think he's going to figure out you do more, and I'll meet you in the middle some way, and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow. So somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way.""

The move risks a tit-for-tat trade war with Mexico, Canada and China that could hurt U.S. businesses selling their products to those countries and upended one of the signature deals of Trump's first term: the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

That agreement, which Trump touted at the time as a negotiating victory, largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, similar to how they had for decades under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. Under the terms of the deal, the agreement wasn’t supposed to be up for renegotiation until July 2026, but Trump’s move to impose new tariffs could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday. In a news conference, she said the action would include ""tariff and nontariff measures."" Sheinbaum also said that Mexico had already taken steps during the past month to crack down on drug gangs and trafficking flows.

Canada will move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) of American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled. Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee, will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn.

""We don't want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don't want to see you hurt, either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,"" Trudeau said at a news conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people. 

Then, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: ""Even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.""

He noted that even though less than 1% of fentanyl seized by the U.S. is coming across the Canadian border, the country has been taking action to further crackdown on the illegal drug trade. As a result, Trudeau said there was a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, ""to a near zero low of less than half an ounce seized in January."" 

China said it will impose additional tariffs on U.S. goods March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. China said that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.

“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.

Trump had previously threatened to place a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 before saying he was delaying those tariffs for a month, after the leaders of the two countries said they would be stepping up security at their borders. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to negotiate on the new import duties.

Economists across the political spectrum have warned that the tariffs, which are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods, would increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Stocks fell nearly 2% Monday, the worst day since December. 

“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy,” Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement Monday. “Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.”

Automakers are among the industries that will feel the greatest impact from the tariffs, since vehicles and their components cross between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico multiple times during the production process. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers. 

“Let’s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,” Farley said at an investor conference last month.

The tariffs could add as much as $12,000 to the price of a new car, according to a report from the Anderson Economic Group. The American Automotive Policy Council,  the industry association representing GM, Ford and Stellantis, said they believe their vehicles and parts that meet the tariff-free requirements under the previously negotiated trade deal during Trump’s first term should be exempt from the tariffs.

“Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the association, said in a statement.

The Aluminum Association, which represents aluminum production and jobs in the U.S., said in February that the U.S. sources two-thirds of the primary aluminum it uses every year from Canada and about 90% of scrap metal from either Canada or Mexico. It added that U.S.-based smelters, even at full capacity, “cannot produce nearly enough metal to meet demand.” 

The tariffs could also contribute to higher grocery prices since Mexico is one of the top suppliers to the U.S. of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years — an issue Trump pledged to tackle on the campaign trail. 

The tariffs could also increase the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico and Canada and hurt sales of U.S. spirits sold in those countries. The Distilled Spirits Council estimates that a 25% tariff on distilled spirits imports from Mexico and Canada could lead to a loss of more than 31,000 U.S. jobs. In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, as well as $622 million worth of Canadian spirits, according to the association. 

“Tariffs on spirits products from Canada and Mexico will jeopardize the industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy,” the group said in a statement. “The North American spirits sector is highly interconnected and, as a result, tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey will harm U.S. spirits companies that have these products in their brand portfolios.”   

Trump has indicated that further tariffs will be on the way. He reiterated Monday that previously announced “reciprocal” tariffs would be coming April 2, and that tariffs on “external product” from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.

Last month, Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States from all countries, and raised his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.

Trump has repeatedly cited tariffs as a tool he can use to raise revenue to pay for other domestic spending priorities and as a measure to pressure companies to relocate production to the U.S.

Premium Lite will cost $7.99 per month and include ""most"" videos in key genres.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


YouTube is launching a less expensive tier of its “Premium” subscription service in the U.S., as the Google-owned video platform says that it now has more than 125 million subscribers to its YouTube Premium and YouTube Music services.


	The company announced the updates Wednesday.




	The new tier is called Premium Lite, and will cost $7.99 per month (compared to $13.99 per month for Premium). It will allow subscribers to watch “most videos” on YouTube ad-free, with a particular emphasis on genres like gaming, fashion, news, and beauty creators. Music content and Shorts will be where users see the most ads.

	At the same time, Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of music, revealed that YouTube Premium and YouTube Music have a combined 125 million subscribers: “An incredible milestone that many laughed off as impossible when we first launched,” he wrote in his annual letter, released Wednesday. “This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there. This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there.”


	YouTube announced that it had hit 100 million Premium and Music subscribers a year ago. It also revealed that its YouTube TV service passed 8 million subscribers.


	The new less expensive Premium tier is likely to further drive total subscribers.


	Cohen also used his letter to tease what he sees coming, including increased use of AI tools, and what he calls “the rebirth of the music video.”


	To hear Cohen explain it, YouTube is the new MTV, the place where culture-defining artists drop their latest work, or where new artists can be discovered.


	“As I look forward, I’m foreseeing a renaissance of the music video,” he wrote. “It’s not about having the biggest production budget; it’s about sharing authentic hero content that music fans can’t unsee. It’s about using the artist’s most influential asset – the music video – and cutting through the tidal wave of clutter and choice. Think about the iconic music videos that have shaped our culture. These weren’t simply videos; they were cultural moments. And they didn’t just break songs – they broke artists.”

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) and TWG Global (TWG) today announced a joint venture to redefine AI deployment in banking, investment management, insurance and other financial services. By pairing Palantir’s unmatched AI infrastructure with TWG’s deep expertise in business operations and financial services, this initiative will enable financial institutions to integrate AI at scale—moving beyond fragmented, piecemeal solutions to a singular, fully embedded, enterprise-wide approach.





Led by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and TWG Global’s Mark Walter, Thomas Tull, and Chief Data & Analytics Officer Drew Cukor—the joint venture brings together a team with a deeply established history of collaboration, spanning over two decades in deploying AI at scale across high-stakes defense, government, and commercial applications. Over the past year, TWG and Palantir have actively worked together to embed AI into TWG’s own companies, refining their approach and proving its impact. This is the next step in that effort—a battle-tested, operational AI offering designed to revolutionize financial services and insurance and accelerate industry-wide adoption.



“Palantir is proud to partner with TWG Global to further seamlessly weave AI into the fabric of financial services and help forward-looking companies unlock enormous opportunity,"" said Alex Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies. ""By combining TWG's deep industry expertise with Palantir's world-leading software, we are empowering businesses to not just navigate today's complex global market, but to position themselves for dominance in it by remaining at the forefront of the AI revolution.”



More than a mere partnership, this initiative represents a fundamental rethinking of AI’s role in business—moving beyond a tool managed by IT teams to an “artificial workforce” integrated into every core function. Leaders who understand strategy, human capital, and operational impact must take ownership of AI—not as a side project, but as the backbone of their business’s growth and resilience. This isn’t optional. As industries shift at an unprecedented pace, AI is the defining factor of who leads and who falls behind in the next era of global competitiveness.



“AI is no longer an add-on—it’s woven into the fabric of every decision, every process, and every outcome, delivering tomorrow’s competitive advantage,"" said Tull. “From Wall Street to the Pentagon, AI is already reshaping industries. But what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity. Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will find themselves outpaced by those that do.”



This full-scale AI solution embeds intelligence across every core function of financial institutions and insurance companies—from compliance and customer growth to operational efficiency, fraud detection, risk monitoring, credit and lending, and capital optimization. Unlike fragmented AI tools, this holistic program drives real business impact by mitigating risk, reshoring capabilities, adapting to shifting labor dynamics, and future-proofing banks and insurers against market volatility and regulatory pressures.



Drew Cukor, TWG Global’s Head of Data and Analytics (former Head of AI Transformation at JPMorgan and Head of the Pentagon’s Project Maven), brings a track record of introducing AI to some of the world’s most complex organizations. At the Pentagon’s Project Maven, he helped shape AI-driven defense capabilities, and later at JPMorgan Chase, he scaled AI solutions across financial operations, integrating machine learning into one of the most intricate banking systems globally and resulting in JPMorgan being recognized as the top-rated bank in AI globally for three consecutive years.



“AI is fundamentally reshaping the workforce—changing who does what and how effective employees can be. It’s not just something to add to a company’s tech stack; it requires a complete shift in how businesses operate,” said Cukor. “That’s why we’ve redefined AI as a management and business process issue, not just a technical deployment. The real question isn’t whether to adopt AI, but who should own and lead its implementation.”



“Encouraging the deployment of emerging technology within our portfolio businesses is at the core of our investment strategy,” said Walter. “By expanding our model beyond our own portfolio, we’re ensuring that companies remain at the forefront of global competitiveness. This is just the beginning, and we’re excited to use this partnership to redefine the future of financial services.

The owner of brands like A&E, History and Lifetime wants to shift its focus to its studios and content, rather than its TV channels.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	A+E Networks is rebranding as it seeks to shift focus away from its pay-TV business and toward its burgeoning studios, digital and content creation divisions.


	Going forward, the company will operate as A+E Global Media, with its ad sales division now called A+E Media Solutions. While A+E Networks still operates pay-TV channels like A&E, Lifetime, and History, the company has leaned into its studios business and digital efforts in recent years, including aggressive licensing deals for its owned programs, and launching both FAST and YouTube channels based on its brands.

	“The name A+E Global Media reflects who we are today – an innovative, multiplatform content engine that reaches audiences everywhere,” says Paul Buccieri, president and chairman of A+E Global Media. “We are powered by our borderless storytelling and worldwide consumption that has no limits. With a vast portfolio of premium brands, cutting-edge studios, and world-class talent, we create compelling narratives that deeply engage viewers across every screen and platform. As we expand our global footprint, our focus remains on delivering exceptional storytelling that resonates across cultures and connects with audiences in meaningful ways.”


	In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, A+E president of media solutions Toby Byrne says that the new corporate brand “just better reflects who we are now, who we’ve been recently, as well as very much who we’re going to be going forward: A multi-platform company that’s a global provider of entertainment content.”


	“I think it’s a great time to change the name. The company as a whole is very forward thinking, data driven, and has a digital mindset,” Byrne adds. “And certainly our team is very solutions oriented as well. When you consider all that, it just felt like A+E Networks was a name for what the company used to be and not what the company is now.”


	Last month A+E launched a dedicated digital division that would encompass all of its digital video content and platforms, as part of a larger bid to diversify its business lines. The company is one of the largest pay-TV companies without any sports in its portfolio, and it is trying to lean more on the production and distribution side of the business as cord-cutting continues to erode the traditional business models.

	











	“We bring the lens of a multi-platform approach with our total distribution,” Byrne says. “Cable networks are one part of our distribution. They don’t represent anywhere near the entirety of what the addition of our multi-platform digital endpoints provide – a really important element of our total reach.”


	“You’ve got much larger platforms and larger media companies, all of them have sports. And we’re really the largest entertainment company,” Byrne adds. “We have high quality content that is a trusted environment that we continue to invest in year after year. We have innovative solutions that we can provide and flexibility around how we do business, and we are an efficient option compared to many of the other assets in the marketplace.”


	Byrne also framed History content as something that complements sports ad buys in terms of audience overlap.


	The announcement from A+E (which is jointly owned by The Walt Disney Co. and Hearst) was connected to the company’s annual upfront presentation, which it delivered in a virtual format Wednesday.


	The company typically announces a stacked slate of programming with recognizable names both in front of and behind the camera. Among the shows it announced are History programs hosted by David Duchovny, Ving Rhames and Henry Winkler, an American Pickers spinoff History’s Greatest Picks, led by Mike Wolfe; at Lifetime, the company unveiled a development deal with Tyler Perry Studios and Pantheon Media Group, and announced a docuseries on the Judd family; and at A&E, new season orders for Storage Wars and the WWE programs LFG and WWE’s Greatest Moments.

Virginia Acquisition Grows Penzance’s Industrial Portfolio


WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Penzance, a leading owner, operator, developer and investor in the Mid-Atlantic region, announced today the acquisition of Gateway & Linden, a six-building industrial portfolio totaling 212,086 square feet in Manassas, Virginia. The $55 million acquisition, completed this month, adds to Penzance’s growing industrial portfolio and reinforces its commitment to strategic investment across commercial real estate asset classes.





Gateway & Linden, acquired from a partnership owned by Davin Holdings and The Davis Companies, consists of two industrial flex parks:



Lauren Kowall, Senior Vice President of Investments at Penzance, said, “This acquisition aligns with our strategy to expand in high-demand industrial markets and capitalize on our in-house expertise to drive long-term value. In this supply-constrained Northern Virginia market, high-quality industrial flex assets like these are becoming increasingly scarce, making this a particularly valuable addition to our portfolio.”



The Gateway & Linden portfolio presented a compelling investment opportunity for Penzance due to its prime location in Manassas, a high-demand industrial submarket with strong regional connectivity. The property is strategically located in the Route 29/I-66 corridor, offering direct access to Interstate 66, Prince William Parkway, and Balls Ford Road, enabling seamless and efficient distribution throughout the D.C. metro area. Its location within Prince William County also positions it to serve warehouse users supporting the data center industry, where over 8.5 million square feet of data center currently exists, which is projected to increase to 80 million square feet over the next decade, further enhancing its long-term value.



Penzance aims to lease current and upcoming vacancies ranging between 6,000 and 33,000 square feet, as well as convert office-heavy suites to industrial use by raising dropped ceilings and adding dock doors. Penzance’s in-house property management team will oversee operations, driving efficiencies and value creation.



Working closely alongside the Penzance team, JLL's Metro DC Industrial Team has been selected to spearhead the leasing efforts for the project. Leveraging their extensive market knowledge and proven track record in the industrial sector, the team will be responsible for marketing the property and securing blue chip tenants.



Dan Coats, senior managing director at JLL, added, ""We are thrilled to partner with such a dedicated and hands-on local owner. Penzance’s commitment to the community aligns perfectly with our approach to delivering tailored, high-touch solutions. Together, we look forward to bringing these exceptional properties to market and creating value for both the ownership and future tenants.""



This acquisition expands Penzance’s industrial portfolio and strengthens its growing industrial development pipeline. JLL’s Mid-Atlantic Capital Markets team, including Bill Prutting, Craig Childs and Chris Dale served as the sole advisors on the sale transaction.



Bill Prutting, senior managing director of Capital Markets, said, “JLL is tracking over 7 million square feet of industrial tenant displacement driven primarily by data centers. Given this trend, the Gateway & Linden portfolio is exceptionally well-positioned. It's poised to retain current tenants who already supply goods and services to data centers, while also attracting new tenants ready to meet market rental rates in Manassas.”

UFC CEO Dana White and WWE president Nick Khan inked the deal Wednesday.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


TKO is officially in the boxing business.


	The owner of UFC and WWE said Wednesday that it had inked a deal with HE Turki Alalshikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, which it describes as “a multi-year partnership to establish a new boxing promotion that will provide a premier platform for both leading boxers and prospects in the sport.”




	The deal, which is also partnering with the Saudi entertainment and sports firm Sela, will see TKO serve as managing partner, running the day to day operations. UFC President and CEO Dana White and WWE President and TKO board member Nick Khan will anchor the leadership team.

	Specific details around fighter signings, fight schedules, venues, and host locations will be revealed over the coming months, but the new venture will include a system to develop and train new talent, with TKO handling TV production.

	“This is a strategic opportunity to reimagine the sport of boxing globally,” TKO president and COO Mark Shapiro said in a statement. “TKO has the deep expertise, promotional prowess, and longstanding relationships. HE Turki Alalshikh and Sela share our passion and vision for evolving the current model. Together, we can bring the sweet science back to its rightful place in the forefront of the global sports ecosystem.”


	“This landmark partnership between industry powerhouses sets the stage for an unparalleled experience for boxers and fans,” added Alalshikh. “Together, we are developing the next generation of talent and delivering world-class events at a time when the sport is primed for further disruption.”


	Boxing had fallen out of favor in the U.S., with its longtime TV homes of HBO and Showtime having exited the space. However, there has been a resurgence in recent years driven by stars like Jake Paul and Anthony Joshua, with last year’s Paul-Mike Tyson fight shattering records for Netflix.


	TKO is betting that the sweet science is in a position to embark on a U.S. comeback in line with what it is seeing around the world.

Highlights Sapporo’s Unaddressed Governance Deficiencies and Lack of Commitment to Maximizing Corporate Value



Encourages Shareholders to Appoint Mr. Paul Brough as a Director who is a Member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee at the Company’s Upcoming Annual General Meeting to Enhance Board Oversight


TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3D Investment Partners Pte. Ltd., the asset management company of 3D OPPORTUNITY MASTER FUND (collectively referred to as “3D,” ""we"" or ""our""), today released a supplemental presentation in response to a presentation released on February 28, 2025 (the ""February 28 Presentation"") by Sapporo Holdings Limited (""Sapporo"" or “the Company"") (2501.T) in connection with the Company’s 101st Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the ""AGM""), scheduled to be held on March 28, 2025.



Sapporo’s February 28 Presentation failed to allay our concerns about Sapporo’s governance, Board composition, commitment to maximize the proceeds of its Real Estate business, or lack of capital discipline needed to deploy the proceeds from the divestiture of the Real Estate business in an optimal manner.



Our presentation is available at: https://www.3dipartners.com/engagement/sapporo-agm-en-202503-addition.pdf



Our Engagement with Sapporo



3D is Sapporo’s largest shareholder, holding approximately 19% of its outstanding shares. For nearly three years, we have sought to engage constructively with the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its executives to improve governance and oversight and enhance corporate value. Our engagement has had a meaningfully positive impact on the strategic direction and plan to divest its Real Estate business, which resulted in Sapporo’s share price outperforming compared to its competitors and the market.



We are supportive of Sapporo’s efforts to focus on its core Alcoholic Beverages business and divest most of its real estate assets. However, Sapporo has the lowest profit margin and ROE of all listed beer companies in the world, and it has also recorded impairment losses on all of its major overseas alcoholic business acquisitions. Furthermore, it has never achieved its sales and operating profit targets including the final year of its mid-term management plan for the past 19 years. Considering the above, we are deeply concerned that the strategic review process that is underway to introduce external capital into the Real Estate business is not designed to maximize corporate value. Furthermore, given Sapporo’s stated policy to deploy the proceeds for large-scale investments in the beer business, we are deeply concerned that, without more effective oversight and enhanced capital discipline, the Company may repeat the capital allocation mistakes of the past and once again incur significant impairment losses.



Concerns Regarding Sapporo’s February 28 Presentation



The Company’s February 28 Presentation did not address these concerns.



Not once in its 35-page presentation, or any of its prior communications, has Sapporo pledged to maximize the proceeds from the divestiture of Sapporo’s Real Estate business. In our view, such a clear affirmation is a prerequisite for an effective process therefor and entirely consistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties. Such a commitment should not be controversial. The fact that the Board is unwilling to make this simple commitment illustrates why improved oversight is urgently needed to avoid making such process arbitrary.



In the February 28 Presentation, Sapporo touts the number of meetings held by the Audit and Supervisory Committee and the proportion of independent outside directors on the Board as supposed evidence of “strengthened” corporate governance. In our view, however, the effectiveness of a governance system should be judged by the outcomes it generates. Despite Sapporo’s claims that the current Board is optimal for improving corporate value and shareholder interests, we believe the Company’s shortcomings – a suboptimal business configuration; the lowest profit margin and ROE in the world in the Company’s core Alcoholic Beverages business; and a track record of value-destructive acquisitions – reflect inadequate oversight that has impaired Sapporo’s corporate value.



At least, Sapporo's shareholders have never benefited from the Board that Sapporo has evaluated as “optimal”.



We find it telling that, in the Company’s February 28 Presentation, the Company did not dispute the fact that:



Our Proposal: Strengthening the Audit and Supervisory Committee to Enhance Board Oversight



We believe it is essential for the Audit and Supervisory Committee to be comprised of independent directors with expertise in accounting standards, financial management, auditing, M&A, capital allocation and real estate. Only then will the Audit and Supervisory Committee be positioned to effectively evaluate the reasonableness of Sapporo’s business strategies and transactions such as maximizing the proceeds from divesting the Real Estate business and optimally allotting its proceeds and prevent failures in judgment which is important and irreversible.



We are seeking to appoint Mr. Paul Brough as an outside director who is a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.



Mr. Brough is extremely well qualified for the role, given his extensive knowledge of accounting, real estate, business development and restructuring, M&A, asset sales and capital allocation. However, in the February 28 Presentation, Sapporo seeks to justify its opposition to Mr. Brough’s appointment by making false and misleading claims regarding his independence and expertise. To be clear:



Conclusion



We encourage our fellow shareholders to review today’s presentation and the other materials we have prepared highlighting the case for strengthening the Audit and Supervisory Committee to enhance Board oversight at Sapporo and to vote in favor of our proposal to appoint Mr. Brough as an outside director who is a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee at the Company’s upcoming AGM.

The Old Course Vilamoura has announced a long-term partnership with Trackman that will see the company’s cutting-edge ball tracking technology installed into driving ranges, practice areas, coaching, club fitting, and simulator golf across the Old Course Vilamoura, and the Els Club Vilamoura, the latter of which is set to launch this summer.

This announcement marks a significant milestone, making the Old Course the only venue in the Algarve to integrate Trackman’s state-of-the-art technology – which will be free for guests to use – reinforcing its reputation as a premier golfing destination.

As part of the collaboration, both courses will be integrated into Trackman’s Virtual Golf Platform, allowing golfers to play the courses virtually, both indoors and on the driving range, using the most advanced virtual golf graphics available. This ensures that golfers worldwide can experience Vilamoura Golf remotely while offering members and guests an elevated practice and gameplay experience on-site.

The Old Course will be the first in the Algarve, and one of only a few in Portugal, to introduce this groundbreaking technology. It has the largest driving range in Portugal with 20 spots available, providing a unique opportunity for golfers to enjoy the game. 

The ability to play the Vilamoura course virtually is incredibly popular, and the accuracy of the data provided ensures a world-class experience. Notably, the system works in all weather conditions, offering functionality whether it’s sunlight or darkness, further enhancing the experience.





“Arrow Global and DETAILS are both visionaries in the industry, and we are delighted to be working with them on the rebirth and relaunch of the Vilamoura golf courses,” said Steven Carmichael, Director of Strategic Alliances for Trackman. “The Old Course in Vilamoura has always been highly regarded by golfers around the world. Trackman is honoured to contribute to their continued presence at the forefront of global golf. We look forward to seeing how this partnership, alongside the wider innovations and developments in Vilamoura, enhances the golfing experience for all.”

Nuno Sepulveda, Co-CEO of Details, added: “At DETAILS, we are committed to pushing boundaries and ensuring our golf destinations remain at the cutting edge of the sport. Partnering with Trackman enables us to offer players a world-class experience, whether they are honing their skills on the range or playing a virtual round at one of our iconic courses. This is an exciting chapter for golf in Vilamoura.”

The Asian Golf Industry Federation (AGIF) has announced the appointment of Rishi Narain to the role of Head of Events, Sponsorship and Membership.

A leading figure in the Asian golf industry for the past four decades, Narain was an Asian Games gold medallist for India in the 1980s and a professional golfer in the 1990s. Over the last 25 years he has been a key figure in many areas of the Indian golf industry, including publishing, player management and event promotion and management.

In January, Narain enjoyed a second successful stint as non-playing captain of the Asia-Pacific Golf Confederation (APGC) Bonallack Trophy team in the biennial Ryder Cup-style match play event against the European Golf Association in the United Arab Emirates.

“As a prominent figure in the golf industry around the region, Rishi is already well known to many of our member companies. We’re delighted to bring him on-board,” said Chris Gray, President of the AGIF. “With his energy and expertise, and the support of his own team in Delhi, Rishi will be overseeing a number of AGIF events around the region in the months to come.

“That will culminate in the annual AGIF Conference, which is set to return to the Sime Darby Convention Centre in Kuala Lumpur to coincide with the LPGA Tour’s Maybank Championship at the end of October,” added Gray.

Speaking about his new role, Narain said: “I’m very much looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Having attended the 2024 AGIF Conference and spent time chatting with many of the speakers and delegates, it’s clear that there is incredible potential to grow the Federation.

“Given the growth of the game across Asia, the industry needs a strong organisation to be leading the way. When you consider the list of high-profile members that it has, the AGIF is perfectly positioned to be just that.”

Gray added: “Rishi will be reaching out to AGIF member companies in the weeks and months ahead to hear their thoughts about how the Federation can best support their businesses and help to grow the industry.”

 St Andrews Links Trust has announced an ambitious set of measures to ensure it meets its pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040 – ensuring a long-term and sustainable future for the Home of Golf. 

Trojan Battery has launched the Trojan Lithium OnePack Extended Range, a 48V, 171Ah lithium-ion battery pack, that enables golf carts and low-speed electric vehicles to travel up to 75 miles on a single charge.

The Old Course Vilamoura has announced a long-term partnership with Trackman that will see the company's cutting-edge ball tracking technology installed at the Old Course Vilamoura, and the Els Club Vilamoura, which is set to launch this summer.

On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, highlighting the domestic and foreign policy changes his administration has made in the first six weeks of his second term.

The speech, which set a record at over 90 minutes, touched upon a myriad of economic policy issues that will directly impact business owners.

In a CBS YouGov poll of watchers (51% described themselves as Republicans, 27% as Independents, and 20% as Democrats), 76% approved what they heard from the president.

In the address, Trump defended his tariffs, saying it would affect the economy but only in the short term.

""There'll be a little disturbance,"" he said. ""But we're OK with that. It won't be much.""

Trump also said he wants to end the Chips Act, the Biden-era $52 billion subsidy program for semiconductor manufacturing.

In response to the address, Josh Lipsky, senior director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center, said Trump's speech means he is serious about tariffs.

""The most significant line on trade in the president's address wasn't about steel, aluminum, or farming. It was when Trump said tariffs are 'about protecting the soul of our country,'"" Lipsky said. ""These seven words should put the whole world on notice that Trump is serious about tariffs. To him, they are not just a negotiating tool. It is possible that, within the next several months, we could be facing a global trade war.""

When it comes to investors, Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors, told Reuters that reaction should ""overall be positive.""

""Cutting taxes on individuals and domestic manufacturing and 100% immediate capex deductions will incentivize business spending as long as corporations believe the consumer will be there to spend,"" Schulman said. ""Investor reaction should overall be positive since disposable income may rise when these policies are passed.""

Others thought the speech was too ""on script.""

Reflection Asset Management President Jason Britton told Reuters: ""The speech will have a muted reaction as much of the positive sentiment was priced in already.""

""It was as expected and a moment where the president stayed on script and there's little to no aftermath,"" Britton added.

After more than a century, the Poor Clares, an order of Roman Catholic nuns, have moved out of their historic monastery in the 700 block of Henry Clay Avenue near Audubon Park, leaving vacant an entire city block in the heart of one of Uptown’s priciest neighborhoods.

Just four nuns, all in their 80s, had been living in St. Clare's Monastery, as the nearly 2-acre property is formally known. It stands behind a brick wall and encompasses the entire block bounded by Henry Clay, Magazine, Constance and Calhoun streets.

Given their advanced age and dwindling numbers, maintaining the buildings and sprawling grounds was simply too much for the nuns to manage, said Sr. Charlene Toups, who leads the order.

“We do our own work and are pretty self-sustaining,” said Toups, a New Orleans native, who joined the order in 1966 after dropping out of college. “But we’re older now and it’s hard for us to climb up and down ladders to change light bulbs and tend to the gardening.”

The nuns are working to sell the property to a local developer and hope to finalize a deal soon, said Toups, who declined to provide details, citing a nondisclosure agreement. They recently relocated to a house on Valmont Street about a mile from the monastery.

The monastery dates to 1912 and includes a main three-story building with a chapel, offices, meeting rooms, dining space and an infirmary. The upper floors of the building house dozens of bedrooms, most of which have been empty for years, and was designated in 1979 as a historic landmark by the city's Historic Districts Landmarks Commission.

The monastery grounds are extensive, and include a mortuary chapel, where members of the order are buried, and a garden shed. There are also two live oaks named St. Anthony and St. Roch, a grotto, a grassy labyrinth and benches for contemplation.

Earlier this year, the monastery was assessed at nearly $7 million, according to the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office, which valued the land at nearly $4 million and the buildings nearly $3 million.

Experts say given its size, location, historic architecture and storied past, the unique piece of property is hard to put a price tag on.

“It’s prime real estate, obviously,” said Larry Schedler of Larry G. Schedler and Associates, who specializes in the local apartment market. “There would be tremendous demand for it as market-rate or affordable housing. It’s really going to come down to how many historic tax credits can a developer get to renovate it.”

The Poor Clare order is more than 800 years old and was founded by St. Clare of Assisi, who was born into nobility in 13th-cenutry Italy and gave up her life of privilege to follow the example of poverty and simple living set by her contemporary, St. Francis of Assisi.

Poor Clare nuns are cloistered, meaning, they spend their lives in the monastery, praying and working, rather than ministering to the needy out in the world. Members of the order pledge chastity, poverty, obedience and enclosure when they enter the monastery, and devote themselves to a life of contemplative prayer.  

Today, there are about 20,000 Poor Clare nuns living in more than 70 countries worldwide, according to Santa Clara University, which is affiliated with the order.

Toups entered the order in the mid-1960s, when many other priests and nuns were rethinking their vocations and leaving. At the time, there were 27 Poor Clares at the local monastery.

“Everybody was dropping out. I was dropping in,” said Toups, who felt called to a life of poverty and contemplative prayer.

In the nearly six decades since, Toups said she hasn’t looked back and has found living in community both rewarding and meaningful. Though the Poor Clares are cloistered, they have played an active role in the local community.

For years, they ran a small printing business that printed stationery and brochures for small local museums. They also had a gift shop, where they sold homemade art and ornaments. Additionally, they baked communion wafers for local Roman Catholic parishes and held Sunday mass in their main chapel, which continues even though the nuns have moved.

“We are hoping to reestablish our gift shop once we get settled,” Toups said. “We’re still in the process of moving everything out. After more than a century, it takes a little while.”

The Poor Clare monastery is the latest of several large parcels of real estate owned by the Roman Catholic church and its affiliated orders that have been sold or listed for sale, amid changing demographics, aging priests and nuns and other financial pressures.

Locally, the Archdiocese of New Orleans’ need to raise money to settle claims with hundreds of survivors of sex abuse by priests, deacons and brothers has prompted Archbishop Gregory Aymond to sell nearly $20 million of real estate in recent years.

The Poor Clare order is not under the control of the archdiocese and the nuns own the monastery independent of the local church. Their deal to sell the property is not related to the church bankruptcy. 

While the Poor Clare property is valued at nearly $7 million by the assessor, it’s unclear how much the property would fetch on the open market, experts say.

A full city block in Mid City, including the shuttered Sacred Heart of Jesus Church on Canal Street, was assessed last year at $6.1 million. Its current asking price is $1.95 million, down from $2.28 million in late 2023.

But the Mid City property, though comparable in size to the monastery Uptown, is hamstrung by a couple of factors. It includes a large, aging former church building, which doesn’t lend itself to reuse as an apartment complex or condos. Also, a former school building on the Mid City site has already been converted to a rent-adjusted apartments for low-income seniors.

Schedler says the value of the Uptown monastery will come down to the amount of historic building tax credits a developer is able to secure to renovate the building and convert it to residential use.

The New York-based company owns more than 100 brands, including Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Ruffino, Meiomi, Simi Winery, and The Prisoner.

It is one of the largest wine suppliers in the United States, but that part of the business has struggled in recent years.



Wine sales fell by 14% year-on-year in the three months ended November 2024, according to the company’s latest update. Spirits sales were also down by 15%.

Constellation Brands is now planning to throw in the towel and get out of the wine industry, according to Wine Business.

The company’s Central Valley wine operations would be sold to Delicato Family Wines, whose brands include Francis Coppola, 1924 and Stoneleigh.



Meanwhile, the firm’s coastal brands and vineyards would go to The Duckhorn Portfolio, which was swallowed up by private equity firm Butterfly Equity last October.

Constellation Brands was established in New York’s Finger Lakes region back in 1945. It was renowned for selling Richard’s Wild Irish Rose, a fortified wine, but it eventually became a major wine producer after making several key acquisitions.

However, the company’s big break came in 2013. AB InBev, the world’s largest brewer, had just agreed to purchase Mexico’s Grupo Modelo for $20.1bn.

That deal fell foul of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust agency, which said it would dent competition in the US market. AB InBev was forced to sell Grupo Modelo’s US operations to get the deal over the line.

Constellation stepped in to buy Modelo’s US business, including the Piedras Negras brewery and the Crown Imports distribution arm.

That made Constellation a major player in the US beer market. Modelo and Corona have gone from strength to strength in the ensuing years, and Modelo is now the country’s most popular beer brand.

However, the wine and spirits business has weighed on the company. In September, Constellation issued a profit warning after revealing it expected an impairment of up to $2.5bn on its wine and spirits unit.

Total US wine sales fell by 6% in 2024, according to SipSource data. Shifting demographics, economic forces and health concerns were blamed. Constellation has now reportedly decided that enough is enough, and could exit the wine trade completely.","{'href': 'https://www.decanter.com', 'title': 'Decanter.com'}"

      McDonald’s is giving its 43,000 restaurants a technology makeover, starting with internet-connected kitchen equipment, artificial intelligence-enabled drive-throughs and AI-powered tools for managers.


     
      The goal? To drive better experiences for its customers and workers who today contend with issues ranging from broken machines to wrong orders, according to Brian Rice, the Chicago-based burger giant’s chief information officer.


     
      “Our restaurants, frankly, can be very stressful. We have customers at the counter, we have customers at our drive-through, couriers coming in for delivery, delivery at curbside. That’s a lot to deal with for our crew,"" Rice said in an interview. “Technology solutions will alleviate the stress.""


     
      The investments are coming at a key time for McDonald’s, whose U.S. sales were sluggish in January—reflective of a broader slump in the fast-food industry. McDonald’s said consumers remain pressured, particularly low-income diners and families. The restaurant is hoping that a better tech-enabled experience will help it deliver on its goal of growing its loyalty patrons from 175 million to 250 million by 2027.


     
      To accomplish that, McDonald’s tapped Google Cloud in late 2023 to bring more computing power to each of its restaurants—giving them the ability to process and analyze data on-site. The setup, known as edge computing, can be a faster, cheaper option than sending data to the cloud, especially in more far-flung locations with less reliable cloud connections, said Rice.


     
      Rice joined McDonald’s in 2022 from Cardinal Health, where he also served as chief information officer. Before his tenure at the healthcare-supplies distributor, Rice served in senior technology positions at cereal maker Kellogg, candy-maker Mars and carmaker General Motors.


     
      Edge computing will enable applications like predicting when kitchen equipment—such as fryers and its notorious McFlurry ice cream machines—is likely to break down, Rice said. The burger chain said its suppliers have begun installing sensors on kitchen equipment that will feed data to the edge computing system and give franchisees a “real-time"" view into how their restaurants are operating. AI can then analyze that data for early signs of a maintenance problem.


     
      McDonald’s is also exploring the use of computer vision, the form of AI behind facial recognition, in store-mounted cameras to determine whether orders are accurate before they’re handed to customers, he said.


     
      “If we can proactively address those issues before they occur, that’s going to mean smoother operations in the future,"" Rice added.


     
      McDonald’s began rolling out edge computing to some U.S. restaurants in 2024, the company said, and plans to include more this year. It declined to say how many restaurants currently have edge cloud connectivity, and when the process will be completed.


     
      Additionally, the ability to tap edge computing will power voice AI at the drive-through, a capability McDonald’s is also working with Google’s cloud-computing arm to explore, Rice said. The company has been experimenting with voice-activated drive-throughs and robotic deep fryers since 2019, and ended its partnership with International Business Machines to test automated order-taking at the drive-through in 2024.


     
      Edge computing will also help McDonald’s restaurant managers oversee their in-store operations. The burger giant is looking to create a “generative AI virtual manager,"" Rice said, which handles administrative tasks such as shift scheduling on managers’ behalf. Fast-food giant Yum Brands’ Pizza Hut and Taco Bell have explored similar capabilities.


     
      McDonald’s is an early mover in its industry when it comes to using edge computing, but it’s by no means alone, according to Jose Gomes, a managing director of retail and consumer goods at Google Cloud. The technology is expected to be used by any sector with distributed physical locations, including hospitals and factories.


     
      Despite its first-mover advantage, McDonald’s will still face challenges including cost and the difficulty of rolling out the same technology across franchises and corporate-owned locations, said Sandeep Unni, a retail analyst at market research and IT consulting firm Gartner. McDonald’s declined to say how much it is spending on its technology initiatives.


     
      But, compared with some of its quick-service restaurant peers, McDonald’s has been relatively aggressive at investing in new digital technologies, Unni said. That, combined with the vast amount of data it has collected on its customers, gives the fast-food giant a leg up on figuring out how to improve customer loyalty.


     
      AI will be able to help McDonald’s tailor its promotions and offers by using customer data such as prior purchasing history, and even linking it with weather data, Rice said. “A customer who we know loves our sweet treats could get an offer through the app for a McFlurry on a hot summer day,"" he said.

	Chemical properties coax a material to form nonrepeating tiling patterns

This material forms irregular patterns in which the molecules inside one triangle are rotated 60 degrees with respect to those in neighboring triangles. That results in nonrepeating triangular patterns.

Empa

By Zack Savitsky

1 hour ago

For centuries, mathematicians and floor designers alike have been fascinated by the shapes that can tile a plane — in particular, those that do so without repetition.

Now, a team of chemists has described a molecule that naturally assembles into these irregular patterns, laying the groundwork for engineering materials that behave differently from regular solids.

“When these things seem to arise spontaneously in nature, I think it’s absolutely fascinating,” says Craig Kaplan, a mathematician and computer scientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada who was not involved in the study. “It feels like you found a glitch in the matrix.”

In 2018, chemist Karl-Heinz Ernst and colleagues were spraying a special hydrocarbon molecule onto a silver substrate and watching it form patterns through a microscope.

“We saw something that was quite surprising and amazing,” says Ernst, of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology in Dübendorf. The deposited molecules formed three-armed spirals, which grouped together into triangles of slightly different sizes. In each of around 100 experiments, the researchers found new triangular sequences that never seemed to repeat. They sat on these images for years trying to make sense of them.

Then, in 2023, Kaplan and collaborators stunned the mathematics world when they found the elusive einstein tile — a single shape that can fill a floor only with a never-repeating pattern, meaning it’s aperiodic. The mathematical discovery helped Ernst and colleagues put the pieces together: It seemed as though they’d stumbled upon a sort of molecular einstein.

Kaplan cautions that the patterns in this material aren’t aperiodic in the same sense as the einstein tile. The pieces don’t fit together precisely, and it’s unlikely — if not impossible — that they can tile only with nonrepeating patterns. But even without achieving true aperiodicity, the novel patterning may be sufficient to grant the material some seemingly magical properties, Kaplan says.

Physicists have known for decades that electrons behave differently in quasicrystals, materials whose atomic structure exhibits some large-scale order but lacks repeated patterns. Last year, physicist Felix Flicker at the University of Bristol in England helped build a computer simulation of a quasicrystal based on Kaplan’s einstein tile, which predicted it would act like a tricked-out sheet of graphene.

How quasicrystals form in nature remains a big mystery, Flicker says. The spirals Ernst grew may provide some clues.

The key to this molecule’s irregular behavior, reported in January 2025 in Nature Communications, may be the entropy of its constellations.

Entropy is a measure of how disordered a material is, or alternatively, how statistically probable its atomic arrangement is. The molecule has two tricks that make it abnormally versatile: It can easily convert between two distinct mirror-image shapes, and it forms very weak intermolecular bonds, allowing it to switch between large-scale configurations relatively easily. These two properties together mean that there are many possible ways for the molecules to arrange without repeating, Ernst says. The molecules thus flock to higher-entropy, nonrepeating patterns — ordering in the most disorderly way possible.

Flicker says the new study provides “a really nice example of this ‘order by disorder’” theory of quasicrystal formation. Understanding the general principles of irregular ordering could point scientists toward better ways to engineer quasicrystals on demand. Flicker believes that uncovering new patterns that lie between regularity and randomness is bound to yield exciting connections in unexpected places.

Ernst is humbled by the fact that the molecules found these patterns all on their own. “This is nature doing math,” he says.

The black hole at the Milky Way’s heart neither slumbers nor sleeps. Instead, the ring of plasma surrounding it flickers constantly, punctuated by superbright flares, observations show.

Astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope to observe Sgr A* and its disk for hours at a time over the course of a year, from April 2023 through April 2024. These were the longest continuous observations yet of our galaxy’s central supermassive black hole.

The telescope revealed a “constant bubbling” in the disk’s light that changed every few seconds or minutes, says astrophysicist Farhad Yusef-Zadeh of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. A few times a day, and seemingly at random, the disk would emit a blindingly bright flare, Yusef-Zadeh and colleagues report in the Feb. 20 Astrophysical Journal Letters.

The supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A* or Sgr A* for short, is about 4 million times as heavy as the sun and lies about 26,000 light-years from our solar system. The black hole is fairly quiet most of the time, only occasionally gobbling up material in its vicinity and letting out bursts of light and energy.

But that doesn’t mean it’s just lying there. Earlier observations, including the first image of the black hole, had suggested that the white-hot disk of plasma that accretes around it is constantly flickering. Computer simulations of how material flows in the accretion disk predicted that the disk’s brightness should vary from minutes to years. The new observations not only confirm those ideas, but also shed light on how the flickering happens.

JWST has some advantages over other telescopes that allowed it to catch the disk’s variability in action. Because the telescope is not in Earth’s orbit, Earth never gets in its way, letting the telescope take longer continuous looks. It can also observe objects in two different wavelengths of light simultaneously.

“We can see things in color, rather than black-and-white,” Yusef-Zadeh says.

The researchers think there are two processes at work, Yusef-Zadeh says. Turbulence in the disk itself causes the bubbling. Meanwhile, the process behind the big flares could be analogous to magnetic reconnection events, in which two lines of magnetic field collide and release bursts of energy. These events also happen during solar flares.

The team has requested a full 24 hours of continuous observation time with JWST to find out more.

Feedback discovers that breasts have been ""largely ignored"" when it comes to tactile acuity – but is relieved that researchers have acted to change this oversight




                                    5 March 2025

Feedback is New Scientist’s popular sideways look at the latest science and technology news. You can submit items you believe may amuse readers to Feedback by emailing feedback@newscientist.com 

Feedback reads a lot of academic articles, and we are often distressed by their titles, which can be not so much meandering and unclear as digressive and circumlocutory. The only things worse are the ones that preface the academese with an allegedly humorous pop culture reference.

However, sometimes we run across research whose title is brisk and to the point. We are fond of the 2000 structural biology paper “The ribosome is a ribozyme“, which is an absolute model of efficiency (assuming you know what the two nouns mean). And then there is a February paper on bioRxiv brought to our attention by New Scientist contributor Chris Simms, titled “The coarse mental map of the breast is anchored on the nipple“.

That may, perhaps, need a bit of context. Some parts of the human body are more sensitive to touch than others. The face – especially the lips – and the tips of our fingers are highly sensitive, while our backs are much less so.

This is one of those classic experiments you can do at home. Get a chopstick or some other blunt tool and gently poke a willing partner. You will find that they can tell if you move the location of successive pokes, even by mere millimetres, if you poke them on the lips or fingertips. But if you poke them on the back, they will be terrible at determining whether you moved it. This is because your back has fewer touch-sensitive nerves there.

The authors of this new preprint spotted a gap in the literature. “While tactile acuity has been extensively studied on the limbs and face, acuity on the torso has received far less experimental attention… with the breast being largely ignored,” they write.

Let’s not drag out the suspense. It turns out breasts have very low tactile acuity, even worse than backs. Apparently, “touches needed to be between 3 and 4 times as far apart on the breast than on the hand to yield equivalent location discrimination performance”.

Feedback isn’t sure if this is quite what Caroline Criado Perez had in mind when she wrote Invisible Women, documenting the myriad ways women have been excluded from scientific research. But, as a piece of basic information, it seems like it might have its uses.

Feedback’s main takeaway is that we would like to have been a fly on the wall for the recruitment process. “You want to do what to my what with what?”

Back in early November 2024, Feedback was running a bit short of material due to a brief hiatus (long since over) in global idiocy, so we padded the column with a torrent of increasingly long words – or, as we said at the time, we engaged in sesquipedalianism.

Except it turns out we did it wrong. Francis Wenban-Smith wrote in to point out our mistake: “you were 2 letters short in your attempt to pad out your column with ‘floccinaucinihipilification’. The correct word is: ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’.”

If you can’t see the difference between those two blizzards of letters – and we wouldn’t blame you, because we evidently couldn’t – the second has an extra “li” just before the “pili”. Feedback would like to assure readers we have been given a stern talking-to.

In the process of confirming that we had indeed misspelled floccinaucinihilipilification, Feedback entered the two versions into a popular search engine. The correct version brought up a dictionary entry as the highlighted response. The incorrect version brought up our article (how embarrassing), above which was an AI summary of the fake word. Here are the opening lines:

“Floccinaucinihipilification is a long word that means to regard something as worthless or trivial. It was the longest word in the Oxford English Dictionary until 1982. Floccinaucinihipilification is a 29-letter word with 12 syllables. It contains nine i’s but no e’s.”

Readers who can count to 29, unlike the AI, will notice that all those claims about the number of letters and syllables are wrong, bar the one about the letter e. Feedback is proud to have contributed, in our own small way, to the ongoing pollution of the information ecosystem.

Like so much else in life, dating is becoming micro-targeted. You can still use huge apps like Tinder, but there is also a growing proliferation of ever-more-niche dating sites.

Perhaps the nichest of all is Unjected, aimed at those not vaccinated against covid-19. Or, to be more precise: “While we do not support vaccination of any kind, Unjected is specifically tailored for Covid-19 unvaccinated or any mRNA based injection.”

As technology analyst Benedict Evans put it on Threads: “Someone built a whole company around the Darwin Awards“.

Feedback has a lot of questions about Unjected, the most pressing of which is: how does the company decide who can join? Perhaps this is so basic it doesn’t need saying, but you can’t prove a negative.

Scouring the site’s FAQs, we found the answer: “Since the beginning, Unjected has believed the healthiest realtionships [sic] have a foundation of trust, and we have operated on an honor system. However, for our members who want the most safety and security in choosing their future partner, we recommend our ‘Unjected Verified’ upgrade. Unjected verified members attest to their unvaccination by affidavit.” Love, like SARS-CoV-2, is in the air.

 by Jenna Flogeras | Mar 5, 2025

Texas-based researchers have developed a sustainable plant-based material that could potentially reduce or eliminate reliance on bottled water while addressing water scarcity, a major global issue.  

The material, known as a hydrogel, acts like a sponge, pulling in moisture from the air and releasing it when heated at low temperatures. It can be used anywhere, even in remote, off-grid locations with low humidity levels, and the absorbed water is safe for drinking.

“The water collected from our hydrogel meets international safety standards, with metal ion concentrations well below the World Health Organization limits,” said Guihua Yu, the study’s lead investigator and a professor at The University of Texas at Austin’s Materials Institute.

Globally, at least two billion people lack access to safe drinking water, a number that is expected to climb as the climate continues to heat up. In response, the United Nations is aiming for “universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water” by 2030.

As the atmosphere holds an estimated 13,000 trillion kilograms of water, tapping into this abundant resource could be the key to meeting this target.    



Yu and his team at created the hydrogels by chemically modifying cellulose, starch, and chitosan –– a compound found in crustacean shells and fungi –– to enhance their ability to absorb and release water.

Polymeric hydrogels, while good at retaining water, are often made from petroleum-derived polymers, Yu said. Unlike fossil fuels, which have limited reserves, biomass materials are renewable, so their supply is ensured. 

The modification process involved grafting certain functional groups onto the chemical structures of cellulose, starch, and chitosan to improve water retention and promote water desorption at lower temperatures, making the process more energy-efficient.

The researchers also embedded lithium chloride, a salt, within the hydrogel to boost its water-absorbing performance. Due to their chemical structures, salts have a natural affinity for water, a property known as hygroscopicity—this is why salt is so effective at preserving food.   

“Unlike free salts, which can dissolve and leak, we immobilized lithium chloride within the hydrogel matrix, allowing it to retain its hygroscopic properties while preventing unwanted loss,” Yu explained.

“This combination ensures that the hydrogel remains highly effective in capturing atmospheric moisture, even in arid conditions,” he added.  



To find out how much water could actually be harvested from the hydrogel in a real-world scenario, the researchers tested the cellulose-based hydrogel, which had the highest water uptake in initial indoor tests, in an outdoor experiment in Austin, Texas.

For six days, they alternated between absorption and desorption cycles, in which the water captured by the hydrogel from the air during each absorption cycle was evaporated by heating the hydrogel on an electric hotplate at 60 °C. They collected the water vapor by condensing it onto a glass covering above the hotplate.

The researchers found that 95% of the captured water could be released at this temperature over each four-hour heating period. Based on the amount of water collected during each desorption cycle, they calculated that a kilogram of the sorbent can provide over 14 liters of water per day on average. 

According to Yu, this amount of water exceeds what other sorbents being investigated for atmospheric water harvesting, including metal–organic frameworks, have been reported to yield. These materials can also require much higher temperatures to release the stored water. 

Aside from the environmental benefits, including avoiding plastic waste and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with bottled water production and transportation, atmospheric water harvesting has the potential to be much more economical than buying bottled water.

Based on the current average price of bottled water in the United States and considering operational costs, Yu and his colleagues estimated that the hydrogel-based water harvester could fully offset its initial investment costs within a year of use.

“Over multiple years, the savings could amount to hundreds to thousands of dollars per household, depending on water needs and local bottled water prices,” Yu said.

Yu and his team are currently working on improving the energy efficiency and practicality of the hydrogel sorbent and its water-harvesting process.

“Moving forward, we aim to enhance the hydrogel’s performance by optimizing its porosity and internal water transport pathways to accelerate sorption–desorption kinetics,” Yu shared.  

Yu and his team are also developing hydrogels that can use direct sunlight, rather than electric heating, to drive water release, which would lower the energy consumption even more.    

“Scaling up production is another key focus, as we work toward making these materials viable for widespread deployment in water-scarce regions,” Yu stated.

Before Reddit there was Digg, which popularized up- and down-votes on online posts. Now the founders of both platforms — social media veterans Kevin Rose and Alexis Ohanian — are relaunching the early Reddit rival with a focus on “humanity and connection” they hope will be boosted by the use of artificial intelligence.

Rose founded Digg, which launched in 2004 and let people up- and down-vote (""Digg"" or “bury”) content from users and from sources around the web. At its peak, it had 40 million monthly users — a high number for the time considering that Facebook only hit 100 million in 2008.

Digg was divvied up and sold in 2012, with many of its assets and patents acquired by LinkedIn. Reddit, which launched in 2005 and was co-founded by Ohanian, took a similar approach to let users vote on what they thought was the best and worst content on the site.

But much has changed since 2012 — not just when it comes to advances in artificial intelligence but also how people treat each other online.

“The social space online is definitely harsher, it feels like, than it’s ever been before,” said Justin Mezzell, who will serve as the new company's CEO. “It feels really difficult to connect. I think the platforms have gotten more disconnected. You know, if ever there was a true town hall of the internet, it feels like it has been deconstructed in a pretty big way.”

Digg's new leaders say they want to use artificial intelligence to “handle the grunt work” of running a social media site while allowing humans to focus on building meaningful online communities. The question, Mezzell said, is how to get people to “show up and have conversations, to learn from each other, to share something they’re passionate about and do it earnestly?” Especially when some of today's social media algorithms “exist really just optimize for outrage.”

Rose said Digg will take a more nuanced approach to content moderation than banning or not banning content, which is a process that can be easy to get around.

“There is a world where, you know, you show up in (a) meditation (group) and you’re swinging four-letter words all over the place, and you hit submit,” he said. And “we come back and we say, hey, you can post this, of course, but only 2% of the audience is going to see it, because the way that the moderator set the tone.”

“That is unique. That is different. That’s not like a hard-defining rule,” Rose added “It’s more like just sensing the voice and how it fits within the entire ecosystem and the model that’s behind the scenes for that community.”

The new Digg will launch in the coming weeks as a website and mobile app.

The G1 robot isn’t just agile — it’s learning kung fu. 

Video via the Chinese official state news agency Xinhua.

We have a new entry on the ever-growing “Robots and algorithms doing things no one asked them to do” list. Introducing the G1 robot, a humanoid machine with impressive balance, smooth agility, and — unexpectedly — kung fu skills. Yes, it can punch. Yes, it can pull off a roundhouse kick. And yes, that begs the question: why?

G1 first appeared on the global stage at China’s Spring Festival Gala, one of the most-watched TV events in the world. Its debut, however, was a little awkward, showcasing a humanoid figure that seemed more of a novelty than a serious technological breakthrough.

That changed quickly. In January, Unitree, the company behind G1, demonstrated the robot effortlessly jogging across uneven terrain. Now, it’s showing off complex martial arts moves, proving how much humanoid robots are advancing in terms of coordination, stability, and movement precision.

Priced at 99,000 yuan (US$13,622), the robot is equipped with 43 joints and mimicry learning. It’s capable of learning complex movements and demonstrates precise maneuverability.

The G1 comes with a price tag of 99,000 yuan (US$13,622) and is equipped with 43 joints and advanced mimicry learning capabilities. This allows it to perform highly dynamic actions with remarkable precision. But what’s even more fascinating is how it learns.

Before G1 ever takes a physical step, its training begins in a virtual world. Unitree leverages NVIDIA’s Isaac AI-driven robotics platform, where the robot first learns the fundamentals of movement.

From there, G1 is shown a digital twin — another humanoid robot performing actions. Using motion capture and video data, it observes and gradually refines its skills, mirroring the process humans use when learning by imitation. Over time, the robot’s movements become more complex, fluid, and customizable.

This blend of simulation-based training and real-world refinement is a major step forward in robotics, making humanoid machines significantly more adaptable.

Beyond its acrobatics, one of the most remarkable aspects of the G1 is that it’s open source.

Much like DeepSeek made headlines not just for its affordability but for its open-source accessibility, Unitree has made its training data, algorithms, and hardware specifications publicly available on GitHub. This means developers, researchers, and robotics enthusiasts can explore, tweak, and enhance G1’s capabilities in ways even its creators might not anticipate.

The dataset includes an interactive mesh and inverse kinematics algorithms, allowing G1 to monitor joint positions, limitations, and motion efficiency. In short, it can learn and optimize movements autonomously, whether it’s performing a kung fu routine or something more practical.

Despite the flashy martial arts demo, Unitree insists that G1 is built for practical applications — not combat. The company envisions its humanoid robot assisting in workplaces, homes, and even hospitals, handling repetitive and complex tasks.

However, because the robot is open source, its potential extends far beyond Unitree’s vision. Researchers, engineers, and AI developers now have a powerful humanoid platform they can customize for various real-world applications — from rehabilitation and elder care to industrial automation and education.

Despite its impressive capabilities, G1 raises a bigger question — are we ready to accept robots like this in our daily lives?

For now, G1 is an impressive display of engineering, a symbol of how far robotics has come. But whether we embrace robots as co-workers, assistants, or even companions remains an open question — one that society will have to answer in the years to come.

Each year, scammers attempt to deceive individuals by impersonating government officials
                                    and reputable agencies to steal money and sensitive information. To combat these fraudulent
                                    activities, Social Security’s Office of the Inspector General has designated Thursday, March 6, 2025, as the 6th Annual National Slam the Scam Day—an initiative to raise awareness about government imposter scams and empower individuals
                                    to recognize and report them.

The Department of Information Technology urges the Seton Hall community to stay alert and take proactive steps to safeguard
                                    personal and financial information.

Scammers use deceptive tactics to manipulate victims. Keep these 4 P’s in mind to
                                    identify and avoid scams:

Scammers may impersonate government officials, tech support representatives, or even
                                    distressed family members—often demanding payment via gift cards. Remember: Gift cards should never be used for payments related to taxes, Social Security benefits,
                                       legal issues, or utility bills. If you’re ever asked to pay with a gift card, hang
                                       up immediately and report the scam.

If you receive a suspicious call, text, email, social media message or letter claiming
                                    to be from Social Security or another government agency, follow these steps:

From fast horses to the internet, from type plucked by hand from a California job case to the Mergenthaler Linotype to computer typesetting, from presses hand-fed a single linen page at a time to electric-powered behemoths designed to spew out 70,000 complete papers an hour, The Providence Journal has ridden the crest of technology's wave for some 200 years.

As the paper closes its plant − moving print operations to a corporate cousin in New Jersey − it is only fitting to look back at the ways The Journal has used technology to meet the challenges of the times, constantly innovating the best way to gather and disseminate news to Rhode Islanders.

As The Journal retires the last flexographic newspaper press in the world, it bears recalling the ways Rhode Island's largest paper has helped innovate, and wondering what the next 200 years might hold.

Here is a brief look at some of the tools the paper used to be ""a faithful reporter of the passing news,"" as its first publisher described it in 1820, nine years before it became a daily paper.

Jan. 3, 1820: Printer Honest John Miller, with the backing of Samuel Slater and other manufacturing leaders, establishes The Providence Journal, which publishes Mondays and Thursdays under the unwieldy title ""Manufacturers' & Farmers' Journal, Providence and Pawtucket Advertiser."" − with the period as part of its name.

July 21, 1829: First issue of The Providence Daily Journal, and General Advertiser. This four-page newspaper was typeset by hand and pressed, one linen page at a time, on an iron hand press capable of 240 impressions per hour.

1829: The Journal uses an early version of the Pony Express to deliver President Andrew Jackson's State of the Union address by horse 500 miles, from Washington to New York to Hartford to Boston to Providence to Journal readers, in only three days.

1846: Distant news begins arriving, at least partway, by telegraph.

1848: Providence ties into the New York-Boston telegraph line.

1856: A Hoe single-cylinder press, the first driven by steam power, comes into operation.

Jan. 26, 1863: After irregular issues of ""Journal Extra"" the previous two years, The Journal begins publishing The Evening Bulletin, a daily afternoon paper to bring news by telegraph from Civil War battlefields as well as updated financial reports.

1881: First web-perfecting press installed; it printed from a continuous roll of paper.

1885: Journal office lit by incandescent lamps powered by Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1886: First hand-drawn illustration to accompany a news story, about sailing.

1889: First typesetting machines in New England are installed, called the Mergenthaler Linotype.

1892: Journal builds a backup printing plant south of Rhode Island Hospital in case downtown is destroyed by fire. It would never be used.

1894: Presses powered for the first time by electricity from Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1903: Journal establishes wireless station at Point Judith; prints the Block Island Wireless, a daily paper published by The Journal on the island.

1912: Journal reporter Charles R. Stark Jr., at the New York City docks, asks Western Union to transmit the New York telephone book to tie up a telegraph line so he could use it to send the first interviews of arriving survivors after the sinking of RMS Titanic.

1918: The Journal stretches a sheet across Eddy Street outside the Old Journal Building next to City Hall and projects election result bulletins, a method used for several decades to bring breaking news to crowds who jammed the streets before the advent of radio took over newsflashes.

1925: First color comics section appears in The Sunday Journal.

1928: Journal becomes first paper delivered to Block Island by airplane.

1936: First use of AP Wirephoto, which transmitted photographs from distant news events over telephone lines.

1950: Journal licensed to use two-way radio for reporters and photographers.

1961: Spot color appears regularly in the news pages.

1968: First use of computers in the composing room.

1975: The end of the ""hot lead"" era. Computers create columns of type on paper that are pasted up onto pages from which printing plates are made photographically.

1976: Installation of electronic writing and editing equipment in the newsroom.

1985: Searchable electronic archive of Journal stories launched.

1987: $60-million Journal printing plant with flexographic presses opens on Kinsley Avenue, designed to produce 70,000 papers an hour, 20,000 more than the letterpresses they replaced.

1995: Journal launches Rhode Island Horizons, an online newspaper hosted by the Prodigy dial-up service.

1996: Journal launches projo.com, the paper's first website.

2001: Journal ends phase-in to digital photography.

2003: Journal correspondent in Iraq sends stories from the battlefield to Providence via satellite telephone.

2003: Journal launches daily email newsletter, starting with deals from the paper's advertisers, followed by Red Sox stories and breaking news.

2008: Journal website regularly includes video.

2011: Journal mobile app debuts.

March 9, 2025: The last Journal to be printed in Providence rolls off the flexographic press at Kinsley Avenue.","{'href': 'https://www.providencejournal.com', 'title': 'The Providence Journal'}"

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial regulator said on Wednesday it will launch a pilot program to relax merger and acquisition (M&A) loan issuance to technology firms, according to a statement released by the National Financial Regulatory Administration.

Under the pilot program, the proportion of such loans will be allowed to account for as much as 80% of a firm's total M&A transactions, up from no more than 60% under current rules, the regulator said. The loan term will be relaxed to a maximum of 10 years from the current seven years, it said.

The pilot program will cover 18 cities including Shanghai and Beijing, according to the statement.

Tadek Ocean Engineering is celebrating 15 years in business with an expansion into new UK offices and a landmark 300 projects. 

Tadek specialises in the delivery of pioneering cable systems, risk advisory and analysis work to developers and owners of fixed and floating assets across marine, offshore and subsea sectors. They also focus on grassroots work in installation analysis and project engineering and management.

They are also rapidly enhancing expertise in offshore renewables, including pre-FEED optioneering studies to FOW (Floating Offshore Wind) developers plus MRE (Marine Renewable Energy) and floating solar projects.

As the UK targets 50GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, the need for advanced engineering and risk mitigation services is growing, said Tarek CEO R. Raymond. ""Tadek has been delivering complex offshore engineering solutions for more than a decade. During that period, we have gradually built a solid reputation supporting some of the largest industry brands around the world.""

""The Floating Offshore Wind sector in particular is evolving rapidly, and Tadek is at the forefront of delivering the technical solutions required to accelerate its deployment,"" said Raymond. ""We can play a critical role with knowledge and experience from O&G, fixed & FOW wind, wave & tidal to bring in lessons learnt to optimize project execution and minimizing uncertainties in design, installation, and operations.""

Recent expansion to new offices in One Crown Square, Woking, near London, comes as Tadek recorded its 300th project – ranging from small prototype projects to corporate deals. The milestone event was attended by Cllr Louise Morales, the 50th Mayor of Woking, in recognition of Tadek’s contribution to the local economy and its growing impact in the offshore renewables sector.

He added, ""Our new office expansion reflects our ambition for growth and strengthens our ability to support industry with practical engineering expertise and strategic consultancy.""

""This is more of a leadership role,"" said  Raymond. ""Rather than operating as a subcontractor, we now speak directly with the end client, advising them on project decisions to ensure most robust, cost-effective and timely solutions.""

PHOENIX — U.S. Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona defended the CHIPS Act on Wednesday after President Donald Trump called it “a horrible, horrible thing” during his speech to Congress.

“Instead of attacking the CHIPS Act, we ought to be celebrating it as a huge, successful policy — a bipartisan win for the United States of America,” Stanton told KTAR News 92.3 FM’s Arizona’s Morning News.

Trump took aim at the Biden-era legislation during his speech before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.

“Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn’t mean a thing. They take our money and they don’t spend it,” the president said.

He also suggested to House Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress should eliminate the CHIPS Act, drawing applause from Republicans.

“You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever’s left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to,” Trump said.

Stanton disagreed with Trump about the effectiveness of the CHIPS Act, saying it established the U.S. as a leader in a pivotal industry.

“The CHIPS Act is not just subsidizing the semiconductor industry. … It’s an investment in workforce training, and it’s an investment in the science behind … this most important technology,” the Valley Democrat said.

Then-President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August 2022, authorizing tens of billion of dollars for domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing.

Arizona has been a major beneficiary through the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which is building a massive chipmaking operation in north Phoenix.

“Since we’ve done the CHIPS Act, we have had more foreign direct investment — including TSMC — in Phoenix, more than any other place in the United States of America. It has been a massive success,” Stanton said.

After already committing $40 billion for two microchip fabrication plants in north Phoenix, TSMC was awarded $6.6 billion in grants plus loans of up to $5 million through the 2022 law. The company then added a third Phoenix fab to its plans in April 2024, boosting its investment to a total of $65 billion.

On Monday, TSMC revealed plans to pump another $100 billion into its U.S. operations. The new investment will go toward two more packaging fabs and a research and development center in Arizona.

A day after joining TSMC officials to announce the latest expansion at the White House on Monday, Trump said his tariff policy influenced the company’s decision.

“We’re giving them no money,” the president said Tuesday night. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs. So, they came and they’re building.”

Stanton, meanwhile, argued that the new investment wouldn’t have been possible without the foundation laid by the previous administration.

“Without the CHIPS Act and the statement by Congress that we want to be a leader in this industry, the very investment that the president announced … in Phoenix would not be happening,” he said.

Wednesday, March 5, 2025

At ITB Berlin, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and Trip.com Group introduced a trailblazing report, Technology Game Changers: Future Trends in Travel & Tourism, which unveils the transformative technologies set to revolutionize the travel industry.



This forward-thinking report highlights 16 cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of travel across four key domains: Digital Technologies, Financial Technologies, the Future of Mobility, and Breakthrough Innovations.



The Future of Travel
The report predicts that, by the end of the decade, artificial intelligence will transcend its role in automating travel bookings and searches. AI agents are expected to rival human intelligence in handling a variety of travel-related tasks, drastically transforming the tourism landscape.



Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers. These innovations will redefine the way we experience the world.



Julia Simpson, President & CEO of WTTC, said: “The Travel & Tourism sector is in the midst of a digital revolution. From AI-driven personalisation to advancements in aviation sustainability, innovation is reshaping how we explore the world.  



“As travellers turn to social media, streaming platforms, and cutting-edge tech to inspire and book trips in real time, platforms like Instagram are shifting from selling products to selling experiences. Meanwhile, technology is unlocking new adventures off the beaten track. 



“With innovation accelerating at an extraordinary pace, businesses embrace these advancements today will be the industry leaders of tomorrow.” 



Boon Sian Chai, Managing Director & Vice President of International Markets at Trip.com Group, added: “Travellers today expect planning and booking to be intuitive, efficient, and hyper-personalised.  



“At Trip.com Group, we are pioneering AI-powered travel assistance, Super Apps, and innovations to cater to, and even exceed such expectations. This report is also an essential guide for businesses looking to stay ahead of rapid digital change.” 



The Future of Travel Is Here
A recent report reveals exciting developments shaping the future of the travel and tourism industry, highlighting key trends that are already making waves.



AI Reshaping the Travel ExperienceArtificial Intelligence is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the industry, with 94% of leaders in the sector identifying it as essential. AI-powered services like TripGenie from Trip.com have seen a remarkable 200% increase in usage in 2024, revolutionizing the way travelers plan trips and engage with customer service, offering a more personalized and efficient experience.



Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.



Space Tourism Nears RealityOnce confined to the realm of science fiction, space tourism is now rapidly becoming a reality. With the accelerating development of infrastructure and rising consumer demand, the dream of commercial space travel is closer than ever, promising a new frontier for adventure tourism.



Transforming the Industry
The report stresses the urgent need for investment in digital skills and robust regulatory frameworks to fully harness the potential of these technologies.



With 91% of travel businesses planning to boost their tech investments, the industry is on the brink of its most profound transformation since the rise of the Internet. Exclusive insights from industry giants like Trip.com Group, Hilton, Qatar Airways, and MSC Cruises highlight how global leaders are already capitalizing on these innovations to drive change and enhance the travel experience for the future.

The report predicts that, by the end of the decade, artificial intelligence will transcend its role in automating travel bookings and searches. AI agents are expected to rival human intelligence in handling a variety of travel-related tasks, drastically transforming the tourism landscape.



Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers.

The Future of Travel Is Here
A recent report reveals exciting developments shaping the future of the travel and tourism industry, highlighting key trends that are already making waves.



AI Reshaping the Travel ExperienceArtificial Intelligence is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the industry, with 94% of leaders in the sector identifying it as essential.

Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.



Space Tourism Nears RealityOnce confined to the realm of science fiction, space tourism is now rapidly becoming a reality. With the accelerating development of infrastructure and rising consumer demand, the dream of commercial space travel is closer than ever, promising a new frontier for adventure tourism.

UK Watchdog Drops Competition Review of Microsoft's OpenAI Deal

LONDON (AP) — Britain's competition watchdog said Wednesday it has dropped its review of Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, saying it's satisfied that the deal doesn't need a closer investigation under the country's merger rules. 

The Competition and Markets Authority said that based on “available evidence,"" the partnership between the U.S. tech giant and the ChatGPT maker doesn't qualify for a merger investigation. 

“In particular the CMA does not consider there has been a change of control by Microsoft from material influence to de facto control over OpenAI,” the watchdog said in a statement. 

Microsoft was a big initial backer of OpenAI, plowing billions of dollars into the San Francisco-based startup in its early days. But since then OpenAI has attracted other big investors including Japan's Softbank and chipmaker Nvidia after its success with ChatGPT. 

The CMA has stepped up scrutiny of AI deals amid a wave of investment from Big Tech companies into startups working on generative artificial intelligence. Last year it approved another Microsoft deal involving Inflection AI as well as partnerships with chatbot maker Anthropic by Google and Amazon.

MacGregor, part of Cargotec, has been awarded a contract to deliver a 100T AHC crane for a dive support vessel owned by Jana Marine Service Company.

The crane delivery to the Guangzhou Salvage shipyard is scheduled in the second quarter 2026, with vessel delivery later that year..

MacGregor's local sales team will work in close cooperation with Guangzhou Salvage throughout the project to ensure the crane's seamless integration into the vessel and optimise its performance.

""Our 100T AHC crane is a proven solution that offers superior performance and reliability. We are confident that it will meet the customer's needs and exceed its expectations,” said Pasi Lehtonen, Senior Vice President, Offshore Solutions, MacGregor.

The contract, which was booked in the fourth quarter 2024, is not reported as part of Cargotec’s orders received, as MacGregor is reported as part of discontinued operations.

To remind, Cargotec said in November 2024 it would sell its cargo handler business MacGregor to European private equity firm Triton in a deal valued at $506 million, including debt.

Inspira Technologies* reports groundbreaking clinical results for its AI-powered HYLA blood sensor, achieving 96% accuracy in a key parameter and 92.3% accuracy in detecting oxygen deficiencies. These impressive findings provide new validation the company's innovative non-invasive monitoring technology and strengthen its position in both the $5.7 billion blood gas analyzer market and the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market. With FDA submission on track for H2 2025 and the INSPIRA ART100 system already being deployed to U.S. hospitals, the company continues to build momentum in its multi-pronged strategy to revolutionize critical care.


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PESG Research releases an update following groundbreaking clinical evaluation results: Inspira Technologies* (NASDAQ: IINN) has reported exceptional clinical study outcomes for its HYLA blood sensor, with 96% accuracy achieved in a key parameter compared to traditional blood analyzers. This milestone achievement validates the company's AI-powered continuous blood monitoring technology and accelerates its path toward commercial deployment in multiple healthcare settings.





Promising Clinical Validation at Premier Medical Institution



The clinical study, conducted at Sheba Hospital (ranked among the world's top 8 hospitals by Newsweek), successfully demonstrated the HYLA sensor's capabilities across 6 patients undergoing open-heart surgery. The clip-on device monitored blood parameters in real-time as blood circulated through the cardiopulmonary bypass system, achieving impressive concordance with conventional laboratory testing methods. Notably, the study also validated a new indicator for identifying oxygen deficiencies, showing 92.3% accuracy – a critical capability for preventing hypoxia during surgical procedures.



This clinical validation at one of the world's premier medical institutions represents a significant de-risking event for the company's core technology. As Dagi Ben-Noon, CEO of Inspira, noted, ""Achieving 96% accuracy as reflected in our clinical results in real-time blood monitoring without the need for blood draws represents a significant technological breakthrough.""



Expanding Technology Ecosystem Shows Commercial Progress



The successful HYLA clinical results come amid accelerating commercial momentum for Inspira's broader product ecosystem. The company's INSPIRA ART100 system, which received FDA 510(k) clearance in May 2024 for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, is now being deployed at leading U.S. hospitals through distribution partner Glo-Med Networks. The system was recently enhanced with new support features designed to assist medical teams, reduce staff overhead, and improve efficiency during critical procedures.



Additionally, in February 2025, Inspira reported positive initial results from its collaboration with Ennocure MedTech Ltd. to develop a novel bio-electronic treatment for preventing bloodstream infections. Ex-vivo testing demonstrated a 95% reduction in bacterial presence within 4 hours, showing promise for addressing the estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections related to intravenous lines occurring worldwide annually.



Inspira’s Strategy Targets Multiple High-Value Markets



The successful clinical validation of the HYLA blood sensor represents a crucial step in Inspira's strategy to penetrate multiple high-value medical technology markets. As a standalone technology, HYLA targets the blood gas analyzer market, which the company projects will reach $5.7 billion by 2030 (up from previous estimates of $2.5 billion). When integrated with Inspira's respiratory support systems, the technology strengthens the company's position in the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market.



Inspira's approach of combining AI-enhanced monitoring capabilities with innovative respiratory support solutions addresses a critical unmet need in healthcare. With approximately 20 million patients annually requiring mechanical ventilation globally and mortality rates exceeding 50% under current protocols, Inspira's technology ecosystem offers a potential paradigm shift in critical care management by enabling conscious patient treatment with continuous monitoring.

Rare Dionysian Cult Fresco Uncovered in Pompeii, Revealing Secret Rites

Photo Credit: Parco archeologico di Pompei

Archaeologists have revealed a significant discovery in Pompeii—a large fresco depicting the initiation rites of an ancient mystery cult. The artwork, which stretches across three walls of a banquet hall, was found in the recently excavated House of Thiasus. The painting portrays maenads, female followers of Dionysus, engaged in hunting and rituals. Scenes of young satyrs playing the flute and offering wine sacrifices are also depicted. At the centre of the fresco, an elderly satyr is shown guiding a young woman through an initiation ceremony. The discovery sheds new light on the practices associated with the cult of Dionysus, a god linked to wine, revelry, and resurrection.

According to a statement by the Pompeii Archaeological Park, the fresco suggests that Roman initiates may have participated in hunting activities as part of their induction into the Dionysian mysteries. This aligns with earlier Greek traditions, where Dionysus was associated with the wilderness and untamed animals. The painting's vivid imagery, set against a deep red background, provides a rare glimpse into these secretive rites. The only other comparable fresco, discovered in 1909 at the Villa of the Mysteries, features similar figures but lacks any depiction of hunting.

Gabriel Zuchtriegel, Director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, said in an official statement that the fresco highlights a depiction of women breaking societal norms—dancing freely, hunting, and consuming raw meat. The presence of such imagery suggests that the cult's practices endured despite a Roman ban on Dionysian rituals in 186 B.C. The House of Thiasus and the Villa of the Mysteries both date back to the first century B.C., indicating that these secretive rites persisted long after they were officially outlawed.

As per a statement by Italian Minister of Culture Alessandro Giuli, the fresco represents an unparalleled historical record, offering insight into lesser-known aspects of classical Mediterranean life. Visitors to Pompeii can now view the House of Thiasus as part of the ongoing excavation tours, allowing a closer look at this rare and detailed depiction of an ancient mystery cult.

Lu, responding to a question about China's progress in the field of artificial intelligence, said that what the young team of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has achieved ""is commendable,"" Reuters reported.

He added that DeepSeek follows an open-source approach and promotes the widespread use of AI technology globally, and that through the rise of companies like DeepSeek, we can see the innovation and inclusiveness of Chinese technological development.

""AI startup DeepSeek has been praised in China since it recently shook up the global tech sector by introducing AI models that cost a fraction of what American rivals like OpenAI have developed,"" Lu noted.

New survey reveals consumers are benefitting from crypto in many ways but crave more education


Visit NCA.org to learn more and meet some of the everyday people benefitting from crypto in their personal and professional lives.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a new non-profit organization dedicated to helping Americans better understand crypto, launches today with the goal of boosting crypto literacy and safe adoption across the country. The NCA will demystify crypto and serve as a resource for anyone and everyone using, holding, or wanting to learn more.





“Crypto going mainstream is no longer a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’,” said Stuart Alderoty, President of the NCA. “Millions are already benefiting from crypto making it quicker and easier to shop online, send money anywhere in the world, create apps, art and games, or build financial futures. We’re giving a voice to users from all walks of life and serving as a guide for how to use crypto responsibly.”



The NCA partnered with Harris Poll to survey 10,000 current crypto holders in the U.S. and found that 81% are interested in learning more about the future of crypto. To bridge the gap, the NCA is providing educational resources, including easy-to-understand explainers and real stories from everyday people using crypto.



“The opportunity for crypto - especially in the US - is now stronger than ever,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. “That’s why I’m proud to announce that Ripple will be funding the NCA with a $50 million grant to educate, raise awareness and shine a spotlight on all the positives that crypto is bringing to people across the country.”



The survey also found that one in five American adults already use crypto and 76% of users say it has positively impacted their lives, giving them increased financial independence, opportunities for learning and personal growth, and fun and excitement from being part of a new and innovative field. Crypto is also providing opportunity for consumers far beyond finance:

About the National Cryptocurrency Association:



The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) is a 501(C)(4) organization dedicated to educating consumers about how to engage with crypto. Crypto is positively impacting the lives of millions of Americans but misinformation has held back those who stand to benefit. The NCA is here to help people make sense of crypto by sharing the stories of real people and businesses using crypto, providing educational resources to navigate the hype and confusion, and offering guidance and support through partnerships and services.



Harris Poll Survey Methodology



The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the National Cryptocurrency Association among 10,000 cryptocurrency holders. The survey was conducted January 22, 2025, through February 3, 2025. More detailed findings will be published in a report in March.



Data are weighted where necessary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, employment, household income, and political party affiliation to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.



Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within ± 1.2 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.



All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- Here's a quick cryptocurrency scam tip.

According to the FBI, consumers lost about $5.6 billion in cryptocurrency fraud in 2023.





Some experts are warning that it's a crypto scam crisis.

The investment law firm Carlson Law says its recent study shows Illinois ranks sixth in the nation, with a staggering 74% increase in investment fraud.

Scammers are using artificial intelligence-generated videos featuring fake images of Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos promoting bogus opportunities.

There are also reports of scammers capitalizing on the hype around the legitimate $Trump and $Melania crypto coins.

When investing, only use trusted crypto exchanges.

Tech expert Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.

Many of us have families to look after. We save money not only for our own future but also – perhaps even more so – for our kids and grandkids. We want to secure a good education, help them buy a home or simply set aside something for when they need it. 

So did Tony. He’d saved a substantial amount for his sons' future, more than $4 million in bitcoin. And with just one click, he lost it all to vishing, a type of scam that uses phone calls to trick people into giving up sensitive information. 

Scammers posed as Google Support agents and, after an elaborate scheme, first caught his attention, then gained his trust and ultimately left him with nothing. 

""Please, man. Is there anything you can do to give me something back?"" was Tony’s final, desperate plea to the scammers, hoping to appeal to their humanity.

Vishing, short for ""voice phishing,"" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.

Because vishing relies heavily on social engineering tactics, it can be difficult to detect, making it a particularly dangerous form of cybercrime.

Let's break down these vishing schemes to understand why they are so effective. Once you see them as a staged play consisting of different acts, it becomes easier to recognize the individual tactics.

Scammers start by identifying potential victims through social media, public transaction records, leaked databases, and more. Once they select a target, they gather personal details (email, phone number, financial holdings) to build credibility. And you could easily be a target. That’s because data brokers – companies that buy and sell your personal information – are goldmines for scammers. Your entire profile is likely out there, containing everything they need to run a successful scam: your name, address, contact details, family members, owned properties and more.

How to protect yourself at this stage:

Scammers always initiate contact first. Let’s walk through a vishing scam using a Google account as an example.

How to protect yourself at this stage:

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET 

Scammers no longer ask for passwords outright. That trick doesn’t work anymore. Here's what they do instead.

After you successfully reset your password, scammers ask for one final step: log in. This is where the real scam happens.

How to protect yourself at this stage:

THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 

At this stage, the scammers end the call, leaving you feeling at ease. You won’t realize what happened until it’s too late. And it’s not just Google accounts at risk. The same method can be used to access Apple accounts, banking services and cryptocurrency wallets. For some, losing access to Google alone is devastating; after all, Google Drive, Google Photos and other cloud services store vast amounts of personal and financial data. But by the time you realize what’s happened, it’s already too late.

How to protect yourself at this stage:

While securing your accounts and reporting fraud are crucial after a scam has already occurred, the best defense is preventing these attacks in the first place. Taking these steps can help ensure you don’t fall victim to a vishing scam in the first place.

1. Invest in personal data removal services: These scams all have one thing in common: they need some of your personal info to work. Without your name, phone number or email, these scams can't happen. Scammers might even try to gain your trust by sharing more of your personal info, like your Social Security number, to seem more believable. I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

2. Set up recovery contacts: Establish backup contacts for your accounts (Google, Apple and bank) to ensure you have a way to regain access if locked out.

3. Monitor financial accounts: Regularly check your financial accounts for any suspicious activity or unauthorized transactions.

4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable 2FA on all accounts, especially Google, Apple and financial services. This adds an extra layer of security, making it harder for scammers to access your accounts even if they obtain your login credentials.

5. Secure devices: Ensure your devices are secured with screen locks or biometric authentication and keep software up to date to prevent malware attacks.

6. Report scams promptly: If you've been scammed, report the fraud immediately to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov and notify the affected platforms.

7. Use strong antivirus software: Install and regularly update strong antivirus software to protect your devices from malware, viruses and other cyber threats. Antivirus software provides real-time protection, scans for malicious files and helps prevent infections by blocking access to harmful websites and downloads. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

Tony's story is a chilling reminder that even the most diligent savers can fall victim to sophisticated scams. These vishing schemes, carefully orchestrated like a theatrical play, exploit our trust and leverage real security alerts to gain access to our accounts. Protecting ourselves requires constant awareness, skepticism towards unsolicited communications, and proactive measures to safeguard our personal information. While the tactics may evolve, the underlying principle remains the same: scammers rely on deception to exploit our vulnerabilities. By understanding their methods and taking preventative steps, we can make it harder for them to succeed.

Bitcoin has broken back above $90,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back after a roller coaster week that’s seen U.S. president Donald Trump trigger bitcoin and crypto price chaos.

The bitcoin price has climbed around 10% over the last 24 hours, pushing the combined crypto market back over $3 trillion, helped by BlackRock revealing a market game-changer.

Now, as Elon Musk issues a “foolish” crypto warning, Trump’s Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly confirmed Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit.

“The President definitely thinks that there’s a bitcoin strategic reserve,” Lutnick, who has claimed to have millions of dollars worth of exposure to bitcoin, told independent news site The Pavlovic Today. “Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

Lutnick added that bitcoin would receive a ""unique status"" under Trump's plans.

“This is massive,” Pete Rizzo, the former Coindesk editor-in-chief who styles himself as a “bitcoin historian,” posted to X.

On Friday, the first White House crypto summit will see influential crypto executives, founders and investors meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets to hash out a regulatory road map for crypto as well as confirm details of Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve.

“After a turbulent week of trading bitcoin has sharply rebounded to the $90,000 mark ahead of this Friday’s inaugural crypto summit,"" Petr Kozyakov, the chief executive of payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments.

“Renewed optimism that U.S. president Donald Trump will make the announcement of a bitcoin reserve strategy is triggering a wave of buy orders for the king of crypto. A road map forward towards a crypto strategic reserve and a model for how it would be structured will be foremost in the minds of industry leaders attending the summit. The prospect of such a monumental move is bullish and may turn sentiment around in a digital token space still reeling from the recent hack of the Bybit exchange, the biggest of all time, and an implosion of the meme coin sector.”

Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano all rocketed higher last weekend after Trump posted to his Truth Social account that he plans to create a U.S.-focused crypto reserve.

“A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding in a follow up post that bitcoin and ethereum would also be included.

Smaller cryptocurrencies being named ahead of bitcoin in a potential reserve sparked a backlash from some bitcoin supporters and led to criticism of Trump’s advisors who are believed to be acting in their own interest.

In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve.

""We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead,"" Trump told CNBC.

""Yes, I think so,"" Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve.

In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a ""strategic national bitcoin reserve"" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Newscom)

President Donald Trump's push for the U.S. government to hold a strategic bitcoin reserve has won the support of some crypto bulls in the U.S. Congress despite doubts that it could be accomplished in the near term.

One prominent supporter, Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who introduced the bill for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve, said the lack of congressional support remains a major hurdle.

""It was hard for me to hear that my colleagues, even on my side of the aisle, were not ready,"" Lummis said at the Bitcoin Investor Day event in New York City on Friday.

She cited Tim Scott, chairman of the House Banking Committee, whom she said argued that ""we might need to put a pin for a little while in the bitcoin strategic reserve because we're not there yet,"" Lummis said. She says the biggest hurdle facing the creation of a strategic reserve is a lack of congressional support.

In a series of social media posts over the weekend, Trump said his administration would move forward with a crypto strategic reserve, naming several tokens that would be included. The named tokens included bitcoin, ethereum, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano, all of which soared in value after Trump's post on Sunday afternoon.



Creating a strategic reserve would effectively establish an institutional price floor for bitcoin and other tokens included in the reserve.

The mechanics behind how a strategic reserve would be created and run are also a source of controversy and debate. It remains unclear if Trump can use executive powers to create a strategic reserve or if it would require an act of Congress.

One alternative is to create a strategic reserve out of bitcoin and other crypto already confiscated through the Department of Justice, although the mechanism of such a transfer remains unclear.

Lummis, an established bitcoin bull, is well-known for her advocacy of bitcoin in government. In July 2024, the senator introduced the bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, where the Treasury would hold all bitcoins for at least 20 years unless used to pay off federal debt. The bill, which is often cited as a concrete way the government can establish a strategic reserve, was referred to the Senate Banking Committee where it has remained.

In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Lummis owned roughly $250,000 of bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls, meanwhile, remain undeterred. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest CEO, told IBD she fully expects the U.S. government's confiscated bitcoin will ultimately be used to establish the crypto reserve. She also expects the government to sell some of its land and gold to fund more purchases of bitcoin. ""I think we could do some diversification of our asset base and get to that $1 million bitcoin goal with those sorts of asset sales,"" she said.

Other pro-bitcoin voices say the one-two punch of a strategic reserve and reduced government regulation are set to provide crypto with its new catalyst for rising valuation. ""With regards to regulation, I think it should be clear rules, I think it should allow for international competition,"" Matt Cole, Strive Asset Management CEO, told IBD. ""You can't do business in a country if you don't know the law.""

During the Biden Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission pursued multiple investigations with the intent of establishing whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were securities and therefore should fall under SEC jurisdiction, a key step in future regulation. Ongoing cases against Robinhood, Coinbase and other major entities were dismissed by the SEC under the Trump Administration.

Other bitcoin bulls are cooler on the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. ""I don't really think a strategic reserve is absolutely necessary,"" Dan Tapiero, CEO and chief investment officer of 1RoundTable Partners & 10T Holdings, told IBD. Tapiero is a leading investor in crypto-focused businesses, with $1.5 billion invested in various crypto-related ventures and funds.

While he thinks a reserve would ultimately help the crypto market and help taxpayers, he remains pessimistic over the mechanics of creating a new reserve. ""It's very complicated when you look at assets that a central bank or a treasury holds,"" he said.

But Tapiero remains supportive of the rapid pace the Trump Administration is taking to crypto. ""It's just been fantastic, the speed of change,"" he said. ""Over the medium term we're going to see that also lead to an increase in adoption.""

Trump's strategic reserve posts have provided rocket fuel for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin soared past $90,000 per coin in late Sunday trades on Trump's posts, this after dipping just below $80,000 on Thursday.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were previously on a hot streak, hitting market highs following in December and January following Trump's election on expectations of lowered regulations and campaign trail promises of a strategic reserve. But earlier in February, the cryptocurrency took a beating over a risk-off mood from investors, fueled by Trump's tariff threats and fears about economic shakiness.

Adding to the earlier sour mood around crypto, a recent hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit saw more than $1.4 billion in ether stolen through a sophisticated attack on a cold-to-warm wallet transaction. CEO Ben Zhou claims Bybit remains solvent.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Nascar’s official X accounts were both hacked by scammers alleging both organisations were launching cryptocurrencies.

Malicious posts appeared on the NBA’s main profile, along with country-specific channels, on Tuesday. Similarly, accounts relating to Nascar’s key competitions, including the Nascar Cup, were also affected.

Each post falsely proclaimed the launch of the non-existent $NBA and $Nascar coins on the Solina blockchain, along with a document purporting to be an official press release.

‘The NBA is taking the game to the next level. Introducing $NBA Coin – our official digital asset on Solana designed to enhance fan engagement and the future of sports transactions’, read one post, along with a link to a contract address.

The NBA attempted to delete the offending tweets, however the scammers were able to repost the message on several occasions before the situation was resolved.

The hacks are the latest in a series of incidents to affect high-profile individuals and organisations in recent times, with scammers hoping to use their perceived endorsement to trick everyday users and investors to part with their cash for non-existent crypto assets.

According to one analysis, crypto scams generated at least US$9.9 billion during 2024, an increase of 40 per cent year on year, although this figure could reach US$12.4 billion once additional data is taken into account.



Sport is unique among businesses and public institutions because of the high degree of loyalty, emotion and trust they inspire in fans. This is precisely why so many brands are keen to enter into commercial relationships with athletes, teams and competitions.

It’s therefore unsurprising that social media accounts with millions of followers are so attractive to scammers. Indeed one of the reasons that so many sports organisations were late adopters of social media was because of the risk of being hacked and the negative publicity. Of course it was realised the positives far outweigh the negatives.

Accordingly, with great power comes great responsibility, and sports organisations should ensure their cybersecurity policies are as robust as possible – particularly when it comes to approving users and protecting credentials.

But equally, there is a responsibility of platforms to protect their users. While cryptoscams can affect any social media service, this hack is the latest in a series of incidents to afflict X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, since Elon Musk completed his acquisition in 2022.

Should sport determine a platform is more trouble than its worth, then it will vote with its feet.

 Howard Lutnick said Bitcoin will likely be treated differently than the other assets tipped to be in the US crypto reserve. 

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration will unveil plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

In an interview with The Pavlovic Today, Lutnick clarified that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely have a special status in the country’s national cryptocurrency reserve, which will include Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP).

“The president definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” Secretary Lutnick said. “Now, there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies. And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

President Donald Trump has faced criticism since announcing on social media that the country’s crypto reserve would include assets other than Bitcoin. Critics say centralized altcoins should not be included alongside Bitcoin, which is the only decentralized commodity that can be used as a long-term store of wealth.

Even notorious Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff, who refused to invest in the digital asset when it was valued at less than $100, said he understands the rationale behind a BTC-only reserve but not one that includes altcoins.

In response, Lutnick reiterated Trump’s interest in a Bitcoin-only stockpile without dismissing the other assets in the proposed basket.

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently,” said Lutnick.

The summit reflects the US government’s historic pivot toward digital assets under President Trump, who vowed to make America the blockchain and crypto capital of the world during the election. 

Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission has established a Crypto Task Force to carve out a “sensible regulatory path” for the sector. The task force has already met with several industry representatives to better understand their regulatory pain points. 

Meanwhile, the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence has engaged with industry experts on a range of issues, from stablecoin regulations to which agency should be given spot market authority over crypto.

You can’t really get a more bearish chart for BTC than this:

In my opinion, the future is very likely to unfold like this:

Only an incredible event can turn this around. $60,000 is a destination, and $40,000 is a possibility.

So, we have the U.S. Crypto Reserve becoming a thing. We have the SEC, etc., lifting its boot from crypto’s neck. We have trade wars, global conniptions, and all the other random factors that are supposed to propel bitcoin to the moon – and yet, the chart looks like a classic developing bust.

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Gold is for war, and bitcoin is for flight. You can see Ukrainian interests selling, buying, and selling their flight capital as the news flow surges back and forth.

So, what’s the big picture?

The U.S. economy is about to go into a tailspin because of tariffs – unless this is ‘3D Chess’!

Tariffs are a sales tax on Americans – a big, flat tax on everyone. The foreign suppliers don’t pay the tariff; the importer does. It’s a trillion dollar tax increase. If new money isn’t printed, a depression ensues. This leads to stagflation or stag-deflation – a drop in GDP. Then, the U.S. government cuts 15% from its spending. That triggers an even deeper economic collapse as the money stops circulating, a million government employees join the unemployment lines, and terrified consumers stop spending, causing the economy to fold.

So what does this mean for crypto? Crypto needs fiat inflows to rise in fiat price. When money’s too tight to mention, inflows reverse.

Does anyone think the stock market is going to keep rising like ‘homesick angel’ now? Can anyone not imagine the Nasdaq at 15,000?

Even if the current administration plays the situation like Paganini plucking a Stradivarius, the disruption already underway is going to knock the froth off risk assets – because only stability unleashes risk assets, while real risks kills them dead.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,Crypto meets home loans: The rise of bitcoin-backed HELOCs,https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/crypto-meets-home-loans-the-rise-of-bitcoin-backed-helocs,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The positive vibes coming out of the Trump Administration towards cryptocurrency are spilling over into its presence in the home lending business.

That will likely drive further growth in both new and existing offerings of products linked to Bitcoin and other digital tokens.

At one point after the election, Bitcoin was trading at just under $106,500, although recently it has been in a slide, briefly dropping under $80,000 on Feb. 27 before rebounding to hit $84,756 during trading the following day. While it spiked back up over $94,000 in the immediate aftermath of the president's crypto strategic reserve announcement, by 3:30 p.m. eastern time on March 3, it was back to $86,166.

Figure Markets, which is a pioneer in using blockchain to support residential lending, is bringing to market a Bitcoin-backed home equity line of credit product. Figure Technology Solutions recently entered into a private lending joint venture with Sixth Street.

It is the first time the HELOC funds can be directly converted to Bitcoin rather than cash, the company said, with the cryptocurrency held in escrow.

Figure did its first loan in 2018, the first securitization in 2020 and three years later its first AAA-rated securitization, said Mike Cagney, its CEO, in an interview with National Mortgage News. So far it has done around $43 million of loans on the blockchain.

The company has gone beyond HELOCs and into other forms of lending. ""One of the things we initially were looking at back in the day was the Bitcoin mortgage,"" said Cagney. ""Where, if you had a million dollars in Bitcoin, we would let you buy a million-dollar home with effectively no underwriting.""

However, this idea emerged just as Bitcoin prices crashed, and interest in Bitcoin mortgages disappeared. Today, with cryptocurrency gaining mainstream acceptance—even earning the president's endorsement—the landscape has shifted, Cagney argued.

""People want exposure to crypto and this is a way for them to use their home equity to get that exposure,"" he said. ""It's really just a vehicle in which you can tap your home equity and use those proceeds as collateral and be able to borrow more than you'd be able to if you were buying a pool, or consolidating your debt, or doing other stuff that people do to use HELOCs for.""

The product works like a traditional HELOC, with a draw period, depending on the term of the loan, of between three to five years. It's open and unlimited draws during that time and borrowers can pay back and take out additional proceeds, he noted.

""You could draw $1 of cash or $2 of Bitcoin. You can mix it up… as long as you're putting that Bitcoin as collateral, gives you the option of choosing between cash and coin,"" Cagney said.

Right now, Americans hold $30 trillion of unencumbered home equity.

""It's not crazy for me to think that 10% of those people would like to use that home equity to buy Bitcoin,"" Cagney said. ""Close to 30% of U.S. investors hold crypto and so at 10% there's a $3 trillion demand for this out there.""

Another company combining crypto and mortgage is Milo. The Miami-based firm just announced it has done $65 million in total volume for its crypto mortgage offerings since it started in 2021.

Milo works with funds in either Bitcoin or Ethereum. Many of its clients have owned crypto currencies for a long time and don't want to sell it in order to finance their property, explained Josip Rupena, Milo's CEO. Besides no longer owning the digital currency that is likely to continue to appreciate in value, a sale would trigger a taxable event.

So in using that crypto as security, Milo is able to provide 100% loan-to-value financing for the home. ""They will transfer that Bitcoin to us through Coinbase,"" Rupena said. ""It sits there in cold storage, and then when they pay back the loan, it gets released and it goes back to them.""

Events like the so-called ""crypto winter"" might have held back growth. The more favorable stance on crypto from the federal government is a positive for Milo to continue to expand its market, Rupena said.

It was after the May 2022 collapse of Luna and TerraUSD cryptocurrencies that Milo brought another product to market, a cash-out refinance that works similar to the purchase mortgage by allowing borrowers to access 100% of their home's equity by pledging their crypto assets and the property to secure the loan.

A likely purchase mortgage customer for Milo's product is one that has been on the sidelines, not because of the affordability issue, but because they wanted to keep their crypto rather than sell it to finance their home buy.

""We are seeing that they're able to take advantage of a flat and sometimes declining real estate market, and they're not having to compete against so many people like in the previous few years where every home for sale right was being bid up,"" said Rupena

""The market has changed, [and] our customers are getting an opportunity to finally buy those homes, because the markets are coming in their direction from price perspective as well as the existence of Milo.""

The fact that other firms want to enter this area is healthy for the future, especially since ""everybody has a different take on what a product should be or how it could be structured,"" Rupena said, adding it is good for consumers to have more choices.

When Milo entered this market, a lot of discussion took place regarding how things could go wrong, but not so much as to why it could succeed, he said.

""We've seen it succeed for so many of our clients where they bought homes and their Bitcoin appreciated and their home appreciated, and it turned out incredibly well for them as a wealth creating tool,"" Rupena said. ""Comparatively, I don't think that there's any other traditional mortgage product that comes even close to the benefits to the consumer that our crypto mortgage has.""

The megalender revealed it employed 14,200 team members at the year's end.

Banosian will work with Victor Ciardelli, who remains as the president and CEO of the Chicago-based parent, Rate Cos., overseeing 15 businesses.

The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to its lowest point so far in 2025, driving refinance activity 83% higher than the same time a year ago.

Figure Technologies is adding a Bitcoin option to its home equity line of credit, while Milo has done $65 million of crypto mortgages since 2021.

The automation provider plans to unveil functionality at its upcoming user conference aimed at improving new loan boarding and investor reporting processes.

President Donald Trump said he inherited an ""economic catastrophe"" from his predecessor in a joint address to Congress, though markets fell Tuesday on fears of a budding trade war with Canada and Mexico.

Survey insights show a demand for crypto knowledge as Ripple funds the National Cryptocurrency Association.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ripple has taken a step toward advancing crypto education in the United States by spearheading the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) launch.

The NCA is positioned as an independent, non-partisan organization with no political affiliations. Its primary goal is to provide educational resources and promote a deeper understanding of crypto.

According to a March 5 statement, the initiative has a $50 million grant from Ripple to increase crypto literacy and foster safe adoption nationwide.

Although Ripple is backing the NCA financially, Ripple CEO Brad Garlingouse clarified that the organization will function independently.

Garlinghouse explained that the firm was finding the initiative because of the importance of education in unlocking the potential of digital assets. He noted that the $50 million funding will support awareness campaigns and showcase how crypto benefits individuals nationwide.

The initiative follows a recent survey conducted with Harris Poll, which gathered insights from thousands of US crypto holders.

The results showed a strong desire for a greater understanding of digital assets, with 81% of respondents expressing a strong interest in learning about the emerging industry’s future.

Additionally, 76% of participants reported positive financial impacts from their crypto involvement, citing greater financial independence and learning and personal growth opportunities.

Considering this, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer and the newly appointed president of the NCA, emphasized that the organization’s role would be to make crypto more accessible.

He noted that the NCA will simplify complex concepts through easy-to-understand explainers and real-life stories from crypto users.

He added on X:

“NCA is here to cut through the noise and make sure everyday Americans have the facts, resources and tools, and support they need to engage with crypto confidently. If you’re already benefitting from digital assets in your life or your business, now’s the time to join us and share your story. If you’re just curious, we are here for you to learn more.”

The cryptocurrency platform Ripple is launching a nonprofit focused on educating Americans about the world of crypto.

The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) aims to offer educational tools and resources about crypto, share stories from crypto users and provide crypto data and statistics, said NCA President Stu Alderoty, who also serves as Ripple’s chief legal officer.

“We think that it’s important to make crypto accessible to the everyday American and demystify crypto,” Alderoty told The Hill. “There has been a narrative around crypto, that it’s complex, it’s geeky, crypto bros, etc.”

“Now I think more than ever, crypto is going mainstream, but there is a gap out there,” he continued. “There’s no one place where folks can go to learn more about crypto, get educated about crypto, and also to amplify the voices of the 55 million Americans that own and use crypto.”

The NCA’s website features answers to questions about crypto, including, “What is crypto, and why should I care?” and, “What’s a wallet, and why do I need one?” 

It also acknowledges the industry’s troubled past with questions about avoiding crypto scams and “crypto fraudsters, bankruptcies, and people going to jail.”

The nonprofit is seeking to distinguish itself from other crypto organizations, such as Stand With Crypto and Blockchain Association, emphasizing that it is not a political or lobbying organization and does not represent crypto companies or protocols.

“Not only are we politically agnostic, we’re agnostic to protocol and company,” Alderoty said. “We’re here to amplify the voices of the everyday Americans who own and use crypto and to be a source of information and education for the crypto curious.” 

“I think we’re gonna find a lot more folks in the United States becoming crypto curious as the U.S. starts leaning to become a more pro-crypto country,” he added.

Stand With Crypto, created by Coinbase, emphasized that it partners with crypto organizations but seeks to represent and provide educational tools for crypto voters.

Crypto has become a key priority for President Trump since taking office. Despite once dismissing crypto as a “scam,” Trump came to embrace the industry during his 2024 campaign.

He has since become a vocal proponent of crypto, naming venture capitalist David Sacks as his crypto and artificial intelligence czar and tasking him with developing a legal framework for the industry.

On Sunday, Trump announced his plans to create a crypto strategic reserve, including XRP, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP is Ripple’s token.

Trump’s strategic reserve has received a mixed response from the crypto world. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse touted the idea, saying he appreciates the president’s “vision of a govt digital asset reserve representative of the industry.”

However, others pushed back on the idea of holding tokens other than bitcoin. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, argued Monday that bitcoin is the only digital asset that is suitable for a strategic reserve.

 Trump’s first White House Crypto Summit confirms key industry leaders, fueling speculation over a potential US Bitcoin reserve policy announcement. 

As US President Donald Trump prepares to host the first White House Crypto Summit on March 7, the industry is watching closely to see who will be invited.

The roundtable, scheduled from 6:30 pm to 10:30 pm UTC, is expected to include more than 25 participants, including members of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets, according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett.

As of Wednesday morning, Terrett reported that 11 crypto executives and two White House representatives had confirmed their attendance.

“Unclear as of now who aside from Bo Hines and David Sacks will be in attendance, but if you go back to Trump’s executive order, the presidential working group also includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Attorney General Pam Bondi, the SEC chair, the CFTC chair and others,” Terrett wrote.

The list of crypto executives and government attendees confirmed so far includes the following:

While Terrett’s list didn’t include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, he previously hinted at his attendance in a March 2 post on X soon after Trump’s crypto czar Sacks announced the summit on March 1.

“I will certainly continue to champion this while in Washington at the end of this week,” Garlinghouse wrote.

According to Terret, Trump’s invites were emailed to attendees on March 4 afternoon, implying that Garlinghouse was among the first executives to receive the invitation beforehand.

“A larger, invite-only reception is being planned across the street from the White House for those not invited to the roundtable meeting,” Terrett said, adding that the plans are not fully finalized and things could change.

As speculation around the summit continues, the crypto community has called for the inclusion of other key industry figures, including ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Circle co-founder Jeremy Allaire, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko.

The summit comes as anticipation builds over the Trump administration’s stance on a potential US cryptocurrency reserve.

Trump’s Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has hinted that Bitcoin (BTC) may receive special consideration under the administration’s crypto policy.

“The President definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” Lutnick said, according to a March 5 report by The Pavlovic Today.

“Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that,” Lutnick reportedly noted.

US President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to unveil the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7, according to The Pavlovic Report.

According to the report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that President Trump will outline his vision for the crypto industry during the event. His address will include a strategy for a Bitcoin reserve alongside broader regulatory plans for digital assets.

Lutnick noted that while the President supports the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, discussions on the regulatory approach for altcoins are ongoing.

Lutnick said:

“A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President’s interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday.”

Meanwhile, Lutnick also confirmed that Bitcoin will receive special recognition under Trump’s plan, while other cryptocurrencies will be handled differently under the new policy.

According to Lutnick:

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently—positively, but differently.”

This clarification is necessary, considering Trump’s recent social media post hinted that the crypto reserve plan might include multiple assets such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP.

The White House Crypto Summit will bring together prominent industry figures to discuss regulatory clarity, financial innovation, and economic growth opportunities.

Strategy chairman Michael Saylor confirmed on X that he has been invited to the event, which will be hosted by the President. Strategy is the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world, with nearly 500,000 BTC.

Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey and executives from leading US crypto trading platforms, including Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Kraken’s Arjun Sethi, and Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev, will also attend.

Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett noted that several high-profile industry players, including Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, have also confirmed their participation.

Additionally, venture capitalists, such as Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang and Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, will also be present.

Huang emphasized the importance of US leadership in crypto innovation, stating:

“I look forward to discussing how America can take a leadership role in promoting the principles of open crypto and enabling builders in ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news,3 reasons why Bitcoin sells off on Trump tariff news,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-bitcoin-sells-off-trump-tariffs,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:21:17 GMT","

 Increasing correlation with US stocks and growing fears of ""Trumpcession"" have primarily driven the Bitcoin sell-off. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has declined by more than 15% since Feb. 3—when US President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada—and was trading for as low as around $86,400 as of March 5.

Simultaneously, investors have withdrawn over $3.50 billion in assets from US-based Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) since Feb. 3, according to Farside Investors data.

Let’s examine why news of Trump’s tariffs is leading to selloffs in the Bitcoin market.

The US imposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China on March 4, raising concerns over supply chain disruptions and rising prices, fueling fears of a “Trumpcession.”

Risk assets typically sell off in such scenarios—in August 2019, Trump’s trade war with China triggered an 800-point Dow Jones drop, but Bitcoin surged as Chinese traders used it to bypass capital controls.

The Chinese government took notice of these trends and increased crackdowns on Bitcoin trading and OTC platforms in late 2019 and 2020.

This time, however, Bitcoin is behaving like a risk asset, with its 30-week correlation with the Nasdaq hitting 0.91.

Additionally, JPMorgan has turned “tactically bearish” toward US equities during the trade war, which may hurt Bitcoin if the correlation sustains.

Unlike traditional markets that close on weekends, BTC trades 24/7 and reacts instantly to macroeconomic developments. 

When Trump’s tariff plans were confirmed over a weekend in early February, crypto traders moved quickly, selling off Bitcoin and other assets before stock markets could react. 

This led to a sharp drop on Feb. 3, pushing Bitcoin to a three-week low of $91,000, while the broader crypto market shed over $1 trillion in value from its December peak by late February.

Conversely, Trump’s announcement of a US crypto strategic reserve on March 3—also a Sunday—sparked a 9.58% surge in Bitcoin, marking its strongest daily gain since Nov. 11, 2024.

That further highlights how policy shifts can drive extreme volatility in crypto markets, particularly during weekends when traditional markets are closed and fewer people are trading.

Typically, tariffs should strengthen the US Dollar Index (DXY) by reducing imports and boosting domestic demand. 

However, this time, DXY peaked around Trump’s tariff announcement and has declined since, like Bitcoin, contradicting the usual bullish assumptions.

While Bitcoin and the dollar are both weakening, the euro has strengthened since Feb. 3. This suggests that global investors looking to hedge against the economic impact of tariffs are turning to fiat alternatives like the euro rather than Bitcoin.

Gold, like the euro, has also surged following Trump’s Feb. 3 announcement.

The Japanese Yen (JPY), another perceived safe haven, has climbed 4.5% since Trump’s Feb. 3 announcement.

Furthermore, if the tariff announcement triggers widespread fear of a trade war or economic slowdown, investors might pull out of risk assets and also avoid the dollar if they expect US economic growth to take a hit. 

Therefore, Bitcoin tends to immediately sell off on certain news, such as new tariffs, because economic uncertainty prompts a flight from risk assets, exacerbated by crypto’s round-the-clock trading. 

While some argue this could benefit Bitcoin long-term if inflation spikes, the knee-jerk market response is currently one of panic and retreat.

According to AltcoinGordon, President Trump is preparing to announce a policy of zero capital gains tax on cryptocurrency. This potential policy change could significantly affect cryptocurrency trading dynamics by reducing tax liabilities on crypto transactions, thereby potentially increasing trading volumes and market liquidity. Traders should closely monitor official announcements for confirmation and details of implementation, as such a policy could influence both short-term and long-term trading strategies.

Ethereum developers on Wednesday initially celebrated a seemingly successful test of Pectra, the blockchain’s most significant upgrade since 2024, on the Sepolia test network. However, hours after the test, Sepolia began to encounter errors.

It was the second buggy test for the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which is designed to improve Ethereum's efficiency, user experience, and validator system. The issues have led to calls from some developers that the upgrade be delayed.

Wednesday’s Sepolia test was expected to be the final step before Pectra’s launch on Ethereum’s mainnet. Initially, the test appeared to succeed, but later, developers noticed empty blocks being added to the chain.

The Ethereum Foundation attributed the issue to ""an issue with Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract,"" which ""prevented many execution layer clients from including transactions in blocks."" In other words, the problem stemmed from a misconfiguration specific to the Sepolia test, rather than a flaw with Pectra itself.

Ethereum Foundation developers said they ""identified the root cause within minutes"" and deployed a fix to restore the network’s normal function.

Despite this, the test has raised concerns about whether Pectra has undergone sufficient testing. The previous test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet also ran into configuration issues, that time caused by misconfigured validators.

""I do think the incidents on both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets warrant a delay to Pectra mainnet activation,"" Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital told CoinDesk. Kim noted that while developers may feel ready, the broader Ethereum ecosystem—including major smart contract applications and wallet providers—needs to be prepared.

Kim suggested that Ethereum’s developers ""spend the time to set up additional testing infrastructure"" before launching the upgrade.

Ethereum core developers are set to meet on March 7 to determine Pectra’s official launch date. Any delay could stir controversy among Ethereum supporters, who are already on edge due to a lagging ETH token price, leadership drama at the Ethereum Foundation, and mounting competition from networks like Solana.

 Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet, but developers may delay the mainnet launch due to unresolved issues on Holesky. 

Ethereum’s highly anticipated Pectra upgrade was successfully deployed on its final testnet, Sepolia, marking a major milestone in the lead-up to the mainnet activation. However, potential delays remain as developers continue to address outstanding issues from a previous testnet failure.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade has gathered significant community support as it aims to improve Ether (ETH) staking, layer-2 (L2) network scalability and overall network capacity.

Pectra was successfully rolled out on its final testnet, Sepolia, at 7:29 am UTC on March 5.

The upgrade, which consists of 11 separate Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), went live on Sepolia “with a perfect proposal rate,” according to core Ethereum contributor Terence.

Source: Terence

The Ethereum Foundation previously confirmed that once both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets are successfully upgraded to Pectra, a mainnet activation epoch will be chosen. 

However, the upgrade was activated on the Holesky testnet on Feb. 24 and failed to finalize. This may mean Ethereum developers will further delay the mainnet launch as they investigate the issues.

Investors expect more information on the final date of the Pectra mainnet implementation on March 6 during Ethereum’s All Core Developers call.

Developers now anticipate that it will take at least 18 more days for the Holesky upgrade to finalize, with issues related to “correlation penalties” and “validator balance drains” still under investigation, Terence noted.

Industry watchers are expecting Pectra to be a transformative upgrade for Ethereum.

One of Pectra’s most exciting aspects is that it may pave the way for the first staked Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.

“Pectra aims to significantly improve staking flexibility and could potentially pave the way for staking to be integrated into Ethereum exchange products,” the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“With competitors like Solana gaining traction due to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, Pectra’s innovations could bolster Ethereum’s appeal, attracting further institutional participation,” he added.

Institutional appetite for Ether staking products has been growing since Donald Trump’s victory during the 2024 US presidential election, partly due to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regime in the country over the next four years.

A Trump administration will likely embrace more crypto industry innovation, including the debut of the first staked Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Edward Wilson, an analyst at Nansen. He added:

Former NCAA official William Bock III talks to OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast about his decision to resign from the organization.

A Democratic Minnesota state representative on Monday said that a bill aiming to limit women's sports to biological women was ""another version of state-sanctioned bullying and genocide.""

""And I don’t say that lightly,"" Rep. Liish Kozlowski, who identifies as ""non-binary,"" said on the Minnesota State Capitol’s House floor.

The representative also claimed to be the ""only two-spirit"" representative in Minnesota and the U.S. 

""Problematic bills like HF12, a bill to bully trans and non-binary kids… It’s not about fairness in sports, it’s about erasing trans girls, non-binary, and two-spirit kids and people from public life,"" ""I can assure you that our children will not stop being transgender just because you try to remove us from sports,"" Kozlowski said.

The bill did not pass as it needed 68 votes and was struck down along party lines in a 67-66 resulting vote.

The representative also called the proposal, formally titled the ""Preserving Girls’ Sports Act,"" ""a bill to bully trans girls and non-binary kids.""

""As politicians and unelected billionaires from the White House to here in the Minnesota House, we’re seeing this doubling down of efforts in an agenda of division of stoking fear, of stoking harm on our communities,"" Kozlowski said.

The measure HF12, sponsored by Republican Rep. Peggy Scott, defines ""female"" to mean that a female is ""biologically determined by genetics and defined with respect to an individual's reproductive system.""

""We cannot allow our girls to be vulnerable to losing their spot on the team, being on the podium, or to injury by a male teammate or male competitor,"" Scott said. 

""That is not safe and that is not fair to our girls,"" she added.

WISCONSIN BANS TRANS ATHLETES FROM GIRLS’ SPORTS, FOLLOWING TRUMP’S EXECUTIVE ORDER 

Minnesota lawmakers' clash over HF12 comes after President Donald Trump signed the ""No Men in Women's Sports"" executive order, fulfilling one of his major campaign promises of keeping biological men out of girls' and women’s sports.

After Trump's executive order, the Minnesota State High School League reportedly announced that they are defying federal law by allowing transgender athletes to continue playing in women's sports.

Per the Minnesota Attorney General’s office, the Minnesota State High School League’s decision to allow transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports does not violate the state’s constitution. If they were to ban transgender athletes from women's sports, it would violate the Minnesota Human Rights Act in the state's constitution.

The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office stated that ""based on the plain language of the statute, educational institutions and the Minnesota State High School League would violate the MHRA by prohibiting transgender athletes from participating in extracurricular activities consistent with their gender identity.""

Furthermore, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a warning to California, Maine and Minnesota to comply with the federal anti-discrimination laws that require them to keep boys out of women’s sports. States defying federal law could face legal action.

Kozlowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Britain's Emma Raducanu: ""I was very distraught. I saw him and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe""; watch ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and Sky Sports app

Emma Raducanu has revealed she ""couldn't see the ball through tears"" and could ""barely breathe"" during a stalking ordeal at the Dubai Open last month.

The 22-year-old Briton approached the umpire's chair in tears just two games into her defeat to Karolina Muchova after receiving repeated unwanted attention from a ""fixated"" man before and during the second-round match.

Raducanu told media: ""I was obviously very distraught. I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe.

""I was like, I need to just take a breather here.""

Raducanu disclosed she had previously been approached twice by the man off-court.

The 2021 US Open champion was speaking to media ahead of the start of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, live on Sky Sports Tennis, where she will return to action for the first time since the ordeal.

The incident occurred early in the first set of the Muchova match. She regrouped to play on after the man was removed from the arena but lost 7-6 6-4.

She later opted not to press charges but the individual has been banned from future tournaments.

""It was a very emotional time,"" Raducanu said. ""After the match I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.

""There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here. I feel a lot better.""

Raducanu added to BBC Sport she is happy with the level of protection she is now receiving, saying: ""[It] could have been dealt with better. Since that incident I have definitely got increased attention and greater security.

""All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation. Now it is being dealt with better, so for me that's important.

""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched.""

Raducanu will face Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, who is ranked three places above her at 52 in the world, in the first round in California. The winner is guaranteed to face third seed Coco Gauff, with the top 32 players all receiving byes through to the second round.

Raducanu told Sky Sports Tennis at Indian Wells...

""I'm very happy to be in Indian Wells, it's my favourite tournament outside of the Slams. Being here, I feel a lot better.

""I wasn't necessarily sure if I was going to come and compete so soon after what happened in Dubai, but I'm glad I made the decision to come here. I'm loving being here, I'm happy on the court.

""I always loved playing in America since junior days, I had this fascination with it. And I remember the first time I saw a palm tree. It was amazing, like I was in heaven.

""Then, obviously, it was pretty epic in New York and ever since, I've just had an amazing fanbase in America and I love it here.

""It's just so easy. Everything is so practical, relaxed, spacious. So I'm just very happy to be here.""

In her latest Sky Sports column, Gigi Salmon discusses her tips for Indian Wells, British hopes, Petra Kvitova's return from maternity leave and Raducanu's stalking ordeal...

""It is impossible for us to put ourselves in Emma's position as someone who is known around the world, who finds it difficult to go about her normal life without being recognised or approached and then the fear of being followed by someone who feels they know you and have a right to speak to you and be near you.

""I imagine it's a difficult balance for 'celebrities' to strike who allow people a glimpse of their life through social media and to show who they are away from their place of work. This is maybe something they do willingly or are encouraged to do by agents, but it does NOT allow people to take advantage of that, assume they really know the person or to approach them. You do not know them!

""Emma has been told she can have added security and the hope is that firstly she feels safe and protected but also that the true fans who are respectful of the players still have the opportunity to get up close to the players. That is important to both fans and players and something that we would not want to lose.""

Washington Capitals superstar Alex Ovechkin is inching closer to an NHL scoring record that many thought was unbreakable.

The 39-year-old Ovechkin is within striking distance of Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL goals record of 894. ""The Great One"" scored his final goal on March 29, 1999. ""The Great Eight"" could very well surpass that mark 26 years later.

Ovechkin entered the 2024-25 NHL season with 853 career NHL goals. He started the season off red-hot with 15 goals in 18 games. But after suffering a broken fibula in November, he missed five weeks. That time off didn't affect his goal-scoring prowess: He recorded four goals in his first five games back from injury.

During a 3-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday, Ovechkin scored career goal No. 884 late in the third period as the Capitals attempted a comeback.

— Washington Capitals (@Capitals) March 1, 2025

He failed to score in Washington's 5-4 win over the Senators Monday that ended in a shootout. Ovechkin remains 11 goals away from surpassing Gretzky, with 21 games left to play in the regular season.

""It's just a matter of time, whether it's late this year, early next year, whenever,"" Gretzky told NHL.com earlier this season about Ovechkin's chances of breaking his record. ""I mean, he's a great player. He's a great goal scorer.""

As he approaches Gretzky's record, Ovechkin has partnered with Hockey Fights Cancer and the V Foundation for Cancer Research to launch ""THE GR8 CHASE for Victory Over Cancer."" The campaign will see Ovechin donate a dollar amount equal to his career NHL goal total for each goal he scores for the rest of his career. onumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Capitals, will match every donation.

Ovechkin will continue his chase for Gretzky's mark on Wednesday against the New York Rangers.

We will track Ovechkin's race to 894 goals and beyond all season.

Officials at CK Burns School in Saco are looking forward to expanding an athletics program for special-needs students thanks to a $7,000 grant from the Special Olympics Foundation.

The money will go toward the Unified Champion Schools Project. At CK Burns, there are 12 special-needs students participating in the program right now, along with 12 more non-special-needs students who act as “partners.” 

On Wednesday, Samantha Goodchild, a special education teacher at the school, was supervising a group of the students shot baskets in the school’s gym. Goodchild said the school regularly participates in the Special Olympics, but this program, while related, is technically separate from that competition.

Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with a logo that read, “Spread Inclusion,” Goodchild said inclusion is the theme that drives the program. It encourages students with and without special needs to work together.  

“We use our regular-ed peers as role models to help teach them the skills that they need to play the game,” she said.

The school first started the program last year and its lesson, Goodchild said, is already spreading beyond athletics. 

“We’re seeing it in our hallways, we’re seeing it on the playground, so when kids are seeing somebody, maybe they don’t have somebody to play with at recess, because we’re doing all this inclusion work, they’re inviting kids to play that maybe they normally wouldn’t have, because we’re fostering that environment here at the school and making inclusion very, very important,” she said.

School Principal April Noble said she has gotten very positive feedback from the program so far, both from students and staff members. 

“The staff are really excited about just being able to see them out in the mainstream setting more than in their classrooms and then having our regular-ed students recognize them in the hallways makes them feel really proud,” she said.

Assistant Principal Thomas Partridge said the money will toward expanding the project. Right now, he said, it includes basketball and soccer, but with the grant the program will add bocce this spring. 

“It’s a little simpler game, and something they can do outside,” he said.

The money will also go toward new equipment, such as smaller, lighter basketballs, and special basketball hoops that are lower and easier to reach. 

“It’s fun for the kids to be able to get it in the hoop,” he said.","{'href': 'https://spectrumlocalnews.com', 'title': 'Spectrum News'}"

TNT Sports continues its opportunistic push for new sports rights.


	The Warner Bros. Discovery division has inked a deal with the global sports streaming service DAZN to televise many of the matches from this year’s FIFA Club World Cup. The event will kick off June 14 in Miami, and sees 32 of the world’s best soccer clubs facing off in a global tournament. The final will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey July 13.




	TNT Sports will televise 24 of the 63 matches on TNT, TBS and TruTV, including the knockout rounds and final. DAZN is the global rightsholder for the FIFA Club World Cup.

	The two companies will also co-develop studio programming, as well as digital content on Bleacher Report and House of Highlights. They will also work together on cross-promotion, marketing, and advertising sales.

	“Partnering with DAZN to present the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 further bolsters our sports portfolio this summer and brings another world-class event to our TNT Sports portfolio,” said Luis Silberwasser, Chairman and CEO of TNT Sports, in a statement. “We’re looking forward to this new partnership with DAZN as we collectively deliver this exciting new global soccer club competition in the US this summer.”   


	“The combined expertise of DAZN and TNT Sports will deliver what FIFA and fans want – a tournament for generations to remember,” adds Shay Segev, CEO of DAZN Group. “With our new partners at Warner Brothers. Discovery, DAZN will enhance and expand production, marketing and ad sales for the tournament, to maximize engagement and reach and ensure that fans receive the very best viewing experience.”.


	TNT Sports has been getting creative in its sports rights deals since losing live NBA rights in the U.S. last year. Sublicensing deals, such as the one with DAZN, have emerged as one pillar of that strategy, alongside strategic deals for upstarts like Unrivaled. The company also secured college football games in a deal with ESPN.


	The U.S. will host the FIFA World Cup in 2026, with Fox and Telemundo holding the U.S. TV rights.

Lottery.com (Nasdaq: LTRY)는 Sports.com에서 광고 형식을 지원하기 위한 플랫폼 업데이트 완료를 발표했습니다. 이 이니셔티브는 프리미엄 스포츠 도메인을 활용하여 광고 및 후원 기회를 모색하고, 고부가가치 스포츠 소비자를 겨냥하는 것을 목표로 합니다.

Après la diffusion réussie de deux combats de boxe professionnels en 2024, Sports.com prévoit d'intégrer la couverture d'événements en direct dans certains marchés.

Les statistiques clés montrent que les fans de sport passent en moyenne 3,2 heures par semaine à regarder du contenu sportif, avec 55 % de l'audience des sports en direct se produisant sur des plateformes numériques en 2024, et ce chiffre devrait atteindre 63 % d'ici 2027. L'industrie sportive mondiale génère plus de 100 milliards de dollars par an en revenus publicitaires et de parrainage, présentant une opportunité significative pour Sports.com d'établir une nouvelle source de revenus au sein du portefeuille de Lottery.com.

Lottery.com (Nasdaq: LTRY) hat den Abschluss der Plattform-Updates angekündigt, um Werbeformate auf Sports.com zu unterstützen. Die Initiative zielt darauf ab, die Premium-Sport-Domain für Werbe- und Sponsoringmöglichkeiten zu nutzen und hochpreisige Sportkonsumenten anzusprechen.

Die Plattform wird Markenlogos, Marketingbotschaften und Call-to-Action-Kampagnen an mehreren Werbeplätzen auf der Website und in der App präsentieren. Nach dem erfolgreichen Streaming von zwei Profi-Boxkämpfen im Jahr 2024 plant Sports.com, die Berichterstattung über Live-Events in ausgewählten Märkten zu integrieren.

Wichtige Statistiken zeigen, dass Sportfans im Durchschnitt 3,2 Stunden pro Woche mit dem Ansehen von Sportinhalten verbringen, wobei 55 % der Live-Sport-Zuschauer im Jahr 2024 auf digitalen Plattformen stattfinden, was bis 2027 auf 63 % ansteigen soll. Die globale Sportindustrie generiert jährlich über 100 Milliarden Dollar an Werbe- und Sponsoringeinnahmen, was eine bedeutende Gelegenheit für Sports.com darstellt, eine neue Einnahmequelle innerhalb des Lottery.com-Portfolios zu etablieren.

Lottery.com's move to implement an ad-supported model for Sports.com represents a strategic diversification of revenue streams, though the immediate financial impact remains uncertain. The company is targeting the $100+ billion global sports advertising market, which could provide meaningful revenue potential for a company with a market cap of just $15.3 million.

The lack of specific revenue projections or announced advertising partnerships limits our ability to quantify the near-term financial impact. However, the strategic rationale is sound - leveraging an existing digital asset (the Sports.com domain) to capture advertising dollars in a growing digital sports consumption market.

This move appears designed to reduce reliance on the company's core lottery business and create a more diversified revenue model. Their mention of successful boxing match broadcasts in 2024 suggests they've begun testing content capabilities, though building substantial audience reach will be critical for attracting premium advertisers.

The vague reference to a ""potential future UK football club acquisition"" indicates broader ambitions but introduces execution risk and potential capital requirements. For a company of Lottery.com's size, such an acquisition would likely require significant financing.

While this announcement shows management is pursuing growth initiatives, investors should monitor for concrete progress metrics such as user growth, advertiser partnerships, and contribution to revenue in upcoming financial reports.

Sports.com represents a potentially valuable digital property for Lottery.com's advertising ambitions, though significant execution challenges lie ahead. The domain name itself carries inherent brand value and search traffic potential in the sports vertical, providing a foundation for their advertising strategy.

The company's timing aligns with documented shifts in consumer behavior. The cited research showing 55% of sports viewership occurring on digital platforms (expected to reach 63% by 2027) validates their digital-first approach. Sports content consumers, particularly in attractive demographics, have demonstrated willingness to engage with advertising when integrated appropriately.

However, building a competitive sports media platform requires more than just domain equity. Content development, user acquisition, and technology infrastructure demands significant investment. The mention of live event coverage suggests awareness of this need, but the company will face established competitors with deeper content libraries and larger audiences.

The ad tech stack implementation they're completing is just the first step - developing direct sales capabilities and programmatic advertising partnerships will be essential for monetization. The company's ability to attract premium brands mentioned (automotive, health &fitness, apparel) will depend on delivering audience scale and engagement metrics.

While the strategy shows promise, Lottery.com will need to demonstrate they can build meaningful user traffic and engagement to convert this domain asset into a substantial revenue generator within their portfolio.

FORT WORTH, Texas, March  05, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lottery.com Inc. (Nasdaq: LTRY, LTRYW) (“Lottery.com” or the “Company”), a leading technology company in digital lottery and sports entertainment, has announced it is completing updates to its platform to support a variety of ad formats on Sports.com. This new revenue stream will leverage Sports.com, one of the world’s most coveted sports domains, as a vehicle for brands with premium advertising and sponsorship opportunities to reach a highly valuable audience of sports consumers.

Sports.com is recognized for its strong brand equity and credibility within the global sports industry. Through this initiative, brands will gain enhanced visibility by featuring logos, marketing messages, and call-to-action campaigns across multiple advertising placements on the Sports.com website and app. By utilizing strategic marketing partnerships and advanced programmatic advertising, Sports.com is poised to become a dominant force in the sports media sector—delivering substantial value to advertisers and tapping into a new revenue stream for the Company. The development and launch of an ad-funded revenue model across the Sports.com website and app could also dovetail with a potential future UK football club acquisition, its stadium and team uniform and apparel sponsorship, as a further branding opportunity for advertisers.

With its global reach, Sports.com provides brands in automotive, health & fitness, and apparel—sectors that naturally align with sports audiences with access to loyal sports content consumers. Advertisers in these industries have successfully partnered with major sports platforms such as ESPN, TNT Sports, beIN SPORTS, and DAZN. An October 2024 report released by Effectv, the sales division of Comcast Advertising, determined that sports fans spend an average of 3.2 hours a week watching sports content. 

After the 2024 successful streaming broadcasts of two professional boxing matches, Sports.com plans to fully integrate live event coverage and broadcasts of sporting events in select markets. Consumers are continuing to shift their viewing preferences for live sports from traditional broadcast to digital. The September 2024 EMARKETER Forecast reported that 55% of live sports viewership was on a digital platform in 2024. That number is projected to grow to 63% by the end of 2027.

Matthew McGahan, Chairman and CEO of Lottery.com, commented:“The advertising and sponsorship landscape presents revenue opportunities for Sports.com. Partner brands can benefit from premium ad placements on our platform, leveraging our strong brand equity while generating value for their businesses. Sports content is brand-safe, as demonstrated by other major platforms that have successfully monetized all forms of sports content.”

Mark Burcham, Director of Sports.com, added:“With the expansion of Sports.com into sponsorships and advertising, we are creating a truly global destination for brands to reach high value consumers. Diehard sports fans have proven to be brand-loyal and less price sensitive which are attractive profiles for advertisers. This is an exciting time for Sports.com and we are committed to delivering value to both our partners and sports fans worldwide.”

The global sports industry generates more than $100 billion annually in advertising and sponsorship revenue. With its global reach, Sports.com is well-positioned to capitalize on this multi-billion-dollar market, creating a new and scalable revenue stream within the Lottery.com portfolio of brands.

🏀 The Mavs are in hell: The Mavericks' season continues to reach new lows. Luka Dončić is gone. Anthony Davis has yet to return. And now Kyrie Irving (torn ACL) is out for the season.

🏈 Saquon gets paid: The Eagles signed Saquon Barkley to a two-year, $41.2 million extension ($36 million guaranteed) that makes him the highest-paid running back in NFL history.

🏀 Aggies stun Tigers: No. 22 Texas A&M upset No. 1 Auburn, 83-72, to snap a four-game losing streak and record the program's first ever win over a top-ranked opponent.

📺 End of an era: ESPN's ""Around the Horn"" will air its final show on May 23, bringing one of the longest-running sports shows to an end after 23 years and more than 4,900 episodes.

⚾️ Sasaki's electric debut: Dodgers newcomer Rōki Sasaki struck out five across three scoreless innings in his spring debut, with a four-seam fastball that averaged 98 mph and an all-world splitter that induced seven whiffs on eight swings.

LeBron James reached yet another milestone on Tuesday when he scored his 50,000th point (including playoffs), nearly 6,000 more than any other player in NBA history.

Top 5:

James: 50,033

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: 44,149

Karl Malone: 41,689

Kobe Bryant: 39,283

Michael Jordan: 38,279

How did he get here? It wasn't just transcendent play; LeBron's latest accomplishment also required excellent health and, above all, astonishing consistency. Just look at the three phases of his career, during which he's somehow experienced virtually zero drop-off in production.

Chapter 1 (age 19-25): 17,332 points in 619 games (28.0 ppg) during his first stint with the Cavs (2003-10).

Chapter 2 (age 26-33): 20,617 points in 763 games (27.0 ppg) during his time in Miami and return to Cleveland (2010-18).

Chapter 3 (age 34-40): 12,084 points in 453 games (26.7 ppg) with the Lakers (2018-present).

About that consistency… LeBron averaged 20.9 points as a rookie. 22 years later, that's still by far his lowest single-season mark. His second-lowest? That would be this year, at age 40, when he's averaging 24.9 points a night — good for 12th-best in the league.

Compare that to the rest of the top 10 and only Jordan and Kevin Durant also went their whole careers without dipping beneath 20 points per game.

The difference is that MJ played only 15 seasons and Durant, now in his 17th, has been far less durable.

LeBron is in Year 22, has missed just four games this season, and is playing 34.7 minutes a night, eighth-most in the league.

This is not normal: James' stats since turning 40 years old (26.4 points, 8.2 rebounds and 8.1 assists on 54.1% shooting) are almost identical to his stats from his fourth MVP campaign in Miami 12 years ago (26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists on 56.5% shooting).

The postseason factor: 50,000 points would have never been possible without the playoffs, where LeBron has scored a record 8,162 points thanks to both opportunity (he's only missed the playoffs four times) and immense success (he's made it to 10 Finals).

Who (if anyone) could catch him? The easy answer is no one, unless you really think another player is going to play at an all-NBA level for 22 years (and counting!) while also consistently making deep playoff runs. But just for fun, here are three contenders.

Durant is closest among active players, though he's still 15,000 (!) points behind. The 36-year-old would have to match James' highest-scoring season for the next five years to reach 50,000.

Luka Dončić reached 12,000 career points faster than James, so that's a good start. But the King's new teammate already said he won't play long enough to catch him: ""I'd rather go back to my farm in Slovenia.""

One intriguing candidate? Anthony Edwards, who should pass Dončić this spring for the fourth-most points ever scored before turning 24. LeBron, of course, tops that list, but when you're chasing an unbreakable record, you've got to start somewhere.

The bottom line: Eventually, this madness will stop. He can't play forever. Until then, I implore you to keep enjoying one of the most prodigious careers in the history of sports.

Go deeper: LeBron James, the face of the league, and the last of his kind (Vincent Goodwill, Yahoo Sports)

There are crooked numbers, and then there's what George Mason did against Holy Cross on Tuesday.

Offensive explosion: The Patriots scored 23 runs in the second inning of their 26-6 win over the Crusaders, the most scored in a single inning in NCAA history. And it all began with a harmless groundout.

Play-by-play: George Mason sent 28 batters to the plate, drawing eight walks (plus five HBPs) and hitting six singles and five doubles.

History books: The Patriots' 23 runs broke the previous NCAA record of 21, shared by Penn State (1983) and Wichita State (1984). The MLB record is 17, set by the Red Sox during their 23-3 win over the Tigers in June 1953.

Barefoot water skiing is exactly what it sounds like, and some of the world's best ""barefooters"" competed over the weekend in Sydney, Australia.

The sport traces its roots back to 1947, when the first barefooters took to the water in Winter Haven, Florida. By 1955, they were starting their rides without skis (as opposed to ""dropping a ski"" once up), and by 1960 they were doing tricks like the ""tumbleturn"" and riding backwards.

Barefooting then spread across the globe and became especially popular in Australia, which hosted the first biennial World Championships in 1978. Only the USA (13) and Australia (9) have won world titles, with the next edition coming this September in France.

Barefoot competitions feature three events — wake slalom, tricks and jumping — and the sport is not for the faint of heart: The standard procedure if a blister or cut opens on the bottom of an athlete's foot is to simply glue it shut, continue competing, and stitch it up later.

From Yahoo Sports' Jack Baer:

Pete Rose died last September. A petition to reinstate him from his permanent ban from baseball was filed in January. Many people, most notably President Donald Trump, have said it's time to put him in the Hall of Fame. The petition may very well be successful.

It's not a surprising sequence of events, to the point that Rose himself reportedly called it 10 days before he died from heart disease.

""I've come to the conclusion — I hope I'm wrong — that I'll make the Hall of Fame after I die,"" Rose said in the interview. ""Which I totally disagree with, because the Hall of Fame is for two reasons: your fans and your family.""

""What good is it going to do me or my fans if they put me in the Hall of Fame couple years after I pass away? What's the point? What's the point? Because they'll make money over it?""

The mechanics of what Rose is lamenting are not complicated. After decades as a baseball pariah, MLB's all-time hits leader expected the world to be more ready to forgive and forget, or at least his proponents would become much louder once they had the concept of grace on their side after his death.

Whether or not they actually succeed is almost entirely up to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred. Unless a future MLB commissioner is a fan, Rose won't have a better chance than the petition in front of Manfred right now, and there's no way this decision is leaving his desk.

At some point in the coming weeks or months, Manfred will likely have to say whether or not he's reinstating Rose.

To do so would fall fully in line with Rose's most cynical expectations, on a matter where very little has changed, except for the fact that the man involved is no longer with us and the president of the United States is yelling at baseball to ""get off its fat, lazy ass.""

Keep reading: Does Manfred have any reason to reinstate Rose?

Austin Cindric’s retaliation against Ty Dillon resulted in a points penalty.

NASCAR announced Wednesday the Team Penske driver had been penalized 50 points and fined $50,000 after he turned Dillon on the front stretch in the opening laps of last weekend’s race at Circuit of the Americas.

Cindric hooked Dillon after Dillon pushed him off the track in the final corner. As Cindric got back on the track, he moved over to spin Dillon to the outside wall. Does Cindric get penalized if he spins Dillon while trying to return to the track instead of seconds later? It’s an interesting thought exercise.

— Steven Taranto (@STaranto92) March 2, 2025

While you can debate if Dillon's move was fair or not — and given how early in the 95-lap race it was, there's a strong case that it was way over the line — it's clear to NASCAR that Cindric's move was worthy of a reprimand even if his frustration was justified.

Cindric could have been subject to a suspension, but the slower speed of the crash and the lack of a resulting caution played a role in the penalty. NASCAR has said it wants to crack down on drivers intentionally crashing others; Chase Elliott was suspended for a race when he hooked Denny Hamlin into the wall on the frontstretch at Charlotte in 2023.

Had Cindric been suspended, it would have come with a tougher consequence than Elliott's did. Ahead of the 2025 season, NASCAR said that any driver who misses a race for a suspension or a non-injury reason would retain playoff eligibility but wouldn’t be able to keep any playoff points earned during the regular season.

That would have left Cindric with the minimum number of starting points in the playoffs if he qualified. Now, he simply faces a regular-season points penalty. He was 11th and 36 points back of the lead before the penalty. Now he's 34th in the points standings with 30.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Texas A&M isn’t done just yet.

The Aggies, after going on a four-game losing skid in the SEC, stunned No. 1 Auburn on Tuesday night in College Station. No. 22 Texas A&M led the entire way en route to the 83-72 win at Reed Arena. It marked the Aggies’ first ever win against a top-ranked opponent. It was also Auburn’s first loss in almost a full month and just the Tigers’ third of the season.

The Aggies looked like they were done in recent weeks. They entered the contest on a four-game losing streak, which included blowout losses to then-No. 21 Mississippi State and then-No. 3 Florida. That sent them plummeting in both the national rankings and the SEC standings ahead of the final week of the regular season.

You wouldn't have known on Tuesday, however. The Aggies took the lead from the jump and never looked back while grabbing the 11-point win. Zhuric Phelps led the way with 19 points off the bench, and Wade Taylor IV added 16 points. Andersson Garcia finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds, too. The Aggies dominated on the glass and out-rebounded Auburn by 16. They had 24 offensive rebounds, too, and 29 second-chance points.

Tahaad Pettiford led the Tigers with 19 points after shooting 6-of-10 from behind the arc. Chad Baker-Mazara added 15 points, and Miles Kelly finished with 12 points. They were the only three players to hit double figures for Auburn. Johni Broome, who is a legitimate contender for Player of the Year with Duke star Cooper Flagg, was held to just eight points and seven rebounds.

While the loss isn't great for Bruce Pearl and the Tigers, they are still in an incredible spot heading into their regular-season finale Saturday. They've already wrapped up the the SEC title, and they are on track to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament almost regardless of what happens the rest of the way. They have 16 Quad 1 wins on the season, too, six more than the next closest teams in the country.

But if they can't bounce back and handle Alabama in a rivalry rematch Saturday afternoon at home, things could get interesting in the SEC tournament at Bridgestone Arena. Suddenly, after weeks and weeks of proving otherwise, Auburn would look legitimately beatable.

But for Texas A&M, the Aggies picked up a huge win when they needed it the most. If there was ever a way to turn their season around in the final week, this was it.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Champaign Central’s Luke Swanson puts up a shot attempt against Chatham Glenwood’s Jack Kurmann on Tuesday night in a Class 3A boys’ basketball sectional semifinal game in Decatur. The Maroons saw their season end with 57-45 loss in overtime.

































Champaign Central's playoff run ended with an overtime loss to Chatham Glenwood in a Class 3A boys' basketball sectional semifinal game at Eisenhower High School in Decatur Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

































DECATUR — It had already been a memorable season for the Champaign Central boys’ basketball team.

First winning season since the COVID-shortened 2020-21 campaign.

First wins over crosstown rival Centennial since 2020.

First regional title since 2019.

The most successful season the Maroons have seen in at least half a decade, but it came to an end Tuesday night in a 57-45 overtime loss to Chatham Glenwood in the Class 3A Decatur Eisenhower Sectional semifinals.

“It was all about the last three weeks with this team,” Central coach P.J. Keaton said. “It was like a switch hit, and they started playing with so much joy and togetherness. I went with the seniors, who were leading practices and doing everything right, and it led to a win and another win until we got on this roll. Just couldn’t capitalize at the end of regulation to get this one.”

The Maroons (17-13) looked poised to keep their momentum rolling, holding a 17-9 lead after the first quarter. Keaton had star senior Chris Bush take a breather for the first few minutes of the second, and the Titans took advantage of it, holding a 25-24 advantage at halftime.

Central bounced back in the third, especially on the defensive end, holding Glenwood scoreless for the first 6 minutes, 20 seconds of the period to retake the lead.

A back-and-forth fourth quarter came down to the final seconds. Bush missed a fadeaway jump shot to send the game into overtime tied at 45.

The Maroons seemed to spend all they had to get the win in regulation, as they couldn’t find the bottom of the basket in overtime. All the wind had been taken out of their sails, and they had little left in the tank.

“It was a great season,” Bush said. “We’ve always been a younger team, so we knew this was our last year to make something happen, and we all bought in.”

In his final high school game, Bush led the team with 21 points, ending his career with 1,577, good enough for third most in Central history. David Riley added 10 points for the Maroons.

“It’s the culture, man,” Bush said. “Everybody accepted me since I was a freshman. The culture was great, the environment was great. It gave me the opportunity to be the face of basketball for our school, and I couldn’t ask for a better place to be.”

It stings now, but it’s safe to say Central is back on the right track.

Following last year’s regional championship loss to Mt. Zion, it was clear that the Maroons had taken a step in the right direction and were ready to take an even bigger one this year. This group, especially the senior class, turned the program around and already have fans excited for next year.

“We’re back, baby,” Keaton said. “My goal this season was to take that next step and get a regional title. We did that, and it’s all about making that mark. Now, regionals should be the standard for our program. We should be getting regionals every year. That’s the mindset.”

The Chicago Bears have now traded for two offensive guards in the same amount of days. After sending the Los Angeles Rams a sixth-round pick for Jonah Jackson on Tuesday, the Bears swung a deal for Kansas City Chiefs offensive guard Joe Thuney on Wednesday. The Bears are sending the Chiefs a 2026 fourth-round pick for the four-time All-Pro, according to CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones. 

Thuney, who turns 33 in November, signed a five-year deal with the Chiefs in 2021 after five seasons with the New England Patriots. He won two Super Bowls in New England, and two with Kansas City. He held down the left guard spot for Kansas City, but was forced to play a career-high 218 regular-season snaps at left tackle in 2024 after the Chiefs' other in-house options such as Kingsley Suamataia, Wanya Morris and D.J. Humphries failed to lock down the job.

The Chiefs' offensive line is in flux this offseason. Kansas City placed the franchise tag on star right guard Trey Smith, which prohibits him from hitting free agency, and now, the Chiefs have two question marks on the left side of the line. Suamataia will be given a shot to compete at left guard with Thuney now gone, Yahoo Sports reports.

Thuney has one more year remaining on his current deal, and carries a cap hit of $16 million with him to Chicago, per Spotrac. You can expect an extension for Thuney before he even takes a snap in Chicago, which is something NFL Media reported as well. 

Thuney will move back inside when he joins Chicago's revamped offensive line. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams was sacked 68 times in his rookie season, which led the NFL and was tied for the third-most sacks taken all time. Now, with more protection in front of him, Williams will be able to develop properly. Especially with an offensive mind like Ben Johnson at the helm.

The NFL's franchise tag deadline has come and gone. Here's everything you need to know.

Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith

Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

The Dallas Cowboys worked out a four-year, $80 million deal with defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who reportedly would have been place on the tag if a deal couldn't be reached.

Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, meanwhile, seemed like a straightforward candidate for the tag, so that he and the Vikings could buy more time in trying to work out a longer-term deal. But the $40.2 million number for QBs on the tag (see below) was reportedly too high for the Vikings, and would have limited their ability to build out the rest of the roster.

The franchise tag is a designation NFL teams may use to retain one player set to be an unrestricted free agent and sign them to a set contract for another year. There are exclusive and non-exclusive tags, as well as transition tags.

Baun had a breakout season in his first year with the Philadelphia Eagles. The 28-year-old Wisconsin product recorded 150 total tackles, 11 for loss and 3.5 sacks during the 2024 season.

Christian Kirk spent the past three seasons in Jacksonville. He played eight games in 2024, making 27 catches for 379 yards and one touchdown.

He was set to make $15.5 million in 2025 with no guaranteed money left on his deal. The Jaguars will end up saving $10.37 million with Kirk's release and will eat $13.65 million in dead money, per Over The Cap.

The Las Vegas Raiders announced on Wednesday that they have signed Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby to a multi-year extension.

Per ESPN, the extension is for three years and $106.5 million with $91.5 in guaranteed money, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history in terms of annual salary ($35.5 million). Minnesota Vikings receiver Justin Jefferson was previously the highest-paid non-quarterback with a four-year, $140 million contract that pays him $35 million per year.

Lockett was due $17 million in salary this season, which included a $5.3 million roster bonus that was to be paid out on March 16. His salary cap hit was set to be $30 million for 2025 and the Seahawks were reportedly nearly $6 million over the cap ceiling ahead of the free agent market opening next week.

Longtime kicker Mason Crosby has announced his retirement, the Green Bay Packers announced.

Crosby spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons in Green Bay after being a 2007 sixth-round pick out of Colorado. He played the most total games and most consecutive games in franchise history (258) and was part of their Super Bowl XLV winning team. He is also the Packers' leader in career points (1,918), field goals (395), 50-yard field goals (43) and extra points (733).

Only two players in NFL history have played 250-plus regular-season games and scored 1,900-plus points with a single team: Crosby and Detroit Lions kicker Jason Hanson.

Crosby last played in 2023 when he appeared in three games with the New York Giants.

This offseason, only Kansas City Chiefs OL Trey Smith and Cincinnati Bengals WR Tee Higgins were tagged by their teams.

This marks the fewest players tagged in a year since 1994, per ESPN.

“We want Tee around here not just next year but in the future,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said at the NFL combine. “Tee’s been a big part of all the wins we’ve had and keeping defenses accountable.""

Whether or not the Bengals will keep him together with MVP-caliber quarterback Joe Burrow and triple crown-winning receiver Ja'Marr Chase, however, is very much in question, mostly thanks to the team itself. Cincinnati failed to reach a contract extension agreement with Chase last summer, and the price has only gone up. Higgins has now received the franchise tag two years in a row, and while reports suggest the Bengals plan to negotiate a longer-term deal with him this time, they also are notorious for tightening purse strings relative to other franchises.

Smith's future, meanwhile, still seems to be in Kansas City, with multiple reports indicating the Chiefs want him long-term, especially given their offensive line issues. He received the non-exclusive tag, which means he's free to negotiate with other teams, but the Chiefs also have the right to match any offer sheet he receives. So it might just have been a way of gauging his market in negotiations.

Hubbard, 29, was a third-round pick by the Bengals in 2018 out of Ohio State. He played 104 games in Cincinnati in seven seasons and recorded 38.5 sacks, 398 total tackles and 55 tackles for loss.

Hubbard suffered a season-ending PCL injury in December during a game where he caught his first career offensive touchdown.

The Seattle Seahawks announced Tuesday that they have released four players, freeing up roughly $26.5 million in salary cap space. Gone are defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones, safety Rayshawn Jenkins, defensive end Roy Robertson-Harris and tackle George Fant.

Jones started seven games last season and played in all 17 regular-season games while tallying four sacks. Jenkins played in 13 games including nine starts. Robertson-Harris was a little-used reserve, who recorded 13 total tackles. Fant was limited to two games in part due to a knee injury.

The Dallas Cowboys have reportedly restructured CeeDee Lamb's contract to free up salary cap space. Details of the restructure weren't initially clear, but the move will open up $20 million in cap space, ESPN's Todd Archer reports.

Per Spotrac, the Cowboys were roughly $3 million over the 2025 cap prior to the restructure and signing defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa to a four-year, $80 million deal. The move to restructure Lamb's deal was expected as the Cowboys approach free agency. Dallas could also restructure quarterback Dak Prescott's contract among other maneuvers to free up more space.

Adams spent just 11 games with the New York Jets after he was dealt there ahead of the deadline from the Las Vegas Raiders, which reunited him with longtime quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Jets have opted to move on from Rodgers after just two seasons — though one of them lasted just four plays, when he injured his Achilles in his debut with the club in 2023.

Adams finished with 854 yards and seven touchdowns with the Jets, who went just 5-12 on the year and won only three games after Adams’ arrival. Despite the team’s struggles, Adams still finished with what was his fifth-straight 1,000-yard season.

Jackson, 28, is a five-year NFL veteran. He played his first four seasons with the Lions before joining the Rams in 2024. He made a Pro Bowl in Detroit in 2021 and was a four-year starter for the Lions.

Jackson was limited to four starts with the Rams on the interior line last season due in part to a shoulder injury. He suffered the injury in Week 2 and made just two more starts after returning to the lineup in Week 10.

If healthy, Jackson addresses a need in Chicago as the Bears look to build around second-year quarterback Caleb Williams.

Bears are in the process of trading for Jonah Jackson and sending a 2025 6th to the Los Angeles Rams. One major need on the OL is addressed before free agency begins. Jackson played center, left guard and right guard last year and was limited to 4 games due to a shoulder injury. https://t.co/UWWUj2X26i

The Florida Panthers continue to be active in the leadup to the NHL trade deadline

Panthers Stay Active at NHL Trade Deadline by Getting Goalie Vitek Vanecek From the Sharks

The defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers continue to be active in the leadup to the NHL trade deadline.

The Panthers acquired goaltender Vitek Vanecek on Wednesday from the San Jose Sharks for 25-year-old forward Patrick Giles, the teams announced.

Vanecek gives Florida depth in net, along with Chris Driedger, behind two-time Vezina Trophy-winning starter Sergei Bobrovsky. The trade comes after the team sent Spencer Knight to Chicago as part of a blockbuster deal for top-pairing defenseman Seth Jones.

Florida will be the fourth NHL organization for Vanecek, who was 3-10-3 in 18 appearances with San Jose this season. The Sharks held him out of their game Tuesday night at Buffalo in preparation of trading the 29-year-old from Czechia.

“It’s part of the business,” said Sharks goaltender Alexandar Georgiev, who was traded there from Colorado for Mackenzie Blackwood earlier this season. “Unfortunately sometimes players get moved. ... Hopefully it’s a good opportunity for him.”

The Sharks in Giles get a young player to add to their core built around No. 1 pick and rookie-of-the-year candidate Macklin Celebrini. Giles appeared in nine NHL games for the Panthers earlier this season without a point. He has mostly been with the team’s American Hockey League affiliate in Charlotte.

San Jose in a corresponding roster move recalled Georgi Romanov from the Barracuda of the AHL.

The goalie market ahead of the 3 p.m. EST deadline Friday remains thin outside of perhaps Anaheim's John Gibson, but other talks continue to pick up around the league. After signing pending free agent tough guy Mathieu Olivier to a six-year, $18 million extension, Columbus Blue Jackets general manager Don Waddell signaled he's open for business — to a certain extent.

“We’re certainly making calls and taking calls,” Waddell said. “I’ve said all along: We’re not in the position to trade first-round picks for rental players or anything like that. If we can add around the edges, certainly we’re going to try that. I’m more interested in hockey deals with maybe players that have term left on their contract. We’re exploring obviously as many of those as we can.”

The Blue Jackets have a handful of other pending UFAs, who Waddell does not expect to re-sign before the deadline but might keep just to help his team fight for a playoff spot.

“If I rip a guy out of this locker room right now (who is) playing a role for us on this hockey club right now, I think that’s pretty devastating to our team,” Waddell said. ""I think it’s the wrong message from my end. I think it’s the wrong message to our fans, the coaches and the players.”

The new Women's Super League marks the start of a new era for reigning champions Chelsea, with long-serving boss Emma Hayes having departed in summer to start a new adventure with the USA Women's team.

Last year they just about did enough to claim the title on goal difference ahead of Manchester City, while Arsenal will again hope to make it a three-horse race for the WSL title. Meanwhile Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham will hope to progress after further rebuilding this summer.

Crystal Palace were promoted to replace Bristol City in the top flight, while on a wider note, the league is now under the management and operation of a new organisation set up to lead women's football towards further growth and progression, with Nikki Doucet overseeing both the WSL and Championship in a new phase for the game.

The Seattle Seahawks released veteran wide receiver Tyler Lockett this week, and they are now reportedly exploring trading their other veteran pass catcher. DK Metcalf has requested a trade, per NFL Media, and the Seahawks will explore it. The request came after a series of conversations over the last two weeks, and that Metcalf wants to play for a contender, ESPN reports.

Metcalf is just 27 years old, but is due an extension. He has just one more year remaining on a three-year, $72 million contract extension that he signed in 2022. Metcalf responded to the bump in pay by putting together back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons in 2022 and 2023. 

This past season, Metcalf caught 66 passes for 992 yards and five touchdowns. He became one of just six receivers all time to record 900 receiving yards in each of a player's first six seasons, joining Terry McLaurin, Mike Evans, A.J. Green, Randy Moss and Jerry Rice. 

The former Ole Miss star was a second-round pick of Seattle back in 2019. He racked up 900 yards receiving and seven touchdowns as a rookie, then had arguably his best season in 2020 with 83 receptions, 1,303 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. Metcalf earned his lone All-Pro selection that year, as well as the first of his two Pro Bowls. 

With Lockett out and Metcalf potentially on the way out, Seattle's wide receiving corps is going to look very different in 2025. The Seahawks will rely on 23-year-old Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who tied a franchise record with 100 receptions for 1,130 yards and six touchdowns last season, but the wide receiver position is all of a sudden a need for John Schneider and Mike Macdonald.

Bayern Munich host Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie tonight.

It’s a first-ever European encounter between the German giants, who have battled for Bundesliga supremacy across the last two seasons. Bayern lead the title race, having seen Leverkusen dethrone them as German champions after a 12-year stranglehold last season.

Vincent Kompany is expected to welcome Joshua Kimmich, Alphonso Davies, and Joao Palhinha back into his squad after the trio all missed training in recent days.

— FC Bayern (@FCBayernEN) March 5, 2025

Leverkusen’s grip on the Bundesliga is loosening but Xabi Alonso’s side have impressed in Europe. Die Werkself qualified automatically for the Round of 16 and are unbeaten in three previous meetings with Bayern this season.

Alonso has an almost full-strength squad to choose from, though Edmond Tapsoba is a doubt. Martin Terrier and Jeanuël Belocian are ruled out.

Bayern Munich: WDDWW

Bayern have been in fine form domestically to win nine of their last 10 Bundesliga games. The only blemish on that record was a goalless draw with Leverkusen in February. Vincent Kompany’s side have lost just once in the Bundesliga this season but have endured a patchier record in Europe.

After missing out on the top eight in the league phase, Bayern survived a scare against Celtic in the play-off round. Alphonso Davies’ stoppage-time goal avoided the prospect of extra time in the second leg.

 

Harry Kane has again been in imperious form. The England captain has 29 goals in all competitions, including seven in the Champions League this season. His overall record at Bayern stands at 73 goals in 78 games.

Bayer Leverkusen: WDDWW

Bayer Leverkusen have an identical record to Bayern over the last five games. Xabi Alonso’s side have secured progress to the DFB-Pokal semi-finals as the club look to defend the trophy.

In the Bundesliga, Leverkusen warmed up for tonight’s clash with a 4-1 thrashing of third-place Eintracht Frankfurt. Patrik Schick was on target to continue his incredible renaissance this season. The Czech striker has scored 16 league goals from just 11 starts for Leverkusen in 2024/25. Only Kane has outscored him in the Bundesliga this season, though Schick’s goals-per-90 (1.47) is far superior.

Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Bayern Munich, February 15th 2025, Bundesliga

Bayer Leverkusen missed the chance to close the gap on Bayern despite dominating their draw at the BayArena. The German champions had 56% of the possession and 15 shots on goal, while reducing Bayern to zero shots on target.

Leverkusen could just not find a route to goal, with Nathan Tella and Jeremie Frimpong each hitting the crossbar.

The best chance of the contest fell to Florian Wirtz, however, who steered wide late on with the goal gaping.

Bayern Munich: Neuer; Laimer, Min-jae, Upamecano, Davies; Palhinha, Goretzka, Musiala; Olise, Coman, Kane.

Bayer Leverkusen: Hradecky; Mukiele, Tah, Hincapie; Frimpong, Garcia, Xhaka, Grimaldo; Tella, Wirtz, Schick.

THE NO. 22 TEXAS A&M AGGIES 

There's a first time for everything, and No. 22 Texas A&M badly needed a first like this. The Aggies snapped a four-game losing streak with a wire-to-wire 83-72 win over No. 1 Auburn, the first win over a top-ranked team in program history.  

Speaking of Bracketology, our Cameron Salerno says it was a wild night for several bubble teams. 

Oh yeah, and just for fun, No. 23 BYU beat No. 10 Iowa State, 88-85, in double overtime. March! 

KYRIE IRVING, THE DALLAS MAVERICKS AND DALLAS MAVERICKS FANS 

Kyrie Irving's season is over. So, too, for all intents and purposes, is the Mavericks' as a disheartening year turned disastrous. Tests revealed Irving tore his ACL in Monday's loss to the Kings; he had left with what was initially ruled a knee sprain. 

This is as bad as it gets. Irving was carrying the injury-plagued team for several weeks, especially in the wake of the Luka Dončić-Anthony Davis trade after Davis got hurt in his Dallas debut. Davis was reportedly nearing a return. 

Now, it's all for naught; talks about Davis not returning at all this season reportedly began after the Irving news, and Jasmyn Wimbish says Dallas has no other options but to tank. 

If you wanted to try justify the Dončić-Davis trade, you could say the Irving-Davis pairing plus a formidable frontcourt made Dallas more balanced and better defensively. It was clearly a win-now move (though the Mavericks had just made the Finals, but, again, I'm trying here). 

I'll never say an injury is karma. It's not like Irving made the trade, after all. But Brad Botkin -- while admitting he hates to speak this way -- says this is the basketball gods punishing Dallas for its awful trade. 

Next season, Irving will be 33 and coming off a torn ACL that will force him to miss the start of the campaign. Davis will be 32. It's an absolutely devastating situation for the Mavericks in the short and long term, James Herbert writes. 

Finally, the race for 10th in the West just got more interesting. 

Join a contender? Check. Win Offensive Player of the Year? Check. Win the Super Bowl? Check. Reset the running back market? Check. Saquon Barkley's remarkable run continued yesterday, as he signed a two-year, $41.2 million extension. 

Now that that's done, here's the Eagles's offseason to-do list. 

Elsewhere around the league ... 

We knew the Madrid Derby, UEFA Champions League edition, had potential to be awesome. It did not disappoint. Like so often, Real Madrid was victorious, nabbing a 2-1 home win over Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their round of 16 matchup. 

All three goals were absolute bangers: Rodrygo smashing one in in the fourth minute, only for Julián Álvarez to curl in a stunner in the 32nd before Brahim Díaz won it with a wonderful solo effort in the 52nd. 

Elsewhere ... 

Here are the scenarios for next week's second legs of these matchups. 

As for today's first legs, it's another loaded slate:

BRIDGEPORT — Sawyer Woodard’s 24-point outing and 21 points from Kam Sweetnam helped the Tuscola boys’ basketball team extend its season on Tuesday night.

The Warriors’ 74-65 sectional semifinal win over Dietrich brought Tuscola within one win of its first Class 1A sectional plaque since 2023. That season ended at State Farm Center with a third-place finish.

“Just a really high level 1A basketball game,” Tuscola coach Justin Bozarth said. “Dietrich, extremely well coached and they’ve got so many guys that can put the basketball in the hoop. ... It was fun. It was entertaining.”

Tuscola secured a 17-10 lead following the first quarter, with Woodard and Caiden Russo each contributing six early points.

That advantage grew to 34-24 by the end of the first half.

“We just played the game,” Bozarth said. “We did a really good job of getting to the pace that we want to and forcing them into one-shot possessions.”

Woodard added four field goals in the third quarter and the Warriors maintained their lead throughout the fourth frame of their ninth consecutive win.

“Sawyer was a monster around the basket and Kam continues to be electric with the basketball in his hands,” Bozarth said.

Tuscola (29-6) managed the 212-mile round trip to Bridgeport by stopping in Olney for a shootaround before driving the rest of the way to the gym.

And Bozarth doesn’t expect that drive to detract from Friday’s sectional final;, as the Warriors will face Effingham St. Anthony or Bluford Webber with a trip to the Elite Eight on the line.

“Everything that small school basketball is supposed to be about,” Bozarth said.

Panthers take down Bombers

LeRoy’s pursuit of its first sectional plaque in nearly a decade is alive and well.

The Panthers dominated Argenta-Oreana on Tuesday, claiming a 66-38 Class 1A semifinal win at Ridgeview thanks to 27 points from Sam Edmundson, 15 points from Brycen Umstaddt.

“I was just really happy for the boys, really proud of them,” LeRoy coach Jesse Hawkins said. “I don’t think anybody expected out of this squad this year, and proud of the grind, proud of the toughness and character of these kids.”

The Panthers jetted out to a 17-9 lead following the first quarter and never looked back, leading 30-20 at halftime and 49-27 by the end of the third frame.

Jordan Cox added nine points and Andrew Fleming added seven points to help the Panthers’ cause, while Damian Gude scored 11 points to pace the Bombers.

“(Tuesday night) it was about doing what we do, playing LeRoy basketball,” Hawkins said. “And being disciplined, executing, trusting each other and moving the basketball. Just normal basketball that you want out of your team, and they absolutely did it and more.”

That Argenta-Oreana would have a chance for its first-ever sectional plaque would have been difficult to believe in the season’s opening weeks. The Bombers fell to 3-8 after a 71-47 loss to Meridian on Dec. 17, 2024.

But the Bombers (19-14) rallied to win seven of its next nine games, gaining a winning record with a 66-52 win against Sullivan on Feb. 4.

“They really buckled down there,” Argenta-Oreana coach Clay Haurberg said. “This game didn’t go well, but these kids really left a mark at our school.

“Hopefully, our younger guys realize that we can keep building from there. ... I just hope these kids get that kind of hunger and say, ‘let’s get back to the sectional and let’s do better.’”

LeRoy will face the winner of Wednesday’s semifinal game between Schlarman and Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley.

“There’s some schematic stuff that we’ve changed throughout the year,” Hawkins said. “We got off to a good start win-loss wise, but schematically it was tough with our football players getting all the way to the semifinal. But now, we’re hitting our groove.”

Sages fall in overtime

Tuscola and Monticello are the only local teams to qualify for the state finals since they returned to Champaign in 2022.

The Sages nearly drew within two wins of another trip on Tuesday night, before Teutopolis made a late surge to end their season with a 53-46 overtime win at Unity.

Tyler Blythe and Matthias Rudolph paced the Sages (18-14) with 10 points apiece, while Grant Gatsby added nine points and Ike Young collected nine rebounds.

Mick Niebrugge and Gavin Addis each scored 10 points for the Wooden Shoes, who won the final period by a 11-4 margin.

Champaign Central's playoff run ended with an overtime loss to Chatham Glenwood in a Class 3A boys' basketball sectional semifinal game at Eis…

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,White running backs matter! Should ex-ASU standout Cam Skattebo's race be news?,https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/college/asu/2025/03/05/cam-skattebo-nfl-comparisons-kyle-brandt/81435688007/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:08:47 GMT","

Let’s just put this out there: Cam Skattebo is a white running back.

I know … I know … I know … “White running backs matter!”

That shouldn’t be a controversial statement, even coming from a Black sportswriter such as myself. But some people are going to think I’m saying “Black running backs don’t matter!”

Or that I’m saying “white running backs matter more!”

(Also, it’s not my decision to capitalize “Black” and keep “white” lowercase. That came from a grammar and style guide that’s in widespread use in my industry. It’s something I disagree with, because I find it distracting. But that’s above my paygrade.)

Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

Anyway, race shouldn’t even matter here!

Cam Skattebo is a gamer! He’s sneaky athletic! He has game speed! He’s a grinder! He gives it 110 percent! And he’s really, really smart!

And now that all the sarcasm is out of my system, we can address what everyone is talking about when it comes to Arizona State’s top 2025 NFL Draft prospect: What NFL player past or present does he most remind you of?!

Kyle Brandt of the NFL Network came out hot, saying on ""Good Morning Football"": “The Cam Skattebo comps are driving me crazy! … I do not want to hear the name ‘Toby Gerhart’ a single time. Don’t say it! If you’re saying it about Cam Skattebo, you’re mailing in your analysis. You’re lazy. They’re not close to the same prospect.

“While I am at it, while I have you, do not utter the name ‘Peyton Hillis’ in my presence, stop it!”

Brandt is saying that we shouldn’t compare Skattebo to other white running backs just because he’s white, which seems like a fair and fairly obvious point.

“It is possible to describe and analyze young Cameron Skattebo without mentioning the name ‘Mike Alstott,’ … Mike Alstott had 4 inches, 30 pounds on Skattebo,” Brandt said. “Guys, just speaking purely in the football sense, it’s not the comp!""

I appreciate what Brandt is doing here.

For far too long, people who get paid to talk about sports have said ridiculous — and borderline racist — things about athletes.

White players are smart. Black players are athletic. White players are hardworking. Black players are gifted. White players are fiery. Black players have attitude problems.  

That sort of junk.

It’s been happening since the days of Jack London and Jack Johnson, and it’s probably not going to stop anytime soon.

Brandt did a great job getting in front of it … except … welllllll … listen, there’s no way to say this delicately: Skattebo has a lot of Alstott in him.

I’ve been around the guy for two years covering ASU football. I’ve seen it with my own eyes, and I’ve heard coaches make the same comparison.

I’m also old enough to remember watching Alstott win a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I loved Alstott. Even had a little statue of the guy diving for a touchdown sitting on my desk in college.

Skattebo reminds me of Alstott in a lot of ways that go beyond the reality that they’re both white running backs.

They both crash into defenders. They initiate contact more than they avoid it. They both keep their legs churning after contact. And they’re both harder to stop in short-yardage situations than big dogs on thin chains.

That said, Skattebo also reminds me of another white running back Brandt mentioned.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” Brandt said, “I am not going to sit here … and hear the name Cameron Skattebo in the same sentence as ‘deceptively fast’ or ‘sneaky athletic.’ … There is nothing sneaky about a 40-inch vertical jump; 39.5 this guy just jumped.

“That is better than Adrian Peterson, than Jamaal Charles, than Marshawn (Lynch). It’s better than Christian McCaffrey, who I personally thought drove a stake through the entire heart of the ‘sneaky athletic’ joke industry.”

Except … welllllll … listen, there’s no way to say this delicately: Skattebo reminds me of McCaffrey a little bit.

I cover the NFC West, and  I’ve seen McCaffrey a lot.

How good is Cam Skattebo?Even Christian McCaffrey has taken notice

Each of these guys can line up anywhere. They can catch the ball. They can run the ball. And they’re harder to grab than a water balloon in an oil slick. (Brandt is right that there’s nothing sneaky about their athleticism.)

Anyway, I appreciate what Brandt is getting at. I really, really do.

But if we say that Skattebo reminds us of Alstott and McCaffrey, are we lazy? Or racist? Or do we just think that not enough football fans will know what we mean if we say he reminds us of David Montgomery?

And if we avoid certain comparisons just because they’re white isn’t that a problem, too?

Skattebo is shifty like Barry Sanders, and they have similar builds. But can you really justify comparing a prospect to one of the greatest players in the history of professional sports?

Skattebo breaks tackles like Jerome Bettis. But Bettis ran way taller than Skattebo.

Skattebo reminds me of Darren Sproles, Ricky Watters and Matt Forte. They all could catch the ball out of the backfield and could occasionally line up in the slot.

But why reach for them when McCaffery is fresh on everyone’s minds?   

Bottom line. I’ve watched Skattebo. I watched Jayden Daniels. I watched Brandon Aiyuk. I know a prospect when I see one.

Skattebo is legit.

Compare him to a pinball. Compare him to a bumper car with a V8 engine. Compare tackling him to being blindfolded and trying to catch a brick.

Just make sure you’re calling him an eight-year or 10-year pro who’ll be a solid contributor to any NFL backfield he steps into.

And, yes, Cam Skattebo is a white running back.

Journy Scott scored 17 in a Final Four loss.

Fayette County’s dreams of a state girls’ basketball championship were dashed in a Final Four loss to the Baldwin Braves, 62-55.

Deyla McCoy opened the game with a three-pointer, and Megan Ohonde drove to the hoop for two as the Lady Tigers led 14-13 after one quarter.

Baldwin swung in front, but Journy Scott got hot from deep. A pair of Scott treys helped stake her squad to a 27-23 halftime lead.

The Braves came out of the break prepared, going on a 14-2 run. The Tigers responded, capping a run of their own with a McCoy three-pointer to pull back within 44-40 heading into the fourth quarter.

Baldwin extended their advantage to 11 with six minutes to play. McCoy drilled a three-pointer, but they still trailed by double digits.

Behind by eight with under one minute remaining, the Tigers clawed back. McCoy hit a trey, then, after a Baldwin free throw, Scott sank a three-pointer to pull within three with 15 seconds left.

Unfortunately. it would be as close as they got. The Braves finished the game at the charity stripe to win, 62-55.

Journy Scott led the Tigers with 17 points, and Deyla McCoy scored 15. Megan Ohonde posted 11 points, six steals, and six rebounds. BriAnn Freeman chipped in nine points and eight rebounds.

It was a bit of deja vu, as it was also the Braves who bested the Tigers in last year’s semifinals. The Tigers finish the year 25-6, a culmination of an excellent run for a senior class that won 87 games with back-to-back Final Four appearances.

The Tigers earned their semifinal spot with a commanding 54-41 win over the Luella Lions.

A physical game saw both teams in foul trouble early, but Fayette persevered. Megan Ohonde was a force, scoring down low, then dishing to Samantha Ohonde for two as they led early. Scott’s putback staked them to a 15-8 lead after one quarter.

Fayette built a double-digit lead as Scott capped the first half with a three-pointer, and they kept the pressure up into the third quarter. A fierce Lion squad kept charging, pulling into a 39-39 tie early in the final frame.

Faced with a challenge, the Tigers responded with a 15-2 run to finish the game. A McCoy three-pointer got it started and back-to-back steals and buckets from Freeman and Megan Ohonde pushed the lead to nine. Free throws from Andrea Hope put it into double digits again, and the swarming defense did the rest in the 54-41 win.

Against Luella, Megan Ohonde posted a double-double of 14 points and 15 rebounds, plus four steals. Scott added 14 points.

When Jaren Jackson Jr. heard about the Memphis Grizzlies' new offense, he had some trepidation. It demanded that all five players move in concert, constantly working to maintain proper spacing, confuse help defenders and either create or maintain advantages. The whole thing sounded complicated.

""I thought it was difficult, actually,"" Jackson, an All-Star big man, said. ""It made a lot of sense, but I was like, 'Damn.' I felt like I was going to be thinking more than I was going to be playing.""

Scotty Pippen Jr. had concerns, too. The offense does not involve pick-and-rolls or dribble-handoffs, staples of the modern NBA. For a point guard like him, this seemed like a major adjustment.

""I would say at first I kind of didn't think it would help me, honestly,"" Pippen said. ""I'm like, 'I run a lot of pick-and-rolls, I've been doing that my whole career.'""

Pippen, who spent most of the offseason in Memphis, said the staff introduced it slowly over the summer. 

""We had a couple film sessions,"" Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane said. ""I was away from the team a little bit, training in Texas, but yeah, I was watching film on it. I was like, 'Hm, this is different.'"" At the beginning of training camp, when the players were learning how they were supposed to cut and relocate, ""it was a lot of thinking and thinking through and trying to find your spots or find what works for you,"" Bane said. ""But just like anything, it's a process.""

Jackson hurt his hamstring on the first day of camp. His summertime workouts with assistant coach Erik Schmidt had been tailored to the new system -- ""I would just have a lot of people in them, so I'd know where people are cutting and passing,"" he said -- but, when he was finally supposed to be getting reps in with his teammates, he could only watch.

""I was just like in awe that they were remembering all the things we have to do,"" Jackson said. ""Because they're so random. It's situational.""

Ten years earlier, when Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr installed an offense that would give rise to a dynasty, players were initially ""kicking the ball all over the gym,"" according to then-GM Bob Myers, and ""looking at Steve like he was out of his f---ing mind,"" according to Draymond Green. In Memphis, the system is different -- Green himself described it as ""unconventional"" and ""weird"" -- but the goals are largely the same: to be more unpredictable, to relieve the stars from having to create against loaded-up defenses, to unleash the role players (as cutters, slashers and passers) and to generate more efficient shots. ""What's amazing to me,"" TNT analyst Stan Van Gundy said, is that the Grizzlies have executed it well ""pretty much from the get-go."" Forward John Konchar said it felt natural toward the end of training camp; Jackson found it relatively easy to fit in after his injury because his everybody else had it down.

Three-quarters of the way through the regular season, the Grizzlies have scored 118 points per 100 possessions, the sixth-best mark in the NBA. They've been crushing opponents on the boards and the break but, unlike recent iterations of the team, these strengths aren't covering up glaring weaknesses. For the first time this era, the Grizzlies are making 3s at an above-average rate and, according to Cleaning The Glass, scoring at an above-average rate in the halfcourt. 

""Everyone's getting involved in the offense, everyone's getting touches, everyone feels good,"" Pippen said. ""So it's been working.""

A few years ago, a YouTube video entitled ""Why NBA Teams Should Study A School You've Never Heard Of"" caught Van Gundy's eye. He had, in fact, heard of the school.

""I recognized the gym,"" Van Gundy said.

Before spending more than 20 years on NBA sidelines, Van Gundy coached at several small colleges. At Division III Castleton State in the 1980s, ""one of our biggest rivals to go to the NAIA national tournament every year"" was the school in the video: St. Joseph's College of Maine.

The video, which is now nearing 2 million views, begins with an aerial shot of the Standish, Maine, campus on Sebago Lake, where kids go swimming in September and ice-fishing in January. Daniel Kawashima, who goes by Coach Daniel, tells viewers that this small, DIII college is ""on the forefront of modern offensive basketball.""

Kawashima then cites stats from Synergy Sports: In 2018-19, St. Joe's increased its offensive efficiency from 0.87 points per possession (40th percentile among DIII schools) the previous season to 1.06 per possession (99th percentile) without making major changes to its personnel. What changed, he explains, is that the Monks entirely ditched set plays, pick-and-rolls and DHOs. The new offense instead called for them to ""operate on a wheel"" -- when one player drove or cut into space, every other player had to relocate.

In 2018, Rob Sanicola was heading into his 16th season as the head coach of St. Joe's. In the previous decade, the Monks had experienced success, going 113-52 over a four-year stretch that included a conference championship, then fallen off, going 50-55 in the four years that followed. They were coming off a respectable season (16-10), but they'd been upset in the conference tournament. Sanicola felt it was time to do something different, so he conferred with Noah LaRoche, his former player.

A point guard at St. Joe's in Sanicola's first season as head coach, LaRoche was splitting his time between Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where he'd founded Integrity Hoops, his basketball training and consulting company, and Los Angeles, where he prepped Wasserman's draft prospects and worked with pros. He was already teaching his clients the concepts that would become the foundation of the St. Joe's offense. In the fall, he stopped by some practices in Standish to help Sanicola teach the team a new way to play.

""It's a motion offense that's predicated on ball movement and player movement and this set of principles that they came up with,"" William Armishaw, then an assistant coach at St. Joe's, said.

It sounds preposterously simple: Drive left, move left; drive right, move right. The idea is, when one player penetrates the basket, he is taking the space in front of him and creating space behind him. If you think of the team as one organism, then this means its other players must move so it can maintain its shape.

St. Joe's hunted layups and catch-and-shoot 3s, but not the way the Houston Rockets were doing it with James Harden handling the ball. ""When you do this offense right, it's like eight or nine passes with maybe three dribbles, but you get a layup out of it,"" Armishaw said. After catching the ball, there was no stopping to survey the floor and size up your defender as the defense resets. This wasn't natural to every player, but buy-in came quickly because shooters were getting clean looks and drivers were getting uncontested layups. After shooting 34.3% from deep the previous season, the Monks shot 43% (No. 1 in the nation among DIII schools), and after averaging 15.7 assists per game, they'd raised that figure to 22.2 (No. 2).

The offense ""makes people think quicker,"" Armishaw said. If you receive a kickout pass, you can either shoot the ball or swing it, but not drive (because the initial driver needs time to relocate) -- whenever there were back-to-back drives in practice, a coach would blow the whistle and call the play dead. If you're in the corner and a ballhandler dribbles toward you, it's not a cue to move toward him for a DHO, but to cut to the basket, where you might find an easy two points.

""For our league, we weren't overly big, we weren't overly athletic,"" Armishaw said, but in one game against Johnson & Wales, St. Joe's scored 70 points in the paint. ""We literally just cut out of the corner on every drive. It was unreal.""

Kawashima, who interned for Integrity Hoops in L.A. and assisted LaRoche with workouts in 2018 and 2019, published his video making the case that NBA teams should study St. Joe's in September 2019. It was not immediately clear, though, that any actually would.

""It wasn't like Stan Van Gundy made that video and was the one talking on it,"" Armishaw said. ""Had it ended up on ESPN or something, you might be like, 'Wow, this is crazy.'""

Over time, though, the offense traveled. ""I know some people sought out Noah at different levels,"" Armishaw said, adding that he remembers Roger Williams University coach Mike Tully complimenting Sanicola at an early-season tournament in 2018. Tully spent time with LaRoche the following offseason, and Roger Williams has been running it ever since. In 2020-21, the University of Virginia experimented with it. Last summer, the Grizzlies hired LaRoche as an assistant coach and then hired Sanicola as an assistant coach with the Hustle, their G League affiliate.

For Memphis, it all started last spring, according to coach Taylor Jenkins. Injuries had forced the team to go through what he called a ""development season"" and, rather than waiting until the offseason to think about where the Grizzlies were going next, he wanted to get a head start. ""We really wanted to take a look at basketball in general,"" Jenkins said. Like Sanicola in Standish six years earlier, he was open to anything that could take his team to another level.

""We started thinking about other sports, and I started talking to other coaches,"" Jenkins said. ""I've probably been quoted talking about soccer and hockey. You just see the constant movement."" 

Within the first two minutes of LaRoche's February 2024 appearance on the ""Slappin' Glass"" podcast, he describes basketball an ""invasion sport"" and says that, for all of the game's complexities, ""everything is about managing space, chasing space."" Later, he holds up the 2021 book ""Football's Five Principles of Play"" and explains how the fundamental principles of soccer apply to basketball just the same.

""If you ask me, one thing that could enhance a team instantly, just one little quantum leap, is if they just pounded relocations,"" LaRoche, whom the Grizzlies declined to make available for an interview for this story, says on the podcast. ""When we get an advantage, no matter how we get it -- off a screen, a cut or a drive -- don't stand. Chase space, relocate.""

As well as bringing in LaRoche and Sanicola, whom the Hustle declined to make available for an interview, Memphis hired Tuomas Iisalo, who taught similar concepts when coaching Paris Basketball last season, and Johnny Carpenter, who was on UVA's staff when it tried the offense out. The team also hired Jack Hostetler, who led that 2018-19 St. Joe's team in 3-point percentage (51.1%), as a Hustle assistant, reuniting him with his college coach.

""As I talked to new coaches that are on our staff, I think we unlocked a lot,"" Jenkins said. ""It seems complex, but to us it's very simple. We're going to have our pick-and-rolls built in there to create the advantage, but we're always about, 'How do we create our advantages? Speed of play, movement of play and just identifying where the space is.' Because if you can take that space, the defense naturally has to react, and when they do, then we know where the other space is.""

Pippen, who is enjoying a breakout season, said that the offense has allowed him to find driving lanes, open 3s and opportunities to catch the ball against a defense that has already been compromised. ""Now that we're all on the same page,"" he said, he knows instinctively where his teammates are going to be. At one point, he recalled, LaRoche approached him and said, ""'Look how well you're playing, and you haven't even added pick-and-rolls.'""

Konchar and forward Santi Aldama both attributed Memphis' improved 3-point accuracy (it's up to 38.4% on catch-and-shoot attempts after five consecutive seasons between 35.7% and 36.6%) to the system producing better looks. ""Every player has benefited from it,"" Konchar said. No one, perhaps, more than Jackson, who has been virtually unstoppable as a driver and, before spraining his ankle on Monday, looked like a lock to make his first All-NBA team.

The offense has allowed ""Jaren to get his,"" Grizzlies star Ja Morant said. ""A lot of people normally try to sit in the paint, sit in the gaps with us. When everybody continues to move, it normally takes the help away. And that's why he's been one of the best iso scorers, as he has been this year, outside of the work he's put in and who he is as a player. It's just putting him in easier positions to go deliver.""

Jenkins praised Jackson's ""spatial awareness,"" adding that the 25-year-old has ""been at the forefront"" of the team's collective development. ""We talk about being an invasion sport,"" he said, and Jackson has gotten extremely comfortable chasing space.

No one is suggesting that the offense that went from Standish to Memphis is about to conquer the world and destroy pick-and-roll basketball forever. When the Grizzlies started running it, though, it was at least novel enough to catch opponents off guard.

""Early in the year it definitely was throwing teams off,"" Pippen said. ""We were getting a lot of wide-open backdoor layups.""

Konchar described it as ""unorthodox,"" given that most teams in the NBA ""are dependent on screens, essentially,"" to create their advantages. ""It's definitely different. No one's really seen it before, I don't think.""

Back at St. Joe's, though, when Sanicola initially put the offense in, he'd show players clips of NBA players executing elements of it. Look, it seems crazy, he'd say, but Jayson Tatum made this read last night. The Boston Celtics were not running the whole offense, but if the Monks could see Tatum catching a swing pass, ripping away for a drive, then passing to a teammate filling the space behind him for a wide-open 3, they could see that their concepts worked at the highest level.

""The concepts themselves are not revolutionary,"" Van Gundy said. Other teams have spacing and cutting rules, and it is not unusual to see a player cut and another player fill behind during an NBA game. Typically, though, ""you'll see that movement one time in a possession,"" he said, whereas the Grizzlies will get ""multiple drives, multiple cuts, multiple relocations on a possession,"" which ""breaks down the defense over time and creates bigger and bigger gaps to drive the ball into."" This is what's ""different than what everybody else is doing in the league.""

In 2007, Van Gundy famously turned the Orlando Magic into a title contender by starting Rashard Lewis at the 4 and maximizing their spacing around Dwight Howard, then the league's most unstoppable roll man. ""I was a pick-and-roll guy, so we had the guys spotted up in the corner and the whole thing,"" he said. ""And the biggest complaint I ran into with players -- and I totally understand it -- is, 'Hey, I'm not worried about how many shots I get, but I want to be involved offensively. I don't want to just stand around, I want to move, I want the ball to come to me.'""

Van Gundy empathized, but, generally speaking, spacing the floor was the priority. ""One of the hardest things to do, designing an offense, is to get a combination of spacing and movement,"" he said. ""Movement makes it harder in some ways to keep the floor spaced because, you know, you're running into each other."" Memphis has pulled a magic trick: By having everybody move, it does not have to sacrifice one for the other.

""They maintain their spacing while still getting movement,"" Van Gundy said. ""They're not just standing around. That's not an easy thing to achieve. I mean, it's relatively easy to get good spacing if you've got two guys involved in the action and three guys' job is basically to stand where they are. You can get that. And you can get movement if you're not as concerned about spacing. But they've done both.""

To Grizzlies center Jay Huff, the offense is ""radical in its simplicity."" Huff is the one player on the roster who had experience with it before the season, as he was at UVA when Tony Bennett's staff dipped its toe in. Back then, Huff liked it and thought it suited his game, but ""it wasn't our system, per se,"" he said. ""Here, it's our system -- that's what we do here."" This, he believes, is ""the way to get the most out of it,"" with allowances for ""maybe the occasional screen-and-roll.""

Once you've internalized the system's principles and the reads that are available to you, you're ""just playing basketball,"" Huff said. The offense should appeal to purists, since, at its core, it's five players working together, reading and reacting. 

Huff and his father, a longtime high school coach, have ""had many conversations about this: Basketball in its purest form can be the best team sport there is because everybody does everything,"" he said. ""It's not like one person stays on offense, one person stays on defense or anything like that. You all have to run up and down the court."" And in this particular offense, everybody has to be in sync.

Initially, the challenge for Memphis was ""just trusting each other to be in the right spots,"" guard Luke Kennard said. For the offense to work, no one, including Kennard, who is leading the NBA in 3-point percentage (45.6%), can be stationary. ""You kind of have to realize, 'Oh, when something happens, I have to move,'"" Huff said. ""And it doesn't always mean that you're going to be the person that's open. But you're going to get somebody else open just by movement.""

In a way, the Grizzlies' new style is represents an evolution, not a revolution. ""They've always been an attacking team: Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack,"" Van Gundy said. Now, in addition to running and offensive rebounding with ferocity, they're cutting and relocating in the halfcourt with the same force.

""They're going to get middle,"" Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick told reporters earlier this season. ""And they're going to get into the wheel concept. And they're going to mess you up when they get middle. And those guys just do it over and over again, on multiple times in a possession, multiple possessions in a row.""

Memphis' commitment to its system can be seen as an extension of its commitment to being, in Jenkins' words, the NBA's ""most intense-playing team"" and ""fastest-playing team."" Deemphasizing set plays and pick-and-rolls is a way to avoid slowing the game down. Moving in the halfcourt generally helps on the offensive glass, as it makes it tougher for opponents to box out. (The Grizzlies have also implemented Iisalo's ""tagging up"" concept, which simultaneously allows them to send more players to the boards, prevent leak-outs and apply full-court pressure.)

After watching a play-call edit of Memphis' 135-119 win against Brooklyn in December, Redick told reporters it was ""literally transition, transition, random, transition, transition, random. They play a very specific way and it's simultaneously predictable and unpredictable."" The downside of giving the players this much freedom, though, is that only five teams have a higher turnover rate than the Grizzlies. Pregame at Madison Square Garden in late January, Aldama said that they'd ""struggled against some teams that have been more physical."" Then, against the New York Knicks' physical defense, they proceeded to turn the ball over 26 times in a blowout loss, their sloppiest performance of the season.

""One of the reasons they're a high-turnover team is you're letting a lot of guys play with the ball in their hands and attack and make decisions,"" Van Gundy said. ""It's not as easy as just saying, 'My best player has the ball and he's gonna make all the decisions and the other guys' job is just to finish a play.'""

By running fewer pick-and-rolls and DHOs than any other team, Memphis has made it difficult for opponents to put two defenders on the ball against Morant and Jackson. The flip side, though, is that it means the Grizzlies might be missing opportunities to hunt favorable matchups. In their 132-130 loss against the Atlanta Hawks on Monday, they scored with elite efficiency despite Morant, Jackson and Aldama being on the shelf. Bane finished with 35 points and the first triple-double of his career, but, in the final seconds, lost the ball trying to drive against Dyson Daniels. The turnover, Bane's fifth, led directly to Caris LeVert's game-winning layup on the other end. It was Memphis' third straight loss, all of them by two points or fewer.

At 38-23, the Grizzlies are now fourth in the West, two games behind the second-place Lakers in the loss column, and Jackson is considered ""week-to-week."" In theory, though, their offense makes them more able to absorb absences to key players -- Redick likened them to ""vintage"" San Antonio Spurs teams in this respect -- and counter playoff defenses.

The beauty of the offense, Aldama said, is that ""if I don't know what I'm going to do, then you for sure won't know and you can't really scout it."" He added that he has ""seen teams send us baseline, teams send us middle, teams overshift, teams not shift. I've seen teams try all different stuff."" Defenses can try to help against drives, but Memphis has spent all season making them pay with cuts and 3s.

Van Gundy said that the system is ""made to have playoff success."" He added that, given that Memphis won 56 games and made it to the second round a few years ago, Jenkins deserves credit for changing things up. It takes ""great humility,"" Van Gundy said, ""to say, 'I like what this guy is doing, he knows that system better than I do, I'm bringing them in and letting them teach me and our team to run it.'""

Armishaw, now at UMass Boston in his 11th year as a DIII assistant coach, has never met Jenkins but, having seen Sanicola take a chance on this offense at St. Joe's, he's invested in its success and admires that Jenkins was willing to try it on a far bigger stage. Around Christmas, he and his fiancée sat on the couch and watched a Hustle game. For his birthday, his future mother-in-law gave him a Grizzlies hoodie.

""I'll see a clip every now and then from one of the Memphis Hustle games, and I'll pull it off Twitter and send it to Rob and I'll be like, 'Hey man, that looks familiar,'"" Armishaw said. ""And he'll laugh.""

JAMESTOWN — The Division B Girls State Tournament returning to Jamestown is an opportunity to showcase the community to smaller communities throughout the state, according to Emily Bivens, executive director of the Jamestown Area Chamber of Commerce.

“We get to show them that we have a lot to offer and that they should come back and visit,” she said.

North Dakota High School Activities Association Division B Girls Basketball State Tournament runs Thursday through Saturday, March 6-8, at the Jamestown Civic Center.

Mitch Carlson, co-manager of the state tournament in Jamestown, said the Jamestown Civic Center is a great venue for the North Dakota High School Activities Association Division B Girls Basketball State Tournament.

“The atmosphere was awesome,” he said, referring to last year's tournament. 

The 2024 Division B Girls Basketball State Tournament in Jamestown had an economic impact of more than $1.4 million over three days, according to information provided by Pam Fosse, Civic Center director.

For the championship game last year, 4,700 tickets were sold.

“At one point, we only had 159 seats left,” Fosse said.

According to the information from Fosse, the economic impact to Jamestown was calculated by breaking down the 4,700 attendees into 1,175 day-trip visitors who spent $50 per day over three days and 3,525 overnight visitors who spent $120 per day over three days.

Of that $1.4 million economic impact, 29% was spent on food and beverages, 22% on retail, 20% on transportation, 15% on lodging and 14% for recreation.

To help state tournament visitors, the chamber and Jamestown Tourism made a flyer that will be included in the tournament packet for visitors. The flyer includes restaurants, any discounts being offered and their hours, phone numbers and addresses. The flyer also includes activities for visitors, local businesses and places where alcoholic beverages are served.

“Then there's also a QR code on there that leads to the listing of all of our local restaurants, whether they're offering something or not,” Bivens said.

Bivens said chamber staff called all the restaurants and hotels to remind them of the influx of visitors coming to Jamestown because of the state tournament.

“I think everybody's more aware of how many people will be in town and the impact that it has on our community,” she said.

During a local state tournament committee meeting in February, Bivens said it’s important to call restaurants ahead of time to notify them of any big crowds coming to their establishment.

“Even parents, if you have two families of five going out to eat,” she said.

Buffalo Grill hosted many teams during the state tournament last year, said Jay Boyd, marketing and technology manager at Buffalo Grill, at the state tournament committee meeting in February. He said he also calls teams ahead of time to let them know coaches and bus drivers get a free meal from the restaurant’s lunch menu.

“We normally close at 10 (p.m.) but last year we stayed open longer,” he said.

Jim Roaldson, co-manager of the state tournament in Jamestown, said a successful tournament is based on the competitiveness of the teams.

“If you have a competitive tournament, that alone is going to provide you an exciting environment, a fan base and that's where it begins,” he said. “Anything beyond that is obviously based for the fans’ experience of being comfortable watching, being able to see the game comfortably, to view it comfortably.”

Roaldson said fans attending the games need to have an overall positive experience. He said the fans need to be able to sit comfortably while watching the games and the concessions at the Civic Center need to be good.

“With the teams, the locker rooms and all that, it's just any little thing that you can do better makes for a better experience,” he said.

The Civic Center made several improvements to its facility since last year’s state tournament for fans and the players. The Civic Center installed a new sound system, bleachers on the east end of the facility, score table, lockers and better courtside seating for players.

The improvements were made at the Civic Center after the city of Jamestown told the North Dakota High School Activities Association that it was willing to make upgrades to the facility so it could be named a host site for state basketball tournaments. The Civic Center was later named a host site for state basketball tournaments through 2031.

“Any little upgrade that you can do to get more user friendly, fan friendly and create a better environment plus by having the tournament and being successful allows us to continue to set the bar higher every year,” Roaldson said.

If you ignore the political negotiations and financial obligations, a new ballpark is exciting for fans. It's shiny bleachers and fresh concession stands and maybe, just maybe, a few more entrances to cut down on the lines. The hope is that'll be happening pretty soon for two teams in Major League Baseball. I'd like to take a look ahead to what might happen in the coming decade or so. 

For now, heading into the 2025 season, those two franchises have a home ballpark situation in flux. 

Barring some extreme circumstances, those are the next two teams to get a new ballpark. Just for fun, let's go beyond those two, though. What might be the next teams to move into a new home? 

Let's shoot for the next 10 years. What teams will be in a new ballpark by the time the 2035 season is set to start? 

MLB actually went through a relative boom earlier this century with new ballparks. Eight current ballparks were opened between 2000-04 and five more between 2006-10. If we dipped back to 1998, we could add two more, which means that half the MLB teams moved into their current homes in a 13-year span. As noted, that's a ballpark boom. This is important because those coming before the boom and even some during it might come to the end of their shelf life in the next two decades. 

Since 2010, there have only been three new ones. LoanDepot Park (Marlins) opened in 2012, Truist Park (Braves) in 2017 and Globe Life Field (Rangers) in 2020. Obviously, none of these three are going to be replaced any time soon. 

Going to the other end of the spectrum, the oldest ballparks are Fenway Park (Red Sox, 1912), Wrigley Field (Cubs, 1914) and Dodger Stadium (1962). None of the three are going anywhere, as they are iconic and the teams have worked to modernize them as best they can for the long haul. 

For the sake of brevity, we can also safely eliminate the following 14 venues from contention for replacement in the next 10 years, for various reasons: Oriole Park at Camden Yards (1992, but it's iconic at this point), Coors Field (Rockies, 1995 and it's still plenty gorgeous), T-Mobile Park (Mariners, 1999), Comerica Park (Tigers, 2000), Daikin Park (Astros, 2000), Oracle Park (Giants, 2000), PNC Park (Pirates, 2001), Great American Ball Park (Reds, 2003), Citizens Bank Park (Phillies, 2004), Petco Park (Padres, 2004), Busch Stadium (Cardinals, 2006), Nationals Park (2008), Yankee Stadium (2009) and Target Field (Twins, 2010). 

That leaves eight contenders. 

Los Angeles Angels - Angel Stadium is the oldest park we haven't mentioned yet, having opened in 1966. It underwent significant renovations in 1997-98, however, so the feel is much newer than a ballpark that goes back to the '60s. Just last month, the Angels extended the lease through the 2032 season and there are extensions that could run it through 2038. Ownership seems pretty content to stay put, but if Arte Moreno -- who recently explored a possible sale but then decided to keep the team -- eventually sells, maybe things change. 

Kansas City Royals - Kauffman Stadium opened in 1973 and shares a gigantic lot with Arrowhead and the Chiefs. The Royals have been planning to build a new ballpark and move pretty soon. In fact, it's been floated that they want to be in a new home as early as the 2027 season. Some political battles are forthcoming, but Royals ownership appears to be very committed to moving pretty soon. The sort of motivation they have means it's likely going to happen, one way or another, even if it takes a few extra years. 

Toronto Blue Jays - Rogers Centre is the sixth-oldest ballpark in baseball, having opened in 1989 as SkyDome (remember that?!?). The Blue Jays just spent $400 million to renovate the ballpark in the last two offseasons, though, so they aren't going anywhere. 

Chicago White Sox - Formerly (""New"") Comiskey Park and then US Cellular Field, the White Sox have dropped the ""Guaranteed"" and now play in Rate Field. The ballpark opened in 1991. It has undergone a few renovations, but still, current ownership is looking to move. Further, Jerry Reinsdorf is in ""active discussions"" to sell the team and it's possible a deep-pocketed, younger owner takes over. There's nothing concrete on any front, but all the ingredients are here. Bet on a move within the next decade. 

Cleveland Guardians - Progressive Field opened in 1994 and has undergone a few changes over the years. The location is outstanding and apparently ownership doesn't want to mess with that. Instead of looking to build a new home, they are spending around $200 million to renovate the ballpark in a project that is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 

Arizona Diamondbacks - Chase Field opened with the expansion D-backs for the 1998 season. Ownership has been seeking help from taxpayers with renovations for years and their lease only runs through 2027. They have continued to say publicly that their first choice is to stay in Chase Field, but it's also possible they could build a new ballpark. For now, they are saying they need $400 million to $500 million in renovations to stay put and are trying to work with local government in order to get a deal done. Moving would obviously be a last resort, but the threat of leaving is generally used as leverage over taxpayers. For now, the situation remains up in the air, but it sounds like the most likely outcome is the D-backs staying put and getting their renovations.

Milwaukee Brewers - American Family Field opened for the 2001 season and has a retractable roof. It isn't too old by any stretch, but Brewers ownership has already started putting out feelers for funding, even leaking to reporters the possibility of leaving Milwaukee if demands aren't met. For now, it seems like the Brewers are trying to squeeze lawmakers to allocate taxpayer money for upgrades to the current venue, but new digs aren't out of the question. 

New York Mets - I don't think they're going anywhere any time soon. The wild card here is Steve Cohen. He is the richest owner in MLB with a net worth of more than $20 billion. Citi Field was opened in 2009 and doesn't badly need an upgrade or anything, but Cohen didn't buy the Mets until 2020 and he loves making big splashes. The Mets are the biggest stretch here, but they are not out of the question to move into a new yard in the next, oh, 15 years.

Obviously, it looks like the next team moving into a new, ""permanent"" home will be the A's, possibly followed by the Rays. 

After that, I'm going to say the next teams moving into a new ballpark will be, in order: 

1. Royals. They might even beat the Rays and/or A's. We'll see. 

2. White Sox. We'll say it happens around 2030.

That's it. No other team seems close. Maybe I'll get nuts and go with the Mets for a third prediction. Hey, why not? Nah.

3. Diamondbacks. My hunch is they get the renovation deal they like and significantly change Chase Field. Aside from the A's, Rays, Royals and White Sox, though, they are the best bet to move into a new ballpark in the next decade -- even if it's not a good bet at all.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Fifa set to dish out $1bn to Club World Cup teams in inaugural tournament,https://sports.yahoo.com/article/fifa-set-dish-1bn-club-183218091.html,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 18:32:18 GMT","

Fifa appear set to award over $1bn in revenue to clubs participating in this summer's inaugural edition of the Club World Cup.

The European Club Association (ECA), who are negotiating on behalf of some of the participating European clubs, are nearing a deal with football's global governing body over the payments, reports the BBC.

The 32 clubs involved in the expanded tournament – 12 of which are from Europe – look set to split what is potentially the biggest prize fund in club football, with $575m based on participation and $465m based on sporting performance. The revenues have been partly funded by a $1bn global TV deal agreed with DAZN last year, and will be awarded on an individual basis.

The competition takes place across 11 cities and 12 stadiums in the USA between 14 June and 13 July, just under a year before the 2026 World Cup begins.

And the inaugural edition includes European sides such as Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Inter Milan, as well as Argentine giants Boca Juniors and River Plate, recent Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo and Fluminense, and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami.

11 of the 12 European clubs are represented by the ECA, with these teams expected to earn a higher share of the revenue due to their importance within the competition. Madrid are not represented due to their support for the European Super League.

Some clubs not participating in the tournament are also set to receive at least $150m in so-called “solidarity payments”, with that money also coming out of a tournament budget of $2bn.

Fifa has claimed that it will not make any profit from the competition, instead re-investing the entire $1bn into club football across the world.

The first edition of the new Club World Cup marks a move away from the old competition, which has now been re-named as the Intercontinental Cup. That annual tournament sees the winners of the other five continental trophies playing each other in a knockout tournament before facing the Champions League winners, who get a bye to the final.

Last season, Real Madrid won the first Intercontinental Cup with a 3-0 victory over Pachuca in December 2024.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Inter Milan make the trip to Rotterdam to take on Feyenoord in the Champions League’s last 16 this evening.

Simeone Inzaghi’s side impressed in the league phase to finish fourth. Across their eight games, the Italian champions conceded just one goal to post the Champions League’s best defensive record.

Inter are also going strong domestically. The Nerazzurri lead the title race from Napoli and have also progressed into the Coppa Italia semi-finals.

However, Inter will be wary of a Feyenoord side who have already claimed a Serie A scalp. The Dutch side eliminated AC Milan in the play-off round to reach this stage of the competition for the first time in the Champions League era.

Feyenoord are under new management, following the appointment of Robin van Persie as head coach in February.

Simeone Inzaghi is short of depth at wing-back for the clash. Federico Dimarco is ruled out, alongside fellow options Matteo Darmian, Carlos Augusto and Nicola Zalewski. Alessandro Bastoni could be pushed further forward into a wing-back role.

 

Inter will also be without first-choice goalkeeper Yann Sommer, so Josep Martínez should deputise in goal. Valentin Carboni is not expected to return this season after sustaining an ACL injury.

Inter Milan predicted XI: J.Martinez; Pavard, De Vrij, Acerbi; Dumfries, Barella, Calhanoglu, Mkhitaryan, Bastoni; L.Martinez, Thuram.

Feyenoord host Inter Milan in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Wednesday March 5th 2025. Kick-off at De Kuip is 17:45 GMT.

Feyenoord vs Inter will be available to watch live on TNT Sports 2 in the UK.

At 165 pounds, Penn State's Mitchell Mesenbrink wrestles Kaden Milheim during the match against American University in Rec. Hall on Friday, Feb. 21, 2025 in University Park, Pa. The Nittany Lions beat the Eagles 50-3.

Just days away from the start of the Big Ten Tournaments, Penn State wrestling is finishing up preparations for the first of two tournaments in March.

All 10 Nittany Lion wrestlers will compete in the Big Ten Tournaments, with multiple competitors likely receiving a No. 1 seed for their respective weight classes.

Two of those likely No. 1 wrestlers are Mitchell Mesenbrink and Beau Bartlett. The two wrestlers take very different approaches to the lengthy tournament and their potential matchups.

Mesenbrink approaches each match without even really knowing his opponent until about five minutes before he runs out to the mat.

“I’m going to be honest, I don’t even look at the bracket,” Mesenbrink said. “I don’t even know until like minutes before my bout… It should be whoever steps out there, look at their lead leg and go.”

Bartlett was more on the eager side with his approach leading up to the Big Ten Tournament.

“There’s just a lot of energy,” Bartlett said. “I’m going to try to let it build up through the week and not just go 100 miles per hour today.”

Bartlett has shown that energy throughout the season with his more aggressive approach as the season has progressed. This has helped him lead to an undefeated regular season and earn the No. 1 ranking at 141 pounds.

“It’s going to be really hard not to (go 100 mph). I’m pretty excited, but just slow and steady and pick it up when I need to,” Bartlett said.

These wrestlers spend the entire season building up to this tournament and the national championships. With essentially the entire season on the line, these upcoming bouts become the most important matches of the season.

Some of those matches could have high implications. Greg Kerkvliet has the chance to wrestle against two-time national champion Gable Steveson. Steveson and Kerkvliet sit at No. 1 and No. 2 in the heavyweight class.

“He beat good guys last year,” coach Cael Sanderson said. “There’s always a lot of good wrestlers, and he’s wrestling good guys in here all the time.”

The mentality in the wrestling room remains the same for each match, and each practice prepares them for the next one.

“Conference tournament is really about preparing for the national tournament, so we just kind of keep that mentality consistent, and it seems to help our guys at the right time,” Sanderson said.

The Nittany Lions continue to keep the mood light even with the matches becoming the most important of the season, with the bouts being some of the last of the season.

“The bigger the match, the more fun it is,” Sanderson said. “We spend every day pretty much preparing and thinking about big matches, so when you actually have an opportunity to go participate and do something about those big matches, I think that’s what it’s all about.”

The most charitable possible explanation for the Luka Dončić trade -- and this was already a stretch -- was that it improved the team's short-term prospects. Nico Harrison told us as much when he said, ""The future to me is three to four years from now"" in his post-trade press conference. Anthony Davis, though not nearly as valuable as Dončić, complements Kyrie Irving quite well. Max Christie has already played well in Dallas, and the extra first-round pick gained gave Dallas another chip to use for further upgrades over the summer. That still probably didn't make the post-Dončić Mavericks better than the pre-Dončić Mavericks, but a justification existed if you were willing to look for it hard enough.

Well, Year No. 1 of that theoretical window went up in smoke on Monday when Kyrie Irving tore his left ACL. It's entirely possible that Year No. 2 is gone as well. There's not exactly a fixed timeline for ACL recoveries. Consider the cases of Iman Shumpert and Derrick Rose. The two of them both tore ACLs on the same day: April 28, 2012. Shumpert was back on the court by Jan. 17, 2013. Rose did not play a single minute during the 2012-13 season. Late-season ACL tears like theirs have derailed multiple seasons for several critical players. Jamal Murray tore his ACL on April 12, 2021, and did not return until the beginning of the 2022-23 season. Irving is in his 30s. He has a lengthy history of injuries, especially in the left knee, that includes his presently torn ligament. There is no guarantee whatsoever that Irving will play next season. Even if he does, the odds of him returning to full strength by the playoffs don't appear great.

That means the first season in which Dallas can reasonably expect to have its two pillars healthy from start to finish would be the 2026-27 campaign, the third year of that stated window. That will be Davis' age-33 season and Irving's age-34 year. Davis himself has a lengthy history of injuries. He has thus far played just 31 minutes in over a month as a Maverick. As bad as this looks now, it would only take one less-than-freak occurrence to make things a whole lot worse.

Could Dallas trade its way into a roster capable of holding down the fort until Irving returns? Well, maybe, but remember, they failed to extract every ounce of value from the Lakers in the Dončić deal and are somewhat limited in what they can offer. They don't have a bad salary either. Any salary they use to match money on a possible acquisition is going to be attached to someone they'd miss. Say they want to chase Kevin Durant, as was reported at the deadline. He's owed $54.7 million next season. It would take three or four good players to match money there, and even if they did, they'd be bringing in another aging, injury-prone star.

In short, we're looking at maybe one or two years of winning here on the GM's own timeline. After that, things get dark. Not just on the basketball court, but within the entire framework of the organization's place in professional basketball. The Mavericks have already lost a substantial amount of fan support in the wake of the Dončić deal. They're probably going to lose more of it after they decided to raise season-ticket prices on Monday. Their push to win before this season also cost them quite a bit of their future. Dallas doesn't control its own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030. When this core ages out, there won't be young prospects coming in to replace them.

That's bad enough, but they get even worse when you consider where those picks are going. The 2028 pick is owed to the San Antonio Spurs through a swap. The 2029 pick is likely to go to the Houston Rockets outright. The 2030 pick is headed to the Oklahoma City Thunder through a swap. Two of those teams play in the same state as the Mavericks. The third is geographically closer to them than either the Spurs or Rockets. These teams are, effectively, the three biggest regional competitors the Mavericks have for the loyalty of prospective basketball fans. Those three teams also happen to have three of the most promising young rosters in the NBA. Guess which teams fans in that part of the country are going to flock to as this Dallas situation continues to deteriorate? It's either them or Dončić's Lakers, who have never had trouble attracting fans outside of their home market.

This is not just a basketball issue. This is an existential crisis for the Mavericks, the sort that can make or break a team's standing in the league for decades. What this team does in the next few transaction cycles is going to determine whether or not the city of Dallas will ever embrace the Mavericks again. And what they should do, as soon as humanly possible, is clear: trade Anthony Davis.

Let's make this clear from the jump: none of this is Davis' fault. The overwhelming majority of teams would be thrilled to have him. The Mavericks are simply in the middle of a wholly unique mess of their own creation, one in which Davis makes sense neither off the court nor on it. To an extraordinarily angry fanbase, Davis is fighting an uphill battle. Short of potentially winning a championship, there is little he can do to shed the label of ""the player we have instead of Luka Dončić.""

What Dallas needs, more than anything, is a fresh start, a new young player for the fan base to rally around. They have a very brief window to find that player. Jasmyn Wimbish explained in detail why it's time for the Mavericks to tank here, but here's the short explanation: Dallas has two chances left to control its own pick this decade. After the 2026 draft, they have no safe way to position themselves to add a notable young player. Their pick this year, given the injuries they've endured, will almost certainly be at the backend of the lottery. If they can weaken the roster enough, their pick next year could be closer to the front of it. Their next chance to do so after 2026 won't come until 2031.

Two lottery picks guarantee nothing, but remember, trading Davis would do more than just weaken next year's team. Such a deal would presumably net an impressive haul in its own right. Not nearly the sort of return teams would have given up for Dončić, but, well, Davis is already a sunk cost. This is where the Mavericks stand today. The 10-year Dončić window is closed. Most of the three-or-four-year Davis and Irving window is now closed, and it's no certainty that it ever re-opens. The Mavericks made their bed and now they have to sleep in it. Two lottery picks plus whatever they can get back for Davis and their other veterans may not be a slam dunk of a rebuild, but given the grim outlook this win-now plan faces after Irving's injury, it's still the best this team can do.

It helps that a rebuild wouldn't be fully starting from scratch. The Mavericks have at least two youngsters with considerable upside in Dereck Lively and Max Christie. Jaden Hardy is going to benefit from the on-ball opportunities Irving's absence creates, and he's locked into an extremely favorable contract. These are players who could be part of the next winning Mavericks team, but none are equipped to lead the Mavericks into the post-Davis and Irving future. That's what they're going to have to do if Dallas stays the course here.

The most obvious roadblock here is Harrison. He bet his career on Davis. It seems almost impossible to imagine him giving up the star he wanted badly enough to trade away Dončić. But we're not writing about what's best for Nico Harrison. We're writing about what's best for the Dallas Mavericks. And if Nico Harrison stands in the way of what's best for the Dallas Mavericks, then Nico Harrison should no longer be the general manager of the Dallas Mavericks.

There's plenty of justification for a leadership change already. The job of a general manager is to position his team for both the present and the future. It's hard to imagine any general manager who openly dismisses a future beyond four years well-suited for the job. A report from Tim Cato of DLLS even surfaced suggesting that Harrison is not planning to hold the job for the long haul. If that is indeed the case, even letting Harrison make the trade was irresponsible on the ownership's part. The goals of a general manager and an organization need to be aligned. It's not clear that they are in Dallas. And from a fan retention perspective, moving on from Harrison might be a necessary step. The trust between city and franchise has been broken. The first step in mending it would be installing someone the fan base does trust in the GM seat moving forward.

Where does Irving fit into this? He still has a surprising amount of leverage. He has a player option for next season. Whether he's capable of playing or not, the Mavericks have to re-sign him. The notion of letting him walk for nothing when the entire team was just retrofitted around his timeline is simply untenable. As low as this team's championship odds with Davis already are, they drop to zero if Irving isn't part of the team. Even hurt, he is far and away the most popular Maverick today. If there's any lingering goodwill with the fans here whatsoever, it dies if Irving leaves.

There's a reasonable compromise for both sides here. Rudy Gobert gave them a template when he declined his $46.6 million 2025-26 player option to re-sign in Minnesota for $109.5 million over three years. Doing so lowered his immediate cap hit, but guaranteed him long-term money. Irving, given the risk of entering free agency in 2026 coming off of an ACL tear, would probably be amenable to something like that, and by locking him in long-term, the Mavericks would probably have an easier time convincing him to be cautious when it comes to his recovery timeline. If they're tanking, it doesn't make sense to play him next season anyway. His best chance at returning anywhere near an All-Star level would be with the 19-month recovery timeline skipping year would create, and that would give the Mavericks a chance to immediately become relatively competitive as soon as they stand to give away picks. The last thing anyone in this organization should want would be giving the Thunder, Rockets or Spurs high draft picks.

What sort of market would Davis garner if he was made available? Not the one Dončić would have had the Mavericks shopped him properly, but still a considerable one. Houston stands out as the ideal suitor, given its depth of assets and its ability to send Dallas its own 2029 pick back. Golden State has been interested in the past and still controls the bulk of its future draft capital. The same could be said for Sacramento, who sorely needs a rim-protector to pair with Domantas Sabonis. Speaking of teams needing rim protection, an under-the-radar option might be Phoenix. Durant is almost certainly headed out over the summer, so perhaps there is a three-way construction that pairs Davis with Devin Booker and turns Durant into a younger asset for Dallas. Davis remains an All-NBA-caliber player. Finding him a home wouldn't be difficult.

That home just shouldn't be in Dallas. It never should have been in Dallas. If Dallas was ever going to trade Dončić, it should have been for the sort of package that a star typically nets: one loaded with young players and draft picks. This harebrained win-now-without-the-second-best-player-in-the-NBA scheme never made sense from the start, and the Irving injury only underlined the risk that Dallas didn't seem to know it was taking. It's time for the Mavericks to cut their losses and start over. As unappealing as that might sound, it's a far brighter future than the one they're headed for when the Davis-Irving era inevitably peters out.

Barely a month ago, the Dallas Mavericks pulled a dumbfounding move in trading superstar Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers for a minuscule package centered around Anthony Davis. The day immediately following the news, Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison held a press conference to discuss the deal that is still sending shockwaves throughout the league.

Fans searched for contrition and reassurance in Harrison's words. At the very least, a credible explanation as to why the franchise traded away a 26-year-old generational talent who is fresh off leading that exact team to the NBA Finals just nine months earlier. Instead, Harrison hammered on the idea that ""defense wins championships,"" subtlety jabbing Dončić by saying Davis ""added"" to the culture of what he and the Mavericks were trying to build.

Rumors and reports have been non-stop as to the reasoning behind Dallas' decision, which have mostly been aimed at tearing down Dončić as a player, calling into question his commitment to staying in shape, his failure as a lockdown defender and his penchant for enjoying his free time by drinking beer -- as if every other Hall of Fame player in league history treated their body like a temple.

Both Harrison and Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont have used the work ethic of Kobe Bryant and his ""Mamba Mentality"" motto as the standard of what they want out of their players going forward, something that, according to both of them, Dončić did not fit into.

But even putting aside the flimsy reasons as to why Harrison decided to pull the trigger on this deal, the return doesn't make much sense. Davis is one of the best defenders in the league, and is a top 10 offensive player himself, but he's also on the wrong side of 30 with an injury history that reads as long as a CVS receipt. By swapping the two players, the Mavericks are essentially mortgaging their future, something that Harrison has made clear that he's doesn't care about.

""The future to me is three to four years from now,"" Harrison said the day after the trade. ""The future ten years from now -- they'll probably bury me and [Mavericks coach Jason Kidd] by then. Or we'll bury ourselves.""

Well, grab a shovel and start digging. It's been a month since the trade and Harrison's short-term plan is already blowing up in his face. Davis has played a total of 31 minutes for the Mavericks after picking up an adductor strain in his very first game in a Dallas uniform. A few games after that, another one of Dallas' big men went down when Daniel Gafford picked up a knee sprain. Oh, and Dereck Lively II has been out since Jan. 15 with a fracture ankle. The Mavericks got dealt the final death blow earlier this week when the team announced All-Star guard Kyrie Irving sustained an ACL tear in his left knee during the team's 122-98 loss to the Sacramento Kings, sidelining him for the remainder of the season, and likely most of next season as well.

Late Tuesday, Harrison released a statement about Irving's injury in which he elicited more praise and emotion than he ever said about Dončić after trading him in the middle of the night. Harrison once again evoked the work ethic of Bryant: ""His work ethic and absolute dedication to his craft, it's cut from the cloth of greats. I know it, I lived it, and I see the same ferocity and passion in him that I saw in Kobe."" Harrison called Irving the ""heart and soul"" of the Mavericks, and touched on his ""evolution and growth"" as a player. It basically read as yet another sleight to Dončić, the guy who has carried the Mavericks franchise on his back since the day he was drafted. But I digress.

With Irving's ACL injury, that four-year future Harrison is only focusing on just evaporated. An ACL tear can take anywhere between 8-12 months to fully heal, so at the latest Irving won't be available until March 2026. That puts the thought of contending for a championship next season out the window. And that's assuming Irving even stays in Dallas past this season, as he has a $43.96 million player option he's able to opt out of to become an unrestricted free agent and sign elsewhere.

That's Problem 1, and regardless of Irving's decision to stay or leave, it still doesn't change the fact that he's going to miss most, or maybe all of next season. Then we come to our second concern: Anthony Davis. Why would Davis want to waste a season with Dallas when he can try to force a trade elsewhere to a championship-contending team? 

There's nothing to suggest Davis would force a move, but maybe it's wise for the Mavericks to consider trading the All-Star forward, as my colleague Sam Quinn suggested. If Irving is to miss all of next season, the first time that duo will be available to play together will be in the 2026-27 season, when Davis is 33 and Irving is 34. Banking on both being fully healthy at that time is a massive risk, and all it takes is one more injury to completely derail Harrison's already harebrained scheme even further.

Davis won't fetch a massive haul for the Mavericks, though they didn't get one for Dončić either, and Harrison may be too proud to even trade the guy he just staked his whole career on. But besides all the theoretical ideas about what the Mavericks should do at this juncture, all of this was completely avoidable had Harrison not traded Dončić.

I'm not saying Dončić getting traded led to Irving's freak injury. But for the last six weeks, Irving led the league in minutes played (38.7). Most of the offensive responsibility fell on his shoulders without Dončić to lean on, and as an undersized veteran guard who loves to get to the rim, the reps start to add up, increasing the likelihood for an injury, though one as catastrophic as this could've never been predicted.

But had Irving torn his ACL with Dončić still on the roster, at least that would've only dampened the next year and a half for Dallas. Dončić was always the failsafe for the Mavericks, someone who is barely in his prime, and could be rebuilt around if Irving struggled to round back into form. Without him there, the Mavericks are like a sinking ship slowly meeting its inevitable demise with Harrison still trying to convince everyone that what he did was the right decision.

That four-year window Harrison mentioned has quickly turned into a two-year window, and even that's generous given who they've built this team around. He's more than willing to take the blame if this whole ordeal goes sideways, which you could very well argue it already has, but Harrison's willingness to take accountability doesn't ignore the hubris with which he acted when trading Dončić in the first place. And to make matters worse, even if the Mavericks decided to fire Harrison today, the damage he's caused will be felt throughout this franchise for the better part of the next decade, given that Dallas doesn't control any of its own first-round picks between 2027 and 2030.

Harrison's short-term plan has quickly been engulfed by a fiery inferno, and the long-term outlook looks even worse. With the way this is going, Harrison may be relieved of his duties before long, but the Mavericks will be stuck holding the bag while being forced to watch Dončić wear another team's jersey while continuing his ascension towards one of the greatest players in league history. And Harrison will always be remembered as the guy who sent him in what is already the worst trade in NBA history.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=sports+news,Chiefs to trade Joe Thuney to Bears,https://sports.yahoo.com/article/chiefs-trade-joe-thuney-bears-143537031.html,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:35:37 GMT","

When the new league year opens, one of the Chiefs' key offensive linemen will be on the move.

According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media, Kansas City is trading Joe Thuney to Chicago.

The Chiefs will receive a 2026 fourth-round pick in exchange for Thuney.

It's a significant move for both teams. The Chiefs are moving on from one of their most valuable players in 2024, as Thuney slid over from left guard to play left tackle midway through the season when it became clear he was the best option to play the position on the roster. Thuney earned his third straight Pro Bowl berth and was an AP first-team All-Pro for the second season in a row.

Thuney, 32, signed with the Chiefs in 2021 after playing his first five years with the Patriots. He is a four-time Super Bowl champion, having won two with New England (LI, LIII) and two with Kansas City (LVII, LVIII).

By trading Thuney, the Chiefs will save $16 million against the cap. Thuney is currently entering the last year of his contract and is set to make $15.5 million in base salary.

Kansas City also franchise-tagged guard Trey Smith and has signaled that the club would like to sign him to a long-term deal.

This is the second trade Chicago has agreed to this week to beef up its offensive line. The club also reportedly will officially acquire Jonah Jackson from the Rams at the start of the new league year.

New Bears head coach Ben Johnson is familiar with Jackson from their shared time on the Lions.

Both Thuney and Jackson should help the club’s pass protection for rising second-year QB Caleb Williams, who was sacked a league-high 68 times in 2024.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The Chicago Bears aren't waiting for free agency or the 2025 NFL Draft to improve the offensive line, as they have now made two trades in the same amount of days to land two starting offensive guards. After sending the Los Angeles Rams a sixth-round pick for Jonah Jackson, the Bears are giving the Kansas City Chiefs a 2026 fourth-round pick for offensive guard Joe Thuney.

Chicago acquires a four-time All-Pro protector, who is just 32 years old and has four Super Bowl rings. Quarterback Caleb Williams needs a player like this, as he was sacked 68 times in his first NFL season, which led the league and was tied for the third-most sacks taken all time.

The Chiefs are a worse team without Thuney in the lineup, but they move his contract off their books while they attempt to strike a record-breaking deal with right guard Trey Smith and make moves in free agency with limited financial resources. It was a tough decision to make, but it's understood why Kansas City went this direction. As for the trade compensation? That's a different story. 

Let's attempt to grade this trade: 

Bears fans' last exposure to Thuney was probably him getting worked by Josh Sweat in the Super Bowl, but that was because he's a left guard, not a left tackle. Thuney was put in a tough situation since every other plan Kansas City made at left tackle did not work out, so the Chiefs had to rely on their interior star.

The Bears are serious about protecting Williams. In 2025, Braxton Jones figures to start at left tackle, Thuney at left guard, Jackson at right guard and Darnell Wright at right tackle. We'll see what happens at center. Not every one of the 68 sacks Williams took in 2024 can be attributed to the offensive line, but good things did happen on occasion when he actually had time to throw.

Thuney will likely be given an extension before he takes a single snap for the Bears, but that's completely fine since he's just 32. The past two days, the Bears have spent a sixth-round pick and a future fourth-round pick to solidify both guard spots. Ryan Poles is likely polling well in Chicago.

Thuney was a star for the Chiefs over the past few seasons, but the bottom line is that Kansas City currently has the highest-paid center and highest-paid offensive guard on roster while Thuney, entering the final year of his current contract and carries a cap hit of $16 million next season, was likely looking for an extension. The Chiefs were $18.1 million over the cap before this move, and still have work to do if they want to be players in free agency. 

This was surely a tough decision for Brett Veach, because Suamataia as a replacement is no sure thing, and we learned from Super Bowls LV and LIX that Patrick Mahomes needs adequate protection if the Chiefs want to hoist trophies. The main reason this grade is so low is because Thuney is worth more than a future fourth-round pick.

Finding effective pitchers in the late rounds is paramount to having a successful fantasy baseball season. Pitchers tend to be more volatile than hitters, which means managers who fail to find successful late-round hurlers are leaving so much profit potential for their competitors.

This year, I tried to avoid listing pitchers who should be slightly more valuable than their ADP suggests. For example, I like Cristopher Sánchez and Zack Eflin at their current Yahoo ADP. But I wouldn’t call them sleepers. They are good value picks but are unlikely to blow away expectations. The 10 men listed below all have a chance to be much better than expected, and they are all available past pick 200 in Yahoo drafts.

[Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league for the 2025 MLB season]

One more note: I decided not to include any rookies. There is obvious sleeper potential for the likes of Jackson Jobe, Kumar Rocker and Quinn Mathews. But I have already written about them in previous articles.

Without further ado, let’s look at some hurlers who could blow the doors off their current projections.

Go here for my sleeper hitters.

It’s hard to believe that one of last season’s best stretch-run starters is available late in 2025 drafts. Francis produced a 1.53 ERA and a 0.53 WHIP after becoming a full-time starter on August 7, and he threw at least seven innings in five of nine outings across that stretch. Francis could regress heavily and still be a value pick at his current ADP.

There were two factors suppressing Schmidt’s draft value in February: he made just 16 starts last year, and he didn’t have a secure rotation spot. But between Luis Gil suffering an injury and Schmidt seemingly ahead of Marcus Stroman in the pecking order, there is a clear path for the right-hander to make 30 starts this year. Schmidt made notable improvements in 2024, which included boosting his strikeout rate to 26.3%. Schmidt’s 105 Stuff+ score placed 28th among pitchers who threw at least 80 innings.

The Padres front office is among the most active in baseball, which means that we should take the offseason Robert Suárez trade rumors seriously. It seems sensible that a team with a strong relief corps and holes in their batting order would entertain the idea of trading away a 34-year-old closer whose value will never be higher than it is right now.

Adam (1.95 ERA, 0.86 WHIP in 2024) is among the best relievers in baseball and would easily be a top-10 closer if the Padres moved him to the ninth inning. Even in a setup role, Adam will return enough production to justify his Yahoo ADP.

Luzardo is the perfect type of boom-or-bust pitcher to select late in Yahoo drafts. His ceiling is incredibly high, as is evidenced by the 3.58 ERA and 208 strikeouts he produced in 2023. The left-hander has stated that he is healthy after an injury-impacted 2024 season, and any negative effects of being traded to a club with a more challenging home park should be offset by having a better supporting cast.

Cortes has been an effective starter in three of the past four years, with a blip during an injury-impacted 2023 season serving as his only disappointment. The left-hander will now ply his trade for the Brewers, who are one of the best franchises in baseball at getting outstanding results out of their hurlers. Cortes could repeat his 2024 season (3.77 ERA, 1.15 WHIP, 162 SO) and repay his current ADP, but he has the potential to be much better than that.

Bradford was limited to 14 outings in what could otherwise be categorized as a breakout season (3.54 ERA, 1.01 WHIP). The southpaw doesn’t have overpowering stuff, but he is among baseball’s best control pitchers (4.2% walk rate) and limits base knocks by inducing plenty of fly balls. Although Bradford will be more prone to homers than the average starter, we have seen many pitchers thrive with a low-walk, fly-ball-heavy game plan.

The upside of Herz is obvious — he struck out 106 batters in 88.2 innings last season, which gives him the potential to have a remarkable strikeout total across 30 starts. And according to Statcast, the rookie was unlucky, as his xBA (.208) and xERA (3.26) were far lower than his actual marks. Herz will need to battle for a rotation spot in spring training, but he is in competition with two unremarkable starters who threw less than 100 innings last year (Trevor Williams, Michael Soroka).

Like Herz, Festa will need to earn a rotation spot in spring training. Fortunately for him, Chris Paddack (4.99 ERA, 88.1 IP in 2024) is not much of an obstacle. After some struggles in his initial three major league starts, Festa produced solid ratios (3.96 ERA, 1.24 WHIP) and an eye-popping 11.2 K/9 rate across his final 11 outings, which was identical to his lifetime mark in the minors. Like Herz, Festa is a boom-or-bust final-round option who can be cut at the end of March if he fails to earn a rotation spot.

Brown is the third consecutive pitcher in this article who needs to earn a rotation spot by beating out mediocre veterans. In the case of Brown, the competition includes Javier Assad and Colin Rea. And like Festa and Herz, Brown should be exciting for fantasy managers because of terrific swing-and-miss skills (28.8% strikeout rate) that give him a high ceiling when working out of the rotation. My only reason to pause on Brown is that he uses just two pitches, but he has made his arsenal work thus far.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

The New England Patriots are coming off back-to-back 4-13 seasons that were both good for last place in the AFC East. While that's not where Robert Kraft wants his once perennial playoff contender, there is promise that the franchise is finally on the upswing. 

After moving on from Jerod Mayo after just one season, the club has hired Mike Vrabel to lead the organization going forward as the head coach. On top of the boost the Patriots should get with Vrabel in-house, they've also seemingly solved the toughest task of any rebuild in the NFL: finding the franchise quarterback. Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in last year's draft, flashed his potential as an elite quarterback prospect during his rookie season, and now it's up to the decision-makers in Foxborough to build up the roster around him as he heads into Year 2. 

Fortunately for the Patriots, they aren't lacking in assets to further jump-start this rebuild. The franchise is armed with the most cap space in the entire league at $127.6 million and possesses the No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. How do the Patriots use those assets effectively? Let's roll out five moves they should make this offseason to better themselves in 2025 and going forward. 

The Patriots have left the tackle positions completely barren over the last few years, which has been a key part of their shortcomings. The line couldn't hold up at all throughout the year and it was a turnstile whether it was Maye or Jacoby Brissett under center. That can't continue. Specifically, the Patriots need a bona fide left tackle and there just so happens to be one that is set to hit the free agent market in Ronnie Stanley. While Stanley is going to be 31 at the start of next season, the Patriots can't get too picky. They need to create a wall in front of Maye and Stanley just put together a Pro Bowl season in 2024 where he allowed just two sacks, according to Pro Football Focus. They also have the financial flexibility with their cap space and Maye being on his rookie deal to extend themselves for Stanley. It's not the sexiest of signings, but it's the most important one to ensure the offense can function. 

As we noted above with Stanley, the Patriots offensive line is the No. 1 problem on the roster. Not only do they need to solidify left tackle, but they also need a right tackle especially if they view Mike Onwenu -- who signed a $57 million extension last offseason -- as a guard. The team should look toward the NFL Draft to address the tackle position over the long term, but also can't simply wait until then. Morgan Moses has been a career right tackle and the 33-year-old allowed just two sacks for the Jets last season. He'd make sense as a short-term signing to give the Patriots an experienced veteran on the right side, while they develop a mainstay at either tackle position going forward. 

After solidifying the offensive line, New England needs to improve its receiver room, which was arguably the worst in the NFL in 2024. The top wideout set to hit the free agent market is Tampa Bay's Chris Godwin. The Patriots should simply outbid the rest of the bunch for his services. Godwin not only is an elite pass catcher when healthy (recovering from a season-ending ankle injury) but would be a solid veteran to add to a room to help get the likes of Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker -- two 2024 draft picks -- on a somewhat positive trajectory. Godwin would prove to be a go-to target for Maye and has the talent of being the team's first 1,000-yard receiver since Julian Edelman in 2019. 

Mike Vrabel made it a point of emphasis in his opening press conference to note that he views building through the trenches as a key component to success in the NFL. With the Patriots having a tremendous amount of cap space, they have the ability to bring in a number of highly sought-after free agents this cycle. While we have them addressing the offensive line and wide receiver, they also have the money to fill up their needs along the defensive line as well. Philadelphia's Milton Williams may not be a household name, but was an instrumental piece in the Eagles winning Super Bowl LIX, and would be a welcome addition along New England's defensive line. Milton will be just 26 years old at the start of next season, making him a good fit for the team's long-term future as well. 

In an ideal world, the Patriots try and fill as many holes on the roster as they can in free agency and the trade market leading up to the 2025 NFL Draft. Under that scenario, they can opt for a ""best player available"" approach. If not, their hand may be forced into taking an offensive tackle or a receiver at No. 4 overall. That said, if Abdul Carter finds himself sitting there when New England is on the clock with the fourth pick, they should run to the podium. Carter fills a key need at edge rusher and is arguably the top overall prospect in the draft. While it's a bit farfetched that he'd fall to the Patriots, the teams ahead of them all need a quarterback. So, they can hope that Cam Ward and Shedeur Sanders endear themselves enough for them to both come off the board within the first three selections. That'd leave either Carter or Colorado's Travis Hunter for the Patriots. Either would be a welcome addition, but Carter plays more of a premium position and fills more of a need for New England.

After a tremendous momentum streak plated by wins centered around victories against the Dallas Stars and the Vegas Golden Knights, the Los Angeles Kings have lost four games in a row. The team had a winless road trip, being outscored 15-4.

The only silver lining about this time frame? The rest of the Division is also currently in a blunder-type mode, with Anaheim being the best team over the last ten, going 6-3-1. The Kings are second in their last ten, tied with the Golden Knights, going 5-3-2. So, while the team is putting up alarming and catastrophic results in the interim, the rest of the Division is putting out fires in sync.

The Kings have matched the Knights step for step, but the Edmonton Oilers have gone 3-7-0 in their last ten and have lost six out of their last seven. This downward spiral for the Oilers was punctuated by a recent 6-2 thumping by the Ducks in their own arena. Unfortunately for the Kings, they have not made up the amount of ground rarely provided by a team as good as the Oilers.

Pacific Division Last 10 Games 6-3-1 Ducks 5-3-2 Kings 5-3-2 Golden Knights 4-4-2 Flames 4-5-1 Canucks 4-5-1 Kraken 3-7-0 Oilers 2-5-3 Sharks

— The Mayor | Team MM (@mayorNHL) March 5, 2025

In a division where every team is experiencing a form of 'flat tire,' particularly the top four teams, the Kings have also turned into a pit stop and have taken a lunch break while finding the tires to switch out. Poor timing? I think so.

The Oilers made noise this week, acquiring Trent Frederic and Max Jones, priming the Pacific Division for what should be an entertaining week. I believe the Oilers will absolutely turn it around in that scope. That leaves the Kings in a position where they must succeed in their last 24 games, with 16 being at home.

As mentioned, the Oilers have the talent and ability to turn it around rapidly. The Golden Knights will do the same. This leaves the Kings in the awkward position of ramping up their game more efficiently and with more gusto than their Pacific counterparts, whom they trail. The team teams they trail have the better firepower to do so, and with the Kings relying on defensive structure first, the challenge becomes even more difficult.

With two games in hand on each team, there is a slight buffer, and they will also have to rely on their astute and league-best home record to take any form of consolation out of the current speed bump they have yet to break free of.

That comes in the form of the St. Louis Blues, who recently beat the Kings during their abysmal road trip. A quick back-to-back game against the same opponent, separated by two days, represents a potential launching pad at home, despite a mini playoff-esque masquerade to which the Blues currently have the Kings on the ropes.

Can the Kings, openly operating at a cold engine on a sunny day, overcome this speed bump? Is it all for naught while the teams ahead of them actually have superstar talent and are stacking up to position themselves for postseason success?

I have some serious doubts, and there might be seams showing that could contaminate that sparkly 19-3-3 home record. If that fails, we could be looking at a wildcard team.

A lot of character or lack thereof, will be revealed in this 'mini' playoff series.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

After an ugly 6-3 loss to the Nashville Predators on March 4, the Boston Bruins have made several moves.

The Bruins have announced that Patrick Brown, Ian Mitchell, and Riley Tufte have been recalled from the Providence Bruins. In addition, Vinni Lettieri has been called up to Boston's roster but on an emergency basis.

These are not the only roster moves Boston has made, as Georgii Merkulov and Jeffrey Viel have been sent back down to Providence.

Seeing the Bruins switch up their roster is not particularly surprising. They had a brutal night against the struggling Predators. Now, Brown, Lettieri, Mitchell, and Tufte are getting their latest shots on the NHL roster because of it.

 Bruins Open To Trade Offers On 2 New Forwards: Report The 

Boston Bruins keep losing, and their playoff hopes are continuing to drop because of it. Due to this, the Bruins already traded Trent Frederic and Max Jones to the Edmonton Oilers on March 4, and more moves are likely to follow.

Perhaps the most notable roster move of the bunch is Merkulov heading back to Providence. The 24-year-old forward is one of the Bruins' top prospects, posting 13 goals and 44 points in 47 games with Providence this season.

LAS VEGAS—EHR vendor InterSystems has debuted today at HIMSS25 IntelliCare, an AI-powered electronic health record and healthcare information system designed to change the way clinicians, administrators and patients engage with healthcare technology.

The AI capabilities are intended to deliver streamlined workflows, reduced administrative burden, enhanced patient interactions and improved operational efficiency while maintaining rigorous human oversight for accuracy and safety, the company said.

Built on InterSystems' TrakCare EHR, IntelliCare is aimed at health systems undergoing rapid digital transformation and seeking modern, connected systems without the constraints of legacy technologies.

""IntelliCare represents the next step in the evolution of EHRs,"" stated Don Woodlock, head of global healthcare solutions at InterSystems. ""By building an EHR solution with AI at its core, we're helping healthcare providers focus on what matters: More face time with patients and less screen time.""

InterSystems is in Booth 2032 at HIMSS25. IntelliCare is meant to streamline the EHR experience by integrating AI-driven intelligence across clinical, administrative and financial workflows.

The company said health systems using IntelliCare can benefit from: generative AI that eliminates administrative inefficiencies; an AI assistant that enables natural language commands and automatic patient history summarization; real-time capture and generation of encounter notes powered by ambient listening; AI that prepopulates the codes required for billing within the revenue cycle management system; and on-premises, cloud or SaaS deployment.

HCA Healthcare recently encountered significant investor activism with proposals advocating changes in corporate governance, including a shift to plant-based diets and adjustments in executive compensation. Management's opposition to these proposals could have played a role in the company's 3.71% share price decline over the last quarter. Despite strong full-year earnings growth, with sales increasing to USD 70.6 billion, net income rising to USD 5.76 billion, and a substantial share buyback program, the response to shareholder activism and broader market fluctuations may have influenced investor sentiment. During this period, the broader market experienced volatile trading, with investor concerns around tariffs impacting general market sentiment, evidenced by a 3.1% market decline over the same timeframe. This context underscores how external factors and internal governance disputes can outweigh positive financial performance, impacting shareholder returns for HCA.

Dig deeper into the specifics of HCA Healthcare here with our thorough analysis report.

HCA Healthcare's shares delivered a total return of 167.58% over the past five years, reflecting its robust long-term performance. Key drivers behind this result include consistent earnings growth, with profits increasing by 9.3% annually. A significant share repurchase program, cumulating in buybacks worth US$5.24 billion, also contributed to the shareholder value. Additionally, HCA's operations showed resilience, with continued profit growth and dividends, which increased to $0.72 per share recently declared.

The healthcare company's relative valuation, trading at 47.4% below the estimated fair value, has made it a compelling option, especially within its industry. Its Price-To-Earnings ratio has remained favorable compared to both industry and peer averages. HCA's proactive steps to enhance operational efficiencies and expand healthcare access have further supported its sustained share price appreciation, despite challenges from investor activism and broader market fluctuations.

LAS VEGAS – The Commonwealth of Kentucky saw a need: Foster children often have complex health needs, and in order to more effectively address them, it established the Health Information Data Sharing (KHIDS) initiative, an effort that seeks to ameliorate the lack of health data sharing among vulnerable youths.

Andrew Bledsoe, deputy executive director of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said the need for such an effort was urgent. Currently, there are about 8,300 youth in foster care in Kentucky, with 4,200 falling between the ages of 6 to 18. And the mortality gap is widening: Foster children in the state die at a far faster clip than children who are not in the foster system.

""This is why we're here doing what we're doing, and leveraging technology in ways that can support this population,"" he said. 

What KHIDS did was to integrate health records into child welfare case management, involving a number of departments under Kentucky's Cabinet for Health and Family Services. Grounded in state law, it authorized Kentucky's child welfare department to share medical records via the Kentucky Health Information Exchange (KHIE).

Being able to share these records was vital, said Bledsoe, because the health of foster use can be jeopardized if providers have an incomplete representation of their health needs. A case worker may not be aware of necessary medications and have a hard time tracking down health records due to a lack of consolidation and interoperability between providers.

""We have great case workers in our state,"" said Bledsoe. ""They want to do what's right, but all of these situations aren't so easy or direct.""

Implementation of KHIDS occurred through single sign-on and API applications, linking Kentucky's child welfare information system to KHIE. In 2023, more than 39,000 clinical event notifications were received, providing invaluable health insights to case managers for foster children.

This integration, said Bledsoe, led to effective case management, better planning and decision-making, and meticulous health monitoring. KHIE now shares data with 100% of Kentucky hospitals.

The success of the program was due in part to a multi-agency governance structure overseeing the integration, which allowed for an interconnected, interoperable network of agencies and providers serving the foster care population.

Now, the data is flying: Routine visits, behavioral health encounters, pharmacy services, immunization records and more are now available for this vulnerable subset of the state's youth population.

""If we can do it, others can do it,"" said Bledsoe.

After months of litigation, Yale New Haven called a deal to buy Prospect’s three Connecticut hospitals “impossible.” The bankrupt health system is reportedly looking for new buyers.

Prospect filed for bankruptcy in January, citing a need to restructure amid ongoing financial difficulty.

The Los Angeles-based operator said it would attempt to sell its East Coast portfolio to focus on its comparatively healthier California-based facilities.

However, Prospect has already been trying to sell its Connecticut portfolio, which includes Manchester Memorial, Waterbury and Rockville General hospitals, for years without success. In 2022, it signed a deal to sell the facilities to Yale New Haven for $435 million.

Yale sued to get out of the deal in May, saying Prospect had reneged on sale conditions by leaving the facilities in “dire” financial condition. In June, Prospect countersued in an attempt to hold Yale to the terms.

The litigation remains ongoing, but a spokesperson for Yale New Haven said Prospect’s bankruptcy filing is “proof of disinvestment and mismanagement.”

“As we have been saying for almost 18 months, and detailed in our lawsuit, Prospect has never been in a position to close the transaction on the terms set out in the October 2022 Asset Purchase Agreement,” the spokesperson said.

Prospect did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

The health system is under pressure from state regulators to sell the hospitals quickly while the facilities continue to rack up operational losses. 

While Prospect and Yale New Haven argue about who ought to operate the facilities, Connecticut regulators say patients are suffering.

In a February bankruptcy filing, lawyers for the state said the “real victims” of the legal dispute were state residents who did not have a clear path toward receiving healthcare. They said their first priority was keeping the facilities open, and that the state would work with Prospect to find a new operator, Yale or not. 

“It is critical that the Connecticut Hospitals be transitioned to a new operator, one who will ensure that the hospitals are adequately funded and safely run,” the attorneys said. “To be very clear, that operator is not Prospect.”

As Connecticut grapples with the fallout from Prospect’s bankruptcy, lawmakers are advancing a bill that would give regulators more oversight over healthcare transactions involving private equity firms.

Prospect was formerly owned by Leonard Green & Partners. In a scathing Senate report issued earlier this year, federal lawmakers said financial strategies employed by the PE firm, including sale-leaseback transactions, may have contributed to Prospect’s financial decline.

The state’s hospital association has opposed the bill, saying it adds unnecessary layers of review and would delay healthcare transactions.

Approximately half of the adults in the United States (116 million) have high blood pressure, or hypertension, with 91.7 million needing prescription medication in addition to lifestyle changes. As of 2017, the self-reported prevalence of hypertension in adults aged 20 and older in Georgia is 30.1% to 31.9%, reported Tim Hall, senior business intelligence developer at Piedmont Healthcare.

Piedmont Health is a not-for-profit health system with 1,755 locations serving communities that comprise 85% of Georgia's population.

""If patients were more adherent to their hypertension medications and blood pressure was better controlled, patients would decrease their risk for heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, which are leading causes of death, disability and high healthcare expenditures,"" Hall explained.

""Using prescription fill data and predictive analytics systems integrated into its health information systems, Piedmont Healthcare developed a project to identify the highest priority patients for intervention to increase their medication adherence rates, improving clinical outcomes and patient safety while meeting value-based care goals.""

Initial results showed improvements in adherence measured by the proportion of days covered, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure values in the treatment group as well as a reduction in wasted clinician intervention.

Hall will be presenting results and much more in a HIMSS25 session entitled ""Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence,"" Thursday, March 6 at 8:30 a.m. in Caesars Forum 115. Hall's co-presenters will be Dr. Thomas Wells and Melissa Robinson, PharmD, both from Piedmont Healthcare.

""In addition to these promising results, we want to share in the session our approach to the development of a predictive analytics model and the feasibility of implementation into an existing workflow within our population health department,"" he added.

Predictive analytics is playing a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in tackling medication nonadherence, he said.

""By integrating predictive analytics scores into electronic health record systems and other health information technologies, providers can identify at-risk patients and intervene earlier,"" he continued. ""Incorporating additional prescription fill history from a population health management system further refines prioritization, allowing for more precise, data-driven decisions.

""Additionally, by leveraging intervention-level data and social determinants of health from EHRs, healthcare organizations can develop more targeted and potentially automated interventions to improve adherence and patient outcomes,"" he said.

Hall has plenty of advice he shares here and in his educational session.

""Leveraging predictive analytics and prescription fill data to inform and design patient interventions, we can positively impact medication adherence, which, in turn, improves patient outcomes,"" he explained.

""Developing a successful predictive analytics model and implementation is an investment, both of time and resources,"" he concluded. ""A multidisciplinary team approach that includes developers, business owners, executives, operations, clinicians, analysts and other stakeholders will help to ensure success. Choosing metrics to measure the success of your predictive analytics project should include the clinical impact in addition to any other financial or operations problem your organization is trying to solve.""

The Piedmont education session, ""Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence,"" is scheduled for Thursday, March 6, from 8:30-to 9:30 a.m. in Caesars | Forum 116 at HIMSS25 in Las Vegas.

AI must navigate highly sensitive, regulated and proprietary data. The big question is:
How can healthcare providers securely leverage AI while maintaining trust, privacy and compliance?

Share Options

AI is revolutionising healthcare — enhancing diagnostics, streamlining workflows and supporting medical professionals in unprecedented ways. But with great potential comes significant risk. At the heart of any AI-powered solution lies its foundation: data. And if that data isn’t properly managed, protected and understood, the results can be unreliable at best — and dangerous at worst.

The old saying “bad data in, bad data out” has never been more relevant than in the era of AI, especially generative AI. This challenge becomes even more complex in healthcare, where AI must navigate highly sensitive, regulated and proprietary data. The big question is:

How can healthcare providers securely leverage AI while maintaining trust, privacy and compliance?


					When it comes to managing inbound phone calls, underperformance has devastating cost implications.				

Retrieval augmented generation – the first step

The answer most AI professionals will give is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), meaning use your data to help inform and enhance the user query with the correct data so the generative AI can use this data in its response. Some AI and RAG providers will even allow users to add security and governance controls to the data before and after the AI to help keep any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other protected data secure and only used or exposed to end users with the right level of access.

This is great, but I look at this as a brute force approach to RAG — one that is somewhat effective but often falls short in testing and trials because a critical element is missing from this approach. This missing component is the context and contextualization of the data you are sending to the AI. 

Without a semantically connected view of your data via a knowledge graph, you will struggle to give the AI the most complete view of your data and the domain in which it exists. Additionally, the regulations and business rules that apply to the data can’t be added and actioned programmatically, potentially risking noncompliance.


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

A semantic approach: contextualize your data 

So, what does a semantic approach to your data mean? 

Well, it means adding a semantic layer(s) to your data to provide this context.  In knowledge management, semantic layers are like a smart bridge between raw data and human understanding. They help organise, interpret and present information in a way that makes sense to people and the AI.

Imagine a large hospital network that stores patient data across multiple systems — electronic health records (EHRs), lab reports, imaging systems and billing databases. These systems often use different formats, terminologies and structures, making it difficult for doctors, researchers and administrators to access and analyse data effectively.

A semantic layer in this context would:

For example, a doctor could ask, “Show me all diabetic patients who had abnormal kidney function tests in the last year,” and the semantic layer would retrieve the relevant data from multiple sources, even if different systems used different names or formats.

The key to trustworthy AI solutions in healthcare

By integrating a semantic layer, AI doesn’t just pull data — it understands it. This results in:

In short, AI in healthcare can only reach its full potential when it’s built on a foundation of structured, meaningful and well-governed data. A semantic approach is the key to making AI not just powerful but also safer, reliable and transformative.

AI has the power to revolutionize healthcare, but without the right data strategy, it is more of a risk than an asset. The difference between AI that simply retrieves information and AI that understands and applies knowledge safely is context, which starts with a semantic approach. If healthcare providers want AI that is more accurate, secure and truly life-changing, they must build on a foundation of structured, meaningful and well-governed data.

This isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s a critical part of fostering the scalability and security of the AI solutions we trust with our most sensitive data.

Strategies to combat rising cyber threats in the healthcare industry



Editor’s Note: This article was originally published in 2024 and has been updated to include the EU Action Plan information.

Healthcare organizations are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, averaging 1,463 cyberattacks per week in 2022, up 74% compared to the previous year [i]. The healthcare industry has also ranked highest in data breach costs for 12 years in a row [ii]. The potential impact of a cyber incident is not just financial–the consequences can be fatal [iii].

Hospitals and healthcare providers are targeted for several reasons. First, they are vulnerable targets as attackers seek to exploit them for the notoriety of claiming they successfully shut down such critical facilities. Healthcare data is also in high demand on the dark web and can fetch a hefty sum for attackers.

Another major reason hospitals are targeted is that they have large operational technology (OT) environments with thousands of entry points. On the medical side, this includes a vast array of equipment, from MRI machines to ventilators. On the building side, it includes assets like fire and life safety systems, HVAC and access control. The sheer volume of assets provides an attack surface far larger than almost any other industry. Moreover, many of these systems operate on legacy frameworks, making them more susceptible to exploitation.

EU Action Plan on the Cybersecurity of Hospitals and Healthcare Providers

In 2023, EU countries reported 309 significant cybersecurity incidents in the healthcare sector, more than any other critical sector. These cyberattacks can delay medical procedures and disrupt vital services. In response, the European Commission unveiled a new EU Action Plan that focuses on:

1.      Enhancing prevention of cyber threats with enhanced preparedness measures

2.      Better detection and identification of these threats with near real-time alerts

3.      Minimizing the impact of cyberattacks to mitigate additional damage

4.      Deterring cyber threat actors with the use of tools such as the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox

It also proposes establishing a pan-European Cybersecurity Support Centre to provide hospitals and healthcare providers with tailored guidance, tools, services, and training. These measures aim to ensure the resilience and security of healthcare systems across Europe, safeguarding patient care and maintaining the integrity of critical healthcare infrastructure. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, the EU aims to create a robust defense against cyber threats, ensuring that healthcare services remain uninterrupted and secure.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers new requirements

In response to this increasing threat, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a concept paper [iv] in 2023 introducing new measures designed to help protect the sector from cyberattacks.

These measures include:

1. Establishing voluntary cybersecurity performance goals for the healthcare sector to help healthcare organizations prioritize cybersecurity practices.

2. Providing resources to incentivize and implement cybersecurity practices, such as the establishment of an upfront investments program to help high-need providers.

3. Implementing an HHS-wide strategy to support greater enforcement and accountability, which includes potential increased financial penalties for HIPAA violations.

4. Expanding and maturing the one-stop shop within HHS for healthcare sector cybersecurity, thereby increasing HHS’ incident-response capabilities.

The intent is to better equip hospitals with cybersecurity education and resources, as well as discourage noncompliance by strengthening HHS’ enforcement authority.

Healthcare organizations don’t know what they don’t know

A big security hole at many hospitals is lack of awareness. They may think their OT systems are secure when they’re not. For instance, the systems may be air-gapped, which means they’re not connected to the internet, but most of them must be patched or updated regularly. This might mean that, on the first of every month, the systems are connected to the internet to download the patches or updates and thus they are not truly air-gapped.

Even if the patching and updating are done via USB, those OT systems may still not be safe. A 2024 Honeywell USB Threat study found that 51% of the malware discovered was designed for USBs  [v] . Another risk is that many cyberattacks target third-party OT systems whose providers may have access rights to perform maintenance and upgrades. This opens the door to yet another threat.

Three steps healthcare organizations should take now

The pressure is on for healthcare organizations to fortify their systems against cyberthreats and put necessary controls and defense measures in place. Here are the top three steps they should take to get started:

1. Create an incident response plan. This is essential for hospitals to swiftly recover if they’re hit with downtime or if critical equipment, such as ventilators or HVAC systems, are targeted in a cyberattack. Without a plan in place, a hospital can’t get back up and running quickly and efficiently, and make sure its patients and staff are safe. This should be tested using tabletop exercises

2. Maintain a full asset inventory with vulnerability management and threat detection. The reality is that most OT and control systems have an IP connection, e.g., HVAC, energy management, security, access control, video/closed-circuit television, patient monitoring, fire systems, medical devices and other IoT. However, IT often doesn’t monitor or manage these connections for cyberthreats as closely as it monitors or manages its own systems. In most cases they’re not aware of all the devices on the OT network. It’s essential that hospitals know exactly what they have running in their environment on both the enterprise IT network and their OT network

3. Have a trusted partner.  Securing operational technology is a complex task that lies in the intersection between engineering and cybersecurity. It requires knowledge of the underlying devices, control systems and proprietary protocols that exist in the environment, combined with cybersecurity technology and the skills required to implement the necessary controls that reduce risk. For this reason, healthcare organizations must work with trusted partners and vendors who build products that are secure-by-design, understand the underlying technology and combine it with cybersecurity experience to help them realize their risk reduction and compliance goals.

Honeywell is in a unique position to help healthcare organizations comply with new regulatory requirements and reduce their cybersecurity risk. With 50+ years of building automation experience and millions of facilities worldwide using Honeywell technology, we understand the attack surface that healthcare organizations operate with and what controls are required to reduce it.

North America dominated the healthcare cybersecurity market in 2024, driven by its advanced digital health infrastructure, growing cyber threats, and strict regulatory environment. The increasing adoption of EHRs, telemedicine, and IoMT devices has expanded the cyber risk landscape, prompting healthcare organizations to prioritize security investments.  

A major factor contributing to market growth is the surge in cyberattacks targeting hospitals, insurers, and third-party service providers. The American Hospital Association (2024) reported approximately 386 healthcare-related cyber incidents as of 2024, continuing the high threat levels seen in 2023—the previous worst year on record for healthcare breaches. Ransomware attacks and data theft remain persistent, frequently disrupting patient care and incurring significant financial losses.  

To combat these escalating threats, healthcare providers across North America are increasing investments in AI-driven threat detection, endpoint protection, and cloud security solutions. Advanced security technologies, including zero-trust architecture, blockchain-based data protection, and real-time threat intelligence, are being widely adopted to enhance cyber resilience. The presence of leading cybersecurity firms in the region, along with growing public-private partnerships, further solidifies North America’s leadership in healthcare cybersecurity.  

Regulatory frameworks are also key in shaping the industry. Laws such as the HIPAA in the U.S. and other federal regulations enforce stringent data protection requirements, compelling healthcare organizations to implement robust security measures. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, for instance, introduced Section 3305: “Ensuring Cybersecurity of Medical Devices,” amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) with Section 524B. This provision mandates stronger cybersecurity protections for medical devices, driving increased investments in encryption, vulnerability management, and threat detection solutions tailored for device security. Compliance efforts are now a top priority for companies aiming to safeguard patient data and maintain regulatory adherence, further accelerating market growth.  

Additionally, heightened regulatory scrutiny and the evolving complexity of cyber threats have encouraged stronger collaboration between government agencies and private cybersecurity providers. Initiatives focused on improving healthcare data security, combined with continuous staff training and awareness programs, have led to the widespread adoption of cybersecurity measures across hospitals, clinics, and third-party vendors.  

With AI and machine learning improving predictive analytics and automated threat response, North American healthcare organizations are adopting comprehensive solutions to ensure both compliance and operational continuity.

Healthcare Cybersecurity Market Dynamics

The healthcare cybersecurity market is experiencing rapid growth as the industry faces escalating cyber threats, regulatory pressures, and the increasing adoption of digital health technologies. The expansion of electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, and connected medical devices has created a vast attack surface for cybercriminals, making healthcare one of the most targeted sectors. As a result, cybersecurity spending in healthcare is expected to rise significantly, with organizations prioritizing investments in advanced threat detection, zero-trust architectures, and AI-driven security solutions.

One of the key drivers of the market is the rising frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks. Ransomware attacks on hospitals and healthcare providers have surged, causing significant disruptions to patient care and leading to hefty financial losses. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated systems, third-party vendors, and cloud-based applications to steal sensitive patient data, which can be sold on the dark web or used for fraud. Consequently, healthcare organizations are adopting proactive cybersecurity measures, such as continuous monitoring, endpoint protection, and security training for employees.

Regulatory compliance is another major factor shaping the market. Governments worldwide have introduced stringent data protection laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the U.S. and the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, mandating strict security protocols for patient information. Non-compliance can lead to heavy penalties, legal consequences, and reputational damage. This regulatory landscape is driving healthcare providers to adopt robust cybersecurity frameworks and partner with specialized cybersecurity firms to ensure compliance.

The growing adoption of cloud computing and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices presents both opportunities and challenges for healthcare cybersecurity. Cloud-based solutions enable seamless data sharing and remote access to medical records, enhancing operational efficiency and patient care. However, they also introduce new security risks, such as data breaches, unauthorized access, and misconfigurations. Similarly, IoMT devices, including smart pacemakers and connected infusion pumps, can be exploited by hackers if not properly secured. To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations are implementing multi-factor authentication, blockchain-based security, and advanced encryption techniques.

Looking ahead, the healthcare cybersecurity market is expected to witness continued innovation and consolidation, with AI and machine learning playing a crucial role in threat detection and response. Cybersecurity-as-a-service (CaaS) is also gaining traction, allowing healthcare institutions to outsource security functions to specialized providers. As cyber threats evolve, healthcare organizations must stay ahead by adopting adaptive security strategies, fostering a cybersecurity-conscious culture, and investing in next-generation technologies to safeguard patient data and ensure the integrity of healthcare systems.

The all-stock deal gives CVS a strategic minority investment in value-based care services firm Wellvana.

Shared Savings, or MSSP, is Medicare’s largest value-based care program. 

Under MSSP, providers band together in accountable care organizations and take on financial risk for patient care, with the goal of offering coordinated services that reduce unnecessary spending or medical errors. In 2023, the program saved the government a record-breaking $2.1 billion, according to the CMS. 

Providers sometimes join ACOs managed by value-based care enablement companies, which can help them transition to the payment arrangement, pull together more data and manage risk-based contracts.

CVS’ enablement services include customers using two CMS value-based care programs, MSSP and the ACO Realizing Equity, Access and Community Health (REACH) Model, which included more than 1 million patients at the end of 2024, according to a securities filing. 

Despite the MSSP divestiture, the healthcare giant will continue to focus on value-based care through its healthcare delivery units, like its senior primary care clinic chain Oak Street Health, and through ACO contracts with its insurer Aetna, CVS said in a press release.

The deal comes after CVS saw its profits cut nearly in half last year as its Aetna insurer struggled with heightened medical costs. The company’s health services segment, which includes its value-based care offerings, reported revenue down about 7% from the previous year, while its adjusted operating income fell 0.9%.

Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense.

Health systems have had the same workforce concerns for years. They’re scrambling to fill nursing shifts, struggling to attract and retain nurses, and spending far too much time and money on temporary staffing. Health system leaders have told me time and again they’re striving for workforce resilience, an emerging ideal that emphasizes the personal and professional wellbeing of the workforce — structurally, culturally, and on an individual level by prioritizing work-life balance.

It’s not a completely novel concept, but it’s trendy given the state of healthcare’s labor force. 

However, it’s not exactly congruent with health systems’ workforce strategies. Ask the average health system leader about how they manage their workforce, and you’ll get the same response you might have received in 2005. In fact, many are still relying on the same processes to fill shifts that they did when I was a practicing nurse nearly twenty years ago: spreadsheets, phone calls, last-minute texts. 


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

On big campuses where innovative new technologies are being used to save lives every day, these staffing habits may seem inconsequential. But they actually signal a much larger problem: healthcare’s workforce blueprint is out of date. 

Today’s nursing workforce is not the workforce of 20 years ago. If hospitals want to build a resilient workforce, they need to embrace flexibility. 

Flexibility and the modern workforce

Walk into any hospital and you’re likely to see a nursing workforce that spans five generations. Each has a unique expectation for their career, and a different perspective of flexibility. It’s not just about striving for work-life balance. It’s about finding ways to build a shift schedule that works for Gen Z nurses and Baby Boomer nurses, for nurse managers and hospital executives, and most importantly, for patients. 


					When it comes to managing inbound phone calls, underperformance has devastating cost implications.				

Younger nurses expect technology-driven solutions that allow them to manage their schedules from the palm of their hands. Mid-career nurses balancing family and professional responsibilities want stability above all — predictable but adaptable scheduling options. Older nurses approaching retirement may want to work just enough to keep their licenses active, or serve as mentors to newer nurses. 

Beyond generational preference, flexibility won’t mean the same thing for every hospital. For some, it might be an internal resource pool that enables full-time staff to float. For others, it could mean building staggered shift structures that can help rotate core staff out of a physically taxing three-on, four-off schedule. Some hospitals have begun leveraging an on-demand workforce to supplement core staff, bringing in on-demand nurses to supplement cultural workforce resilience programs. 

Change is hard. Uncertainty is uncomfortable. But the reality is, the old ways aren’t working anymore. Hospitals are in a hiring hole, straining against tightening budget constraints, and depending on a workforce that expects flexibility as a given — not a perk. The time to try new things is now. 

Designing a blueprint for today

If we could rethink care delivery overnight during the pandemic, why aren’t we applying those lessons now? In 2020 and 2021, health systems adapted on the fly — launching telehealth programs, restructuring shifts, and mobilizing both internal and external staffing resources. 

Somehow, once the pandemic began to wane, most health systems reverted back to the status quo, back to old ways that don’t work for a workforce and industry that has undergone rapid transformation. The industry missed a key opportunity to build on those gains.

New care delivery models present perfect opportunities to experiment with flexible workforce strategies. Hospital-at-home programs are gaining traction, requiring new, flexible staffing approaches. Those that are able to tap into on-demand staffing resources will be better able to support full-time staff as they extend care beyond the four walls of the hospital. Forward-thinking health systems are testing the waters by staffing virtual nursing programs with nurses nearing retirement, and activating per diem nurses to fill the gaps left in facilities. 

Many older nurses want to remain in the workforce, albeit in a much less rigorous capacity. Developing formal mentorship programs — where experienced nurses can provide guidance, training, and support for incoming nurses — can help retain institutional knowledge that health systems cannot afford to lose, while providing additional career pathways. 

Health systems want to achieve workforce resilience, but the old staffing blueprint will never allow it. Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense. 

Flexibility is no longer a luxury. Today, it’s a necessity. The time for health systems to define what it means for them is now.

Artificial intelligence is the technology that dominates the conversation, and 2025 will be the ""year of adoption,"" where healthcare sees AI more broadly deployed across the industry, said Chris Althoff, executive vice president, marketing, at emtelligent, in Booth 124 at HIMSS25.

The company sells AI-driven systems designed to help healthcare organizations extract, structure and integrate unstructured clinical data.

""Apart from AI, healthcare organizations will continue to focus on addressing interoperability challenges and working to enhance data access and liquidity, as data increasingly becomes a key driver of innovation and revenue,"" he added.

As for AI, though, Althoff cautioned HIMSS25 attendees to be mindful of the hype.

""The healthcare IT space is crowded, especially with the growing buzz around AI,"" he stated. ""Focus on connecting with specialists who have deep expertise in healthcare, rather than those who have simply adapted general-purpose models. Look for partners who not only bring this specialized knowledge but are also committed to growing alongside you on your AI journey – implementing pilot programs, achieving incremental successes and uncovering hidden value.

""These early wins will help build momentum for broader adoption, fueling internal innovation and driving meaningful transformation in both your operational workflows and clinical processes,"" he continued.

At HIMSS25, emtelligent is emphasizing that expert medical AI is key to transforming unstructured clinical data into actionable insights – generic AI systems simply are not enough for healthcare, Althoff contended.

""They lack the specialization needed to navigate medical terminology and the unique operational realities that exist across health systems, payers, pharma and the various other healthcare business models,"" he concluded.

Don’t ask Aaron Neinstein for the accuracy rates of Notable’s AI — he won’t tell you. Here, the executive explains why.

LAS VEGAS — The healthcare industry was taken by storm by generative artificial intelligence products two years ago. The technology, which can understand and create new text and images, was viewed as the key to reducing administrative burden for physicians and medical workers by summarizing patient records, writing requests for prior authorization, communicating with patients and more.

More recently, the models underpinning generative AI are being woven into “AI agents,” a buzzword that’s quickly surpassed its predecessor as the darling of technologists in the healthcare space.

Using large language models, agentic AI can make complex decisions without human oversight, allowing it to operate relatively unsupervised. As such, AI agents have the potential to significantly reduce clinician burnout and save providers money by taking over mundane tasks, proponents say.

AI agents bubbled up in numerous conversations at the massive HIMSS health IT conference in Las Vegas this week, as startups and tech behemoths peddling the tools pitched them as an inexpensive digital workforce.

Among the crop is Notable, a company founded almost one decade ago to automate healthcare tasks. Now, Notable’s AI is live at more than 10,000 care sites across the U.S., including in systems like CommonSpirit Health and Intermountain, according to the company.

But agents run up against many of the same issues as other AI tools, including a lack of independent information about their efficacy and accuracy and unclear liability if things go wrong. As research shows AI continues to make errors in healthcare, such speed bumps could get in the way of adoption — no matter how desperately providers need fixes for the hefty documentation burden on their workforce.

Healthcare Dive caught up with Aaron Neinstein, Notable’s chief medical officer, on-site at HIMSS, where Neinstein shared why tech giants like Google and Salesforce are a step behind in agentic AI, how the industry is holding AI to an unfair standard and why he refuses to share the accuracy rates of Notable’s AI tools with potential clients.

This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

AARON NEINSTEIN: The company is about doubling workforce productivity at a fraction of the cost.

If you look at how a patient gets care today, a very teeny part of that is in the visit interaction. Think about a cancer patient: They have to get a PET scan, they have to get a biopsy, they have to come in and see their oncologist, they have to get a chemotherapy infusion. Each of those steps requires an order, that the order be entered into the EHR, the staff to take the prior authorization and submit it into the payer portal, schedule that appointment, pre-appointment preparation, etc. The majority of healthcare is the execution of the care plan. And Notable is focused on all of those steps, with AI agents that perform those tasks on behalf of health systems.

More of the latter. I was in health IT at UC San Francisco for 15 years. I was pitched every product there, and I bought many of them. And that’s a pain for IT teams, managing lots and lots of vendors. The dream is having one vendor who can do a lot of different things for you. So we typically see people starting with one use case but expanding to others.

Yes. That’s one advantage of having done this for 10 years. You walk around [the HIMSS conference] and you see AI agents everywhere. It’s very validating for us that there are a lot of new companies trying to enter the space. But it takes a long time to develop relationships with EHR vendors and integrate into care teams’ workflows.

With large language models, it’s pretty easy for anybody to make a demo look cool. But that doesn’t mean you can actually deploy it into healthcare operations, because the integrations will kill it quickly.

Yes. One is contact center. Contact centers are expensive, have high turnover rates and we have a lot of customers asking us about using agents here. We’re going live with some of these over the next few months.

And then prior authorizations and more nurse or care coordinator-type things, like pre- and post-procedure communication — those are two areas where we’re just starting to work with some existing customers that I think will become much more commonplace over the next year or two.

I am very happy that Microsoft and Salesforce are spending so much money teaching everybody about AI agents on our behalf. Their marketing budgets are more than we could ever dream of spending.

But realistically, if you look at those companies, what makes or breaks things in healthcare is getting into the nooks and crannies of the workflow. I do not worry about those companies’ ability to do that at a deep level.

Go ask health systems. How many of them are using Google, Salesforce or Microsoft? Well, maybe not Microsoft, because it has Nuance. I used [Nuance’s ambient documentation tool] 15 years ago. I still have that microphone in a drawer somewhere. So Microsoft is probably best positioned because of the Nuance acquisition, but I have yet to see Google or Salesforce really get into care delivery.

There’s no easy answer to that one. The way I think about it is, it matters more than ever to work with partners you can trust, because there’s no easy answer coming from the government.

It’s like what the FDA does for pharmaceuticals. If this regulatory body says it’s safe, then I can trust it. And people were hoping that might happen for AI, that there would be this blessing from some third-party body that would then allow health systems to feel safe. That was probably a pipe dream anyway, but it seems much less likely now.

But either way — having a third party validate an algorithm is useless. You have to start with the workflow and build AI into it to know how it’ll perform.

We get asked by customers all the time — what’s the accuracy of your AI? And we won’t answer it. Because it’s a process. As you’re deploying an algorithm, you use the local dataset to take the base algorithm and train it to perform better for their environment, their workflow and their data.

My warning light to any organization who’s looking for AI tools — if a company says their AI is 99% accurate, it’s probably not true. And it doesn’t actually mean it’s going to help with outcomes. Nutrition labels for AI is a nice-sounding idea, but it’s not how I would make decisions about deploying AI.

The question I usually ask organizations when they ask for that number is, ‘What’s your human performance today?’

Do you know how many people know the answer to that? Very few. Most people are comparing AI performance to a theoretical imagined target versus comparing it to their current performance. 

So one thing we do with organizations as we get started is we actually measure their human performance. Because in some places, surprise surprise, the human performance is 50%, 60%, 70% accuracy. So then that becomes the target, rather than this imagined target of 99% accuracy. Let’s see if we can do better than how humans are doing today.

So I think it’s just constantly reminding people and reframing that the benchmark to beat is not perfection. It’s better than what we have today, which in most cases is pretty bad.

When we deploy we’ll start with a human in the loop. So we have a human check the algorithm’s output. That builds trust. It reduces fear, because often people are afraid that the AI is coming for their job. It also helps us improve model performance. If you have a human in the loop early, you eventually get to a point where people say it’s no longer needed, usually after a few weeks or months.

So rather than setting it up as this war, like ‘is the AI good enough?’ and have it be a binary decision — because I think that’s the trap people fall into — let’s make this a process of earning trust and improving the performance over time.

Everybody’s bringing a sense of skepticism and hesitancy, but AI is going to become more and more normal in daily life. And we’re going to become more comfortable. And inherently, peoples’ guards will come down.

LAS VEGAS - HIMSS President and CEO Hal Wolf addressed funding cuts for medical research during a press conference at HIMSS25 here on Tuesday.

""I think we're at the beginning of a very shaky period,"" Wolf said. ""I think that we're all concerned.""

Fifty percent of healthcare in the United States is funded by the federal government, he said. This includes Medicare and Medicaid.

However, Wolf said, the strength of the system has always been in taking the long term.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the cuts, according to Reuters.

Trump's pick to head the National Institute of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, is expected to be confirmed following a Senate hearing. If confirmed, Bhattacharya would oversee a nearly $50 billion budget and funding for thousands of scientific projects. The NIH director oversees 27 institutes and centers that conduct early-stage research, according to Reuters.

For hospitals, the biggest challenge is the workforce shortage. Wolf estimated a shortage of 8-9 million people on a global basis. 

Hospitals need to turn to digital health. Digital health allows care to be extended into the home.

Healthcare comes down to an anomaly, Wolf said. When an anomaly is found,  people are put on care pathways.

Helping this search for what's not normal are devices and watches that allow people to monitor their own health.

Nurses are now doing work formerly done by physicians.

""Now we have to stretch those resources and that's where digital health comes in,"" Wolf said.

Flexibilities for remote patient monitoring and telehealth - which allow for care in the home including acute care, will end on March 31 without Congressional action.

HIMSS is involved in getting these flexibility extended, Wolf said. 

An estimated 28,000 people are attending HIMSS25 in Las Vegas, he said. Last year a little over 26,000 people attended HIMSS24.

Home > LMH Health Foundation honors those who support community healthcare

Published on March 05, 2025

 

LAWRENCE – LMH Health Foundation is pleased to announce recipients of the 18th annual Elizabeth Watkins Community Caring Award. The Watkins Award celebrates people and organizations who have provided significant service to LMH Health and community healthcare.

Honorees are community members Dward and the late Jeanine Moore, Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson, Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner, and Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson. Information on each honoree is included below.

The Foundation is also pleased to announce a record annual transfer of more than $9.1 million in philanthropic contributions to support LMH Health priorities in 2024. The previous record of $4.3 million was established in 2020.  

Over the last two years, donors have provided more than $7.2 million in support for the expansion and renovation of the LMH Health Cancer Center, anticipated to open this summer. This expansion will ensure the Cancer Center facilities reflect the extraordinarily high level of physician care and expertise, leading-edge technology and patient-centered programming found within the center. Additional funds were transferred in support of new PET imaging technology, clinic renovations in the Anderson Health Plaza, charitable care needs, and other patient-centered initiatives.

“We are fortunate to be part of a community that values access to exceptional healthcare, and donor support helps ensure our community hospital continues to be among the very best in the country,"" said Rebecca Smith, LMH Health Foundation executive director and LMH Health vice president of strategy and communications. “From investing in facilities and technology typically only seen in major medical centers to ensuring those advancements are available to every single member of our community regardless of ability to pay, donors have had a real and tremendous impact over this past year. We are incredibly grateful for this support and all it makes possible.”

  

Here’s a closer look at the Watkins honorees:



Dward and the late Jeanine Moore



Dward and Jeanine Moore were married for 56 years. They met at a music camp in Missouri — Jeanine was a violinist; Dward, a baritone vocalist. The young couple joined the Peace Corps after college, teaching two years at a school for boys in Uganda. Back in the States, they eventually settled in a small town in Maryland. Dward taught anthropology and later worked at an employee-owned survey research company. Jeanine worked in libraries, taught music and performed in professional quartets. In 2015, to be closer to extended family, they moved to Lawrence.  As always, they looked for ways to give to their community.

“One day in the newspaper I saw an article about the Help & Healing Fund, and we knew that was it,” Dward said. The fund pays for medication and durable medical equipment for patients in need as they leave the hospital. “We had some personal experience with LMH Health — the doctors here are very good. It made us feel good that we can support people who need the help.”

Through their generosity, both Dward and Jeanine continue to touch lives.

 

Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson



At some point after Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson moved to Lawrence about 25 years ago, they realized LMH Health is extraordinary.

“We didn’t choose Lawrence because we saw it had great healthcare, but we lucked into it!” Sam said.

“This is a small-enough community — you get to see your healthcare providers in real life. You can be out to dinner, or the grocery store, and there’s your doctor. You get to see them as real people,” Leann explained. “I love having those relationships here.”

Sam and Leann have given generously to support renovations to the LMH Health Cancer Center and patient-centered technology, as well as patient expenditures for physical therapy and occupational therapy. Additionally, Sam founded Falling Forward Foundation, which funds continued rehab after insurance benefits run out.

“The culture and the people at LMH Health are all about kindness and caring, and the quality of care is remarkable,” Sam said. “Hospitals used to be about fixing things that were already broken. Today, it’s more about being proactive, and that’s very true here. I mean, they even changed the name of the hospital to LMH Health.”

  

Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner



Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner moved back to Lawrence in 2001.

“It seems like we end up at the hospital a lot,” said Dan, laughing. “I fell off a ladder a few years ago and cracked some ribs. I’ve also had a total knee replacement and back surgery here. When Sally had chest pain, they ushered us right in to a special cardiac care unit. I think it’s a pretty big deal that LMH Health is independent and not-for-profit. They do a great job looking after our community — and so I decided to do my part and look after LMH.”

Dan served on the LMH Health Foundation board of directors and has listed the foundation in his estate planning. They have shared several generous gifts to the hospital and were early donors to the LMH Health East Heights primary care clinic.

“We share a philosophy about giving,” Sally said.  “If you want something done, just do it. And why wait until you die? If it’s possible, give now and reap the emotional benefit while you’re alive. The amount doesn’t matter as much as the willingness to give.”

 

Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson



For 25 years, Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson have been part of the LMH Health family. Dr. Thompson — “everyone calls me Mike,” he said — saw a job posting for a pathologist in Lawrence in 2000 and came for an interview.

“We got here and knew right away,” said Cheri, a registered nurse and nurse anesthetist who went to work at Lawrence Plastic Surgery.

While their boys grew up here, the Thompsons invested in LMH Health in myriad ways. Mike served as chief of staff, on many committees and on the foundation board of directors; together they co-chaired Rock the Block–Kick Cancer. They have supported patient-centered technology, cancer care and specific needs in the laboratory.

“We’re just big believers in a community hospital,” Cheri said.

Mike added, “The hospital is sort of the heartbeat of the community. It’s amazing to see how much ours has grown since we moved here.” 

Both have retired recently but stay connected.

“This is a family,” Mike said. “I try to be an example for younger docs, and they are proud to report back that they went to a meeting, played in the Penny Jones Golf Tournament. When you give to something you have ownership in, you want it to do well.”

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Patients with disabilities face disrespect from health care providers,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250305/Patients-with-disabilities-face-disrespect-from-health-care-providers.aspx,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:32:00 GMT","

Patients with disabilities are less likely to feel health care workers treat them respectfully, according to new research from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, patients with disabilities were also significantly less likely than those without disabilities to say that their providers gave them information that was easy-to-understand. The findings are published this month in Annals of Internal Medicine.

""People with disabilities make up 20 percent of American adults. This group already faces multiple barriers to accessing care, and they have large disparities in health outcomes. When they perceive disrespect from their providers, it can make them less proactive in engaging with the health care system, especially preventative care,"" said Mihir Kakara, MBBS, MSHP, who led the study as a neurology fellow at the Perelman School of Medicine and is now an assistant professor of Neurology at the NYU Grossman school of Medicine. ""It is easy to imagine these patients not following up on certain recommendations-for example, getting that repeat brain scan to follow up on a certain lesion-if they don't feel respected."" 

Overall, 2.9 percent of people without disabilities reported that they felt their providers didn't treat them with respect. But among patients with disabilities, 4.8 percent reported feeling that way.

A narrower analysis revealed greater disparities for patients with conditions affecting vision, hearing, mental health, and cognitive abilities. The proportion of respondents with these conditions who felt disrespected was nearly twice that of those without disabilities.

These findings prove that we must continuously strive toward ensuring our patient care is culturally humble and inclusive. While we have clear standards from the Americans with Disabilities Act, they should be the floor that medical professionals build upon, not the ceiling we strive for. We are seeing where great strides need to be made."" 

Jaya Aysola, MD, DTMH, MPH, senior author, associate professor of General Internal Medicine and executive director of the Penn Medicine Center for Health Equity Advancement

Data analyzed in the study was pulled from 2017's National Health Interview Study. Almost 23,000 of the study's participants who had visited a health care provider in the last year were asked about their providers' ""cultural competence""-sensitivities to different people's circumstances and customs. Among them, almost 5,000 of the participants-roughly 20 percent-identified as having a disability, roughly in line with reported national averages.

Participants in the 2017 study were asked whether their provider gave them instructions that were easy to understand. Wide gaps were found between those with disabilities and those without: 11.3 percent of patients with disabilities didn't feel health care workers explained things well, and 7.1 percent of those without disabilities felt the same.

At least 13 percent of those with either vision, hearing, mental health, or cognitive conditions all felt that they weren't given easy-understand directions.

Patients had also been queried whether their providers ""asked opinions about their care."" Here, the researchers found that a significant number of respondents both with and without disabilities expressed that their providers did not ask their thoughts: 41.1 percent of patients without disabilities said they weren't asked, compared to 44.9 percent of patients with disabilities. Again, those with visual impairments reported significantly worse experiences.

In 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) officially designated people with disabilities as a population demonstrating disparities in health driven by social disadvantages. That designation meant that more NIH funds could be used to support that underserved population with research. 

Moving forward, Aysola and Kakara believe there should be follow-up studies examining the potential health implications for patients with disabilities who feel disrespect from their providers or have trouble understanding what they're being told.

They also see opportunities to examine the effect of system-level policies, and call for ensuring a patient-centered care approach in every setting. 

""It's about empowering and meeting the needs and preferences of our patients,"" Kakara said. 

When patients have disabilities, patient-centered care can involve, as an example, maintaining eye contact and speaking directly to them, rather than only addressing their family members. Another example is printing out instructions with large font for those with low vision.

""Patient-centered care models have now been adopted by many health care systems, but there is still a critical gap in providing disability-inclusive care in medical education and training, and our analysis highlights a need to incorporate such disability-specific training into our daily practice,"" Kakara explained. 

Kakara was funded by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality T32 training grant during the period of this study.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news,Ransomware goes postal: US healthcare firms receive fake extortion letters,https://www.csoonline.com/article/3839190/ransomware-goes-postal-us-healthcare-firms-receive-fake-extortion-letters.html,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:41:13 GMT","



In late February, healthcare organizations across the US started receiving extortion demands by mail claiming that their organization’s data had been stolen in a ransomware attack and giving them 10 days to respond.

According to the letters, printed on paper and delivered in envelopes purporting to be from the BianLian ransomware group, the data would be leaked unless the organization paid a ransom of between $250,000 to $350,000 in Bitcoin.

Now for the good news: the breaches never happened, and the letters are almost certainly fake. Two security vendors that have studied the letters, Arctic Wolf and Guidepoint Security, now believe that the whole letter-writing campaign is a ruse by someone pretending to be BianLian, one of the ransomware industry’s up-and-coming threat groups.

Targeting healthcare organizations, the strange incident is a reminder that ransomware today is really two industries: a larger one that carries out the serious ransomware attacks everyone hears about and a much smaller and less well publicized one that tries to impersonate them.

But how can organizations distinguish a real attack with menaces from an entirely simulated one?

Judging from published examples, not easily, at least for a non-expert. The letters had Boston postmarks and a city center return address, links to Tor data leak sites associated with BianLian and, in two cases, an example of what was claimed to be a compromised password.

“We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money. Our industry only works if we hold up our end of the bargain,” stated the attackers in a letter analyzed by Guidepoint Security.

“If you follow our instructions and pay the full requested amount on time, all of your company’s data will be permanently destroyed and none of it will ever be published,” the letter continued.

A clue that something is amiss is simply that the attackers would use a letter to communicate. There is no record of this tactic being deployed before by organized ransomware groups such as BianLian and for good reason: sending demands by post is uncertain and very slow.

Letters sent to multiple organizations were also identical to one another, Arctic Wolf noted, apart from small variations tailoring text for each recipient. This is the same tactic used by random email attacks and smacks of opportunism. They also refused to negotiate and offered no channel to do this. In ransomware circles, that is almost unheard of.

That said, sending demands by letter does have a useful characteristic: they won’t be filtered by spam systems which makes them more likely to be read by someone.  It’s a form of social engineering in which if even one company falls for the tactic out of a thousand letters, the pay day will make it worth the effort.

If stolen credit cards are used to pay for the postage costs, it’s probably also cheap or even free with the letters themselves sent via print-to-mail services that feed them to the US Postal Service.

Ransomware impersonation is nothing new. In 2019, organizations across the US reportedly received emails deploying the same fake breach modus operandi as the recent letter writers – ‘pay up now because we have your data’. In truth, such campaigns are probably commonplace but are dismissed as obvious ruses and rarely reported on.

However, by 2023 the tactic had evolved into something more sophisticated with a separate campaign backing up its bogus threats by attaching snippets of genuine data culled from dark web trawls. This raises a disturbing possibility: the organization has been breached but the group threatening them is not one who carried out the attack.

Underlying all this is how organizations should defend themselves in practical ways against yet another fraud tactic.

“Attacks like this are unlikely to succeed in the majority of cases, but the perpetrators only have to have a small number of victims fall for it for it to be a big pay day for them,” cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley said via email.

The first line of defense against this type of attack is simply to develop a process to deal with it, he said. Incidents like this should be reported internally to increase awareness of the scammers’ techniques. At the same time, every ransom threat should be reported to the IT team as well as to the security companies supporting the organization.

Attackers would typically include evidence that data has been exfiltrated in the form of genuine data. However, organizations need to be careful they aren’t being tricked:

“These protocols include verifying the authenticity of any ransom demands. It is important to establish whether that data could have been stolen in an earlier data breach or may have been collected from a different third-party source,” said Cluley.

Cluley also stressed the need for organizations to have a response plan that could assess the possibility of a breach itself while engaging with law enforcement.

“There should be named members of staff in your plan who coordinate communications with any potential extortionist, who ensures that all relevant departments are involved in any important decisions. Make sure that you engage with law enforcement. If you have received a fake ransom snail-mail, chances are that other businesses have as well,” said Cluley.

Ransom demands are always designed for their shock value, agreed John Shier, Field CISO at security vendor Sophos. Sending a demand by letter was unusual but that might be the point.

“Teams need to bring awareness of this latest scam to their leadership. If an organization receives a letter, they shouldn’t panic, but they still need to investigate if there is any basis to the claim,” he said.

“At the very least, companies should review network logs for any unauthorized access and large data transfers that don’t conform to normal patterns. While it appears that the letters are fake, some due basic diligence needs to be performed to rule out a data breach,” he said.

John E. Dunn is a former editor of the UK editions of Personal Computer Magazine, LAN Magazine, and Network World.

DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) has secured a significant contract with a major healthcare system, marking its entry into the healthcare provider employer market in Q1 2025. This agreement contributes to Dario's 15 new client signings targeted for 2025.

The partnership will provide AI-powered chronic care management solutions to the healthcare system's employees, focusing on conditions including diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, and mental health. Clinical studies demonstrate Dario's effectiveness, showing a 2.3-point reduction in A1C levels for diabetes patients and 28-30% decrease in anxiety and depression over eight weeks through its Dario Mind platform.

This milestone represents a breakthrough in healthcare system adoption of digital health solutions, traditionally a slower-moving sector due to reimbursement challenges and provider skepticism. The partnership validates Dario's approach to combining AI-driven personalization with user-friendly interfaces to bridge the gap between traditional care models and digital interventions.

DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) ha ottenuto un contratto significativo con un importante sistema sanitario, segnando il suo ingresso nel mercato dei fornitori di servizi sanitari nel primo trimestre del 2025. Questo accordo contribuisce ai 15 nuovi contratti con clienti previsti da Dario per il 2025.

La partnership fornirà soluzioni di gestione della cura cronica potenziate dall'IA ai dipendenti del sistema sanitario, concentrandosi su condizioni quali diabete, ipertensione, dolori muscoloscheletrici e salute mentale. Gli studi clinici dimostrano l'efficacia di Dario, evidenziando una riduzione di 2,3 punti nei livelli di A1C per i pazienti diabetici e una diminuzione del 28-30% dell'ansia e della depressione in otto settimane attraverso la piattaforma Dario Mind.

Questo traguardo rappresenta una svolta nell'adozione delle soluzioni di salute digitale da parte dei sistemi sanitari, un settore tradizionalmente più lento a causa delle sfide di rimborso e dello scetticismo dei fornitori. La partnership convalida l'approccio di Dario nel combinare la personalizzazione guidata dall'IA con interfacce user-friendly per colmare il divario tra i modelli di cura tradizionali e le interventi digitali.

La asociación valida el enfoque de Dario de combinar la personalización impulsada por IA con interfaces amigables para el usuario, cerrando la brecha entre los modelos de atención tradicionales y las intervenciones digitales.

DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO)는 주요 의료 시스템과 중요한 계약을 체결하여 2025년 1분기에 의료 제공자 고용 시장에 진입하게 되었습니다. 이 계약은 Dario가 2025년을 목표로 하는 15개의 신규 고객 계약에 기여합니다.

이번 파트너십은 의료 시스템의 직원들에게 당뇨병, 고혈압, 근골격계 통증 및 정신 건강을 포함한 상태에 초점을 맞춘 AI 기반 만성 관리 솔루션을 제공합니다. 임상 연구는 Dario의 효과를 입증하며, 당뇨병 환자의 A1C 수치를 2.3포인트 감소시키고 Dario Mind 플랫폼을 통해 8주 동안 불안 및 우울증을 28-30% 감소시켰습니다.

이번 이정표는 전통적으로 환급 문제와 제공자의 회의론으로 인해 느리게 진행되는 분야인 디지털 건강 솔루션의 의료 시스템 채택에 있어 돌파구를 나타냅니다. 이 파트너십은 AI 기반 개인화와 사용자 친화적인 인터페이스를 결합하여 전통적인 치료 모델과 디지털 개입 간의 격차를 해소하는 Dario의 접근 방식을 검증합니다.

DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) hat einen bedeutenden Vertrag mit einem großen Gesundheitssystem gesichert, was den Eintritt in den Markt für Gesundheitsdienstleister im ersten Quartal 2025 markiert. Diese Vereinbarung trägt zu Darios Ziel von 15 neuen Kundenverträgen für 2025 bei.

Die Partnerschaft wird KI-gestützte Lösungen für das Management chronischer Erkrankungen für die Mitarbeiter des Gesundheitssystems bereitstellen, wobei der Fokus auf Erkrankungen wie Diabetes, Bluthochdruck, muskuloskelettalen Schmerzen und psychischer Gesundheit liegt. Klinische Studien zeigen Darios Effektivität, mit einer Reduktion der A1C-Werte um 2,3 Punkte bei Diabetes-Patienten und einer Verringerung von 28-30% bei Angst und Depression über einen Zeitraum von acht Wochen durch die Dario Mind-Plattform.

Dieser Meilenstein stellt einen Durchbruch in der Akzeptanz digitaler Gesundheitslösungen durch Gesundheitssysteme dar, die traditionell einen langsameren Fortschritt aufgrund von Erstattungsproblemen und Skepsis der Anbieter aufweisen. Die Partnerschaft bestätigt Darios Ansatz, KI-gesteuerte Personalisierung mit benutzerfreundlichen Schnittstellen zu kombinieren, um die Lücke zwischen traditionellen Versorgungsmodellen und digitalen Interventionen zu schließen.

Healthcare system collaborates with Dario to offer AI-powered chronic care management solutions as a benefit for their employee base of healthcare workers, expected to contribute to the current total of 15 new client signings in 2025, representing a significant head start in its 2025 net new client goal.

NEW YORK, March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) (""Dario"" or the ""Company""), a leader in the global digital health market, announced today the signing of a contract with a major healthcare system to be added to its employer book of business, set to go live in the first quarter of 2025. We believe that this milestone reinforces the growing recognition of digital health solutions among healthcare professionals, a group uniquely positioned to understand the value of proactive, technology-driven care.

The new healthcare system contract marks a significant step for Dario. As self-insured employers, these organizations carefully evaluated Dario's ability to deliver measurable value for both employees and patients. Their decision to integrate Dario's solutions reflects confidence in the company's ability to enhance care delivery while addressing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, and mental health challenges.

Dario aims to position itself at the forefront of the evolution of the digital health landscape, demonstrating the ability of digital health solutions to drive meaningful clinical outcomes. Peer-reviewed studies highlight Dario's effectiveness in reducing A1C levels for diabetes patients by 2.3 points, as well as decreasing anxiety and depression by 28-30% over eight weeks through its behavioral health platform, Dario Mind. By combining AI-driven personalization with a seamless user experience, Dario is closing the gap between traditional care models and scalable digital interventions.

""We are thrilled to add such a unique segment to our employer book of business,"" said Steven Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer at Dario. ""Healthcare workers have a deep understanding of the impact that poor chronic condition management can have on a person. Having our solutions trusted by this audience is truly meaningful. These employers recognize the clinical importance of Dario's cardiometabolic and behavioral health solutions, and we are excited to provide them with tools that improve health outcomes and overall well-being.""

Historically, healthcare systems have been slower to adopt digital wellness and self-care therapies. Inconsistent reimbursement models and provider skepticism about engagement and clinical efficacy have all contributed to delayed integration. However, recent industry shifts—including coverage, stronger clinical evidence and more innovative approaches to engagement —are accelerating adoption.

As the digital health landscape continues to evolve, collaborations with healthcare systems will play a critical role in expanding access to high-quality, technology-enabled care. By prioritizing innovation and clinical rigor, Dario remains committed to driving the next wave of digital health adoption for both employers and healthcare providers alike.

(Nasdaq: DRIO) is a leading digital health company revolutionizing how people with chronic conditions manage their health through a user-centric, multi-chronic condition digital therapeutics platform.

GE HealthCare Technologies introduced Genesis Solutions, a new portfolio of cloud enterprise imaging SaaS solutions, aimed at enhancing efficiency and precision in healthcare. This development occurred amid a challenging market environment, with major indexes alternating between gains and losses, influenced by tariff discussions and mixed economic data. The company's share price moved 1.57% over the last quarter, a potentially modest increase considering the launch of Genesis, as well as recent upcoming products like Freelium and Flyrcado. Additionally, the company reported strong Q4 2024 earnings with increased revenue and net income, factors that likely held shareholder interest. Despite market volatility and broader economic concerns, GE HealthCare's innovations and market position kept investor confidence relatively stable compared to a broader market decline of 3.1% over the same period. Overall, the company's strategies and product developments may have offset broader market trends.

Take a closer look at GE HealthCare Technologies's potential here.

In the last year, GE HealthCare Technologies experienced a total return decline of 8.03%, underperforming both the US Medical Equipment industry, which saw a 9.7% gain, and the broader US market, which rose by 13.1%. While the company's earnings grew significantly by 43.5%, revenues only increased marginally at 3.8% annually, which may have deterred investors accounting for slower growth prospects compared to market expectations. The company's guidance for moderate organic revenue growth, between 1% to 2%, further tempered investor enthusiasm amid macroeconomic pressures such as weakness in the China market.

Despite these challenges, GE HealthCare's product innovations, including the launch of the Freelium MRI platform, which uses less than 1% helium, and the Flyrcado PET MPI agent, highlight its commitment to advancing technological solutions. Additionally, the strategic partnership with UCSF to advance imaging solutions signals a strong focus on clinical improvement. Nonetheless, these developments were not enough to counterbalance the broader market headwinds impacting its share performance over the period.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Monitoring. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks analysts are monitoring.

CNBC has recently confirmed that artificial intelligence firm Anthropic has closed its latest Series E funding round at a $61.5 billion post-money valuation. Led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, the $3.5 billion round also included investors such as Salesforce Ventures, Cisco Investments, Fidelity Management & Research Co., General Catalyst, D1 Capital Partners and Jane Street.

According to Anthropic, the latest funding shall be used to advance the development of next-generation AI, particularly to “expand its compute capacity, deepen its research in mechanistic interpretability and alignment, and accelerate its international expansion in Asia and Europe.”

“The latest investment “fuels our development of more intelligent and capable AI systems that expand what humans can achieve” and that “continued advances in scaling across all aspects of model training are powering breakthroughs in intelligence and expertise.”

The latest announcement by Anthropic follows the launch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code, with the former being a hybrid reasoning model and the latter being an agentic coding tool. According to Anthropic, its Claude 3.7 Sonnet has set a new high-water mark in coding abilities, setting the stage for developing AI systems that can serve as true collaborators in the future.

It further elaborated how businesses are increasingly turning to Claude to transform their operations. From Thomson Reuters’ tax platform CoCounsel using it to assist tax professionals; to Novo Nordisk leveraging Claude to reduce clinical study report writing; and even powering Amazon’s Alexa+, Anthropic is committed to leveraging artificial intelligence to help advance human progress.

Meanwhile, the Claude Code has been an early product but has been an asset for test-driven development, debugging complex issues, and large-scale refactoring. Anthropic plans to continually improve it based on its usage, with the goal of better understanding how developers use Claude for coding to inform future model improvements.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points  (see more details here).

On March 3rd, the company announced the launch of Microsoft Dragon Copilot, the first AI assistant for clinical workflow that integrates the capabilities from its dictation solution, Dragon Medical One, and ambient listening solution, DAX Copilot, into one tool.

Even though clinician burnout in the U.S. has dropped from 53% in 2023 to 48% in 2024, projections of a shortage of the U.S. workforce make Dragon Medical One an ideal tool to streamline administrative tasks, enhance health care access, and facilitate faster clinical insights. The tool will allow healthcare workers to cut down on their clerical workloads, thereby reducing burnout.

Dragon Copilot is accessible through a mobile app, browser, or desktop, and it can be integrated directly with several different electronic health records. Through the tool, clinicians will be able to draft clinical notes, use natural language to edit, and even prompt further. The company has said that the tool will be generally available in the U.S. and Canada starting in May.

“At Microsoft, we have long believed that AI has the incredible potential to free clinicians from much of the administrative burden in healthcare and enable them to refocus on taking care of patients. With the launch of our new Dragon Copilot, we are introducing the first unified voice AI experience to the market, drawing on our trusted, decades-long expertise that has consistently enhanced provider wellness and improved clinical and financial outcomes for provider organizations and the patients they serve.”

Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks analysts are monitoring. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

CINCINNATI – Quipt Home Medical says David Kanen, Philotimo Fund and Kanen Wealth Management have agreed to withdraw their notice to solicit proxies in support of four director candidates in opposition to those recommended by the company. 

As part of a new cooperation agreement, the company's board of directors has granted Kanen certain board access rights for as long as Kanen maintains aggregate beneficial ownership of at least 3.5% in the company’s outstanding shares. This includes the right to request and conduct quarterly discussions with either the chairman of the board or another non-executive director designee of the board. 

“We want to thank Kanen for their constructive discussions and valuable insights,” said Mark Greenberg, lead independent director of the board. “We appreciate the perspectives of all shareholders and welcome ongoing engagement as management executes on our strategic growth plans to drive long-term growth.” 

As part of the agreement, Quipt has also agreed to establish a new committee of the board to review and provide analysis and non-binding recommendations pertaining to Kanen’s previously communicated recommendations on corporate governance and other areas related to the company’s operations. 

Additionally, Kanen has agreed to a customary standstill, a voting commitment and other provisions. 

“We appreciate the company’s willingness to engage with us and its commitment to maximizing value for Quipt shareholders,” said David Kanen, president and CEO of Kanen. “The formation of this committee is an important step, and we look forward to working constructively with the company to help unlock long-term value.”

Study: Sleep apnea linked to increased risk of Parkinson’s, but CPAP may reduce risk 

MINNEAPOLIS – People with obstructive sleep apnea have an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, but if started early enough, CPAP therapy may reduce that risk, according to a preliminary study released March 2, 2025, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 77th Annual Meeting taking place April 5–9, 2025, in San Diego and online. 

The study found using CPAP within two years of a sleep apnea diagnosis reduced the risk of Parkinson's. 

""Obstructive sleep apnea is common, and previous research has found when untreated, it is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke,"" said study author Gregory D. Scott, MD, PhD, of the VA Portland Health Care System in Oregon. ""While our study found an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, the good news is people can do something about it, by using CPAP as soon as they are diagnosed with the sleep disorder."" 

For the study, researchers reviewed more than 20 years of medical records to identify nearly 1.6 million veterans who had obstructive sleep apnea and nearly 10 million veterans who did not. 

Researchers looked at rates of Parkinson's disease five years after a sleep apnea diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex and health factors such as smoking, researchers found among people with sleep apnea, there were 1.8 more cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people compared to people without sleep apnea. 

Of participants with sleep apnea, 10% had documented use of a CPAP machine. These participants were divided into two groups: Those who received a CPAP machine within two years of their diagnosis and those who received one after two years. 

Researchers found similar rates among people with sleep apnea who started CPAP after two years as those who did not use CPAP, with 9.5 and 9 cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people respectively. However, researchers found a lower rate of Parkinson's among those who started CPAP early, within two years of diagnosis, with 2.3 fewer cases per 1,000 people when compared to people who did not use CPAP. 

""It is encouraging to know that while obstructive sleep apnea may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease, treating it right away with CPAP may reduce that risk,"" said Scott. ""Future studies are needed to follow people more closely after receiving a sleep apnea diagnosis and over longer periods of time."" 

A limitation of the study was that, while researchers could identify which people had a CPAP device, they were unable to tell if people used the treatment daily, as prescribed. 

The study was supported by the U.S. Veterans Administration and the U.S. Department of Defense.

ACHC renewed as deeming authority for home health accreditation 

CARY, N.C. – The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) has received continued approval from CMS as a national accrediting organization for home health agencies (HHAs). This renewal, effective until 2031, affirms that ACHC’s accreditation program meets or exceeds Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs) for HHAs. “ACHC remains committed to delivering high-quality, patient-centered accreditation services that help home health providers ensure compliance with CMS requirements while driving excellence in care,” said Susan Mills, ACHC senior program director. “This six-year renewal reflects our dedication to upholding the highest standards in the home health industry and supporting agencies in their mission to deliver outstanding patient care.” Deeming authority allows ACHC-accredited home health agencies to demonstrate compliance with Medicare CoPs without undergoing routine state surveys. Instead, ACHC conducts rigorous accreditation surveys that assess HHAs on critical operational and clinical performance standards, ensuring quality and safety in home-based health care services. To achieve continued CMS approval, ACHC underwent an extensive evaluation process, which included a comprehensive review of ACHC’s accreditation standards to ensure alignment with federal regulations, an assessment of ACHC’s surveyor training and performance to ensure consistency and effectiveness, a comparison of ACHC’s accreditation process with CMS survey requirements, including monitoring noncompliance and responding to deficiencies, and an analysis of ACHC’s ability to report survey findings and corrective actions in a timely manner.

Mar 5, 2025

|					Kate Behncken, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Philanthropies and Erin Burchfield, Senior Director, Technology for Social Impact				

Last year, Microsoft launched its Cybersecurity for Rural Hospitals Program an initiative designed to help protect access to healthcare for the 46 million people living in rural America. Funded through a philanthropic investment, the program now has more than 550 rural hospitals, nearly one-third of all US rural hospitals, participating to receive free cybersecurity assessments, cybersecurity training, Microsoft security product discounts, and AI solutions designed to promote hospital resiliency.  

Today, we are releasing a new white paper sharing what we’ve learned in the last year, including insights on the current cybersecurity landscape for rural health and the role technology companies can play. Our goal with this program is to address both the immediate cyber risks facing these critical community resources as well as broader systemic challenges facing rural health.   

Click here to read the Microsoft report 

Rural hospitals are a cornerstone of healthcare in communities across the United States, providing critical services for roughly 14% of the U.S. population. The need to support rural hospitals is immense. These hospitals are often the only healthcare option for over 50 miles in the communities they serve. A cyberattack that disrupts care for weeks or months in these isolated settings can have a devastating impact and endanger human lives. When a rural hospital’s IT systems go down, patients often need to travel even longer distances for medical care. Long travel distances for healthcare are directly associated with higher mortality rates, particularly for time-sensitive conditions like heart attacks and strokes. 

According to an FBI report, the healthcare sector reported more ransomware attacks in 2023 than any of the other critical infrastructure areas in the study. Given the highly sensitive personal data involved, healthcare is a rich target for increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals and nation-state threat actors launching cyberattacks. According to a recent report based on a survey of 402 healthcare organizations, 67% experienced a ransomware attack in the past year, with the average admitted ransom payment amounting to $4.4 million.  

And while larger hospitals can often pay ransoms to avoid patient care disruptions, ransomware attacks pose a particular threat to rural hospitals who operate with much smaller operational teams and financial margins. Rural hospitals are prime targets for these attacks due to their often-limited resources and legacy technology. For rural hospitals, a ransomware attack may represent a tipping point toward closure, impacting not just the hospital, but the communities they serve with potentially life-threatening consequences.  

As we’ve worked with these hospitals in the last year, our goal has been to help create strong security not just through our products but to also help address specific practice needs and identify broader systemic issues. For example, early on, we found most rural hospitals hadn’t implemented basic cybersecurity best practices, such as email security and multi-factor authentication. By delivering a holistic solution that includes free assessment, curated learning pathways for employees, and non-profit pricing for Critical Access and Rural Emergency Hospitals, we can help these hospitals to be less vulnerable to common threats and ultimately, better serve their communities.  

With the release of today’s white paper, we hope to increase awareness and understanding of these issues and drive more collaboration between technology companies, policymakers, and healthcare providers to enhance the cybersecurity resilience of rural hospitals.  

In the coming months, Microsoft will continue to expand efforts to support rural hospitals, ensuring they have the tools and resources needed to mitigate cyber threats and enhance their overall resilience. Leveraging AI for greater efficiency—by streamlining and automating some hospital processes—is just one way we are looking to provide support.   

By addressing both immediate cybersecurity risks and broader systemic challenges, we can help ensure that rural hospitals remain a vital part of the healthcare ecosystem, providing essential services to millions of Americans.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) —  Physician assistants from across Illinois gathered at the state capitol today to advocate for a bill aimed at improving healthcare access by removing certain restrictions on their practice.

The proposed legislation seeks to eliminate requirements that currently prevent physician assistants (PAs) from immediately assisting patients, such as the necessity for a specific physician agreement to practice medicine.

""Right now in Illinois there’s unfortunately a lot of red tape that doesn’t allow these physician assistants to get hired the way they should be and we need them,"" said Jayson Coble, a physician assistant with HSHS.

He added, ""We're trying to modernize our practice act on our lobby day here at the state capitol in order to improve access for patients.""

Smart card readers also help healthcare providers comply with stringent data protection regulations, such as HIPAA, by ensuring that patient information remains confidential and accessible only to authorized personnel.Additionally, the use of smart card readers in medical research and trials has gained momentum. Researchers are leveraging these devices to securely store and access patient data for clinical studies, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of their findings. The integration of smart card readers with electronic health record (EHR) systems is another major trend, enhancing real-time data access and updating capabilities. This not only improves operational efficiency but also empowers healthcare professionals to make informed decisions quickly. As a result, smart card readers have become indispensable tools for modern healthcare institutions.What Role Do Smart Card Readers Play in Addressing Healthcare Challenges?Smart card readers are addressing some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare, including data security, patient privacy, and interoperability. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, healthcare providers face increasing risks of data breaches. Smart card readers offer a robust solution by enabling multi-factor authentication and encrypted data storage, ensuring that sensitive patient information remains protected. Furthermore, these devices help maintain patient privacy by limiting access to medical records based on role-based permissions.In regions with fragmented healthcare systems, smart card readers enhance interoperability by serving as a centralized medium for accessing patient information. This ensures continuity of care even when patients move between different providers or geographic locations. Additionally, smart card readers are aiding in public health initiatives by facilitating the efficient distribution and tracking of vaccines and medications. By enabling accurate record-keeping and data retrieval, these devices contribute to the effective management of healthcare resources. The growing reliance on smart card readers underscores their role in addressing critical healthcare challenges while supporting the transition to digital ecosystems.

The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center) and Flatiron Health are teaming up to make clinical trials more efficient by reducing administrative burdens on researchers.

The partnership brings Flatiron Clinical Pipe to CU Cancer Center and UCHealth, allowing clinical trial data to move directly from electronic health records (EHRs) to electronic data capture (EDC) systems.

The technology eliminates the need for manual data entry. Instead, it transfers information directly from the EHR to trial databases.

The system is in use at over 85 academic medical centers and community oncology sites, covering more than 300 locations.

Clinical trials require massive amounts of data, and entering this information by hand is one of the most time-consuming parts of the research process.

Clinical Pipe integrates with UCHealth's EHR through Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs), an installation process that took about 11 hours.

Flatiron Health's Head of Research Network Emily Akin told MobiHealthNews that Clinical Pipe can help reduce the burden on clinical trial site teams, streamline data management, and accelerate study timelines.

The company recently published the first peer-reviewed paper on a commercially available EHR-to-EDC system that showed the average case report form completion time was just 37 seconds when using Clinical Pipe.

""That's ten times faster than manual data entry, which typically takes about 30 seconds per data point,"" Akin said. ""With Clinical Pipe, it only takes three seconds.""

The study, published in ESMO Real-World Data and Digital Oncology, found that researchers using Clinical Pipe transferred more than 11,000 data points and nearly 1,000 CRFs.

By automating this process, sites like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth can conduct more trials with greater ease, Akin said.

""By reducing the administrative workload, Clinical Pipe allows providers to spend more meaningful time with patients,"" Akin said. ""This improved efficiency enhances the overall care experience for trial participants.""

Faster data entry and reduced errors also mean fewer delays in research, which can speed up trial completion and bring new treatments to patients sooner, she said.

As handling sensitive patient data requires strict security measures, Clinical Pipe meets SOC-2 and HITRUST CSF certification requirements and complies with HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 regulations.

All data is encrypted during transfer and storage, ensuring privacy and protection.

Akin explained one of the biggest challenges in clinical research is making trials more accessible to patients, with many research sites struggling with administrative barriers that limit the number of trials they can run.

Clinical Pipe is designed to reduce these challenges, allowing institutions like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth to conduct more studies and expand research opportunities.

""This collaboration makes clinical trials more accessible by reducing the operational challenges that often limit trial availability at research sites,"" Akin said. ""It allows institutions to efficiently conduct more trials and ultimately broadens patient access to research opportunities.""

Their life cycle assessment reveals opportunities to reduce the ecological footprint of healthcare, from reducing disposable materials to improving energy efficiency. The results have been published in the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. 

We look at each individual element of the care process and investigate its environmental effects, from the materials used to the energy needed

Each year, 7,000 to 8,000 people in the Netherlands undergo bypass surgery, including patients at Radboudumc. During this major procedure, blood vessels from other parts of the body are used to create bypasses for the heart’s arteries. After the operation, intensive care is required. This healthcare process significantly impacts the environment, particularly through the use of disposable materials and energy consumption during the surgery and recovery period. 

Under the leadership of medical researcher Egid van Bree, the research team thoroughly examined the care pathway for a patient. ‘It's like a large jigsaw puzzle’, explains Van Bree. ‘We look at each individual element of the care process and investigate its environmental effects, from the materials used to the energy needed.’ The life cycle assessment reveals that the care for one patient can result in up to 414 kg of CO2 emissions, equivalent to a 3,000-kilometer car trip, from the Netherlands to Morocco. 

The researchers looked for impactful areas where the environmental footprint of bypass surgeries could be reduced and identified several opportunities. Disposable materials, such as drapes, surgical gowns, cotton gauze, and gloves, contribute to waste and CO2 emissions. More sustainable alternatives, like washable drapes and other surgical gowns, can help reduce the ecological footprint. 

The time when 'going green' in healthcare only referred to the colour of surgical gowns are long past: reducing CO₂ emissions, improving waste management and saving energy are essential for modern hospitals. Keep reading to find out what medical institutions can do to become more sustainable.

Additionally, savings in energy consumption can be achieved, especially through the optimization of air handling units, and benefits can be realized by using renewable energy. Moreover, the disposable set for the heart-lung machine, which contains approximately six kilos of plastic, has a significant environmental burden. Although there is currently no alternative, this remains an important area for innovation to reduce ecological impact. 

This study provides insights into how heart surgeries and intensive care admissions can be made more sustainable. A direct outcome is that Radboudumc is now exploring how to optimize its air handling systems and reduce disposable materials. Tim Stobernack, sustainability researcher at Radboudumc, emphasizes the challenge of implementing these changes across the healthcare sector. 'Step by step, we are mapping out more care pathways. We hope to soon share our results for eye surgeries, emergency room care, and the admission of other patients to intensive care.’

Warfarin is sometimes prescribed after heart surgery, but getting the dose right requires a personalised approach for each patient. A new AI tool is designed to help with this complex task.

Surgeons will need to tackle three major challenges with the most potential to reduce major causes of death and improve access to surgical care, according to an international group of experts.

A team at the Finnish research institute VTT has created a biodegradable ECG patch, aiming to pave the way to a more sustainable future for wearable electronic devices.

At HIMSS25, the focus for attendees should be on actionable innovations – technologies that eliminate friction and enhance collaboration, advised Dr. Colin Banas, chief medical officer at DrFirst.

DrFirst (Booth 1058) is a vendor of medication management technology that works from prescription through adherence and is used by nearly half a million prescribers, 70,000 pharmacies, 270 EHRs and health information systems, and more than 2,000 hospitals in the U.S., the company reported.

""I recommend health IT leaders at HIMSS25 prioritize AI and automation in practical, measurable ways,"" Banas said. ""AI already is making an impact, but the key for CIOs and IT leaders is to deploy AI where it solves real pain points.

""Whether it's automating prior authorization workflows, integrating predictive analytics for medication adherence, or enabling chat-driven clinical decision support, the focus should be on reducing administrative burden and improving patient outcomes,"" he continued. ""Look for AI systems that provide real, quantifiable value to clinicians and patients alike.""

On another front, break down data silos to enable better collaboration, Banas advised.

""One of healthcare's biggest obstacles is fragmented data, which prevents providers, pharmacies and payers from working together efficiently,"" he said. ""IT leaders should prioritize interoperability with integrations that facilitate real-time data exchange across the healthcare ecosystem. When clinical data is accessible and actionable within workflow, it leads to faster treatment decisions, fewer errors and better patient engagement.""

Also, CIOs and other health IT leaders should empower patients with targeted information to improve adherence and reduce readmissions, he added.

""When patients end up back in the hospital, it's often connected to taking their prescribed medications incorrectly – or not at all,"" he noted. ""Patient engagement programs that include personalized, targeted information connect people with cost-saving resources and relevant clinical information that drives medication adherence.

""CIOs and IT leaders should focus on patient engagement platforms that give patients the information they need while not adding administrative burden to busy clinicians,"" he said.

Along these lines, Banas noted what he has observed to be the big technologies for HIMSS25.

""AI has been a dominant topic in healthcare for years, but in 2025, it's shifting from hype to real-world applications,"" he said. ""This year, the industry is focusing on AI's practical impact – especially in areas like patient engagement, clinical decision support and accelerating time to therapy.

""For patients, AI agents are transforming the medication journey by acting as concierges that provide real-time updates on copays, prior authorization status and financial assistance options,"" he continued. ""These innovations are eliminating long hold times and back-and-forth calls between providers, insurers and pharmacies – easing frustration and giving patients greater control over their care.""

On the provider side, AI-enhanced clinical decision support tools now are embedded directly into EHR and prescribing workflows, enabling clinicians to quickly search clinical literature for informed decisions, he said. This reduces cognitive overload and improves patient safety by ensuring providers have the most up-to-date treatment insights at the point of care, he noted.

""In addition, disruptive innovation is poised to revolutionize how e-prescriptions are sent to pharmacies, breaking out of an outdated system that strangles innovation and limits clinical collaboration,"" Banas said. ""Prescriptions are, after all, clinical orders. Yet e-prescriptions are handled by an archaic claims-based system that treats them more like financial transactions.

""A new approach with customizable workflows allows prescribers and pharmacists to fully collaborate, connect with payers and patient support programs, eliminate time-consuming manual workarounds, and reduce the delays that impact patient care – particularly for specialty and high-cost medications,"" he concluded.

RICHMOND, Va. — Thousands of Virginians are navigating the loss of job-based health care following massive layoffs from the federal government.

Enroll Virginia is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that wants to help those who need to enroll in a new health care plan.

Director Deepak Madala says they’ve seen a sharp spike in calls for assistance, especially in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond, following the federal layoffs.

Many of these Virginians without work have not had to navigate the challenge of enrolling in non-work-related health care in years, according to Madala.

That’s where Enroll Virginia can step in. Their statewide team of assisters can provide free, unbiased advice to help you review all of the options you may have.

""Sometimes they think COBRA may be their only option, but unfortunately, COBRA can be quite expensive, especially if your employer is not paying for it,"" explained Madala. ""But in some cases, COBRA is the best option. So it's one of those things of just looking at all of what's out there, and then seeing what you can qualify for.""

It’s important that if you do lose insurance from your job, you act quickly because you only have 60 days to enroll in new coverage.

""Make sure you're starting to collect all of your medical needs,"" Madala explained. ""So, you know, what prescriptions are you taking? What, if you have any upcoming appointments, things like that, just kind of collect and make sure you know what those are. And then when you go to a navigator or even an agent and broker, they can be better positioned to help you understand what the best plan, or, you know, kind of best option may be for your family.""

A shift toward strategic partnerships is underway, with RCM outsourcing budgets expected to riseMore than half of healthcare providers surveyed are actively exploring or testing gen AI use cases

BOCA RATON, Fla., March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- An overwhelming majority (85%) of senior healthcare executives surveyed believe AI will improve efficiencies in revenue cycle management (RCM) operations over the next five years, according to the results of a new Everest Group report, supported by Omega Healthcare, titled ""Realizing the Promise of Tech-Enabled, AI-Driven Revenue Cycle Management (RCM): Outsourcing in the New Era."" The study highlights how healthcare providers are leveraging AI-enabled technology services (such as gen AI and agentic AI) and a shift to more strategic outsourcing partnerships to address challenges, enhance financial performance, and streamline revenue cycle processes.

""The hope and promise of AI, gen AI and agentic AI are no longer just hype,"" said Anurag Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder, Omega Healthcare.  ""While the technology is important, it is only part of the equation. To fully harness the power of AI it will become increasingly critical for healthcare providers to work with the right partners.""

Shift to More Strategic RCM Outsourcing PartnershipsAs gen AI investments continue to accelerate, more than half (51%) of healthcare leaders polled expect an increase in RCM outsourcing budgets by 2030, emphasizing the significance gen AI will have on the sector.

""More than seven in 10 (71%) healthcare executives surveyed are planning to evolve from transactional relationships to strategic partnerships, and nearly half (49%) are interested in end-to-end RCM outsourcing to a single service provider,"" noted Mehta. ""Long-term success will be defined by selecting a partner who can serve as a trusted advisor capable of delivering not only the technology, but also a comprehensive fusion of ongoing digital innovation, healthcare expertise, services as solutions, and proven operational and cybersecurity excellence.""

Gen AI: Propelling RCM TransformationInterestingly, the survey found that more than half (51%) of healthcare providers are actively exploring gen AI in RCM, with 22% already testing proof-of-concept initiatives and 29% in the consideration stage, evaluating use cases and potential challenges. Although adoption varies by organization size, the overwhelming consensus is that gen AI will play a critical role in automating manual processes, improving billing accuracy, and reducing claim denials.

""As a benefit of the gen AI investments we have already made so our customers do not have to, our clients are already putting gen AI use cases into action and are seeing meaningful results across RCM functions,"" said Vijayashree Natarajan, SVP & Head of Technology, Omega Healthcare.  ""The Omega Digital platform, powered by AI/gen AI/agentic AI solutions, is helping to enhance business outcomes for our customers, such as ~20-25% collections improvement; ~ 25-30% aged AR reduction; and ~ 30-35% improvement in charge lag.""

Top Five Gen AI Use CasesRCM leaders' top five gen AI use cases are: Real-time eligibility and benefits verification; Claims data analysis and pattern recognition to avoid future rejections; Gen AI chatbots to resolve patient queries (billing, payments, scheduling) and enhance experience; Documentation improvement through AI scribing; and Synthetic data generation and automated medical coding from clinical documents.

Barriers to AdoptionMajor challenges to gen AI adoption in RCM include a lack of in-house expertise, with about 80% of executives citing it as a key hurdle, and barriers integrating with existing electronic health records systems. Additionally, 46% of survey respondents consider gen AI a high priority but are awaiting regulatory clarity before committing to large-scale investments.

Future Investment PrioritiesEmerging RCM challenges, including the need for real-time claims tracking, the transition to value-based care models, and increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance, are also influencing investment decisions.

Looking ahead, RCM leaders are prioritizing cybersecurity, payer collaboration, and AI-driven automation:

About the surveyTo explore the impact and effectiveness of technology-driven RCM outsourcing, Everest Group, supported by Omega Healthcare, surveyed 41 C-Suite executives (CTOs, CIOs, CEOs), senior vice presidents, and directors of RCM Operations at US-based healthcare provider organizations. The study included organizations of all sizes and types, such as health networks, independent hospitals, independent physicians and physician groups, and ambulatory surgical centers, and DMEs.

An innovative healthcare approach that cuts out insurance companies— and with them, surprise charges — could get a boost in Wisconsin with the passage of a bill moving through the Legislature.

State Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara, a Republican from Appleton, has again introduced legislation that would exempt this newer model, called direct primary care, from health insurance law and regulations, as well as define the specifics of agreements between patients and those providers.

Direct primary care is a membership-based healthcare system in which patients pay a flat, monthly fee out of their pocket, rather than for visits and services. Most care is then covered by the membership fee. Proponents argue it gives doctors more time and personalized care with their patients and cuts much of the headache of dealing with insurance companies and surprise charges from out-of-network providers.

Cabral-Guevara, the chair of the Senate’s health committee, is also a nurse practitioner who runs her own healthcare practice.

“Direct primary care has become more popular over the years simply because insurance costs are going up,” she said.

Her bill aims to provide some protections for the young industry as it grows, the senator said, and also protections for patients, by defining and clarifying primary care agreements.

These types of laws, which have passed in states across the country, shield direct primary care practices from being regulated like traditional health insurance companies, reinforcing the model’s focus on direct patient-physician relationships without third-party payers, said Amanda Preimesberger, a physician and the founder of rootsMD, a direct primary care practice in Madison.

“Direct primary care agreements are not insurance plans,” she wrote in an email. 

Without clear legislation, regulators may classify them as such, subjecting direct primary care practices to complex regulations, like obtaining insurance licenses, that could force increased costs on them, Preimesberger noted. That would result in higher prices for patients, blowing up the entire premise of direct primary care, which can keep costs low due to the lack of middlemen.

Nicole Hemkes, a physician who founded Advocate MD, a direct primary care practice with several clinics in Dane County, said the vast majority of her patients also have health insurance on top of paying her membership fee, “but they are using us for the majority of their stuff.”

Folks with high deductible plans in the thousands of dollars likely have to pay for most healthcare services at a traditional clinic out of pocket, so buying membership-based direct primary care and using it for most of their healthcare on top of paying insurance premiums can often be cheaper for the patient.

“We are filling that gap,” Hemkes said.

Regarding the bill, Hemkes said she had “mixed feelings,” as she worries it might hold direct primary care practices to a higher standard than traditional ones, but overall she is supporting it.

A version of the bill has been introduced for several legislative sessions, according to Cabral-Guevara’s office. After passing both houses of the legislature with only Republican votes in 2019, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed the bill due to fears it might be discriminatory, the senator said.

Seeking to win over the governor, Cabral-Guevara got an opinion from the Legislative Research Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency that assists legislators in developing and analyzing bills, saying other laws on the books already offer discrimination protections. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case affirmed those protections for gay or transgender people, she noted.

The governor’s press office did not respond to messages asking if those things have changed his mind.



Potential drawbacks of direct primary care

Direct primary care does not make sense for everyone. Memberships do not cover everything, and patients still need to buy insurance so they are covered for major medical expenses and specialty care. But memberships are relatively inexpensive, generally around $50-100 per month depending on age and location, and may be cheaper than paying for healthcare services out of pocket under high-deductible plans.

Also, direct primary care memberships may not accept Medicare and Medicaid, limiting their access for some. And because it is not part of your health insurance, spending on memberships have no effect on your deductible.

One of the most robust and influential grant foundations in New York recently extended its generosity to the Le Moyne College community. Mother Cabrini Health Foundation awarded $1.275 million to the Le Moyne Healthcare Advancement Resource Center (HARC), which supports international medical professionals in obtaining healthcare jobs in New York.

Mother Cabrini Health Foundation is a non-profit, private organization that provides healthcare services, particularly to historically underserved communities. The foundation’s mission is rooted in Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini, an Italian immigrant who dedicated her career to advocating for immigrants and social justice. The foundation follows in her footsteps and provides grants to programs and services that support the health and well-being of people across New York. 

Since its establishment in 2018, the foundation has awarded over 2,700 grants, approximately over $800 million. In 2024, 529 grants were distributed, amounting to $208 million for organizations across New York. This money has been used to fund community healthcare programs to serve people facing health and social disparities, providing basic food and shelter as well as access to healthcare and mental health services. These programs focus on serving vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, immigrants, and veterans. The funding from the grants is necessary to allow these programs to flourish and provide for their communities. 

One such program is Le Moyne’s Healthcare Advancement Resource Center; this program is designed for foreign-trained medical graduates (FMGs) who are searching for jobs in New York. Professions and career pathways of clients include Registered Nurse, Physician’s Assistant, Physician, Occupational Therapy, Medical Researcher, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, and others. Obtaining the necessary training and certifications to work as a medical professional is often challenging, as it involves a degree of knowledge about American healthcare and education systems. 

This challenge is exacerbated by language and cultural barriers. HARC seeks to address these issues and provides clients with resources such as English classes, resume reviews, educational case managers, interview and job searches, academic scholarships, community networking, and many more. The clients of this program come from over 25 countries such as Brazil, China, Afghanistan, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Yemen.

HARC is a vital contributor to Syracuse’s healthcare system; with growing populations and increased health disparities, culturally and linguistically appropriate providers are needed to connect with communities and provide appropriate care to Syracuse residents. Foreign-trained medical graduates offer unique perspectives and skill sets that are essential to advancing healthcare services and practices. The additional support provided by the Foundation’s grant will help this program flourish and provide resources to its clients.

 Reaching 10 Million Patients by 2035 With a Focus on Underserved Communities 

AUSTIN, Texas, March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BB Imaging, a leading sonography services company, announced its goal to reach 10 million patients annually in the next 10 years. Building on its legacy of serving half a million patients, the company is determined to address the urgent need for improved maternal healthcare and combat the maternal mortality crisis, underscored by the United States' D-plus preterm birth grade from the March of Dimes and Texas' D grade.

BB Imaging to Reach 10M Patients, Transforming Maternal Healthcare Access


""When we started BB Imaging, we knew access to quality prenatal care was essential, but the maternal mortality rates in the United States are alarming,"" said Blanca Lesmes, President, Chairperson, and Co-founder of BB Imaging. ""Our goal is to move the needle on this critical issue by ensuring pregnant patients, especially in underserved communities, receive timely and comprehensive prenatal ultrasounds.""


""When we started BB Imaging, we knew access to quality prenatal care was essential, but the maternal mortality rates in the United States are alarming,"" said Blanca Lesmes, President, Chairperson, and Co-founder of BB Imaging. ""Our goal is to move the needle on this critical issue by ensuring pregnant patients, especially in underserved communities, receive timely and comprehensive prenatal ultrasounds.""

BB Imaging is expanding access to maternal healthcare in areas of greatest need. Initial expansion plans focus on Dallas, Houston, and border towns in Texas, as well as Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Oklahoma, and Washington. This is driven by the urgent need to improve maternal health outcomes, especially in Texas, which ranks 47th in the nation for access to prenatal care, with 22 percent of women receiving inadequate care compared to the national average of 15.7 percent.

""We recognize the urgent need for qualified sonographers, especially in rural areas,"" said Sanjay Patel, CEO of BB Imaging. ""The industry average to fill a sonographer role is between 36 and 42 days, but in rural settings, it can take up to 180 days. This delay in hiring can significantly impact patient care. BB Imaging can place highly skilled, accredited sonographers in clinics in as little as 30 days, ensuring timely access to vital diagnostic services.""

BB Imaging provides a comprehensive solution for sonography staffing, handling everything from recruitment and training to scheduling and benefits. BB Imaging employs hundreds of sonographers. All are specialized, accredited professionals who meet the highest industry standards.

Looking ahead, BB Imaging is committed to partnering with healthcare providers, community organizations, and technology innovators like Telescan® to expand access to prenatal care and improve maternal health outcomes. ""Telescan® has been a game changer,"" said Ben Buentipo, Chief Imaging Officer and Co-founder for BB Imaging. ""It allows us to bridge geographical gaps and provide timely care to patients who might otherwise have limited access to specialists.""

The company's goal of reaching 10 million patients annually in the next 10 years underscores its dedication to transforming healthcare access for all. ""We invite healthcare providers and community organizations to join us in this mission to ensure that every mother and baby has access to the quality care they deserve,"" concluded Lesmes.

Sulphur Springs, Texas – The Hopkins County Health Care Foundation has fulfilled its commitment of providing $260,000 toward the $780,000 upgrade of the MRI machine at CHRISTUS Mother Frances Hospital – Sulphur Springs.
Local physicians report clearer scans, resulting in quicker and more accurate test results. Radiology reports a 43% reduction in scan time, which has almost doubled the number of patients that can be scanned in a day.
One of the first patients to use the upgraded MRI machine shared how pleased she was with the experience in comparison to the machine before: “I was more comfortable because there were no annoying straps, and it went by much faster than before”.
Funds for the upgrades were made possible by proceeds of the Hopkins County Health Care Foundation’s Annual Gala. This year’s chairs were Linda and Joe Bob, Julie and Brad, and Teffany and Corey Burgin. Their vision and dedication helped make the evening successful, resulting in proceeds of almost $264,000. Save the date to participate in the next Gala January 31, 2026.

Vyne Dental joins industry voices advocating for open data access to enhance patient care, practice efficiency, and innovation in dental healthcare

INDIANAPOLIS, March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- One year after the Change Healthcare crisis exposed critical vulnerabilities in healthcare data systems, Vyne Dental®, a leading provider of dental revenue technologies and electronic health information exchange solutions, is joining industry leaders in advocating for greater open data access and improved interoperability across dental healthcare systems.

""Open data allows for data portability — the primary intent and 'P' in HIPAA — which is not just beneficial but required by law,"" said Dr. Bryan Laskin, dental technology advocate and advisor to Vyne Dental. ""Along with the data availability mandates in the 21st Century Cures Act, these regulations exist to empower providers and patients. Open data drives competition, fuels innovation, and enables provider choice while creating better transparency. Ultimately, it gives patients greater control, security, and agency over their own healthcare data and clinical dental records.""

The dental industry continues to face challenges with data siloing in practice management systems (PMS) that restrict information flow between providers, patients, and payers — creating unnecessary barriers to efficient care delivery and practice management.

Open data solutions deliver significant benefits to the entire dental industry:

For Dental Providers:

For Patients:

For Technology Partners:

""The Change Healthcare crisis exposed critical vulnerabilities in our industry's approach to data management,"" said Paul Bernard, Chief Product Officer at Vyne Dental. ""We learned that Practice Management Systems need multiple clearinghouse options rather than a single-threaded approach that creates significant financial impacts for providers and patients. Despite these clear lessons, many PMS systems have reverted to assigning all clearinghouse transaction volume to a single clearinghouse vendor— putting practices at risk once again. Open data standards are essential to creating more resilient systems and giving providers control over their own risk management.""

Looking to other industries provides valuable insights. Medical healthcare saw progress through the 21st Century Cures Act and FHIR standards adoption, which led to 57% of hospitals using FHIR APIs for patient data exchange by 2022, according to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT.

Similarly, the EU's Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) mandating open banking APIs resulted in a 10% improvement in financial transaction efficiency, according to a 2021 McKinsey report, while telecommunications regulation enabling number portability increased consumer choice and service quality.

""We face significant barriers to achieving open data in dentistry,"" added Dr. Laskin. ""These include a perverse and opaque incentive structure where PMS systems keep structural payer incentives for themselves, a lack of visibility into the systemic risk these practices create, insufficient oversight and enforcement of existing laws, and a power imbalance between PMS systems and their provider customers. This is compounded by a lack of unified provider advocacy for change. The time has come to address these barriers head-on.""

To support industry progress toward greater data openness, Vyne Dental is:

In cooperation with

Almost one in three healthcare organizations allow their people to use AI without formal restrictions. Half permit AI utilization as long as the models have been OK’d by management. Only 16% prohibit AI outright.  

The findings are from a new survey conducted by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, aka HIMSS. The project’s focus was not limited to AI—the researchers were interested in uncovering the broader landscape of cybersecurity across healthcare. But AI ends up consuming a considerable patch of real estate in the survey report. 

The survey drew representative responses from 273 healthcare cybersecurity professionals working not only for providers (50%) but also for vendors (18%), consulting firms (13%), government entities (8%) and other organizations (11%). 

Respondents ranged from C-suite leaders (50%) to non-executive management (37%) to non-management (13%). 

What all had in common was holding some level of responsibility for day-today cybersecurity operations or cybersecurity activities.

Here are highlights from the AI section of the report. 

37% of respondents reported using AI for technical tasks like support and data analytics, 35% for clinical services such as diagnostics, and cybersecurity and administrative tasks (each 34%). HIMSS comments: 

‘More AI technology use cases are anticipated for the future as AI becomes more prevalent.’

Nearly half the field, 47%, indicated that their organizations have approval processes, while 42% reported that they do not. An additional 11% were unsure whether such processes exist within their organizations. The authors remark: 

‘An approval process serves as a proactive guardrail by vetting AI technologies before adoption, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized or inappropriate use. Meanwhile, monitoring AI usage functions as a reactive guardrail, providing ongoing oversight of AI activities to identify and address potential misuse, compliance issues or security risks.’

31% of respondents reported their organizations actively monitor AI usage across systems and devices, while 52% said they do not and 17% did not know. HIMSS points out: 

‘The lack of monitoring poses risks such as data breaches and others. There is a need for robust monitoring strategies to ensure safe and responsible use of AI technologies.’

42% of respondent stated that their healthcare organizations have written AUPs for AI, 48% indicated they do not, and 10% did not know. HIMSS notes: 

‘An acceptable use policy sets clear guidelines for the safe and responsible use of technology, including AI, and can be standalone or integrated into a general policy based on the organization’s AI adoption.’ 

75% of respondents cited data privacy as a top concern, followed by data breaches (53%) and bias in AI systems (53%). Nearly half expressed concerns about intellectual property theft (47%) and lack of transparency (47%), while 41% highlighted patient safety risks. HIMSS writes: 

‘These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards, ethical frameworks and proactive measures to address the risks.’

A small percentage of respondents reported negligent insider threat activity (5%), malicious insider threat activity (3%), or both negligent and malicious insider threat activity (3%). HIMSS states: 

‘While these numbers may seem small, it is likely that many organizations have not yet implemented monitoring specifically for AI-driven insider threats, leaving potential risks undetected.’

Amplifying the implied call to arms against insider threats, the authors write: 

‘The growing reliance on AI tools and systems introduces new opportunities for both negligent and malicious insider activity, which can amplify risks to sensitive data and operational integrity.’

HIMSS doesn’t specify which geographic regions it included in the survey, but the group operates in North America, Europe, the U.K., the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.

The Trump administration is looking to roll back staffing at the department charged with caring for American veterans by firing as many as 80,000 workers who were hired as part of a Biden administration initiative to improve care and cover veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances.

The plan is laid out in a memorandum, first reported on by Government Executive, which came from VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek and calls to reduce the number of employees on the payroll to 2019 levels.

It instructs top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganization in August to ""resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.""

The memorandum also calls for agency officials to work with the White House's Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to ""move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach"" to meeting objectives laid out by the administration, which has started a concerted effort to reduce the number of people on federal payrolls.

In public social media posts, Musk, the world’s wealthiest man and a prominent Trump campaign donor, has alluded to presidential election results in the District of Columbia — a heavily Democratic city that has never given its electoral votes to a Republican candidate — as justification for slashing the federal workforce.

Veterans have already been speaking out against the cuts at the VA, which so far have included a few thousand employees and hundreds of contracts. More than 25 percent of the VA's workforce are veterans themselves.

In Congress, Democrats have decried the cuts at the VA and other agencies, while Republicans have watched the Trump administration's changes with caution.

Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veteran's affairs, said in a statement that the Trump administration ""has launched an all-out assault"" against progress the VA has made in expanding its services as the number of covered veterans grows and includes those impacted by toxic burn pits.

""Their plan prioritizes private sector profits over veterans' care, balancing the budget on the backs of those who served. It's a shameful betrayal, and veterans will pay the price for their unforgivable corruption, incompetence, and immorality,"" he said.

Stuart Ashman, a friend who met the late Gene Hackman at Pilates classes, shared with Fox News Digital that the actor was very ""fit."" Video by Derek Shook for Fox News Digital.

While authorities continue to investigate the mysterious death of legendary actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, a misstep was found in the case. 

The dog that was found dead near Arakawa's body was misidentified by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Department in the investigation, Fox News Digital can confirm. 

The owner of the Santa Fe Tails, the pet care facility that took in Hackman’s two other surviving dogs, explained that the dead dog was a different breed than what is listed in the search warrant affidavit, obtained by Fox News Digital.

Hackman and his wife’s three dogs were named Zinna, Bear and Nikita.

""Zinna was a mutt … a mixed breed,"" Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails, shared with Fox News Digital. ""Bear is the purebred German shepherd and Nikita's the shepherd mix.""

""Our deputies, they don’t work with canines on a daily basis,"" she said, according to The Associated Press. 

Padilla told Fox News Digital that the shepherd mix appeared frightened by the mysterious events that unfolded surrounding their now-deceased owners.

""Nikita's the shepherd mix, and she was the one that was really terrified of what was going on when all of this was happening. She was really difficult,"" Padilla added.

While it is unclear how long the surviving dogs were left unattended, the pet care facility owner said the shepherd mix ""was hungry,"" and their team attempted to give her treats. However, the dog did not immediately take the treats since there were ""too many people"" around. 

He continued to explain that the animal services ""utilized a trap"" for the shepherd mix and then the pet care facility picked up the dog.

Authorities have been searching for answers after the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa, whose partially mummified bodies were discovered on Feb. 26 at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home.

Authorities did not perform a necropsy on Zinna, who was found in a kennel in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, the search warrant stated. Investigators initially noted the discovery of a ""deceased brown in color German-Shepard canine.""

The Oscar-winning actor and his wife, a classical pianist, tested negative for carbon monoxide, according to the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department. Hackman likely died about nine days before his body was discovered by authorities.

According to a press release obtained by Fox News Digital Tuesday, the New Mexico Gas Company ""confirmed it conducted an extensive investigation for gas leaks and carbon monoxide"" Feb. 26 and made ""no significant findings"" at the couple's secluded home.

At one time, actor Stephen Collins seemed to have it all: fame, wealth and the undying love of legions of fans.

The handsome actor who starred as Jake Cutter in ABC’s adventure series, Tales of the Gold Monkey, and Diane Keaton’s wayward husband in the hit feature film, The First Wives Club, was perhaps best known for his role as wholesome pastor and dad Eric Camden on the WB series, 7th Heaven.

But in Hollywood, Calif., the land of make-believe and illusion, not everything is as it seems.

Collins’ picture-perfect world was turned upside down in 2012 when news broke that he was being investigated by police for allegedly sexually abusing underage girls.

The investigation came after a recording of Collins allegedly confessing his transgressions to a therapist was leaked to TMZ.

Collins made headlines again in 2014 when he released a lengthy statement to PEOPLE admitting he had inappropriate sexual conduct with three female minors over twenty years, from 1973 to 1994.

Shortly after, Collins told Katie Couric in an exclusive interview that aired on ABC News’ 20/20 that he was “absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted to children.”

Collins’ shocking fall from grace is detailed in Investigation Discovery’s new six-part series, Hollywood Demons.

ID/Investigation Discovery

Premiering Monday, March 24, from 9 to 11 p.m. ET/PT on ID and streaming on Max, the series features six mini-documentaries that pull back “the glamorous curtain of fame to expose the hidden struggles, sacrifices and scandals of life in the spotlight,” according to an ID press release.

“Each gripping two-hour episode features accounts from Hollywood insiders, project collaborators, and survivors who endured harrowing abuse and struggles,” ID says in its release. (The trailer is exclusively debuted below.)

Addiction specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky and culture writer Scaachi Koul share their perspectives on each scandal.

“The majority of people don’t know the true story,” former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills castmate Taylor Armstrong says in the trailer.

The two-hour premiere, Stephen Collins: America’s Dad, tells the story of Collins and other stars who are “far from” the characters they play, according to ID.

The episode includes a shocking, tell-all interview with one of Collins’ alleged victims and with 7th Heaven cast members including Jeremy London, who open up about how they felt when they learned about the accusations.Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Covering some of Hollywood’s biggest scandals, the series includes an episode called ""Child Stars Gone Violent,"" premiering March 31, about the “path of crime, addiction and violence” that ensued for some young celebrities once their moment in the spotlight had faded.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of 'My Mother and I,' discusses how the Duchess of Sussex isn't going to be welcomed back across the pond anytime soon following her royal exit.

There is ""no comparison"" between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, according to one royal expert.  

On Tuesday, the same day that Markle's new lifestyle series premiered, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams noted to Fox News Digital that Princess Kate and husband Prince William's popularity is ""very high.""

Meanwhile, Markle has a 21% approval rating, another British royals expert, Hilary Fordwich, told Fox News Digital, citing a recent YouGov poll in Britain, adding that the Princess of Wales is ""Britain's most popular living royal.""

""With Love, Meghan,"" premiered on Netflix on Tuesday and includes the Duchess of Sussex in the kitchen and garden with friends and celebrities.

""Princess Catherine actually is a beekeeper,"" Fordwich said, referencing Markle’s beekeeping segment shown in a preview for ""With Love, Meghan."" ""Her bees are at Anmer Hall, in the corner of the gardens on the Sandringham estate. Instead of monetizing her real hobby, back in the summer of ’21, she actually took honey from the hives whilst visiting schoolchildren attending the biodiversity hub at London’s Natural History Museum.""

Fordwich said that everything Middleton ""does is to help others, those mentally challenged, the less privileged, the disadvantaged, the young, as well as those suffering from cancer, to name a few causes.""

""She never belittles others, whereas this Netflix show is actually denigrating to those less fortunate,"" Fordwich opined.

She added that, to her, Markle is ""not only doing everything for money, she is seeking more fame and self-aggrandizement,"" whereas Middleton and her husband, Prince William, do everything ""without fanfare.""

In December 2018, William and Kate flew on a Royal Mail flight that was loaded with cards and presents from the families of those serving at a Royal Air Force base in Cyprus, Fordwich mentioned.

""Also, a few years ago, they enjoyed a fake snowball fight at the palace's temporary Orangery cafe, played games and helped children make Christmas cards and treats,"" she said. ""Supported by the Royal British Legion in recognition of the sacrifices serving personnel and their families make year-round, and especially when they are separated during the festive period, again without public fanfare. This is what is really comforting versus jars of bath salts.""

""Princess Catherine has never been involved in any legal issues or lawsuits,"" she continued. ""She is genuine, honest and true. She is devoted to her children, so doesn’t use them to monetize projects. She lives her life in spite of the media and paparazzi.""

Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner disagreed. 

""The beauty of Meghan is she is very precise with all the intricate ingredients and presentation and, obviously, with the usual Netflix styling the show looks immaculate,"" he said, adding, ""I am a self-confessed Meghan fan and for me the show works.""

Pelham Turner called it a ""shame there is such a chasm with King Charles,"" noting that the longtime environmentalist ""would like the show content, especially using the homeopathic herbs from the garden.""

He added that the royal family would be ""fools"" not to watch Markle’s show because ""royal members like Meghan show how [a] 21st century monarchy can be.""

Fordwich said that with the royal family, it’s important to note what they don’t say compared to what they do say when it comes to Markle’s show.

ABC News and Walt Disney Co. entertainment networks are being hit with a 6% reduction in staff amid shrinking ratings and revenues for traditional television.

Workers were told of the cuts Wednesday. The reduction of 200 positions is being made across   Disney‘s television units, with news suffering the biggest job losses. A majority of the cuts will impact ABC News employees in New York.

Rumors of workforce reductions have circulated for months at the news division, which like other outlets has seen its audience leave TV channels for streaming platforms. 

ABC News lost about 40 employees in a round of layoffs in October, which also hit the company’s TV stations for a total of 75 cuts. The reductions announced Wednesday will hit the network’s entertainment networks as well as the news division.

 Hollywood Inc. 

Godwin came to the Walt Disney Co. unit from CBS. She made history as the first Black broadcast news division president.

Almin Karamehmedovic, president of ABC News, said in a note to staff that the cuts are aimed at streamlining the operation and positioning it for the changes in the TV landscape. 

“Rethinking the way we work to future-proof our team regrettably includes reductions to our extraordinary staff,” Karamehmedovic said. “These decisions are incredibly challenging and today will undoubtedly be difficult for our organization. ”

No on-air correspondents or anchors at ABC News will lose their jobs in the cutbacks, according to one person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to comment publicly.

ABC News will consolidate the staffs of “Good Morning America” with the afternoon edition of the show known as “GMA 3,” according to the Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the layoffs. The staffs of newsmagazine “20/20” and late night program “Nightline” are being consolidated under the ABC News Studios production unit.

ABC News is also shuttering 538, the data journalism unit Disney acquired from founder Nate Silver.

ABC News has long been the leader among evening news viewers with “ABC World News Tonight with David Muir.” 

But “Good Morning America” — which has three of the highest-paid news hosts in TV with George Stephanopoulos, Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan — is running behind NBC’s “Today” for the first time in seven years. 

In the 2024-25 season, “Today” has a slight edge over “GMA” in total viewers and wins a wider margin among the 25 to 54 age group preferred by advertisers who buy against news programming.

ABC News has also been investing in the streaming news service ABC News Live, which attracts younger viewers but only a fraction of the audience size for network TV broadcasts.

The Wednesday layoffs account for roughly 6% of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks’ staff

ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks are laying off just under 200 employees, or roughly 6% of its staff, across news and entertainment starting on Wednesday, TheWrap has learned.

A majority of these cuts come from ABC News, where its employees are largely based in New York. 

In line with the changes, ABC News Studios, “20/20,” “Nightline” and “Impact x Nightline” now fall under one leadership structure. ABC News’ digital, editorial and social teams are similarly now integrated within the news gathering, shows and owned stations units.

Additionally, the “Good Morning America”-branded shows have been consolidated into one under Simone Swink, while Seni Tienabeso was named VP of ABC News Live.

TheWrap has reached out to Disney and ABC News for comment.

The ABC News layoffs are just the latest in a rocky start for media jobs in 2025. Scripps also underwent cuts this week, while Indiewire let go of three top editors last month, Forbes cut 5% of its staff in late January and Vox was recently hit by its third round of reductions in just two months. The Washington Post and the Huffington Post also let go of employees last month.

In October, Disney laid off about 75 employees from ABC News and its eight ABC Owned Television Stations in another effort to cut costs.

The owner of brands like A&E, History and Lifetime wants to shift its focus to its studios and content, rather than its TV channels.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	A+E Networks is rebranding as it seeks to shift focus away from its pay-TV business and toward its burgeoning studios, digital and content creation divisions.


	Going forward, the company will operate as A+E Global Media, with its ad sales division now called A+E Media Solutions. While A+E Networks still operates pay-TV channels like A&E, Lifetime, and History, the company has leaned into its studios business and digital efforts in recent years, including aggressive licensing deals for its owned programs, and launching both FAST and YouTube channels based on its brands.

	“The name A+E Global Media reflects who we are today – an innovative, multiplatform content engine that reaches audiences everywhere,” says Paul Buccieri, president and chairman of A+E Global Media. “We are powered by our borderless storytelling and worldwide consumption that has no limits. With a vast portfolio of premium brands, cutting-edge studios, and world-class talent, we create compelling narratives that deeply engage viewers across every screen and platform. As we expand our global footprint, our focus remains on delivering exceptional storytelling that resonates across cultures and connects with audiences in meaningful ways.”

	In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, A+E president of media solutions Toby Byrne says that the new corporate brand “just better reflects who we are now, who we’ve been recently, as well as very much who we’re going to be going forward: A multi-platform company that’s a global provider of entertainment content.”


	“I think it’s a great time to change the name. The company as a whole is very forward thinking, data driven, and has a digital mindset,” Byrne adds. “And certainly our team is very solutions oriented as well. When you consider all that, it just felt like A+E Networks was a name for what the company used to be and not what the company is now.”


	Last month A+E launched a dedicated digital division that would encompass all of its digital video content and platforms, as part of a larger bid to diversify its business lines. The company is one of the largest pay-TV companies without any sports in its portfolio, and it is trying to lean more on the production and distribution side of the business as cord-cutting continues to erode the traditional business models.

	











	“We bring the lens of a multi-platform approach with our total distribution,” Byrne says. “Cable networks are one part of our distribution. They don’t represent anywhere near the entirety of what the addition of our multi-platform digital endpoints provide – a really important element of our total reach.”


	“You’ve got much larger platforms and larger media companies, all of them have sports. And we’re really the largest entertainment company,” Byrne adds. “We have high quality content that is a trusted environment that we continue to invest in year after year. We have innovative solutions that we can provide and flexibility around how we do business, and we are an efficient option compared to many of the other assets in the marketplace.”


	Byrne also framed History content as something that complements sports ad buys in terms of audience overlap.


	The announcement from A+E (which is jointly owned by The Walt Disney Co. and Hearst) was connected to the company’s annual upfront presentation, which it delivered in a virtual format Wednesday.


	The company typically announces a stacked slate of programming with recognizable names both in front of and behind the camera. Among the shows it announced are History programs hosted by David Duchovny, Ving Rhames and Henry Winkler, an American Pickers spinoff History’s Greatest Picks, led by Mike Wolfe; at Lifetime, the company unveiled a development deal with Tyler Perry Studios and Pantheon Media Group, and announced a docuseries on the Judd family; and at A&E, new season orders for Storage Wars and the WWE programs LFG and WWE’s Greatest Moments.

Brittany Mahomes has decided that she won't be sharing any photos or videos of her newborn daughter's face for a while.

The mom of three shared the news on her Instagram Stories on Tuesday, March 4.

""Golden is in the stroller. You can't see her, and won't for a while,"" she captioned a post. The comment appeared to spawn from people being confused about an earlier post. Mahomes reshared a video that her personal trainer shared that showed the face of a baby sitting in a rocking seat. Also in the photo was a stroller that was completely covered. Some people thought that the baby in the seat was Golden — but it was actually Mahomes' trainer's baby.

Before starting the workout, Mahomes posted a video of herself rocking Golden in her stroller.

""My fav workout partner,"" she captioned a video.

Mahomes and husband, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, announced the birth of their third child on Instagram back in January. The announcement included a photo of Golden's feet along with her full name and her birthday, but no other details. In the time since, neither Brittany nor Patrick have shared any photos or videos of Golden's face.

Meanwhile, the couple's other two kids, Sterling, 4, and Bronze, 2, have been all over social media. Most recently, Brittany shared footage from Sterling's Bluey-themed fourth birthday party. The oldest Mahomes child was seen jumping around and playing in her pink and green flamingo dress.

Two days earlier, Brittany shared a birthday tribute to Sterling.

""This sweetest, most kind little girl ever! I thank god everyday for choosing me to be your mom, you have taught me so much about life and what matters most and I truly am so thankful you made me a mama! You are the best big sister to Golden & Bronze and they are so lucky to have you guiding them,"" she captioned the Instagram share.

All three Mahomes children made appearances in the post, but Golden's face wasn't visible in any of the included photos.

	The Walt Disney Company is going through a round of layoffs Wednesday, impacting just under 200 employees, or almost 6% of the workforce in the ABC News Group and the company’s entertainment networks.


	The majority of the impacts will be at ABC News, which has most of its workforce based in New York, according to sources familiar with the plans.


	As part of the organizational changes, the news division’s longform units are being placed under one leadership structure including ABC News Studios, 20/20, Nightline and Impact x Nightline. Simone Swink will oversee all Good Morning America branded shows, a change as GMA and GMA3 had previously operated separately. The network last week named Seni Tienabeso to a new role as vice president of ABC News Live and some of the specialized units of the news division.

	











	Digital and social media operations also will be integrated with news gathering, shows and owned stations

	The network also is ending 538, its data analytics site. Its founder, Nate Silver, was part of the job reductions in 2023, but the site was repurposed with G. Elliott Morris as director of data analytics. The network will continue to provide polling data, but it will no longer be part of the separate 538 unit.


	Morris wrote on X, “538’s data collection was game-changing, and i hope it gets a rebirth. would need a modest budget for 2-3 researchers and 1-2 engineers. AI has also made things easier (at least I suspect — we were forbidden from using it).”


	The total layoffs are the latest to hit traditional media, which has grappled with a decline in ad spending and shifts in viewer habits.


	The Status newsletter was first to report the layoff plans.

Channing Tatum is reportedly ""doing well"" amid his rumored new romance months after his split from ex-fiancée Zoë Kravitz. 

Tatum recently sparked romance rumors after being seen with model Inka Williams in Los Angeles last month. On Tuesday (March 4), a source close to Tatum claimed to People that the 44-year-old Magic Mike star and the 25 year old were ""seeing"" each other ""romantically,"" adding, ""Channing's doing well. [Inka] makes him happy."" 

The insider also addressed the nearly 20-year age gap between the pair, noting that the model ""seems older"" than her age.

""They met through friends. She's great,"" the source said. ""She has her own life. She's young, but seems older.""

Prior to his reported romance with Williams, Tatum was engaged to Kravitz. The pair were together for three years after meeting while filming her directorial debut Blink Twice before they called it quits in October 2024. 

In addition to his reported new relationship, Tatum has been spending ""a lot of time"" with his 11-year-old daughter Everly, whom he shares with ex-wife Jenna Dewan, after wrapping up filming in North Carolina and returning home to Los Angeles. His work will also see him reunite with Kravitz in the near future as they are both set to star in an upcoming film that was announced around the same time as their split.

""He's reuniting with Zoë later this spring for another movie project,"" the insider said. ""It shouldn't be too awkward — they ended things on okay terms.""","{'href': 'https://kiisfm.iheart.com', 'title': 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest'}"

On Tuesday, March 4, the 46-year-old former Dancing With The Stars host revealed on the Calm Down podcast that she had a precancerous spot on her face.

Amid their discussion about travel, co-host Charissa Thompson quipped, ""Don't touch that,"" to the sports broadcaster, who responded, ""Sorry, it is so crusty, and it really hurts.""

Thompson, 42, clarified what they were talking about, telling listeners, ""For those of you that are new, Erin's working through some — an issue on her upper lip, but it's not what you think it is.""

The sideline reporter jumped in, explaining, ""It's a pre-skin cancer situation, and so we did a cream. I did a cream for five days on it.""

Andrews — who has been open about her previous battle with cervical cancer — reiterated a few times that she would explain the situation further on the ""big show"" as they were recording for their shorter ""Pregame"" episode. The ""big show"" is their full-length podcast episodes that air each week — the next one will come out on Thursday, March 6.

""I went for the old 'Oh, it's a great idea until you get in the car' skin check, the whole shebang,"" she recounted. ""I wanted to pass out in the middle of it because I'm like so afraid they're going to find something.""

The Fox Sports mainstay was previously diagnosed with cervical cancer in September 2016 and underwent surgery a few weeks later.

A post shared by Calm Down with Erin & Charissa (@calmdownpodcast)

In 2018, sheopened up to Michael Strahan on Good Morning America about her experience with the illness.

""I think what went through my mind is what everybody thinks of when they hear what do they say the C word, right? 'I'm sorry. I have what? I have what?'"" Andrews recalled. ""[My doctor] told me what was going on and my first reaction was like, 'How bad is this?'""

Andrews — who has since defeated cervical cancer — has been married to Canadian NHL player Jarret Stoll since 2017. The couple share a son, Mack, born June 2023.

[Warning: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for Severance Season 2 Episode 7, “Chikhai Bardo.”]

It’s perhaps the biggest mystery hanging over Severance’s second season: What the heck is Cold Harbor, and what does it have to do with Gemma Scout (Dichen Lachman)?

In “Chikhai Bardo,” we got a few crumbs. We now know that Gemma is alive, rather than in a catatonic or unresponsive state. We know she remembers Mark (Adam Scott) and appears to be herself, rather than a duplicate or a clone. We don’t, however, know what Cold Harbor is supposed to do. We know only that the room for it remains locked and that Mark is responsible for refining the data that will ultimately, we assume, create the experience. Here’s what we — and the Internet — think Cold Harbor might be.

Apple TV+

According to several predominant and logical-sounding Reddit theories, “Cold Harbor” might be devastating — and it’s entirely possible Gemma won’t survive its completion. The consensus among groups of fans is that Gemma’s experiences in the rooms on the testing floor are meant to evoke inconveniences and fears from which people might want to escape. Thus, as an innie, she writes tedious thank-you cards, endures a turbulent flight, and goes to the dentist, all of which are experiences non-severed people might want to opt out of. When Gemma reverts to herself, she has no memory of what she went through; she simply leaves the room with aching gums or a sore hand.

Following that line of thought, the current theories propose that Cold Harbor might be a way of escaping the ultimate opt-out human experience: death. The assistant on the testing floor asks Gemma whether she fears suffocation or drowning more, which seems to imply Gemma’s being evaluated for her response to certain scenarios. Once Cold Harbor is completed, it could end up being a way to test whether Gemma is able to experience death entirely as an innie, therefore sparing her outie from going through the pain. We’ve also seen plenty of nods to drowning in Season 2, with a whistled “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” and Helena-Helly’s (Britt Lower) near-drowning experience.

Apple TV+

Throughout Season 2, Severance has made it clear that Mark has to be the one to complete Cold Harbor. To hear the workers at Lumon tell it, he’s the only one who’s capable — but why? And why, for that matter, is there so much interest in Mark as an employee when all of the MDR workers have been trained for the same job?

If, as the theories propose, Cold Harbor relates specifically to Gemma’s fears, it’s possible that Mark is needed to refine that data because he knew Gemma on the outside. He was married to her, after all; he knows she hates writing thank-you cards, that she always sneezes twice, that she’s allergic to nutmeg. If Cold Harbor is meant to be her ultimate fear, who would be better to refine the data to recreate it than her husband? This also places Mark in a unique position to the Lumon higher-ups, because he has a personal connection with Gemma. We already know Mark’s refining work is involved with Gemma’s torture, because he completed a file called “Allentown” — the name of one of the rooms Gemma entered.

Of course, should that prove true, it’d be beyond horrible for both Mark and Gemma. Mark’s been working for the whole season to get his wife back: If he ends up being the architect of her demise, it’d be hard to imagine his character ever recovering. And it isn’t as if Lumon’s answers to Gemma when she asks about Mark are offering much hope — while they’ve told her Mark will benefit from the world her testing creates (“The completion of Cold Harbor will be remembered as one of the greatest moments in the history of this planet,” Mr. Drummond [Olafur Darri Olafsson] says), their responses when she asks about seeing her husband again are incredibly ominous. We wouldn’t be surprised if Mark ends up being too late to save Gemma and they end up either separated again heading into the show’s third season, or separated permanently.

Whether or not Cold Harbor goes into effect, we think Gemma deserves to hit the scientists on the testing floor with even more chairs. She’s earned it.

Millie Bobby Brown loves her husband Jake Bongiovi so much she got a sweet tribute inked in his honor.

The Stranger Things star debuted a tiny tattoo of what is seemingly her husband's initials on her ankle this week, putting the ink on display during a stylish stroll in London on Tuesday (March 4), per Page Six, which also shared photos of the body art. The ink, a subtle ""JB"" placed on the inside of her left ankle, could be seen through her sheer black tights that she paired with platform loafers, leopard print trench coat-style outfit, mini umbrella and pillbox hat. 

Brown and the 22-year-old son of rocker Jon Bon Jovi first got married in a ""private ceremony"" in May 2024 just over a year after getting engaged following three years of dating. They held a second intimate ceremony in Italy in October. 

Brown's newest ink joins her growing list of tattoos she has gotten over the past few years. She has a pair of delicate flowers inked on her back as well as the name ""Ruth"" on her ribcage in honor of her grandmother who passed away in 2020. She also has a small heart on her collarbone and the number ""011"" on her wrist, commemorating her breakout role as Eleven in Stranger Things. 

Earlier this week, the Enola Holmes star slammed haters constantly criticizing her looks, calling out the harmful ""bullying"" in a powerful message and refusing to ""apologize for growing up.""","{'href': 'https://kiisfm.iheart.com', 'title': 'On Air with Ryan Seacrest'}"

Barack Obama turned down Keanu Reeves' role in 'Severance'.

The former United States President, 63, was offered a role in the hit AppleTV+ psychological sci-fi thriller series by Ben Stiller - who serves as executive producer and director on the show - as the voice of an animated Lumon building in a film shown to staff in season two.

Appearing on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' this week, Ben said: ""There was one person that I asked before [Keanu], and he said no.""

Ben confirmed Obama was the other person, and explained: ""I didn’t ask him in person. I knew someone who knew his lawyer, and his lawyer said: ‘I can relay the request if you write an email, so I wrote this email to him saying: ‘Hey, we have this show... whatever.’

""Two days later, I get an email back from President Barack Obama saying: ‘Hey Ben, big fan of the show, love season one, can’t wait for season two.

""'Don’t think I have time in my schedule to make this happen.’ ”

The 59-year-old comedian joked that he couldn't thing of anything ""more important than doing the voice-over for the animated building in Severance"".

The show - which stars Adam Scott, Britt Lower and John Turturro - focuses on office workers at Lumon industries who have undergone the so-called 'severance' procedure, which is the clinical separation of their work and personal lives.

Ben admitted it was ""pretty cool"" that Obama responded at all, before opening up on how Keanu, 60, took to the role.

He recalled: ""We did it like a full-on recording session. He was in LA, I was in New York, but he went into the studio and did multiple takes.

""He took it very seriously. He’s just like the most warm and inviting voice.

""I don’t know if when you see the building and hear his voice you necessarily immediately think that it’s Keanu, but then I think you just have this innate sort of feeling.”

Actress Neetu Chandra filed a PIL in Patna High Court requesting the government to impose a complete ban on vulgar Bhojpuri and Hindi songs. Popularly known as Bihar's daughter, Bollywood actress and National Award winner Neetu Chandra Srivastava put forward her demand and said that school-going girls feel unsafe.

On the occasion of International Women's Day, the National Award-winning actress said, 'Vulgar Bhojpuri and Hindi songs are not leaving the girls and women going to school and college in Bihar and they are forced to walk on the road with their eyes down. Due to these songs, women do not even like to watch TV at home. Many singers singing such songs have gained fame today, which can become an obstacle in the development of society and country.'

She further added, 'When girls or women will not be able to walk safely on the road, then will they be able to think about development. If a government can bring a law to ban liquor in its state to save women from drunken husbands, then can it not ban these vulgar songs for school-college going girls and women. I want there should be a complete ban on the production and playing of these songs in Bihar.'

She even said that these songs create a feeling of insecurity in women and can hurt small children. These songs can take society in the wrong direction and reduce respect for women. She even appealed to the people of Bihar to strongly oppose these songs and said that a case should be registered against the singers who sing such songs. A PIL has been filed in Patna High Court today, which has been led by Senior Advocate Nivedita Nirvikar. The PIL has been filed in Patna High Court today by Shashi Priya. 'Women should never make the mistake of treating anyone as an object because insulting a woman has always resulted in painful consequences,' read the PIL.

British tennis star Emma Raducanu said she was so distraught after seeing her stalker in the stands during last month that she didn't know if she would be able to finish the the match. 

The former U.S. Open champion spoke about the distressing incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships for the first time Wednesday, ahead of the Indian Wells in California, where she will return to play with enhanced security. 

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish’,” Raducanu told reporters, according to Sky News. “I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.’” 

The 22-year-old tennis player's distress was visible on camera after she spotted the man ""fixated on her"" during her opening match against Czech player Karolina Muchova.

She broke down in tears before approaching the umpire, where she appeared to be explaining the situation. She then hid behind the umpire’s chair while the man was escorted out by security.

When she resumed the match, she lost 7-6(6) 6-4 and took a week off before returning to the tour.

“It was a very emotional time,” Raducanu said.

“After the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost,” she said, adding, “There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here.”

Raducanu said the man had also been present during her previous matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha.

In Dubai, she was approached by the man twice off the court, including at the Aviation Club Tennis Centre the day before her match, the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said in a statement.

Following the incident, Dubai Police said it had detained the “tourist” who “left [Raducanu] a note, took her photograph, and engaged in behavior that caused her distress.” 

The man signed a restraining order and agreed to keep his distance from her, it added, before he returned to her match the next day. 

Raducanu subsequently decided not to press charges against the man. The WTA said he had been banned from its tournaments in the future.

“The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support,"" the association said at the time.

It added, “Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events.” 

Following the incident, Raducanu thanked her fans for the “messages of support” in an Instagram story. 

“Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be okay and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match,” Raducanu wrote.

The incident in Dubai was not Raducanu’s first troubling encounter with a fan. In 2022, another man was charged with stalking and received a five-year restraining order after he showing up at the British tennis player’s home on three separate occasions and left her unwanted gifts and flowers.

Raducanu, who rose to fame after winning the 2021 U.S. Open at the age of 18, currently ranks 55 in the world rankings. 

She will next play against Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima in the first round of Indian Wells, with the winner to face off Coco Gauff in the third round.

“I wasn’t necessarily sure if I was going to come and compete so soon after what happened in Dubai but I’m glad I made the decision to come here,"" Raducanu said Wednesday, ahead of her next match.

“I feel a lot better,” she added.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Janko Tipsarevic suggests who would have been the better coach for Novak Djokovic,https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/janko-tipsarevic-suggests-who-would-have-been-the-better-coach-for-novak-djokovic-andy-murray-or-pete-sampras/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:30:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray made tennis headlines last year as they joined forces in a coaching capacity.

The 24-time Major champion made a significant change at the end of his 2024 season, as Djokovic hired Murray as his coach.

They immediately found success together, as Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open, retiring with an injury against Alexander Zverev.

Djokovic has appeared just once since, losing in the first round of the Qatar Open to Matteo Berrettini, an event Murray chose not to attend.

The pair will be re-united for the year’s first Masters 1000 tournament at Indian Wells, as the Serb searches for a sixth title in California.

Ahead of the 37-year-old’s return to action, his countryman and friend shared his thoughts on Djokovic’s decision to bring Murray in as a coach.

Appearing as a guest on The Tennis Podcast, former ATP world number eight, Janko Tipsarevic gave his honest opinion on Murray as a coach.

“When I talk about glorified towel boys and people who are on tour just to pick up balls, 100% Andy Murray does not fall into that category,” he said.

“This has nothing to do with him being the ex-world number one, there are a lot of ex-top players who are s— coaches.

“My description of Andy Murray as a coach has nothing to do with his prior successes as a tennis player, by his character, you can clearly see that he loves the sport.”

Tipsarevic revealed that he spoke to the Brit in Melbourne earlier this year, and was impressed by his attention to detail.

“I spoke with him in Australia and I know him, we played quite a few times on tour, this is somebody who is taking his job extremely seriously, in terms of looking at the tiniest details in terms of what Novak [Djokovic] can do,” he said.

“I think we can say this will be the final quarter of his career, talking about Novak, whether it be two years or four years, I think we can say it’s the final quarter.”

The 40-year-old gave his verdict on the hire, suggesting Murray was the best possible option for Djokovic.

“So I feel from every possible person on tour, this was and I’m not saying this because we were friends, this was the best possible hire Novak could take,” said Tipsarevic.

“I really feel if he is healthy he can have another great season.

“There is nobody better on tour for Novak as a full package, that he knows personally, that he respects, that he knows will give 100% into the job like he is giving in this moment of his career than Murray.

“I am 100% certain of that, he is a way better hire than [Pete] Sampras or some legend like that or a top player or a Grand Slam winner.

“Because in Andy you have everything in one in terms of somebody who knows the feeling of the pressure that Novak needs his coach to know, and he has been playing with the guys that Novak has still been competing against.”

Djokovic will return to action in California later this week, as he searches for a record-sixth title at Indian Wells.

He’s been handed a tough draw, however, and could potentially face off against world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals.

Djokovic beat Alcaraz in their most recent encounter at the Australian Open, battling back from a set down to win, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.

The pair have faced off twice before in Masters 1000 tournaments, as Alcaraz beat Djokovic at the 2022 Madrid Open before Djokovic exacted revenge at the Cincinnati Open in 2023.

He won’t want to get too far ahead of himself, however, as he’ll first work hard with Murray to figure out a gameplan worthy of taking down either Botic van de Zandschulp or Nick Kyrgios in the second round.

The Australian star leads the head-to-head with Djokovic, 2-1, but many are concerned he won’t appear at the event after Kyrgios appeared to re-injure his wrist during a practice session ahead of the tournament.

It remains to be seen whether Djokovic will take on Kyrgios or Van de Zandschulp in the second round, but it’ll certainly be worth a watch as the Serb looks to win his 41st Masters 1000 title.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

Becoming the best in your craft takes more than pure talent. It demands relentless effort, unshakable mental and physical resilience, and the ability to adapt under pressure when everything is on the line.

One man who embodies those qualities is Stefan Edberg. The Swede is one of just 29 players to have climbed to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, while he is one of only two, alongside John McEnroe, to have claimed No. 1 in both singles and doubles.

On August 13, 1990, just a day after claiming his second ATP Masters 1000 title in Cincinnati, Edberg ended Ivan Lendl’s dominant 80-week reign to seize the World No. 1 ranking for the first time. A proud member of the elite ATP No. 1 Club, Edberg recently reflected on the relentless work and dedication it took not just to reach the top, but to stay there.

""It requires a certain mentality. You need to go your own way,” Edberg said. “You need to be quite selfish. You need to have a lot of good people around you.  It's one thing getting there, that's hard enough, but it's almost harder to stay at the top. It's like being on top of the one mountain; it's very windy up there and you have to be extremely focused to stay up there.”






The Swede held the No. 1 ranking for 24 weeks in his first stint before it passed to longtime rival Boris Becker on 27 January 1991. The two swapped the top spot four times that year, but Edberg sealed his place atop the rankings on 9 September, the day after winning his first US Open title.
Edberg, who lifted six trophies in 1991, celebrated the end of the season by earning ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the second time, having also finished 1990 as the World No. 1.
“Looking back, it is quite an achievement actually to finish the year as No. 1 and to do it two years in a row, even better,” Edberg said. “But I was very, very close to making it three years in a row and I was quite disappointed towards the end because I really wanted that spot. But I think Courier got there ahead of me that time.”
Edberg was renowned for his elegant and aggressive serve-and-volley style, a hallmark of classic grass-court tennis. He built his game around a precise and well-placed serve, which he followed up with lightning-quick net approaches, exceptional volleying skills and graceful movement.
The Swede’s fluid footwork and one-handed backhand, particularly his deadly slice, allowed him to transition seamlessly from defence to attack, helping him win 41 tour-level singles titles, including six majors.
Edberg’s game caused problems for his biggest rival Becker. The Swede faced the German in three consecutive Wimbledon finals from 1988 to 1990, winning in '88 and '90. Becker held a 25-10 Lexus ATP Head2Head series overall but those matches on Tour were ones Edberg relished.
“My biggest rivalry was with Boris Becker. Obviously playing three Wimbledon finals and that’s what people remember the most,” Edberg said. “But there was a little rivalry with Mats Wilander, being from the same country and pushing each other. And there was a little sort of rivalry with Courier at one stage as well and those are very important in tennis. If you go back in history, you can find a lot of rivalries and that makes it super exciting.”

Edberg held the World No. 1 ranking for a total of 72 weeks across five separate reigns, with his final stint ending in October 1992. Now, 19 years after retiring, the 18-time tour-level doubles champion reflects with pride on his achievements at the pinnacle of men’s tennis.
“Being No. 1 is something so special” Edberg said. “Just talking to your kids, telling them you have been the No. 1 tennis player in the world. It is quite an achievement for anyone in any sport to be No. 1, because there is only one.”

British tennis star Emma Raducanu says she struggled to breathe and “couldn’t see the ball through tears” when her match last month was paused at the Dubai Tennis Championships while security led a ""fixated"" man out of the crowd.

Raducanu, 22, told reporters this week that she could “barely breathe” when the umpire halted the match in order for security to escort the man out of the arena. Raducanu eventually lost the second-round match to Karolina Muchova in back-to-back sets after the umpire resumed the contest.

“I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told reporters in Indian Wells, Calif., this week, according to the Associated Press. The 2021 U.S. Open Winner will return to tennis at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells this week, her first since the incident in Dubai last month.

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.' I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears,” Raducanu said, according to the AP. “I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather here.’ “

Raducanu said she “did break down in tears” after the match, “but not necessarily because I lost.”“It was a very emotional time,” she added.

ESPN reported that Raducanu had been approached by the man twice off the court during her time in Dubai leading up to the match. Raducanu told reporters that the man had been at her matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in the weeks prior, as well.

The man was detained by Dubai police following the incident, who reported that the man also left her a note and took her picture in addition to following her at her matches, the AP reported last month.

“There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here,” Raducanu said this week, noting that she feels “a lot better” after a few weeks away.

Raducanu has dealt with stalkers before, receiving a restraining order against a fan in 2022 who came to her home three times, according to the AP.

“Thank you for the messages of support,” she wrote on Instagram last month following the most recent incident. “Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be okay and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match.”

Tennis

The way phenomenal and accomplished athletes’ minds work can often catch regular folks off-guard. How is it that a tennis player like Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1, would ever get to a place where she might question her ability?

It happens all the time, even with the all-time greats — a subset of the tennis species that Patrick Mouratoglou, the longtime coach and tennis media impresario, has spent most of his career studying. He coached the best of the best, Serena Williams, at the scene of so many of her greatest triumphs.

In September 2024, three-quarters of the way through her comeback season after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, Osaka hired Mouratogou to replace Wim Fissette. Osaka had reunited with Fissette (who coached her between 2019 and 2022) the previous summer, to prepare for her return to competitive tennis last January. At first, she was magnanimous about the relationship between improvement and outcome. When she came within a point of beating Iga Swiatek at last year’s French Open, Osaka wasn’t down: “Obviously the results aren’t resulting right now, but I think I’m growing every tournament,” she said in her news conference.

When the results still didn’t result, Osaka found herself again struggling with her confidence and decided to move away from the coach with whom she won two of those four Grand Slam titles.

Osaka, 27, hasn’t won a title of any kind with Mouratoglou yet, but she has come awfully close. She had to retire with an abdominal injury when she was up a set against Clara Tauson in the final of the Auckland Classic in New Zealand in January and she has played her best tennis since becoming a mother in the past five months, when her body has allowed her to do so.

“I just had to believe in myself a lot more,” Osaka said at the Australian Open after her second-round win over Karolina Muchova, one of the world’s most gifted players, who had eased past Osaka at the same stage of the U.S. Open four months prior. There in Melbourne, Osaka was talking about coming back to win the last two sets after losing the first 6-1, but she could have been talking about how, when healthy, she has rediscovered her swagger and her ability to take the racket out of her opponents’ hands.

That is not an accident.

In an interview in February from Los Angeles, where he and Osaka prepared for her comeback from that abdominal injury, Mouratoglou said they have been working on confronting those moments when she feels her belief slipping and on figuring out ways to overcome them.

“You earn confidence with what you do every day in practice,” Mouratoglou said.

After two weeks of hard training, Osaka will try to bring that swagger to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, Calif., this week.

In the interview, Mouratoglou, 54, said he expects nothing less from Osaka, a player he says comes to the court every day with an open mind and a hunger to try anything to get better.

All the great ones do.

This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

GO DEEPER

Naomi Osaka and the gravity of a superstar at the U.S. Open

How is her injury feeling?

She has no pain anymore. We have been serving, but slowly and progressively. She’s done the work to try to make sure she does not get hurt again.

What is it like to work with players at her level? How does she compare with Serena Williams?

I don’t compare anyone to Serena. It is very exciting, because of her potential. She has the potential to win very many more Slams. Her motivation is very high. Tennis is a big priority and she is prepared to come back all the way.

How do you know if you are a good fit with her? 

I don’t know if it’s a good fit — all the players are different, and as a coach you need to adapt.

Is it any different when you are coaching a superstar rather than some of the players you have worked with who are not at that level?

It’s very important when you work with a superstar that you do the same as if the player is not a superstar. You need to talk to a person in a normal way, like she is a normal player. When they achieve so much they have certainties about what they do, but they have to be open enough to learn and continue to grow. That’s where Naomi is. She really wants to improve. She’s really taking the advice, and giving 100 percent. She is not scared. That’s the champion’s mindset.

It’s interesting you say that. I would have thought people who have won so much in the past think they know how to do it again. 

They are champions because they are doing what it takes to improve; their ability to trust the person working with them to tell them what to do and what it takes. That makes them champions.

Rafa (Nadal) and Novak (Djokovic), they went through so many technical changes. They see the sport as a race. Everybody is improving. That is how Serena was seeing the world. If you’re happy with what you have and don’t try new things, you will be overtaken by others. The progress comes from seeing which areas you can get better with.

Why is Osaka better now than she was last year?

Her confidence is much higher. This comes from what she has done at practice. She’s practising extremely well. She pushes herself. Her game has gained in consistency. A player has to be aware of how she is feeling, even if she feels she is losing confidence. Before, she didn’t express it to herself. Most of the matches, she lost because she stopped believing and this is not allowed.

We do practice matches. She is aware of what she is feeling. We talk about it. We work on it in the moment. It’s fine to have that feeling, it’s natural — there is no shame in being nervous. We just have to be aware of it. It can affect you but it can’t affect you too much — Novak gets super-nervous or angry, but the most important thing is the ability to come back very fast. Otherwise, you are losing points and points and points. You have the right to become nervous and lose confidence, but not too much and not for too long.

You don’t talk much during matches other than small messages of encouragement. Why?

There is not so much to say, unless I see she is not following the plan one way or another. The match, we prepare it before. The only thing I can do is to support her.

In the Muchova match in Melbourne, Muchova was playing great and Naomi was struggling to get to her level. I’ve seen that in the past year. I found out that when she was in trouble, her confidence level would drop a lot and the game was affected.

Her first tournament in China, she had lost 20 matches in a row when she had lost the first set. This time, she didn’t let what was happening on the court play with her mind.  It’s impossible not to be affected by the score. They need to be affected by the score. How much it affects you and does it affect you in a way that can harm you is the question. You want to be affected but stay under control. Keep believing in what you are doing.

Advertisement

Is that what she did against Muchova? 

She stayed mentally there. You don’t go away. Nobody plays perfectly from the first point to the last.

When you coached Serena, you went up against Osaka. Did you share your old game plans with her?

No. You don’t want to reinforce the spots that are weaker. I also don’t think you win by improving your mistakes so much. You prepare solutions, and you make your strong points better. If someone has a good game plan to beat Jannik Sinner, I would like to see it. Players at that level, you have to catch them on a certain day when there are weak spots.

I want my players to know how to turn their strengths into weapons: ‘What is my player’s game style and how do they win points?’.

So what are Osaka’s strengths at this point that should be her weapons?

When she is at the top of the game, she plays faster than anyone. She makes it very difficult to organize a point against her. She comes back to you with the ball in such a short time. When the ball touches the racket, it goes so fast to the other side of the net, and she can be very accurate with hitting her spots.

She also has big room for improvement. She can return better, be more aggressive on the second serve, take time away from the opponent better. The good thing is that she is extremely open to new ideas. I told her what I thought when I arrived and she told me she was very excited to get to work because she believed she was going to learn new things.

Is that what the best ones tell you?

Absolutely. They forget what they have achieved one minute after they achieve it. Serena finishes 2012 winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and the Olympics and the WTA Tour Finals. She’s walking off the court and tells me to come up with a plan for her to win the French Open. She says, “I’ve been chasing it for 10 years. I want to win Roland Garros, make a plan for me to win it.” (Williams won the 2013 French Open.)

Advertisement

The past is the past. It’s important not to look at the past. ‘Let’s move on. Always focus on the journey, where we want to go’. That’s Naomi right now. She’s very ambitious. She believes her story is still to be written. That’s important, because when you hold a trophy it only lasts a few minutes. You have to be excited about what’s next.

What has changed about tennis in recent years?

In general, the fitness level has improved a lot. It’s easy to explain. All of the top players travel with a fitness coach and physiotherapist. It was not true before. The movement of the players is so much better. On the women’s side, (Aryna) Sabalenka, for her height, is moving so well. And then Iga (Swiatek) and Coco (Gauff).

(Carlos) Alcaraz, Sinner, it’s crazy how they move on the court. Even someone like Tomas Machac. So it’s harder to hit winners, to get the ball through the court. If Naomi keeps evolving as she is, she will be able to hit as many winners again.

Naomi said she didn’t know if you would actually be a good coach, because you had coached Serena and she wondered whether Serena even needed coaching. Others sometimes question how much impact you have when you are coaching these all-time greats? How does that affect you? 

People who say that don’t know what they are talking about. If I coach Naomi and she doesn’t do something well, I’m going to hear about it. I take no special pride in coaching champions. For me, if I don’t bring her to her top level, I didn’t do a good job.

Western Kentucky senior Sofia Blanco was named the Conference USA Women’s Tennis Athlete of the Week, and Blanco and Rachel Hermanova were named the CUSA Women’s Tennis Doubles Team of the Week, the conference announced Wednesday.

“Very happy to see Sofia get Athlete of the Week, and Sofia and Rachel get Doubles Team of the Week in Conference USA,” WKU coach Greg Davis said in a news release. “I think it’s historic for the program. We’re very proud of their accomplishments, not just last week but throughout their career.”

The two helped the Lady Toppers to three wins last weekend. WKU defeated Eastern Illinois 7-0 on Friday, and followed with a 4-1 victory over CUSA foe Jacksonville State in the first match of a doubleheader on Sunday and a 7-0 victory over Southern Illinois in the second match on Sunday.

Blanco went 4-0 in her singles matches last week, playing in the No. 1 and 2 positions during that time, and she has now won her last six matches to sit at 10-2 this spring. Blanco claimed a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Samford’s Margaret Jaraczewski on Wednesday from the No. 2 position, and followed with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Eastern Illinois’ Ornella Lomenzo at the No. 2 position on Friday, a 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 win over Jax State’s Lea Erenda from the No. 2 position on WKU’s first match on Sunday and a 6-2, 6-1 win over Southern Indiana’s Anais Negrail from the No. 1 position on Sunday in the second match of the team’s doubleheader. She now has 50 career singles wins, which ranks second in program history.

Blanco and Hermanova went 3-1 last week together in doubles play. The two defeated Eastern Illinois’ Luisa Renovales-Salazar/Charleigh Fay 6-0 on Friday, and followed by defeating Jax State’s Irene Artigas/Aneka Patel 6-3 in their first match on Sunday and Southern Indiana’s Anais Negrail/Madison Windham 6-0 in their second match on Sunday. Blanco and Hermanova were ranked 85th nationally at the time, and their ranking was the first ITA spring doubles ranking in program history. Blanco is now at 45 career doubles wins, which ranks second in program history, and Hermanova now has 23 career doubles wins, which ranks 12th in program history.

It marks the second and third weekly awards the Lady Toppers have won this season. Sophomores Emily Schut and Mia Miranda were named the CUSA Women’s Tennis Doubles Team of the Week on Jan. 29. The three weekly awards and the most the Lady Toppers have won in a single season since joining CUSA, and it is only the second time the program has claimed multiple weekly awards in a single season. WKU has claimed eight CUSA weekly awards under Davis.

The Lady Toppers are 9-4 this season, with wins in their last three matches. WKU is scheduled to host FIU on Friday at 12:30 p.m. at the Warren County Tennis Facility at Michael O. Buchanon Park.","{'href': 'https://bgdailynews.com', 'title': 'Bowling Green Daily News'}"

Match Recap: Men's Tennis | 3/4/2025 9:16:00 PM 

vs. Loyola University Maryland

3/5/2025 | 11:30 A.M.

ORLANDO, Fla. – North Carolina A&T and Howard University men's tennis teams engaged in an old-fashioned HBCU showdown on Tuesday, with the Aggies prevailing with an exciting 4-3 win over the Bison at the United States Tennis Association's (USTA) Oak Street facility.

Later in the day, the Aggies improved to 7-0 overall with a 7-0 win over Concordia College (Minn.) at the USTA National Main Campus. Sophomore Kaua Santos clinched the win for the Aggies over Howard with a thrilling 7-6, 6-2 victory over Marcel Dawson at No. 3 singles.

It marked the first time in his career that he had been the clincher in a 3-3 contest.

""I played with so much fire,"" said Santos. ""The Bison was trying to put me down, but my energy was higher than his.""

In the first set, Santos trailed Dawson 6-5 and 40-15 within the game before unleashing a furious rally. He not only came back to win the game to even things at 6-6, but he was also down 6-2 in the tiebreaker before producing the clincher.

""I gave all the energy that I had, and I fought my way back to bring home the match for the Aggies,"" said Santos.

Howard gave the Aggies fits even beyond the Santos singles match. For the first time this season, the Aggies lost a doubles match and the doubles point. In fact, the Bison won all three doubles matches, starting with a win at No. 1 doubles as the Howard duo of Dawson and Michael Major, Jr. defeated Said Akbarov and Ian Pedersen, 6-1.

Freshman Jindrich and sophomore Lucas Coupo-Moison lost to the Howard team of Daniel Dunac and Kaosie Kwokedi 7-5 at No. 2 doubles. Despite a furious comeback from junior Mathieu Dussaubat and Santos, Howard completed the sweep with a super competitive 7-6, 7-4 in the tiebreaker win by Kendrick Lash and Hassimiyou Dieng.

But Brill evened the match 1-1 with a win at No. 5 singles. Brill defeated Dieng 6-0, 6-4 to improve to 6-0 at the time. Brill said he and Coupo-Moison did not play as well as they usually do, but in the singles match, his serve pulled him through and helped him take care of business. Dussaubat gave the Aggies a 2-1 lead with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Dunac at No. 6 singles.   

""I tried to make my opponent move all over the court and make him tired. That worked,"" said Dussaubat. I'm really proud of the team's performance and energy.""

In A&T's first three-setter of the season, Akbarov defeated Lash 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 at No. 4 singles, putting A&T on the brink of victory. But Pedersen lost to Major 6-4, 6-2 at No. 1 singles, and Coupo-Moison lost to Kwokedi 6-2, 7-5, setting up Santos' clincher.

The Aggies returned to their dominance later in the day against the Cobbers. A&T claimed the doubles with a sweep, starting with Santos and Dussaubat improving to 6-1 on the season with a 6-0 win over Kai Pierce and Daniel Skrade at No. 3 doubles. Coupo-Moison and Brill won at No. 2 doubles, 6-2, over Kai Kringlie and Logan Sandberg. Akbarov and Pedersen finished things off with a 6-3 win over Ryoga Yano and Isaac Maddock at No. 1 doubles.

In singles play, Akbarov remained undefeated at 7-0 with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Pierce at No. 4 singles. Brill is also unbeaten at 7-0 after his 6-2, 6-1 victory over Kringlie at No. 5 singles. Santos is 7-0 after his 6-0, 6-1 win over Sandberg at No. 3 that gave the Aggies a 4-0 lead. Pedersen returned to the win column with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Yano.

""At the end, I had mixed feelings because I wasn't satisfied with my level, but I also was happy because, as a team, we won an important match,"" Pedersen said about the Howard match before discussing the Concordia matchup. ""I was trying to work on what I did badly in the last match and in previous matches,"" Pedersen added.

Dussaubat defeated Hunter Rice at No. 6 singles 6-2, 6-0 and Coupo-Moison defeated Maddock 6-3, 6-3. The Aggies return to play on Wednesday morning with an 11:30 matchup against Loyola University Maryland.

FARMINGTON, Utah - Portland State senior Nika Beukers has been named the Big Sky Women's Tennis Player of the Week, the conference announced Wednesday.

Beukers, a native of Den Bosch, Netherlands, delivered a perfect start to the Vikings' Big Sky slate, going 4-0 at the No. 1 spot to lead PSU to wins over Weber State and Idaho State.

The duo carried that momentum into Monday, securing a 6-0 doubles win before Beukers capped the weekend with a 6-3, 6-4 singles victory over Idaho State's Stefanya Shalakhova.

Additionally, with her back-to-back doubles victories, Beukers surpassed former teammate Capu Sanoner's program record for Big Sky doubles wins in a career, achieving a new program record of 22 wins.

AUBURN, Ala. – Auburn will make its Texas swing this week, facing No. 15 Texas A&M on Thursday evening at 6 p.m. CT and No. 4 Texas on Saturday at 1 p.m. CT.. The Tigers will enter Thursday’s match winners of three straight matches.

“It’s been a short week with one practice in Auburn before hitting the road on Wednesday so making sure we’re well rested is first and foremost in my mind,” said Auburn head coach Bobby Reynolds. “We have to make sure they’re well rested physically and mentally to be ready for a tough Thursday night in College Station.”

Auburn bounced back from dropping its first two conference matches of the season by defeating No. 32 Vanderbilt on Friday and No. 59 Georgia on Sunday to even its SEC record at 2-2. The team also defeated Tennessee State on Sunday evening and the three wins moved Auburn up 13 spots in the latest ITA National Team Rankings No. 32.

Auburn redshirt sophomore Nicholas Heng was instrumental in helping the Tigers earn the three victories. On Friday, Heng and doubles partner Thomas Kennedy picked up a crucial break late in the match that led to a 6-2 win that clinched the doubles point for Auburn. In singles, Heng won a tight first set then cruised through the second set to defeat Callum Markowitz 7-5, 6-0 to give Auburn a 3-1 advantage in the match.

On Sunday, Georgia’s Gabriele Vulpitta defeated Heng in the first set before Heng dominated the second set 6-1. With the final set tied at two, the Auburn redshirt sophomore earned two breaks and held to 15 in the final game to win the match 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 and clinch the team win for the Tigers.

Texas A&M will enter Thursday’s matchup with an 8-5 overall record and a 2-1 record in the SEC. The Aggies posted wins over LSU and Oklahoma and were defeated by Arkansas. Aggie freshman Theo Papamalamis has had a great spring since beginning his college career in January.

Papamalamis holds a 5-4 singles record at the No. 1 singles position as well as a 4-1 record at the top doubles position with partner Togan Tokac. Papamalamis is ranked No. 38 in singles while he and Tokac are ranked No. 52 in doubles.

“Courts in College Station are quick and the fans are tough,” Reynolds said about Thursday’s match. “Their team is very talented, but they also just came off a loss against Arkansas so very vulnerable too. I’m going to continue to preach the importance of competing without giving free errors. Keeping depth on ball, waiting for short balls, being aggressive and not outplaying ourselves. That will allow us to compete from start to finish.”

In its first season in the league, Texas is the only team that still holds an undefeated SEC record at 3-0. The Longhorns are 12-2 overall this season and a perfect 9-0 at home. Texas impressed early in the season by taking down defending national champion and then-No. 1 TCU before picking up wins over No. 14 Texas A&M and No. 5 Virginia at the ITA National Team Indoor Championship.

Texas has five players featured in the latest ITA National Singles Rankings including No. 7 Timo Legout and No. 13 Sebastian Gorzny. Legout has had a great season in singles for the Longhorns, posting a 22-2 overall record and a 9-1 record in dual matches. He has recorded 14 wins over ranked opponents and reached the finals of the NCAA Singles Championship in November.

The Longhorns also have two ranked doubles pairings highlighted by No. 10 Legout and Lucas Brown.

Auburn will face Texas A&M under the lights at 6 p.m. CT at the Michell Tennis Center on Thursday in College Station before traveling to play Texas at 1 p.m. on Sunday afternoon at the Texas Tennis Center in Austin. Live video and live scoring of Thursday’s match will be available online at 12thman.com while live video and live scoring of Sunday's match will be available online at TexasLonghorns.com.","{'href': 'https://auburntigers.com', 'title': 'Auburn Tigers Official Athletic Site'}"

March 5 (UPI) -- Emma Raducanu spoke publicly for the first time about being followed by a fixated fan, telling reporters that she could barely see the ball during a tennis match after spotting the ""middle-aged creep"" in Dubai.

Raducanu made the comments to a group of reporters Tuesday at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., her first tournament since the Feb. 18 Dubai Tennis Championships incident.
""I'm here because I feel a lot better now,"" Raducanu said. ""A lot happened obviously after Dubai, so I just needed to kind of take my time after.
""I think the allure of Indian Wells being my favorite tournament, I just couldn't really step away from it.""

Raducanu also was targeted by a stalker, who traveled to her home, in 2021. That man was charged in 2022.
The 22-year-old British tennis star was first approached by the man in Dubai on Feb. 17. She spotted the same man in the first few rows of seats during a Round of 16 match against Karolina Muchova the next day at Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium.
Raducanu, who lost the match 7-6 (8), 6-4, was brought to tears early on in the match after spotting the man. She briefly stood behind the umpire's chair as security removed the man from the stadium. Play eventually resumed, but Raducanu was obviously rattled.

""I literally couldn't see the ball through the tears, I could barely breathe,"" Raducanu said. ""I was playing Karolina, who's like top 17 in the world or something, and I can't see the ball. Then the first four games kind of ran away from me because I was not on the court, to be honest.
""I'm not really sure how I regrouped.""
The WTA later said the man ""who exhibited fixated behavior"" was ejected and ""banned from all WTA events,"" pending a threat assessment.
Dubai Police went on to detain the man, but said Raducanu chose to drop charges against him.
The 2021 U.S. Open women's singles champion said she decided last Wednesday to compete at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
""There's a part of you that thinks, 'I'm not gonna let a middle-aged creep stop me doing what I love to do,'"" Raducanu said.
Raducanu, the No. 55 player in the WTA singles rankings, will take on No. 52 Moyuka Uchijima of Japan in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday in Indian Wells.

Port Aransas High School tennis players didn’t have an easy time at the Tuloso-Midway Varsity Tournament on Friday, Feb. 28. “This was a very tough tournament, with teams from all over Texas,” said Kayla Sheffield, coach of PAHS tennis. “We will keep working hard to improve and will continue to excel in tennis.” Boys’ doubles Samuel Campbell and Christian Janosky […]

Women's tennis star and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu spoke openly about an incident at last month's Dubai Tennis Championships, when she had to stop playing after discovering a man who had been stalking her was in the crowd. Raducanu will return to competition at Indian Wells, where she will have enhanced security for her personal safety.

During Raducanu's second-round match at Dubai, an unexplained stoppage  occurred when Raducanu approached the umpire's chair after the second  game, saying a few words before standing in the space between the back  of the official's chair and barrier netting adjacent to Court 2. Raducanu became distressed due to the presence of a man who had been exhibiting ""fixated behavior"" toward her in the first few rows of the stands. The man approached her twice in public in Dubai and was also present at her matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha  in weeks prior.

The man was ejected from the match and detained by Dubai police. Though Raducanu elected to drop charges against him, the individual in question has been banned from all WTA tournaments.

""I was obviously very distraught,"" Raducanu told reporters in Indian Wells. ""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, 'I don't know how I'm going to finish.'  I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, 'I need to just take a breather.'""

Unfortunately, this is not the first time Raducanu has dealt with stalkers. As a teenager, Raducanu was stalked at her family home in London by a 35-year-old man who was later arrested and had a five-year restraining order issued against him. After this latest incident, Raducanu took a week off from tennis, explaining she had been going through an ""emotional time"" and now feels much better.

Raducanu, who eventually lost her match in Dubai 7-6 (6), 6-4, is set to play Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in the first round at Indian Wells. A victory would advance her to a match against third-seeded Coco Gauff.

The Mary Persons boys and girls tennis teams are coming off region championships last year, and are showing signs of competing for one again. While head coach Trey Bernard’s Net Dogs lost 5 seniors, 4 of them boys, the boys are off to a 3-0 start and the girls 3-1. MP continues building a strong tennis program despite the tougher competition. 

Bernard concedes that it will be more difficult in the new 9-team Region 2-AAA, much tougher than the 5-team conference from last year.

The good news is that the region tournament will be held at the John Drew Center in Macon. Since MP is the closest school to John Drew, it’ll be like hosting.

Another change for the new season: the region had adopted no-ad scoring, so you can win games by just 1 point rather than the traditional 2. The objective was to speed up games so students could get home earlier. Bernard said he voted against the move, as ad points are one of the more exciting parts of tennis, leading to very competitive games. But he was outvoted by region coaches.

Most recently, on Tuesday, Feb. 25, the gentlemen won 5-0 over the hardy Troup County Tigers, while the ladies defeated the Lady Tigers 4-1 in LaGrange.

Winners for the boys included 1 Singles Ben Morris, who defeated Daniel Kang 6-4, 6-1 in a well contested match. Morris ended up forcing more errors on Kang than he could produce winners and won a battle of attrition. 2 Singles Tyler Dowdy earned Player of the Match honors for the gentlemen with a 6-1, 5-7, 7-5 marathon match that lasted over 2 hours against Jinhu Lim of Troup, who featured two forehands to counteract the aggressive attacks from Dowdy and produced a classic early season match. Dowdy exhibited all of the DOGS characteristics (Determination, Optimism, Growth Mindset, and Sportsmanship) as he willed himself to victory. Aiden Spence brought the thunder at 3 Singles with a 6-3, 6-3 defeat of Troup County’s Ryan Choi. Spence remained patient and picked his spots carefully to attack to disrupt Choi’s rhythm.

The 1 Doubles team of Chris Simpson and Reid Hilton defeated Noah Webb and Garner Little of Troup County 6-0, 6-2. Hilton and Simpson exemplified teamwork as they communicated well, kept the ball away from their opponents, and finished shots emphatically. 2 Doubles Braxton House and John Rainey channeled their energies into a great match against Sergio Martinez and Turtle Cheely-Vines—winning 6-0, 6-2. House and Rainey have grown together as a team and gave Troup all they could handle.

Ladies were almost equally dominant, with the only blemish coming at the 1 Singles position. Barnes recovered nicely from dropping her first set 4-6 to defeat Troup County’s Emma Cook 6-1, 6-2 in the final two sets of 2 Singles, earning Player of the Match honors. Clay won at 3 Singles against Cat Starr of Troup 6-0, 6-3. Clay has done a lot of work to get herself into a good position to dominate. Movement has improved and she does a wonderful job with shot selection and putting the ball away.

For doubles, Hickman and Bass dispatched their counterparts Zoe Graham and Gracie Baker 6-2, 6-0 in the 1 Slot. Being aggressive and improving shot placement has given them dominant performances. Berlin and Fleckenstein also proved unstoppable at 2 Doubles, knocking off Addie Hyde and Lilli Norton 6-1, 6-0.

Millie Meadows played for almost 2 hours, but was unable to defeat her opponent LM Hart, falling 5-7, 3-6 in a battle of the baseline and drop shots. Meadows had many great rallies, but came up just a bit short in finishing the drill. 

On Monday, Feb. 24, the girls beat the St. George’s Dragons at the Dog Pound in Forsyth, defending their home turf with a 5-0 sweep. Winners for the ladies included Millie Meadows, who was player of the match, earning a hard fought 6-4, 6-2 victory. Millie overcame some first set jitters to adjust and defeat her 1 Singles counterpart from St. George’s. Rebekah Barnes followed Meadows’ performance with a 6-0, 6-1 win. Barnes controlled the baseline and was able to dispatch her opponent. Sarah Clay anchored the team at the 3 Singles position with a double bagel score (6-0, 6-0). Clay kept her opponent guessing, moving the ball around and hitting her spots.

For doubles, Ava Bass and Izzy Hickman easily won 6-0, 6-1. They did a wonderful job finishing points and not allowing their opponents to get comfortable on the court. Brooklyn Fleckenstein and Marlee Berlin got a default victory against shorthanded St. George’s. 

On Thursday, Feb. 13, MP Tennis went to Peachtree City to beat the Fayette County Tigers for their first match and first region match of the season. The ladies and gentlemen swept the Tigers 5-0 on both sides.

Sophomore Ben Morris started off at 1 Singles and earned the Player of the Week honors for the gentlemen with a gritty 6-1, 7-6(3) victory over Parma Raina of the Fayette County squad. Morris eased through his 1st set, but had to come back from being down 2-5 to secure the win in the tiebreaker.

Junior Tyler Dowdy made his first start at 2 Singles and defeated Noah Kell 6-4, 7-5 to round out the matches for the gentlemen. Dowdy overcame early jitters to finish a strong showing for the gentlemen.

Junior Aiden Spence (3 Singles), and doubles teams Chris Simpson/Reid Hilton and Braxton House/John Rainey, all juniors, won by forfeit. 

The MP Ladies played all five lines and only allowed Fayette County to win one game across five lines. Junior Millie Meadows, in her 2nd season at 1 Singles, defeated Fayette’s Thya Kemp 6-0, 6-0. Junior Rebekah Barnes beat Kayori Moore of Fayette 6-0, 6-0, and sophomore Sarah Clay also hung 2 bagels on Fayette’s Oyin Balogun. Senior Ava Bass and sophomore Izzy Hickman defeated Olivia Harris and Elianny Montano 6-1, 6-0, and the team of junior Brooklyn Fleckenstein and sophomore Marlee Berlin beat Laria Powell and Kerri Carter 6-0, 6-0 in their first action together this season.

On Friday, Feb. 21, MP Tennis traveled to Gray to take on the Greyhounds of Jones County. The gentlemen held on for a 3-2 victory, while the ladies suffered their first loss of the season in a narrow 3-2 defeat. Playing Pro 8 sets poses a different challenge than sets, but the no-ad feature that has been inserted into GHSA rules for playoffs can alter strategies, as well.

Winners for the gentlemen began with 1 Singles Ben Morris earning his second victory of the season, a 8-4 victory over JC’s Sid Giles. Morris defended the court beautifully as he focused on neutralizing his opponent’s serve and putting away points. 

Tyler Dowdy suffered his first defeat of the season with a 5-8 loss against Jones’s Matthew O’Neal. Dowdy fought valiantly, but could not overcome a strong serve and return game from O’Neal.

The rest of the gentlemen officially got onto the courts for the first time this season, with Aiden Spence securing a 9-7 victory at 3 Singles over JC’s Kalyb Durden. Spence surged ahead to a 6-3 lead, but had to pull out some great patience and shots to preserve the win for the Bulldogs.

After falling behind 0-3 to JC’s Wesley Maynard and Landon Lagroon, the 1 Doubles team of Reid Hilton and Chris Simpson stormed back to earn a hard fought 9-7 victory over the Greyhounds’ 1 Doubles team. Communication, timely returns, and well-placed winners propelled MP to a victory at the first line of doubles.

Braxton House and Ben Harrell rounded out the gentlemen’s slate with a 4-8 loss to JC’s Evan Randall and Drew Holder. Despite some great shots from the junior and the freshman, they were unable to carry that momentum throughout the match.

The ladies, despite their best efforts, fell 3-2 against the Lady Greyhounds. At 1 Singles, Millie Meadows fell behind early and tried to mount a comeback late, but lost 2-8 to Lyndsie Hanner. Meadows searched for the right combination to unlock the game of Hanner, but ran out of time to pick the lock in the shortened Pro 8 format.

Sarah Clay stepped up to the 2 Singles position to assist as Rebekah Barnes attended a FFA competition and defeated Chloe Scarborough 8-3 with a variety of shots that kept Scarborough moving all over the court. 

Freshman Emma Kinnebrew made her high school debut at 3 Singles, but fell to JC’s Mallory Herdon 3-8 on the unique singles court at Jones County High. Kinnebrew had some great returns and stayed competitive throughout.

1 Doubles team of Ava Bass and Izzy Hickman handily earned an 8-1 victory over Macie Milholen and Emily Parks from Jones County. Bass and Hickman have blossomed in the 1 Doubles slot and seek to continue their success that Bass and her former partner Katherine Clay, who graduated at the end of last season, maintained throughout their time together.

2 Doubles was a seesaw affair, as Brooklyn Fleckenstein and Marlee Berlin fell behind early in their Pro 8 set, fought back to even the affair, but eventually lost 6-8 to Nahlia Richardson and Ailey Hayman of Jones County. 

Coach Trey Bernard said about his team after their first two matches:

“Securing an early region win is always a great accomplishment, but the true value lies in facing tough competition. It provides our players with the opportunity to identify areas for improvement and learn how to respond in various situations on the tennis court. This year, we have a young yet highly coachable team, and I am confident that their experiences—both on and off the court—will greatly influence our journey throughout the season. I am incredibly proud of each of our student-athletes for their achievements thus far, and I eagerly anticipate watching them strive for their highest potential.

During our match against Jones County, we faced some challenges as a couple of our starters had prior commitments that forced them to miss the match. However, the ‘next person up’ mentality was clearly demonstrated as we seamlessly integrated new athletes into the starting lineup. Their resilience and teamwork were commendable, and I look forward to seeing how they continue to grow together.”

Bernard thanked his coaching staff, including assistant coach Ashley Ellison, and MCMS coaches Jess Stephens and Jason Williams, and lay coach Mike Berlin.

MP will host region foe LaGrange on Tuesday, March 4. Results for this match-up and Thursday, March 6, against Upson-Lee will be in next week’s edition.

At First Major Rally of the Semester, HOOP Protests Israeli Tanks in West Bank

In a weekend that featured dominant victories over Memphis and Quinnipiac, a packed Murr Center witnessed a three hour battle on Sunday afternoon as No. 11 Harvard fought past a talented and unrelenting No. 36 Middle Tennessee State squad, 4-2.

Featuring four intense three-set singles matches and a heroic effort from junior Melchior Delloye, razor-thin margins on deuce points ultimately propelled the Crimson to victory. The showdown between the perennial NCAA tournament contenders solidified the team’s standing as a force to be reckoned with as the outdoor season approaches.

Opening doubles action, junior Masato Perera and freshman Benjamin Privara, the 18th-ranked team in the nation, quickly struck first with a break of serve. However, their advantage wouldn’t last long as the Blue Raiders’ consistency and lack of unforced errors quickly gave their opponents a decisive 6-2 victory.

Just as the court one match was wrapping up, seniors Daniel Milavsky and David Lins — who jumped out to a lead with an early break of their own — held serve the entire set, securing a 6-4 victory.

As the Crimson evened up the tally at one, all eyes darted towards the third court, where things stood even at 4-4 between the junior tandem of Delloye and Valdemar Pape and Middle Tennessee’s Rostislav Halfinger and Shu Matsuoka.

Battling from a break down, the juniors overcame several unforced errors to score a break of their own. Returning serve at four games apiece, Pape blistered a down-the-line backhand past the net player, giving Harvard a 15-0 advantage as the crowd erupted. A string of high quality points featuring a balanced attack earned the Crimson a break, putting the match — and doubles point — on Pape’s racquet.

“We're two tall guys who have great serves,” said Delloye. “There's no reason why we can't  provide the goods in the tight moments.”

In his service game, Pape didn’t miss a beat. At 15 all, the Dane dialed up a flat ace down the T, inching the team towards the finish line. Two more unreturnable serves gave Harvard the edge it needed to secure the doubles point — its 11th on the season — as play shifted to singles.

In the second hour of the contest, things looked good for the Crimson as it won the first set of singles on courts one, two, four, and six.

Freshman Mitchell Lee, stepping into the court and dictating points with his inside-out and inside-in forehands, extended the lead to 2-0 as he closed out his match 6-2, 6-3.

Similarly, Milavsky pushed his opponent over with strong, overpowering forehands and a smooth touch at the net. The 21st-ranked singles player in the nation put Harvard just one point away from victory with a 7-6(6), 6-3 victory.

“He’s been an amazing senior captain,” said Head Coach Andrew Rueb ’95. “His maturity, his composure. I mean, he's really one of the top players in all of college tennis.”

The four remaining courts featured tight matches in which the players split the first two sets. All the Crimson needed was one domino to fall to secure its weekend sweep.

On court three, after battling back from behind a set, sophomore Rohan Murali fell victim to a controversial line call in the opening game, ultimately falling behind a break and dropping the set, narrowing the gap to 3-1. Similarly, the speedy Perera fell behind early in his deciding set and was unable to recover, falling to Matsuoka.

With the score standing at 3-2 in Harvard’s favor, Delloye and Pape found themselves in a similar situation: fighting to clinch the deciding point. As Pape started to fall behind in the third set, the coaches, fans, and players alike started to focus in on Delloye’s court, where the match would likely be decided.

“It was definitely a physical match, especially in the third set. We stepped up our game at the same time. In the first and second set, we were both serving well and coming to net and playing more attacking tennis,” said Delloye.

In back-and-forth rallies that often eclipsed 20 shots, Delloye utilized his precise down the line backhands to facilitate opportunities to be aggressive and approach the net. Controlling these points, he was able to hold serve throughout the set.

“We both were matching each other. So I just wanted to be a little bit more aggressive and hit a little bit harder, and commit to my game a little bit more than him,” added Delloye.

At 5-3 in the third, Delloye served for the match in comfortable form. The energized team cheered in celebration after every point that ended in the junior’s favor. Finally, as he clinched the match, the Murr Center’s dedicated fans gave the star of the match a long ovation.

The victory should provide confidence for the team as it prepares for its spring break swing in Southern California.

“You got to bring your A game, otherwise people will take it from you,” said Rueb. “Melchior’s finish there was spectacular.”

Now, the team shifts its focus to the outdoor tennis season and starts a road trip that includes a challenge against No. 7 University of San Diego.

HINSDALE, IL – The project to add two paddle tennis courts to Hinsdale's Katherine Legge Memorial Park is expected to start this spring. 

The Hinsdale Platform Tennis Association plans to build two courts, in addition to its six current ones at the park. The group said the sport is becoming increasingly popular. 

At Tuesday's Hinsdale Village Board meeting, trustees reviewed a proposed agreement with the association on the two new courts at the village park. 

The trustees, who are set to vote on the pact later this month, had no objections to it. 

The association's Kevin Parks asked village officials to waive the group's building permit fee. 

In response, Village President Tom Cauley said Hinsdale could waive the part related to the village's in-house costs because of the project's community benefit. 

But the village would have to charge for the part involving out-of-pocket payments to third parties, he said.

Parks agreed.

""That's our understanding as well,"" he said. 

With new technology, the planned courts will have lighting that is more efficient than the existing equipment and produces less glare, according to the association.

The group also has two paddle tennis courts at Burns Field Park in Hinsdale.

Follow:


            British tennis star Emma Raducanu has spoken about the emotional toll of noticing what the WTA called a “fixated” man during one of her recent matches in Dubai, explaining how she “couldn’t see the ball through tears.”
    


            Raducanu was playing in the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships when the incident occurred early on in her match against Czech Republic’s Karolína Muchová, causing her to become visibly distressed and hide behind the umpire’s chair.
    


            The Dubai government later said that the individual in question signed a formal restraining order and had been banned from future tournaments.
    


            “I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told reporters on Tuesday, per Reuters. “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.’
    


            “I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.’”
    


            Raducanu managed to recover and take the first set against Muchová to a tie-break, but ultimately lost in straight sets. Two weeks on, she is now in California to play at Indian Wells, which will be her first appearance since the ordeal.
    


            “It was a very emotional time,” said Raducanu, who was speaking to reporters for the first time about the incident. “After the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.
    


            “There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here. I feel a lot better.”
    


            The world No. 55 added that the same individual had been at her previous tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha before appearing in Dubai.
    


            Raducanu told BBC Sport that the incident “could have been dealt with better,” adding that she has now taken precautions to prevent similar situations from arising.
    


            “Since that incident, I have definitely got increased attention and greater security,” she told the BBC. “All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation.
    


            “Now, it is being dealt with better, so for me that’s important. I’m always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I’m always with someone and always being watched.”
    


            The WTA, the governing body of women’s tennis, had not been made aware of the individual following Raducanu until 24 hours after he had approached the 22-year-old in a public area in Dubai.
    


            After the second-round match, the WTA released a statement saying that the man was displaying “fixated behavior” and had been ejected from the tournament.
    


            “Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events,” the statement said.
    


            “The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support. We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players.”
    


            CNN has contacted the Dubai Tennis Championships for comment.
    


            In her first match since the incident, Raducanu will face Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima in Indian Wells on Thursday. She could then face American third seed Coco Gauff, a fellow former US Open champion, in the second round.
    


            “I’m very happy to be in Indian Wells, it’s my favorite tournament outside of the slams,” Raducanu said. “Being here, I feel a lot better. I wasn’t necessarily sure if I was going to come and compete so soon after what happened in Dubai, but I’m glad I made the decision to come here and I’m loving being here. I’m happy on the court.”

BNP Paribas Open Indian Wells returns to Sky Sports Tennis with Emma Raducanu, Jack Draper, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek all playing; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Wednesday 5 March 2025 10:15, UK

Tennis returns to the desert - live on Sky Sports Tennis - with the first combined WTA and ATP 1000 event of the year at the BNP Paribas Open Indian Wells.

The tournament kicked off with the qualifying stages on Sunday March 2, with the main draw action commencing on Wednesday March 5. It all ends on Sunday March 16 when both the men's and women's singles finals will take place.

Yes! Emma Raducanu's ranking has earned her direct entry into the main draw after she required a wildcard to play the first two WTA 1000 events of the year in Doha and Dubai.

She is expected to be offered enhanced security in Indian Wells after she was the target of ""fixated behaviour"" from a man during the Dubai Championships last week.

The 22-year-old will play Japan's Moyuka Uchijima on opening Wednesday and will face Coco Gauff if she progresses to the next round.

Raducanu will be joined in the main draw by British No 1 Katie Boulter, who automatically goes straight to the second round as she's seeded.

Sonay Kartal defeated Marina Stakusic 6-2 6-2 to book her place into the final qualifying round, but she couldn't make the main draw after losing to Clervie Ngounoue 3-6 7-5 7-5.

Novak Djokovic will play at the ATP 1000-level tournament, as the Serbian resumes his hunt for a 100th singles title.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner retired from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev with a hamstring issue last month and lost in the Qatar Open first round last week.

The 37-year-old said that he ""played without pain"" in Doha but his disappointing display raised concerns among fans that he would not play in the Southern California event.

""A legend returns to the desert,"" the tournament wrote on X, quieting concerns about whether he would play.

Djokovic will play Nick Kyrgios in the second round, if the latter comes through his first match, with Carlos Alcaraz in line to face the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the quarter-finals.

Five-time Indian Wells winner Djokovic will aim to become the third man to claim 100 singles titles in the professional era, behind Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103).

Djokovic is expected to be joined in Indian Wells by coach Andy Murray, with the partnership set to continue ""indefinitely"".

Speaking in her monthly column for Sky Sports, Laura Robson said she was encouraged by the news. ""Andy Murray continuing with Novak Djokovic is really positive. Andy has four young kids and probably doesn't want to do all of these weeks on the road now that he's just stopped playing, so I'm sure that after the Australian Open, it just took them a minute to figure out their schedules,"" she wrote.

""I think it was a case of picking and choosing which tournaments they partner up at, and it sounds like he's going to be at Indian Wells and Miami coming up in March.""

Jannik Sinner will miss Indian Wells after accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Carlos Alcaraz is the two-time reigning Indian Wells champion, having downed Daniil Medvedev in the final of the last two editions, while Alexander Zverev will be the top seed on the men's side.

Iga Swiatek is the reigning women's champion, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Australian Open winner Madison Keys will aim to topple the Pole.

Joao Fonseca, an 18-year-old Brazilian prodigy who recently won his maiden ATP title at the Argentina Open, and Learner Tien, a 19-year-old who made a stunning run to the fourth round of the 2025 Australian Open as a qualifier and is one of the brightest young American prospects, received wild cards.

Legendary seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams will not play after declining her wild card.

Williams, who has reached the semi-finals on three occasions in Indian Wells, had boycotted the tournament between 2002 and 2016 after her sister Serena was booed by the crowd in the 2001 final, with the family also saying they were subjected to racist abuse.

Two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova was also awarded a wildcard. The Czech will be returning to action after the birth of her first child, son Petr, last July.

""The 'sunshine double' of Indian Wells and Miami is very tough for any player to pull off because it's totally opposite conditions - even though it's two hard-court tournaments,"" said former British No 1 Robson.

""It's a really long stint - both events are 12 days - and it's just a massive change conditions-wise, to go from one to the other as Miami is so hot and humid, compared to being in the desert of Palm Springs.

""Indian Wells, in particular, I always struggled at because it's much slower than you think. It doesn't always favour the Brits, who in general prefer slightly faster conditions and a pacier hard court that plays more lively, because you get a bit more out of your shots.""

Indian Wells Tennis Garden is located near Palm Springs, California, in the Coachella Valley.

Alongside its 16,100-capacity centre court - the second largest tennis-specific stadium in the world - the complex also boasts 29 hard-courts.

Oracle co-founder and CEO Larry Ellison assumed full ownership of Indian Wells in 2009 for a whopping $100m. The tech billionaire is the world's fourth richest man, worth an estimated £165bn.

The Caltech women’s tennis team, ranked No. 32 in NCAA Division III, took down No. 27 University of Mary Washington with outstanding singles play in a 5-2 victory, the squad’s second win in a row.

The Beavers looked to set the tone quickly as the rookie duo of Aoi Kunimoto (San Diego / Rancho Bernardo) and Polaris Hayes (Robbinsville, N.J. / The Pennington School) raced to a 6-0 doubles set win on Court 3. However, the Eagles reclaimed control with wins in the other two doubles matches to claim a 1-0 lead heading into singles play.

Eager to her team back in it, first-year Carissa Gerung (Portland, Ore. / Jesuit) rebounded from her doubles result with an unblemished 6-0, 6-0 rout in #4 Singles, while Hannah Ramsperger (Zürich / Realgymnasium Rämibühl Zürich) took control of #3 singles and posted a matching 6-0, 6-0 win to put Caltech up 2-1 in the match.

Caltech kept all the momentum as sophomore Anna Szczuka (Scotch Plains, NJ / Scotch-Plains Fanwood High School) picked up a match point on Court 6, winning 6-3, 6-1, and senior Yoyo Benchetrit (Toronto, Ont. / St. Clements) clinched the Beavers’ win shortly thereafter in #1 Singles with 6-4, 6-1 set scores.

Fellow senior Anika Arora (Fremont, Calif. / Mission San Jose) added the Beavers’ fifth match point, coming back from a 6-4 loss in her opening set with a 6-4 second set win, and then claiming the tiebreak with an efficient 10-3 win.

“Today was a great test against another ranked team, and I’m really pleased with our response,” said Head Coach Nyssa Peele. “I feel like everyone showed a championship mentality. If we got ahead, we stayed focused and didn’t let up. If we fell behind, we kept fighting and got back in it. That’s the approach I want us to have every time we play.”

Coach Peele and the Beavers will be back in action on their home courts next Wednesday, March 12, taking on Vassar College.

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) — Emma Raducanu says she “couldn’t see the ball through tears” and struggled to breathe after spotting a man who was “fixated” on her during a match.

The British tennis player and 2021 U.S. Open winner was left distressed during a match at last month’s Dubai Championships by the presence of the man in the stand.

The man, who had already approached Raducanu earlier in the tournament, was ejected from the arena after she spoke to the chair umpire during a second-round match against Karolina Muchova. He was later detained by Dubai police and signed a document pledging to “maintain distance” from Raducanu. The WTA said he had “exhibited fixated behavior.”

“I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told British reporters at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first tournament since the incident.

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish’. I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather here’.”

Raducanu regrouped to play on after the man was removed from the arena but lost 7-6 6-4.

“It was a very emotional time,” added Raducanu. “After the match I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.”

Raducanu told the BBC that the incident “could have been dealt with better” but that security improvements have now been made.




“I’m always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I’m always with someone and always being watched,” Raducanu told the BBC.

In 2022, an obsessive fan of Raducanu was given a restraining order after coming to her house three times.

Raducanu will face Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima, who is ranked three places above her at 52nd in the world, in the first round in California on Thursday. The winner is guaranteed to face third-seeded Coco Gauff, with the top 32 players all receiving byes through to the second round.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Ben Shelton states the one thing he regrets about choosing to be a professional tennis player,https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/ben-shelton-states-the-one-thing-he-regrets-about-choosing-to-be-a-professional-tennis-player/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","

Ben Shelton has enjoyed a roller-coaster 2025 season already, with a strong Indian Wells run now likely on his agenda.

Andy Roddick thinks Shelton can impress at Indian Wells, with the ATP Masters 1000 tournament shortly getting underway.

Shelton is the 2025 Indian Wells 11th seed, and gets his tournament underway in the round of 64 on Friday.

The American, who has just clinched a career-high rank of 12th on the ATP Tour, plays the winner of Learner Tien and Mariano Navone.

Shelton heads to Indian Wells on the back of a round of 16 exit at the Mexican Open, having also exited the Dallas Open at that stage.

A round of 16 exit was also suffered at the ASB Classic at the start of the year, but he recovered superbly to reach the Australian Open semi-finals.

The 22-year-old has now shared insight into his superb career so far, telling Vogue: “Tennis was my dad’s thing. It was my sister’s thing.

“And for me, growing up in American public schools tennis wasn’t really cool. Football is cool, basketball is cool – even baseball is cool.

“But playing quarterback – being on that field, hitting people – for me, that was the most fun you can have in athletics.”

Asked if that meant hitting receivers with passes, he replied: “Oh, no, no, no – hitting. Actually hitting them.

“I love contact. That’s the one thing I regret about choosing tennis – not being able to play a contact sport.”

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

Tennis certainly runs in the Shelton family, with his father Bryan spending eight years on the professional tour before coaching at Georgia Tech and the University of Florida.

His mother Lisa meanwhile competed at college level, with his sister Emma having been a highly ranked juniors player.

Ben meanwhile is seemingly closing in on a top 10 debut, a feat recently achieved by his fellow American Tommy Paul.

Paul has since dropped out of the top 10 ahead of Indian Wells, but another American in Taylor Fritz occupies fourth spot in the rankings.

Sharing his verdict on the very top ATP players, Shelton said: “Most of these guys who are at the top of the game right now, they were prodigies – five or six years old, racket in their hand, training every day.

“I wasn’t really supposed to be this great player. And so to get to top 20 in the world within two years of playing college tennis? That’s something that I don’t take for granted. It’s tough to be a finished product by 18 if you start at 12 – but I’m not a finished product.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"

An in-depth look at some of the hottest young players on the ATP Tour. No 4: Jakub Mensik

Jakub Mensik burst onto the scene at last year’s Qatar Open, reaching the final as an 18-year-old.

Over the last six months, tennis fans have been given a glimpse of what the men’s game might look like in another 10 to 15 years, as a crop of future stars have surfaced to pique the imagination of fans everywhere. Yes, we know Jannik Sinner is just 23, and Carlos Alcaraz is still 21, but what about the fresh-faced youngsters who are already starting to surface as potential rivals to them? 

Over the next few weeks, Tennis Majors will be shining a light on the new wave of young talent that started to show sings of a rise to prominence at this year’s Australian Open.

Today we will look at Mensik, a 19-year-old Czech who reached the third round at this year’s Australian Open.

Jakub Mensik won’t turn 20 until this year’s U.S. Open but already he has proven himself to be a force on the ATP tour.

The former world No 2 Junior hit the ATP’s top 100 in February of last year after powering into the Doha final, where he became the youngest Czech finalist and the first player to compete in an ATP final that was born in 2005 or later.

In October of last year, Mensik made his top-50 debut after a month that saw him advance to his first masters 1000 quarter-final in Shanghai, where he was defeated by Novak Djokovic, and his first ATP 500 quarter-final in Vienna.

Mensik’s serve is a weapon, and it drew praise from his friend and some-time practice partner Novak Djokovic after the pair played in the quarter-finals at the Shanghai Masters last year.

“I haven’t trained with him for a year and a half, so I could see today why he is one of the best servers we have in the game,” Djokovic said of Mensik, who hit 17 aces in that match. “He is only 19, the future is very bright for him. He knows that I am always there for him, whatever he needs.”

His serve isn’t just good, it’s also improving. Mensik is holding serve at an 88 percent clip so far in 2025 (as of February 20). That’s up from his career average of 85 percent. Excellent numbers for a teenager. 

Power is the main theme in the Czech’s game, and aggression. He hits big from both wings and can take his backhand up the line to close out points and keep opponents off balance. 

At 6ft 4in he’s still growing into his body, but all the tools are there for him to continue making his way up the rankings.

In his maiden Grand Slam appearance at the 2023 US Open, Mensik became the youngest player to reach the third round in 33 years. He had never won – or even played – an ATP level match prior to that tournament. He turned 18 during that year’s US Open. 

Several months later, at Doha in 2024, Mensik earned his first career top 5 win over Andrey Rublev and later become the youngest finalist in tournament history. He made his top 100 debut not long after that performance. 

Later in 2024, Mensik won eight out of nine matches and cracked two milestones in the fall. He reached his maiden Masters quarter-final (defeated by Djokovic) and his maiden ATP 500 final (defeated by De Minaur). 

Novak Djokovic has high praise for Mensik’s game. 

“I mean, he’s the youngster that is coming up,” declared Djokovic of Mensik last year prior to their Shanghai clash. 

“I followed him since, he has played finals of Australian Open, I think it was in juniors three years ago or so. So, I’m very thrilled for him that he’s doing so well. 

“I always believed that he’s got potential to be one of the top players of the world, and he’s building that kind of momentum right now. He’s tall, he’s got the big serve, he has got the all-around game, and he defends and moves very well for somebody of his height.” 

When asked to name players that he felt could someday get to No 1, Casper Ruud mentioned Mensik, along with Frenchman Arthur Fils. 

Mensik has all the tools to be a dominating force on hard courts, and perhaps grass. If he continues to evolve and improves his fitness and consistency, he has top 10 potential. He currently ranks at No 45 in the world, and will not turn 20 until the 2025 US Open. Time is on his side. 

Mensik will next be in action at the prestigious Indian Wells tournament, where he faces Tomas Martin Etcheverry in the first round.

https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news,Emma Raducanu says how she feels about playing tennis in America ahead of Indian Wells tournament starting,https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/emma-raducanu-says-how-she-feels-about-playing-tennis-in-america-ahead-of-indian-wells-tournament-starting/,"Wed, 05 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Emma Raducanu is thrilled to be back playing in America as she prepares for the start of the Indian Wells Masters.

The 22-year-old experienced the greatest moment of her career to date while competing in the United States.

This came in 2021 where she became US Open champion after coming through qualifying rounds and did not drop a set.

Four years later Emma Raducanu is ready to make her fifth appearance in Indian Wells, which has come at just the right time for the former British number one.

Each player has the tournaments or countries they enjoy competing in more than others and it brings out the best in them.

In Raducanu’s case, she loves competing in the United States, as her thrilling US Open title win would illustrate.

But the former British number one indicated that the Indian Wells Masters is her favourite tournament to play outside of the Grand Slams, and she shared why she loves playing in America.

“I’m happy to be in Indian Wells. It’s my favourite tournament outside of the Grand Slams. Being here I feel a lot better,” Raducanu told Sky Sports.

“I always loved playing in America since junior days, I had this fascination with it. And I remember the first time I saw a palm tree. It was amazing, like I was in heaven.

“Then, obviously, it was pretty epic in New York and ever since, I’ve just had an amazing fanbase in America and I love it here. It’s just so easy. Everything is so practical, relaxed, and spacious. So I’m just very happy to be here.”

As mentioned above the most successful tournament of Raducanu’s career is her 2021 US Open title win.

Raducanu has won six of her 10 matches at Indian Wells and has reached the fourth round in 2023 where she lost to Iga Swiatek.

In 2022 Raducanu defeated Serena Williams on the way to reaching the third round at the Cincinnati Masters.

Prior to her 2025 Indian Wells campaign, Raducanu last played in America at the Citi Open in the nation’s capital of Washington D.C. in July 2024.

Raducanu reached the Citi Open quarter-finals, and was leading Paula Badosa by a set until the Spaniard came back to win 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, which led to her becoming champion.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"
