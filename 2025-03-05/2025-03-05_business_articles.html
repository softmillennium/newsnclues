US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said President Donald Trump is considering a deal that would offer exemptions from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, including potentially for carmakers.

The possibility of a rollback, which he said could be announced on Wednesday, came as many US businesses raised concerns about Trump's decision to hit US imports from its two closest trade partners with a 25% import tax. 

After two days of declines, the main US stock indexes were trading slightly higher early on Wednesday. 

Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly told the BBC's Newsnight on Tuesday that her office had not been contacted about any plans around reducing tariffs.

US officials "can say many things" but "the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump," Joly said.

The US president used a large part of his speech to Congress on Tuesday to outline his trade policies, but he did not say whether he planned to cut the tariffs that came into effect this week.

Canada and Mexico announced retaliatory import levies on the US after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday.

Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.

Trump says he wants to protect American industry and boost manufacturing, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.

On Wednesday, Lutnick said tariffs would be in place, but suggested some goods could be "left out".

"There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2," Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday. 

"It will be 25% but there will be some categories left out - it could well be autos. It could be others as well," he added.

A day earlier on Fox News, Lutnick had raised the possibility of a compromise and reduction of tariffs for Mexico and Canada, saying Trump was weighing offers to meet his allies "in the middle". 

Trump has said he would move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has slammed Trump's sweeping tariffs on his country, calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and vowed to conduct a "relentless fight" to protect its economy.

Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.

But Trump pushed even further in a post on his Truth Social platform, saying: "Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!"

Trudeau accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".

"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state," he told reporters.

Washington also ramped up its trade war with Beijing on Tuesday as a new 10% levy on Chinese imports that came into effect - which adds to existing levies from Trump's first term and those announced last month.

"China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said after their country announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.

The man allegedly swallowed two pairs of earrings worth $769,500 (£597,000) hoping to avoid being charged with theft.

Israel was consulted prior to the talks, according to the White House, after reports said the two sides were discussing the release of hostages.

The US president spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about trade tariffs on Wednesday.

Premium Lite will cost $7.99 per month and include "most" videos in key genres.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


YouTube is launching a less expensive tier of its “Premium” subscription service in the U.S., as the Google-owned video platform says that it now has more than 125 million subscribers to its YouTube Premium and YouTube Music services.


	The company announced the updates Wednesday.




	The new tier is called Premium Lite, and will cost $7.99 per month (compared to $13.99 per month for Premium). It will allow subscribers to watch “most videos” on YouTube ad-free, with a particular emphasis on genres like gaming, fashion, news, and beauty creators. Music content and Shorts will be where users see the most ads.

	The company had been testing Premium Lite in a handful of countries, but is now rolling it out to the U.S.

	At the same time, Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of music, revealed that YouTube Premium and YouTube Music have a combined 125 million subscribers: “An incredible milestone that many laughed off as impossible when we first launched,” he wrote in his annual letter, released Wednesday. “This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there. This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there.”


	YouTube announced that it had hit 100 million Premium and Music subscribers a year ago. It also revealed that its YouTube TV service passed 8 million subscribers.


	The new less expensive Premium tier is likely to further drive total subscribers.


	Cohen also used his letter to tease what he sees coming, including increased use of AI tools, and what he calls “the rebirth of the music video.”


	To hear Cohen explain it, YouTube is the new MTV, the place where culture-defining artists drop their latest work, or where new artists can be discovered.


	“As I look forward, I’m foreseeing a renaissance of the music video,” he wrote. “It’s not about having the biggest production budget; it’s about sharing authentic hero content that music fans can’t unsee. It’s about using the artist’s most influential asset – the music video – and cutting through the tidal wave of clutter and choice. Think about the iconic music videos that have shaped our culture. These weren’t simply videos; they were cultural moments. And they didn’t just break songs – they broke artists.”

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



With Wall Street focused on the impact of July's global IT outage on customer contract renewals, CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) delivered fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates. The cybersecurity firm's fiscal 2026 sales and profitability outlook for CrowdStrike stock underwhelmed.

The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based cybersecurity firm reported January-ended quarterly earnings after the market close on Tuesday.

CrowdStrike earnings climbed 8% to $1.03 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue, including acquisitions, rose 25% to $1.06 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $1.035 billion.

With CrowdStrike, Wall Street analysts focus on annual recurring revenue, or ARR. It's a key financial metric tied to subscription services growth. Analysts have lowered estimates for "net new" ARR amid expectations that many customers will seek price discounts when renewing contracts to help cover the cost of business disruptions. A software upgrade caused the IT outage.

In Q4, total ARR increased 23% to $4.24 billion. Analysts had predicted total ARR of $4.21 billion. But net new ARR fell 20% to $224.3 million.

"CrowdStrike put up strong Q4 results with $224 million in net new ARR coming in ahead of expectations, but offering little in the way of clarity into the timing or magnitude of a second half (fiscal 2026) reacceleration," said UBS analyst Roger Boyd in a report. "In addition, while the revenue guidance for 21% year-over-year growth was ahead of consensus, the outlook for margins was below expectations, with CrowdStrike guiding to 20% operating margin."

For fiscal 2026, which starts with the current quarter ending in April, CrowdStrike predicted revenue in a range of $4.744 billion to $4.805 billion vs. estimates for $4.768 billion.

CrowdStrike said it expects adjusted EPS of $3.39 at the midpoint of guidance, well below estimates of $4.40. CrowdStrike plans higher investments in marketing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Higher taxes also will impact profitability

Also, CrowdStrike did not provide an outlook for total ARR versus estimates of $5.058 billion.

At William Blair, analyst Jonathan Ho noted that CrowdStrike management said it no longer is offering customers perks related to the IT outage.

"Guidance for revenue was offered only slightly above the consensus for 2026 with pro forma EPS guidance well below, due primarily to tax rate and incremental investments," Ho said in a report. "Fiscal 2026 is expected to be back-end loaded from an ARR perspective as customer commitment package — related revenue is expected to be renewed, but it is unclear at what levels."

He added: "CrowdStrike has been clear that it expects the business to accelerate in the back half of the year as it converts CCP-free products to be paid."

At Jefferies, analyst Joseph Gallo said in a report: "While risk remains on whether customers actually pay for free modules eventually, we have confidence in CrowdStrike's market position driving a fiscal second half 2026 net new ARR re-acceleration."

On the stock market today, CrowdStrike stock fell 7.5% to near 361 in early trading. Heading into the CrowdStrike earnings report, shares were up 15% in 2025.

"The company changed the accounting of employee payroll related to stock based compensation, hiding another 500 to 600 basis points of operating mrgin pressure, but management noted it now uses the same accounting practices as peers," said Bank of America analyst Tal Liani in a report. "Similar to other software vendors and to Zscaler (ZS), management raised the assumed tax rate from about 5% to 22.5% to account for full taxes post historical loss credits."

Further, CrowdStrike recently said its sales through Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com (AMZN), had surpassed $1 billion in 2024.

CrowdStrike competes with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), SentinelOne (S), Microsoft (MSFT) and others in the "endpoint" market. Endpoint security tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.

Also, CrowdStrike is building a broad, threat-detection cybersecurity platform called XDR, which stands for extended detection and response. It monitors endpoints as well as web/email gateways, web application firewalls and cloud business workloads.

The data-driven news brand 538 will be shuttered in the cuts.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	The Walt Disney Co. is slashing just under 200 jobs at ABC News and at its Disney Entertainment Networks division as the traditional TV business continues to face economic headwinds, a source familiar with the decision tells The Hollywood Reporter. The cuts represented about 6 percent of the division’s workforce.


	ABC News will be hit particularly hard, with the data-driven digital news brand 538 being shuttered, teams from Nightline and 20/20 being consolidated, and all three hours of Good Morning America moving under the same top producer, Simone Swink. The company is also merging its digital and social operations.

	











	Disney’s entertainment networks will see cuts in program planning and scheduling, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the cuts there. Disney’s channels include FX and Freeform. The newsletter Status first reported the looming cuts at ABC News.

	ABC News last saw job cuts last fall, when around 75 jobs were eliminated. The news division had announced Almin Karamehmedovic as its president last August.


	Broadcast news divisions in general are grappling with the changing economics of TV, with structures increasingly consolidated in divisions alongside local TV stations, and the role of network news president being a smaller role than it was in they heyday of TV. Disney writ large announced structure-driven job cuts last September.

Virginia Acquisition Grows Penzance’s Industrial Portfolio


WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Penzance, a leading owner, operator, developer and investor in the Mid-Atlantic region, announced today the acquisition of Gateway & Linden, a six-building industrial portfolio totaling 212,086 square feet in Manassas, Virginia. The $55 million acquisition, completed this month, adds to Penzance’s growing industrial portfolio and reinforces its commitment to strategic investment across commercial real estate asset classes.





Gateway & Linden, acquired from a partnership owned by Davin Holdings and The Davis Companies, consists of two industrial flex parks:



Lauren Kowall, Senior Vice President of Investments at Penzance, said, “This acquisition aligns with our strategy to expand in high-demand industrial markets and capitalize on our in-house expertise to drive long-term value. In this supply-constrained Northern Virginia market, high-quality industrial flex assets like these are becoming increasingly scarce, making this a particularly valuable addition to our portfolio.”



The Gateway & Linden portfolio presented a compelling investment opportunity for Penzance due to its prime location in Manassas, a high-demand industrial submarket with strong regional connectivity. The property is strategically located in the Route 29/I-66 corridor, offering direct access to Interstate 66, Prince William Parkway, and Balls Ford Road, enabling seamless and efficient distribution throughout the D.C. metro area. Its location within Prince William County also positions it to serve warehouse users supporting the data center industry, where over 8.5 million square feet of data center currently exists, which is projected to increase to 80 million square feet over the next decade, further enhancing its long-term value.



Penzance aims to lease current and upcoming vacancies ranging between 6,000 and 33,000 square feet, as well as convert office-heavy suites to industrial use by raising dropped ceilings and adding dock doors. Penzance’s in-house property management team will oversee operations, driving efficiencies and value creation.



Working closely alongside the Penzance team, JLL's Metro DC Industrial Team has been selected to spearhead the leasing efforts for the project. Leveraging their extensive market knowledge and proven track record in the industrial sector, the team will be responsible for marketing the property and securing blue chip tenants.



Dan Coats, senior managing director at JLL, added, "We are thrilled to partner with such a dedicated and hands-on local owner. Penzance’s commitment to the community aligns perfectly with our approach to delivering tailored, high-touch solutions. Together, we look forward to bringing these exceptional properties to market and creating value for both the ownership and future tenants."



This acquisition expands Penzance’s industrial portfolio and strengthens its growing industrial development pipeline. JLL’s Mid-Atlantic Capital Markets team, including Bill Prutting, Craig Childs and Chris Dale served as the sole advisors on the sale transaction.



Bill Prutting, senior managing director of Capital Markets, said, “JLL is tracking over 7 million square feet of industrial tenant displacement driven primarily by data centers. Given this trend, the Gateway & Linden portfolio is exceptionally well-positioned. It's poised to retain current tenants who already supply goods and services to data centers, while also attracting new tenants ready to meet market rental rates in Manassas.”

President Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners — and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods. 

The U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%. 

Businesses ranging from automakers to alcohol producers have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy. While some companies will look to source their goods from other countries or move production to the U.S., those moves could take years. 

In the meantime, companies have said they will have to pay the tariffs and then pick from two options: either pass the added costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorb the fees and either cut costs elsewhere or take lower profits. 

On Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month, which includes products such as electronics, footwear, medicines and cosmetics. Those tariffs are in addition to tariffs already put in place during Trump's first term in office.

Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.

Late Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. In an appearance on Fox Business News, Lutnick said an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree could come as soon as Wednesday.

"The Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better," Lutnick said. "And the president is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable. So I think he's going to work something out with them."

Lutnick continued: "It's not going to be a pause, that pause stuff, but I think he's going to figure out you do more, and I'll meet you in the middle some way, and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow. So somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way."

The move risks a tit-for-tat trade war with Mexico, Canada and China that could hurt U.S. businesses selling their products to those countries and upended one of the signature deals of Trump's first term: the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

That agreement, which Trump touted at the time as a negotiating victory, largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, similar to how they had for decades under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. Under the terms of the deal, the agreement wasn’t supposed to be up for renegotiation until July 2026, but Trump’s move to impose new tariffs could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday. In a news conference, she said the action would include "tariff and nontariff measures." Sheinbaum also said that Mexico had already taken steps during the past month to crack down on drug gangs and trafficking flows.

Canada will move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) of American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled. Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee, will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn.

"We don't want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don't want to see you hurt, either, but your government has chosen to do this to you," Trudeau said at a news conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people. 

Then, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: "Even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do."

He noted that even though less than 1% of fentanyl seized by the U.S. is coming across the Canadian border, the country has been taking action to further crackdown on the illegal drug trade. As a result, Trudeau said there was a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, "to a near zero low of less than half an ounce seized in January." 

China said it will impose additional tariffs on U.S. goods March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. China said that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.

“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.

Trump had previously threatened to place a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 before saying he was delaying those tariffs for a month, after the leaders of the two countries said they would be stepping up security at their borders. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to negotiate on the new import duties.

Economists across the political spectrum have warned that the tariffs, which are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods, would increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Stocks fell nearly 2% Monday, the worst day since December. 

“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy,” Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement Monday. “Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.”

Automakers are among the industries that will feel the greatest impact from the tariffs, since vehicles and their components cross between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico multiple times during the production process. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers. 

“Let’s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,” Farley said at an investor conference last month.

The tariffs could add as much as $12,000 to the price of a new car, according to a report from the Anderson Economic Group. The American Automotive Policy Council,  the industry association representing GM, Ford and Stellantis, said they believe their vehicles and parts that meet the tariff-free requirements under the previously negotiated trade deal during Trump’s first term should be exempt from the tariffs.

“Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the association, said in a statement.

The Aluminum Association, which represents aluminum production and jobs in the U.S., said in February that the U.S. sources two-thirds of the primary aluminum it uses every year from Canada and about 90% of scrap metal from either Canada or Mexico. It added that U.S.-based smelters, even at full capacity, “cannot produce nearly enough metal to meet demand.” 

The tariffs could also contribute to higher grocery prices since Mexico is one of the top suppliers to the U.S. of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years — an issue Trump pledged to tackle on the campaign trail. 

The tariffs could also increase the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico and Canada and hurt sales of U.S. spirits sold in those countries. The Distilled Spirits Council estimates that a 25% tariff on distilled spirits imports from Mexico and Canada could lead to a loss of more than 31,000 U.S. jobs. In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, as well as $622 million worth of Canadian spirits, according to the association. 

“Tariffs on spirits products from Canada and Mexico will jeopardize the industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy,” the group said in a statement. “The North American spirits sector is highly interconnected and, as a result, tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey will harm U.S. spirits companies that have these products in their brand portfolios.”   

Trump has indicated that further tariffs will be on the way. He reiterated Monday that previously announced “reciprocal” tariffs would be coming April 2, and that tariffs on “external product” from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.

Last month, Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States from all countries, and raised his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.

Trump has repeatedly cited tariffs as a tool he can use to raise revenue to pay for other domestic spending priorities and as a measure to pressure companies to relocate production to the U.S.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) and TWG Global (TWG) today announced a joint venture to redefine AI deployment in banking, investment management, insurance and other financial services. By pairing Palantir’s unmatched AI infrastructure with TWG’s deep expertise in business operations and financial services, this initiative will enable financial institutions to integrate AI at scale—moving beyond fragmented, piecemeal solutions to a singular, fully embedded, enterprise-wide approach.





Led by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and TWG Global’s Mark Walter, Thomas Tull, and Chief Data & Analytics Officer Drew Cukor—the joint venture brings together a team with a deeply established history of collaboration, spanning over two decades in deploying AI at scale across high-stakes defense, government, and commercial applications. Over the past year, TWG and Palantir have actively worked together to embed AI into TWG’s own companies, refining their approach and proving its impact. This is the next step in that effort—a battle-tested, operational AI offering designed to revolutionize financial services and insurance and accelerate industry-wide adoption.



“Palantir is proud to partner with TWG Global to further seamlessly weave AI into the fabric of financial services and help forward-looking companies unlock enormous opportunity," said Alex Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies. "By combining TWG's deep industry expertise with Palantir's world-leading software, we are empowering businesses to not just navigate today's complex global market, but to position themselves for dominance in it by remaining at the forefront of the AI revolution.”



More than a mere partnership, this initiative represents a fundamental rethinking of AI’s role in business—moving beyond a tool managed by IT teams to an “artificial workforce” integrated into every core function. Leaders who understand strategy, human capital, and operational impact must take ownership of AI—not as a side project, but as the backbone of their business’s growth and resilience. This isn’t optional. As industries shift at an unprecedented pace, AI is the defining factor of who leads and who falls behind in the next era of global competitiveness.



“AI is no longer an add-on—it’s woven into the fabric of every decision, every process, and every outcome, delivering tomorrow’s competitive advantage," said Tull. “From Wall Street to the Pentagon, AI is already reshaping industries. But what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity. Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will find themselves outpaced by those that do.”



This full-scale AI solution embeds intelligence across every core function of financial institutions and insurance companies—from compliance and customer growth to operational efficiency, fraud detection, risk monitoring, credit and lending, and capital optimization. Unlike fragmented AI tools, this holistic program drives real business impact by mitigating risk, reshoring capabilities, adapting to shifting labor dynamics, and future-proofing banks and insurers against market volatility and regulatory pressures.



Drew Cukor, TWG Global’s Head of Data and Analytics (former Head of AI Transformation at JPMorgan and Head of the Pentagon’s Project Maven), brings a track record of introducing AI to some of the world’s most complex organizations. At the Pentagon’s Project Maven, he helped shape AI-driven defense capabilities, and later at JPMorgan Chase, he scaled AI solutions across financial operations, integrating machine learning into one of the most intricate banking systems globally and resulting in JPMorgan being recognized as the top-rated bank in AI globally for three consecutive years.



“AI is fundamentally reshaping the workforce—changing who does what and how effective employees can be. It’s not just something to add to a company’s tech stack; it requires a complete shift in how businesses operate,” said Cukor. “That’s why we’ve redefined AI as a management and business process issue, not just a technical deployment. The real question isn’t whether to adopt AI, but who should own and lead its implementation.”



“Encouraging the deployment of emerging technology within our portfolio businesses is at the core of our investment strategy,” said Walter. “By expanding our model beyond our own portfolio, we’re ensuring that companies remain at the forefront of global competitiveness. This is just the beginning, and we’re excited to use this partnership to redefine the future of financial services.

After more than a century, the Poor Clares, an order of Roman Catholic nuns, have moved out of their historic monastery in the 700 block of Henry Clay Avenue near Audubon Park, leaving vacant an entire city block in the heart of one of Uptown’s priciest neighborhoods.

Just four nuns, all in their 80s, had been living in St. Clare's Monastery, as the nearly 2-acre property is formally known. It stands behind a brick wall and encompasses the entire block bounded by Henry Clay, Magazine, Constance and Calhoun streets.

Given their advanced age and dwindling numbers, maintaining the buildings and sprawling grounds was simply too much for the nuns to manage, said Sr. Charlene Toups, who leads the order.

“We do our own work and are pretty self-sustaining,” said Toups, a New Orleans native, who joined the order in 1966 after dropping out of college. “But we’re older now and it’s hard for us to climb up and down ladders to change light bulbs and tend to the gardening.”

The nuns are working to sell the property to a local developer and hope to finalize a deal soon, said Toups, who declined to provide details, citing a nondisclosure agreement. They recently relocated to a house on Valmont Street about a mile from the monastery.

The monastery dates to 1912 and includes a main three-story building with a chapel, offices, meeting rooms, dining space and an infirmary. The upper floors of the building house dozens of bedrooms, most of which have been empty for years, and was designated in 1979 as a historic landmark by the city's Historic Districts Landmarks Commission.

The monastery grounds are extensive, and include a mortuary chapel, where members of the order are buried, and a garden shed. There are also two live oaks named St. Anthony and St. Roch, a grotto, a grassy labyrinth and benches for contemplation.

Earlier this year, the monastery was assessed at nearly $7 million, according to the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office, which valued the land at nearly $4 million and the buildings nearly $3 million.

Experts say given its size, location, historic architecture and storied past, the unique piece of property is hard to put a price tag on.

“It’s prime real estate, obviously,” said Larry Schedler of Larry G. Schedler and Associates, who specializes in the local apartment market. “There would be tremendous demand for it as market-rate or affordable housing. It’s really going to come down to how many historic tax credits can a developer get to renovate it.”

The Poor Clare order is more than 800 years old and was founded by St. Clare of Assisi, who was born into nobility in 13th-cenutry Italy and gave up her life of privilege to follow the example of poverty and simple living set by her contemporary, St. Francis of Assisi.

Poor Clare nuns are cloistered, meaning, they spend their lives in the monastery, praying and working, rather than ministering to the needy out in the world. Members of the order pledge chastity, poverty, obedience and enclosure when they enter the monastery, and devote themselves to a life of contemplative prayer.  

Today, there are about 20,000 Poor Clare nuns living in more than 70 countries worldwide, according to Santa Clara University, which is affiliated with the order.

Toups entered the order in the mid-1960s, when many other priests and nuns were rethinking their vocations and leaving. At the time, there were 27 Poor Clares at the local monastery.

“Everybody was dropping out. I was dropping in,” said Toups, who felt called to a life of poverty and contemplative prayer.

In the nearly six decades since, Toups said she hasn’t looked back and has found living in community both rewarding and meaningful. Though the Poor Clares are cloistered, they have played an active role in the local community.

For years, they ran a small printing business that printed stationery and brochures for small local museums. They also had a gift shop, where they sold homemade art and ornaments. Additionally, they baked communion wafers for local Roman Catholic parishes and held Sunday mass in their main chapel, which continues even though the nuns have moved.

“We are hoping to reestablish our gift shop once we get settled,” Toups said. “We’re still in the process of moving everything out. After more than a century, it takes a little while.”

The Poor Clare monastery is the latest of several large parcels of real estate owned by the Roman Catholic church and its affiliated orders that have been sold or listed for sale, amid changing demographics, aging priests and nuns and other financial pressures.

Locally, the Archdiocese of New Orleans’ need to raise money to settle claims with hundreds of survivors of sex abuse by priests, deacons and brothers has prompted Archbishop Gregory Aymond to sell nearly $20 million of real estate in recent years.

The Poor Clare order is not under the control of the archdiocese and the nuns own the monastery independent of the local church. Their deal to sell the property is not related to the church bankruptcy. 

While the Poor Clare property is valued at nearly $7 million by the assessor, it’s unclear how much the property would fetch on the open market, experts say.

A full city block in Mid City, including the shuttered Sacred Heart of Jesus Church on Canal Street, was assessed last year at $6.1 million. Its current asking price is $1.95 million, down from $2.28 million in late 2023.

But the Mid City property, though comparable in size to the monastery Uptown, is hamstrung by a couple of factors. It includes a large, aging former church building, which doesn’t lend itself to reuse as an apartment complex or condos. Also, a former school building on the Mid City site has already been converted to a rent-adjusted apartments for low-income seniors.

Schedler says the value of the Uptown monastery will come down to the amount of historic building tax credits a developer is able to secure to renovate the building and convert it to residential use.
