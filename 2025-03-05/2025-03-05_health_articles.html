Home > LMH Health Foundation honors those who support community healthcare

Published on March 05, 2025

 

LAWRENCE – LMH Health Foundation is pleased to announce recipients of the 18th annual Elizabeth Watkins Community Caring Award. The Watkins Award celebrates people and organizations who have provided significant service to LMH Health and community healthcare.

Honorees are community members Dward and the late Jeanine Moore, Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson, Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner, and Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson. Information on each honoree is included below.

The Foundation is also pleased to announce a record annual transfer of more than $9.1 million in philanthropic contributions to support LMH Health priorities in 2024. The previous record of $4.3 million was established in 2020.  

Over the last two years, donors have provided more than $7.2 million in support for the expansion and renovation of the LMH Health Cancer Center, anticipated to open this summer. This expansion will ensure the Cancer Center facilities reflect the extraordinarily high level of physician care and expertise, leading-edge technology and patient-centered programming found within the center. Additional funds were transferred in support of new PET imaging technology, clinic renovations in the Anderson Health Plaza, charitable care needs, and other patient-centered initiatives.

“We are fortunate to be part of a community that values access to exceptional healthcare, and donor support helps ensure our community hospital continues to be among the very best in the country," said Rebecca Smith, LMH Health Foundation executive director and LMH Health vice president of strategy and communications. “From investing in facilities and technology typically only seen in major medical centers to ensuring those advancements are available to every single member of our community regardless of ability to pay, donors have had a real and tremendous impact over this past year. We are incredibly grateful for this support and all it makes possible.”

  

Here’s a closer look at the Watkins honorees:



Dward and the late Jeanine Moore



Dward and Jeanine Moore were married for 56 years. They met at a music camp in Missouri — Jeanine was a violinist; Dward, a baritone vocalist. The young couple joined the Peace Corps after college, teaching two years at a school for boys in Uganda. Back in the States, they eventually settled in a small town in Maryland. Dward taught anthropology and later worked at an employee-owned survey research company. Jeanine worked in libraries, taught music and performed in professional quartets. In 2015, to be closer to extended family, they moved to Lawrence.  As always, they looked for ways to give to their community.

“One day in the newspaper I saw an article about the Help & Healing Fund, and we knew that was it,” Dward said. The fund pays for medication and durable medical equipment for patients in need as they leave the hospital. “We had some personal experience with LMH Health — the doctors here are very good. It made us feel good that we can support people who need the help.”

Through their generosity, both Dward and Jeanine continue to touch lives.

 

Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson



At some point after Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson moved to Lawrence about 25 years ago, they realized LMH Health is extraordinary.

“We didn’t choose Lawrence because we saw it had great healthcare, but we lucked into it!” Sam said.

“This is a small-enough community — you get to see your healthcare providers in real life. You can be out to dinner, or the grocery store, and there’s your doctor. You get to see them as real people,” Leann explained. “I love having those relationships here.”

Sam and Leann have given generously to support renovations to the LMH Health Cancer Center and patient-centered technology, as well as patient expenditures for physical therapy and occupational therapy. Additionally, Sam founded Falling Forward Foundation, which funds continued rehab after insurance benefits run out.

“The culture and the people at LMH Health are all about kindness and caring, and the quality of care is remarkable,” Sam said. “Hospitals used to be about fixing things that were already broken. Today, it’s more about being proactive, and that’s very true here. I mean, they even changed the name of the hospital to LMH Health.”

  

Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner



Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner moved back to Lawrence in 2001.

“It seems like we end up at the hospital a lot,” said Dan, laughing. “I fell off a ladder a few years ago and cracked some ribs. I’ve also had a total knee replacement and back surgery here. When Sally had chest pain, they ushered us right in to a special cardiac care unit. I think it’s a pretty big deal that LMH Health is independent and not-for-profit. They do a great job looking after our community — and so I decided to do my part and look after LMH.”

Dan served on the LMH Health Foundation board of directors and has listed the foundation in his estate planning. They have shared several generous gifts to the hospital and were early donors to the LMH Health East Heights primary care clinic.

“We share a philosophy about giving,” Sally said.  “If you want something done, just do it. And why wait until you die? If it’s possible, give now and reap the emotional benefit while you’re alive. The amount doesn’t matter as much as the willingness to give.”

 

Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson



For 25 years, Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson have been part of the LMH Health family. Dr. Thompson — “everyone calls me Mike,” he said — saw a job posting for a pathologist in Lawrence in 2000 and came for an interview.

“We got here and knew right away,” said Cheri, a registered nurse and nurse anesthetist who went to work at Lawrence Plastic Surgery.

While their boys grew up here, the Thompsons invested in LMH Health in myriad ways. Mike served as chief of staff, on many committees and on the foundation board of directors; together they co-chaired Rock the Block–Kick Cancer. They have supported patient-centered technology, cancer care and specific needs in the laboratory.

“We’re just big believers in a community hospital,” Cheri said.

Mike added, “The hospital is sort of the heartbeat of the community. It’s amazing to see how much ours has grown since we moved here.” 

Both have retired recently but stay connected.

“This is a family,” Mike said. “I try to be an example for younger docs, and they are proud to report back that they went to a meeting, played in the Penny Jones Golf Tournament. When you give to something you have ownership in, you want it to do well.”

One of the most robust and influential grant foundations in New York recently extended its generosity to the Le Moyne College community. Mother Cabrini Health Foundation awarded $1.275 million to the Le Moyne Healthcare Advancement Resource Center (HARC), which supports international medical professionals in obtaining healthcare jobs in New York.

Mother Cabrini Health Foundation is a non-profit, private organization that provides healthcare services, particularly to historically underserved communities. The foundation’s mission is rooted in Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini, an Italian immigrant who dedicated her career to advocating for immigrants and social justice. The foundation follows in her footsteps and provides grants to programs and services that support the health and well-being of people across New York. 

Since its establishment in 2018, the foundation has awarded over 2,700 grants, approximately over $800 million. In 2024, 529 grants were distributed, amounting to $208 million for organizations across New York. This money has been used to fund community healthcare programs to serve people facing health and social disparities, providing basic food and shelter as well as access to healthcare and mental health services. These programs focus on serving vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, immigrants, and veterans. The funding from the grants is necessary to allow these programs to flourish and provide for their communities. 

One such program is Le Moyne’s Healthcare Advancement Resource Center; this program is designed for foreign-trained medical graduates (FMGs) who are searching for jobs in New York. Professions and career pathways of clients include Registered Nurse, Physician’s Assistant, Physician, Occupational Therapy, Medical Researcher, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, and others. Obtaining the necessary training and certifications to work as a medical professional is often challenging, as it involves a degree of knowledge about American healthcare and education systems. 

This challenge is exacerbated by language and cultural barriers. HARC seeks to address these issues and provides clients with resources such as English classes, resume reviews, educational case managers, interview and job searches, academic scholarships, community networking, and many more. The clients of this program come from over 25 countries such as Brazil, China, Afghanistan, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Yemen.

HARC is a vital contributor to Syracuse’s healthcare system; with growing populations and increased health disparities, culturally and linguistically appropriate providers are needed to connect with communities and provide appropriate care to Syracuse residents. Foreign-trained medical graduates offer unique perspectives and skill sets that are essential to advancing healthcare services and practices. The additional support provided by the Foundation’s grant will help this program flourish and provide resources to its clients.

GE HealthCare Technologies introduced Genesis Solutions, a new portfolio of cloud enterprise imaging SaaS solutions, aimed at enhancing efficiency and precision in healthcare. This development occurred amid a challenging market environment, with major indexes alternating between gains and losses, influenced by tariff discussions and mixed economic data. The company's share price moved 1.57% over the last quarter, a potentially modest increase considering the launch of Genesis, as well as recent upcoming products like Freelium and Flyrcado. Additionally, the company reported strong Q4 2024 earnings with increased revenue and net income, factors that likely held shareholder interest. Despite market volatility and broader economic concerns, GE HealthCare's innovations and market position kept investor confidence relatively stable compared to a broader market decline of 3.1% over the same period. Overall, the company's strategies and product developments may have offset broader market trends.

Take a closer look at GE HealthCare Technologies's potential here.

In the last year, GE HealthCare Technologies experienced a total return decline of 8.03%, underperforming both the US Medical Equipment industry, which saw a 9.7% gain, and the broader US market, which rose by 13.1%. While the company's earnings grew significantly by 43.5%, revenues only increased marginally at 3.8% annually, which may have deterred investors accounting for slower growth prospects compared to market expectations. The company's guidance for moderate organic revenue growth, between 1% to 2%, further tempered investor enthusiasm amid macroeconomic pressures such as weakness in the China market.

Despite these challenges, GE HealthCare's product innovations, including the launch of the Freelium MRI platform, which uses less than 1% helium, and the Flyrcado PET MPI agent, highlight its commitment to advancing technological solutions. Additionally, the strategic partnership with UCSF to advance imaging solutions signals a strong focus on clinical improvement. Nonetheless, these developments were not enough to counterbalance the broader market headwinds impacting its share performance over the period.

HIMSS President and CEO speaks at a press conference during HIMSS25.

Susan Morse/Healthcare Finance News, HIMSS

LAS VEGAS - HIMSS President and CEO Hal Wolf addressed funding cuts for medical research during a press conference at HIMSS25 here on Tuesday.

"I think we're at the beginning of a very shaky period," Wolf said. "I think that we're all concerned."

Fifty percent of healthcare in the United States is funded by the federal government, he said. This includes Medicare and Medicaid.

However, Wolf said, the strength of the system has always been in taking the long term.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the cuts, according to Reuters.

Trump's pick to head the National Institute of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, is expected to be confirmed following a Senate hearing. If confirmed, Bhattacharya would oversee a nearly $50 billion budget and funding for thousands of scientific projects. The NIH director oversees 27 institutes and centers that conduct early-stage research, according to Reuters.

For hospitals, the biggest challenge is the workforce shortage. Wolf estimated a shortage of 8-9 million people on a global basis. 

Hospitals need to turn to digital health. Digital health allows care to be extended into the home.

Healthcare comes down to an anomaly, Wolf said. When an anomaly is found,  people are put on care pathways.

Helping this search for what's not normal are devices and watches that allow people to monitor their own health.

Nurses are now doing work formerly done by physicians.

"Now we have to stretch those resources and that's where digital health comes in," Wolf said.

Flexibilities for remote patient monitoring and telehealth - which allow for care in the home including acute care, will end on March 31 without Congressional action.

HIMSS is involved in getting these flexibility extended, Wolf said. 

An estimated 28,000 people are attending HIMSS25 in Las Vegas, he said. Last year a little over 26,000 people attended HIMSS24.

In late February, healthcare organizations across the US started receiving extortion demands by mail claiming that their organization’s data had been stolen in a ransomware attack and giving them 10 days to respond.

According to the letters, printed on paper and delivered in envelopes purporting to be from the BianLian ransomware group, the data would be leaked unless the organization paid a ransom of between $250,000 to $350,000 in Bitcoin.

Now for the good news: the breaches never happened, and the letters are almost certainly fake. Two security vendors that have studied the letters, Arctic Wolf and Guidepoint Security, now believe that the whole letter-writing campaign is a ruse by someone pretending to be BianLian, one of the ransomware industry’s up-and-coming threat groups.

Targeting healthcare organizations, the strange incident is a reminder that ransomware today is really two industries: a larger one that carries out the serious ransomware attacks everyone hears about and a much smaller and less well publicized one that tries to impersonate them.

But how can organizations distinguish a real attack with menaces from an entirely simulated one?

Judging from published examples, not easily, at least for a non-expert. The letters had Boston postmarks and a city center return address, links to Tor data leak sites associated with BianLian and, in two cases, an example of what was claimed to be a compromised password.

“We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money. Our industry only works if we hold up our end of the bargain,” stated the attackers in a letter analyzed by Guidepoint Security.

“If you follow our instructions and pay the full requested amount on time, all of your company’s data will be permanently destroyed and none of it will ever be published,” the letter continued.

A clue that something is amiss is simply that the attackers would use a letter to communicate. There is no record of this tactic being deployed before by organized ransomware groups such as BianLian and for good reason: sending demands by post is uncertain and very slow.

Letters sent to multiple organizations were also identical to one another, Arctic Wolf noted, apart from small variations tailoring text for each recipient. This is the same tactic used by random email attacks and smacks of opportunism. They also refused to negotiate and offered no channel to do this. In ransomware circles, that is almost unheard of.

That said, sending demands by letter does have a useful characteristic: they won’t be filtered by spam systems which makes them more likely to be read by someone.  It’s a form of social engineering in which if even one company falls for the tactic out of a thousand letters, the pay day will make it worth the effort.

If stolen credit cards are used to pay for the postage costs, it’s probably also cheap or even free with the letters themselves sent via print-to-mail services that feed them to the US Postal Service.

Ransomware impersonation is nothing new. In 2019, organizations across the US reportedly received emails deploying the same fake breach modus operandi as the recent letter writers – ‘pay up now because we have your data’. In truth, such campaigns are probably commonplace but are dismissed as obvious ruses and rarely reported on.

However, by 2023 the tactic had evolved into something more sophisticated with a separate campaign backing up its bogus threats by attaching snippets of genuine data culled from dark web trawls. This raises a disturbing possibility: the organization has been breached but the group threatening them is not one who carried out the attack.

Underlying all this is how organizations should defend themselves in practical ways against yet another fraud tactic.

“Attacks like this are unlikely to succeed in the majority of cases, but the perpetrators only have to have a small number of victims fall for it for it to be a big pay day for them,” cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley said via email.

The first line of defense against this type of attack is simply to develop a process to deal with it, he said. Incidents like this should be reported internally to increase awareness of the scammers’ techniques. At the same time, every ransom threat should be reported to the IT team as well as to the security companies supporting the organization.

Attackers would typically include evidence that data has been exfiltrated in the form of genuine data. However, organizations need to be careful they aren’t being tricked:

“These protocols include verifying the authenticity of any ransom demands. It is important to establish whether that data could have been stolen in an earlier data breach or may have been collected from a different third-party source,” said Cluley.

Cluley also stressed the need for organizations to have a response plan that could assess the possibility of a breach itself while engaging with law enforcement.

“There should be named members of staff in your plan who coordinate communications with any potential extortionist, who ensures that all relevant departments are involved in any important decisions. Make sure that you engage with law enforcement. If you have received a fake ransom snail-mail, chances are that other businesses have as well,” said Cluley.

Ransom demands are always designed for their shock value, agreed John Shier, Field CISO at security vendor Sophos. Sending a demand by letter was unusual but that might be the point.

“Teams need to bring awareness of this latest scam to their leadership. If an organization receives a letter, they shouldn’t panic, but they still need to investigate if there is any basis to the claim,” he said.

“At the very least, companies should review network logs for any unauthorized access and large data transfers that don’t conform to normal patterns. While it appears that the letters are fake, some due basic diligence needs to be performed to rule out a data breach,” he said.

Patients with disabilities are less likely to feel health care workers treat them respectfully, according to new research from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, patients with disabilities were also significantly less likely than those without disabilities to say that their providers gave them information that was easy-to-understand. The findings are published this month in Annals of Internal Medicine.

"People with disabilities make up 20 percent of American adults. This group already faces multiple barriers to accessing care, and they have large disparities in health outcomes. When they perceive disrespect from their providers, it can make them less proactive in engaging with the health care system, especially preventative care," said Mihir Kakara, MBBS, MSHP, who led the study as a neurology fellow at the Perelman School of Medicine and is now an assistant professor of Neurology at the NYU Grossman school of Medicine. "It is easy to imagine these patients not following up on certain recommendations-for example, getting that repeat brain scan to follow up on a certain lesion-if they don't feel respected." 

Overall, 2.9 percent of people without disabilities reported that they felt their providers didn't treat them with respect. But among patients with disabilities, 4.8 percent reported feeling that way.

A narrower analysis revealed greater disparities for patients with conditions affecting vision, hearing, mental health, and cognitive abilities. The proportion of respondents with these conditions who felt disrespected was nearly twice that of those without disabilities.

These findings prove that we must continuously strive toward ensuring our patient care is culturally humble and inclusive. While we have clear standards from the Americans with Disabilities Act, they should be the floor that medical professionals build upon, not the ceiling we strive for. We are seeing where great strides need to be made." 

Jaya Aysola, MD, DTMH, MPH, senior author, associate professor of General Internal Medicine and executive director of the Penn Medicine Center for Health Equity Advancement

Data analyzed in the study was pulled from 2017's National Health Interview Study. Almost 23,000 of the study's participants who had visited a health care provider in the last year were asked about their providers' "cultural competence"-sensitivities to different people's circumstances and customs. Among them, almost 5,000 of the participants-roughly 20 percent-identified as having a disability, roughly in line with reported national averages.

Participants in the 2017 study were asked whether their provider gave them instructions that were easy to understand. Wide gaps were found between those with disabilities and those without: 11.3 percent of patients with disabilities didn't feel health care workers explained things well, and 7.1 percent of those without disabilities felt the same.

At least 13 percent of those with either vision, hearing, mental health, or cognitive conditions all felt that they weren't given easy-understand directions.

Patients had also been queried whether their providers "asked opinions about their care." Here, the researchers found that a significant number of respondents both with and without disabilities expressed that their providers did not ask their thoughts: 41.1 percent of patients without disabilities said they weren't asked, compared to 44.9 percent of patients with disabilities. Again, those with visual impairments reported significantly worse experiences.

In 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) officially designated people with disabilities as a population demonstrating disparities in health driven by social disadvantages. That designation meant that more NIH funds could be used to support that underserved population with research. 

Moving forward, Aysola and Kakara believe there should be follow-up studies examining the potential health implications for patients with disabilities who feel disrespect from their providers or have trouble understanding what they're being told.

They also see opportunities to examine the effect of system-level policies, and call for ensuring a patient-centered care approach in every setting. 

"It's about empowering and meeting the needs and preferences of our patients," Kakara said. 

When patients have disabilities, patient-centered care can involve, as an example, maintaining eye contact and speaking directly to them, rather than only addressing their family members. Another example is printing out instructions with large font for those with low vision.

"Patient-centered care models have now been adopted by many health care systems, but there is still a critical gap in providing disability-inclusive care in medical education and training, and our analysis highlights a need to incorporate such disability-specific training into our daily practice," Kakara explained. 

Kakara was funded by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality T32 training grant during the period of this study.

The Trump administration is looking to roll back staffing at the department charged with caring for American veterans by firing as many as 80,000 workers who were hired as part of a Biden administration initiative to improve care and cover veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances.

The plan is laid out in a memorandum, first reported on by Government Executive, which came from VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek and calls to reduce the number of employees on the payroll to 2019 levels.

It instructs top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganization in August to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure."

The memorandum also calls for agency officials to work with the White House's Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to meeting objectives laid out by the administration, which has started a concerted effort to reduce the number of people on federal payrolls.

In public social media posts, Musk, the world’s wealthiest man and a prominent Trump campaign donor, has alluded to presidential election results in the District of Columbia — a heavily Democratic city that has never given its electoral votes to a Republican candidate — as justification for slashing the federal workforce.

Veterans have already been speaking out against the cuts at the VA, which so far have included a few thousand employees and hundreds of contracts. More than 25 percent of the VA's workforce are veterans themselves.

In Congress, Democrats have decried the cuts at the VA and other agencies, while Republicans have watched the Trump administration's changes with caution.

Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veteran's affairs, said in a statement that the Trump administration "has launched an all-out assault" against progress the VA has made in expanding its services as the number of covered veterans grows and includes those impacted by toxic burn pits.

"Their plan prioritizes private sector profits over veterans' care, balancing the budget on the backs of those who served. It's a shameful betrayal, and veterans will pay the price for their unforgivable corruption, incompetence, and immorality," he said.

In brief: Quipt Home Medical cooperates, Bellevue Healthcare grows, Tennr hires expert                             

News

By HME News Staff

Updated 11:02 AM CST, Wed March 5, 2025

CINCINNATI – Quipt Home Medical says David Kanen, Philotimo Fund and Kanen Wealth Management have agreed to withdraw their notice to solicit proxies in support of four director candidates in opposition to those recommended by the company. 

As part of a new cooperation agreement, the company's board of directors has granted Kanen certain board access rights for as long as Kanen maintains aggregate beneficial ownership of at least 3.5% in the company’s outstanding shares. This includes the right to request and conduct quarterly discussions with either the chairman of the board or another non-executive director designee of the board. 

“We want to thank Kanen for their constructive discussions and valuable insights,” said Mark Greenberg, lead independent director of the board. “We appreciate the perspectives of all shareholders and welcome ongoing engagement as management executes on our strategic growth plans to drive long-term growth.” 

As part of the agreement, Quipt has also agreed to establish a new committee of the board to review and provide analysis and non-binding recommendations pertaining to Kanen’s previously communicated recommendations on corporate governance and other areas related to the company’s operations. 

Additionally, Kanen has agreed to a customary standstill, a voting commitment and other provisions. 

“We appreciate the company’s willingness to engage with us and its commitment to maximizing value for Quipt shareholders,” said David Kanen, president and CEO of Kanen. “The formation of this committee is an important step, and we look forward to working constructively with the company to help unlock long-term value.”

Study: Sleep apnea linked to increased risk of Parkinson’s, but CPAP may reduce risk 

MINNEAPOLIS – People with obstructive sleep apnea have an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, but if started early enough, CPAP therapy may reduce that risk, according to a preliminary study released March 2, 2025, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 77th Annual Meeting taking place April 5–9, 2025, in San Diego and online. 

The study found using CPAP within two years of a sleep apnea diagnosis reduced the risk of Parkinson's. 

"Obstructive sleep apnea is common, and previous research has found when untreated, it is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke," said study author Gregory D. Scott, MD, PhD, of the VA Portland Health Care System in Oregon. "While our study found an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, the good news is people can do something about it, by using CPAP as soon as they are diagnosed with the sleep disorder." 

For the study, researchers reviewed more than 20 years of medical records to identify nearly 1.6 million veterans who had obstructive sleep apnea and nearly 10 million veterans who did not. 

Researchers looked at rates of Parkinson's disease five years after a sleep apnea diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex and health factors such as smoking, researchers found among people with sleep apnea, there were 1.8 more cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people compared to people without sleep apnea. 

Of participants with sleep apnea, 10% had documented use of a CPAP machine. These participants were divided into two groups: Those who received a CPAP machine within two years of their diagnosis and those who received one after two years. 

Researchers found similar rates among people with sleep apnea who started CPAP after two years as those who did not use CPAP, with 9.5 and 9 cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people respectively. However, researchers found a lower rate of Parkinson's among those who started CPAP early, within two years of diagnosis, with 2.3 fewer cases per 1,000 people when compared to people who did not use CPAP. 

"It is encouraging to know that while obstructive sleep apnea may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease, treating it right away with CPAP may reduce that risk," said Scott. "Future studies are needed to follow people more closely after receiving a sleep apnea diagnosis and over longer periods of time." 

A limitation of the study was that, while researchers could identify which people had a CPAP device, they were unable to tell if people used the treatment daily, as prescribed. 

The study was supported by the U.S. Veterans Administration and the U.S. Department of Defense. 

Bellevue Healthcare expands in Oregon 

‘Our vision has remained unchanged, to serve every household in Washington, Oregon and Idaho with same day delivery service, and the Salem location brings us one step closer to that’ 

BELLEVUE, Wash. – Bellevue Healthcare will open a new location in Salem, Ore., later this month, its 22nd brick-and-mortar location. 

Located at 2661 Cascadia Industrial St SE, directly across from the Salem Municipal Airport, this new branch will provide a full range of mobility and respiratory equipment, as well as serve the equipment needs of hospice customers.

NCART update: Two more states approve power seat elevation 

LUBBOCK, Texas – The Medicaid programs in North Dakota and Idaho have given the green light to power seat elevation, according to NCART. In North Dakota, the Medicaid program has approved the organization’s request to consider power seat elevation (E2298) as a covered benefit and has implemented coverage retroactively back to Feb. 1, 2025. The coverage criteria will be the same as those outlined in the National Coverage Determination and reimbursement will be set at $2,062.20. In Idaho, the Medicaid program has approved NCART’s request to extend coverage for power seat elevation (E2298) to recipients over the age of 21, effective immediately, with certain criteria. Those criteria: must meet power wheelchair coverage; and unable to independently stand or pivot transfer; and limited reach and range of motion that prohibits ability to perform MRADLs independently; requires assistance only with transfers across unequal seat heights; and cannot safely transfer using a lift or standing transfer but can safely transfer independently with the seat elevation feature. Reimbursement will be set at 75% of MSRP. If the pricing documentation is the invoice, reimbursement will be at cost plus 10%, with the addition of shipping if that documentation is provided. 

BOC looks to Joshua Mullins to ‘grow community’

ABC debuts POP Month 

ALEXANDRIA, Va. - The American Board for Certification in Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics (ABC) on March 3 announced the start of POP Month, a celebration of 15,000 prosthetic, orthotic and pedorthic (POP) professionals who custom design and fit devices that help people improve their lives through better mobility. More than 30 national organizations will commemorate POP Month by recognizing the achievements of POP champions, students, educators and practitioners. "POP professionals have an immense impact on society by helping people of all ages and backgrounds improve their mobility," said Catherine Carter, ABC's executive director. "It's an honor to celebrate these health care heroes and the profound difference they make in people's daily lives." ABC says POP professionals serve more than 5.6 million people in America who live with mobility limitations due to chronic illness, limb loss or other conditions. As part of POP Month, the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, Amputee Blade Runners, Hanger Clinic, National Commission on Orthotic and Prosthetic Education and others will host open houses, speak at schools and recognize employees. POP ambassadors—practicing health care professionals from around the United States—will also share stories and experiences from their interactions with thousands of patients.

ACHC renewed as deeming authority for home health accreditation 

CARY, N.C. – The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) has received continued approval from CMS as a national accrediting organization for home health agencies (HHAs). This renewal, effective until 2031, affirms that ACHC’s accreditation program meets or exceeds Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs) for HHAs. “ACHC remains committed to delivering high-quality, patient-centered accreditation services that help home health providers ensure compliance with CMS requirements while driving excellence in care,” said Susan Mills, ACHC senior program director. “This six-year renewal reflects our dedication to upholding the highest standards in the home health industry and supporting agencies in their mission to deliver outstanding patient care.” Deeming authority allows ACHC-accredited home health agencies to demonstrate compliance with Medicare CoPs without undergoing routine state surveys. Instead, ACHC conducts rigorous accreditation surveys that assess HHAs on critical operational and clinical performance standards, ensuring quality and safety in home-based health care services. To achieve continued CMS approval, ACHC underwent an extensive evaluation process, which included a comprehensive review of ACHC’s accreditation standards to ensure alignment with federal regulations, an assessment of ACHC’s surveyor training and performance to ensure consistency and effectiveness, a comparison of ACHC’s accreditation process with CMS survey requirements, including monitoring noncompliance and responding to deficiencies, and an analysis of ACHC’s ability to report survey findings and corrective actions in a timely manner.

The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center) and Flatiron Health are teaming up to make clinical trials more efficient by reducing administrative burdens on researchers.

The partnership brings Flatiron Clinical Pipe to CU Cancer Center and UCHealth, allowing clinical trial data to move directly from electronic health records (EHRs) to electronic data capture (EDC) systems.

The technology eliminates the need for manual data entry. Instead, it transfers information directly from the EHR to trial databases.

The system is in use at over 85 academic medical centers and community oncology sites, covering more than 300 locations.

Clinical trials require massive amounts of data, and entering this information by hand is one of the most time-consuming parts of the research process.

Clinical Pipe integrates with UCHealth's EHR through Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs), an installation process that took about 11 hours.

Flatiron Health's Head of Research Network Emily Akin told MobiHealthNews that Clinical Pipe can help reduce the burden on clinical trial site teams, streamline data management, and accelerate study timelines.

The company recently published the first peer-reviewed paper on a commercially available EHR-to-EDC system that showed the average case report form completion time was just 37 seconds when using Clinical Pipe.

"That's ten times faster than manual data entry, which typically takes about 30 seconds per data point," Akin said. "With Clinical Pipe, it only takes three seconds."

The study, published in ESMO Real-World Data and Digital Oncology, found that researchers using Clinical Pipe transferred more than 11,000 data points and nearly 1,000 CRFs.

By automating this process, sites like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth can conduct more trials with greater ease, Akin said.

"By reducing the administrative workload, Clinical Pipe allows providers to spend more meaningful time with patients," Akin said. "This improved efficiency enhances the overall care experience for trial participants."

Faster data entry and reduced errors also mean fewer delays in research, which can speed up trial completion and bring new treatments to patients sooner, she said.

As handling sensitive patient data requires strict security measures, Clinical Pipe meets SOC-2 and HITRUST CSF certification requirements and complies with HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 regulations.

All data is encrypted during transfer and storage, ensuring privacy and protection.

Akin explained one of the biggest challenges in clinical research is making trials more accessible to patients, with many research sites struggling with administrative barriers that limit the number of trials they can run.

Clinical Pipe is designed to reduce these challenges, allowing institutions like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth to conduct more studies and expand research opportunities.

"This collaboration makes clinical trials more accessible by reducing the operational challenges that often limit trial availability at research sites," Akin said. "It allows institutions to efficiently conduct more trials and ultimately broadens patient access to research opportunities."

The Badger Project



An innovative healthcare approach that cuts out insurance companies— and with them, surprise charges — could get a boost in Wisconsin with the passage of a bill moving through the Legislature.

State Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara, a Republican from Appleton, has again introduced legislation that would exempt this newer model, called direct primary care, from health insurance law and regulations, as well as define the specifics of agreements between patients and those providers.

Direct primary care is a membership-based healthcare system in which patients pay a flat, monthly fee out of their pocket, rather than for visits and services. Most care is then covered by the membership fee. Proponents argue it gives doctors more time and personalized care with their patients and cuts much of the headache of dealing with insurance companies and surprise charges from out-of-network providers.

Cabral-Guevara, the chair of the Senate’s health committee, is also a nurse practitioner who runs her own healthcare practice.

“Direct primary care has become more popular over the years simply because insurance costs are going up,” she said.

Her bill aims to provide some protections for the young industry as it grows, the senator said, and also protections for patients, by defining and clarifying primary care agreements.

These types of laws, which have passed in states across the country, shield direct primary care practices from being regulated like traditional health insurance companies, reinforcing the model’s focus on direct patient-physician relationships without third-party payers, said Amanda Preimesberger, a physician and the founder of rootsMD, a direct primary care practice in Madison.

“Direct primary care agreements are not insurance plans,” she wrote in an email. 

Without clear legislation, regulators may classify them as such, subjecting direct primary care practices to complex regulations, like obtaining insurance licenses, that could force increased costs on them, Preimesberger noted. That would result in higher prices for patients, blowing up the entire premise of direct primary care, which can keep costs low due to the lack of middlemen.

Nicole Hemkes, a physician who founded Advocate MD, a direct primary care practice with several clinics in Dane County, said the vast majority of her patients also have health insurance on top of paying her membership fee, “but they are using us for the majority of their stuff.”

Folks with high deductible plans in the thousands of dollars likely have to pay for most healthcare services at a traditional clinic out of pocket, so buying membership-based direct primary care and using it for most of their healthcare on top of paying insurance premiums can often be cheaper for the patient.

“We are filling that gap,” Hemkes said.

Regarding the bill, Hemkes said she had “mixed feelings,” as she worries it might hold direct primary care practices to a higher standard than traditional ones, but overall she is supporting it.

A version of the bill has been introduced for several legislative sessions, according to Cabral-Guevara’s office. After passing both houses of the legislature with only Republican votes in 2019, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed the bill due to fears it might be discriminatory, the senator said.

Seeking to win over the governor, Cabral-Guevara got an opinion from the Legislative Research Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency that assists legislators in developing and analyzing bills, saying other laws on the books already offer discrimination protections. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case affirmed those protections for gay or transgender people, she noted.

The governor’s press office did not respond to messages asking if those things have changed his mind.



Potential drawbacks of direct primary care

Direct primary care does not make sense for everyone. Memberships do not cover everything, and patients still need to buy insurance so they are covered for major medical expenses and specialty care. But memberships are relatively inexpensive, generally around $50-100 per month depending on age and location, and may be cheaper than paying for healthcare services out of pocket under high-deductible plans.

Also, direct primary care memberships may not accept Medicare and Medicaid, limiting their access for some. And because it is not part of your health insurance, spending on memberships have no effect on your deductible.

Tim Hall, senior business intelligence developer at Piedmont Healthcare

Approximately half of the adults in the United States (116 million) have high blood pressure, or hypertension, with 91.7 million needing prescription medication in addition to lifestyle changes. As of 2017, the self-reported prevalence of hypertension in adults aged 20 and older in Georgia is 30.1% to 31.9%, reported Tim Hall, senior business intelligence developer at Piedmont Healthcare.

Piedmont Health is a not-for-profit health system with 1,755 locations serving communities that comprise 85% of Georgia's population.

"If patients were more adherent to their hypertension medications and blood pressure was better controlled, patients would decrease their risk for heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, which are leading causes of death, disability and high healthcare expenditures," Hall explained.

"Using prescription fill data and predictive analytics systems integrated into its health information systems, Piedmont Healthcare developed a project to identify the highest priority patients for intervention to increase their medication adherence rates, improving clinical outcomes and patient safety while meeting value-based care goals."

Initial results showed improvements in adherence measured by the proportion of days covered, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure values in the treatment group as well as a reduction in wasted clinician intervention.

Hall will be presenting results and much more in a HIMSS25 session entitled "Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence," Thursday, March 6 at 8:30 a.m. in Caesars Forum 115. Hall's co-presenters will be Dr. Thomas Wells and Melissa Robinson, PharmD, both from Piedmont Healthcare.

"In addition to these promising results, we want to share in the session our approach to the development of a predictive analytics model and the feasibility of implementation into an existing workflow within our population health department," he added.

Predictive analytics is playing a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in tackling medication nonadherence, he said.

"By integrating predictive analytics scores into electronic health record systems and other health information technologies, providers can identify at-risk patients and intervene earlier," he continued. "Incorporating additional prescription fill history from a population health management system further refines prioritization, allowing for more precise, data-driven decisions.

"Additionally, by leveraging intervention-level data and social determinants of health from EHRs, healthcare organizations can develop more targeted and potentially automated interventions to improve adherence and patient outcomes," he said.

Hall has plenty of advice he shares here and in his educational session.

"Leveraging predictive analytics and prescription fill data to inform and design patient interventions, we can positively impact medication adherence, which, in turn, improves patient outcomes," he explained.

"Developing a successful predictive analytics model and implementation is an investment, both of time and resources," he concluded. "A multidisciplinary team approach that includes developers, business owners, executives, operations, clinicians, analysts and other stakeholders will help to ensure success. Choosing metrics to measure the success of your predictive analytics project should include the clinical impact in addition to any other financial or operations problem your organization is trying to solve."

The Piedmont education session, "Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence," is scheduled for Thursday, March 6, from 8:30-to 9:30 a.m. in Caesars | Forum 116 at HIMSS25 in Las Vegas.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) —  Physician assistants from across Illinois gathered at the state capitol today to advocate for a bill aimed at improving healthcare access by removing certain restrictions on their practice.

The proposed legislation seeks to eliminate requirements that currently prevent physician assistants (PAs) from immediately assisting patients, such as the necessity for a specific physician agreement to practice medicine.

"Right now in Illinois there’s unfortunately a lot of red tape that doesn’t allow these physician assistants to get hired the way they should be and we need them," said Jayson Coble, a physician assistant with HSHS.

He added, "We're trying to modernize our practice act on our lobby day here at the state capitol in order to improve access for patients."

Nationwide, physician assistants account for more than 500 million patient visits each year.</p>

Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense.

Health systems have had the same workforce concerns for years. They’re scrambling to fill nursing shifts, struggling to attract and retain nurses, and spending far too much time and money on temporary staffing. Health system leaders have told me time and again they’re striving for workforce resilience, an emerging ideal that emphasizes the personal and professional wellbeing of the workforce — structurally, culturally, and on an individual level by prioritizing work-life balance.

It’s not a completely novel concept, but it’s trendy given the state of healthcare’s labor force. 

However, it’s not exactly congruent with health systems’ workforce strategies. Ask the average health system leader about how they manage their workforce, and you’ll get the same response you might have received in 2005. In fact, many are still relying on the same processes to fill shifts that they did when I was a practicing nurse nearly twenty years ago: spreadsheets, phone calls, last-minute texts. 


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

On big campuses where innovative new technologies are being used to save lives every day, these staffing habits may seem inconsequential. But they actually signal a much larger problem: healthcare’s workforce blueprint is out of date. 

Today’s nursing workforce is not the workforce of 20 years ago. If hospitals want to build a resilient workforce, they need to embrace flexibility. 

Flexibility and the modern workforce

Walk into any hospital and you’re likely to see a nursing workforce that spans five generations. Each has a unique expectation for their career, and a different perspective of flexibility. It’s not just about striving for work-life balance. It’s about finding ways to build a shift schedule that works for Gen Z nurses and Baby Boomer nurses, for nurse managers and hospital executives, and most importantly, for patients. 


					When it comes to managing inbound phone calls, underperformance has devastating cost implications.				

Younger nurses expect technology-driven solutions that allow them to manage their schedules from the palm of their hands. Mid-career nurses balancing family and professional responsibilities want stability above all — predictable but adaptable scheduling options. Older nurses approaching retirement may want to work just enough to keep their licenses active, or serve as mentors to newer nurses. 

Beyond generational preference, flexibility won’t mean the same thing for every hospital. For some, it might be an internal resource pool that enables full-time staff to float. For others, it could mean building staggered shift structures that can help rotate core staff out of a physically taxing three-on, four-off schedule. Some hospitals have begun leveraging an on-demand workforce to supplement core staff, bringing in on-demand nurses to supplement cultural workforce resilience programs. 

Change is hard. Uncertainty is uncomfortable. But the reality is, the old ways aren’t working anymore. Hospitals are in a hiring hole, straining against tightening budget constraints, and depending on a workforce that expects flexibility as a given — not a perk. The time to try new things is now. 

Designing a blueprint for today

If we could rethink care delivery overnight during the pandemic, why aren’t we applying those lessons now? In 2020 and 2021, health systems adapted on the fly — launching telehealth programs, restructuring shifts, and mobilizing both internal and external staffing resources. 

Somehow, once the pandemic began to wane, most health systems reverted back to the status quo, back to old ways that don’t work for a workforce and industry that has undergone rapid transformation. The industry missed a key opportunity to build on those gains.

New care delivery models present perfect opportunities to experiment with flexible workforce strategies. Hospital-at-home programs are gaining traction, requiring new, flexible staffing approaches. Those that are able to tap into on-demand staffing resources will be better able to support full-time staff as they extend care beyond the four walls of the hospital. Forward-thinking health systems are testing the waters by staffing virtual nursing programs with nurses nearing retirement, and activating per diem nurses to fill the gaps left in facilities. 

Many older nurses want to remain in the workforce, albeit in a much less rigorous capacity. Developing formal mentorship programs — where experienced nurses can provide guidance, training, and support for incoming nurses — can help retain institutional knowledge that health systems cannot afford to lose, while providing additional career pathways. 

Health systems want to achieve workforce resilience, but the old staffing blueprint will never allow it. Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense. 

Flexibility is no longer a luxury. Today, it’s a necessity. The time for health systems to define what it means for them is now.

A shift toward strategic partnerships is underway, with RCM outsourcing budgets expected to riseMore than half of healthcare providers surveyed are actively exploring or testing gen AI use cases

BOCA RATON, Fla., March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- An overwhelming majority (85%) of senior healthcare executives surveyed believe AI will improve efficiencies in revenue cycle management (RCM) operations over the next five years, according to the results of a new Everest Group report, supported by Omega Healthcare, titled "Realizing the Promise of Tech-Enabled, AI-Driven Revenue Cycle Management (RCM): Outsourcing in the New Era." The study highlights how healthcare providers are leveraging AI-enabled technology services (such as gen AI and agentic AI) and a shift to more strategic outsourcing partnerships to address challenges, enhance financial performance, and streamline revenue cycle processes.

"The hope and promise of AI, gen AI and agentic AI are no longer just hype," said Anurag Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder, Omega Healthcare.  "While the technology is important, it is only part of the equation. To fully harness the power of AI it will become increasingly critical for healthcare providers to work with the right partners."

Shift to More Strategic RCM Outsourcing PartnershipsAs gen AI investments continue to accelerate, more than half (51%) of healthcare leaders polled expect an increase in RCM outsourcing budgets by 2030, emphasizing the significance gen AI will have on the sector.

"More than seven in 10 (71%) healthcare executives surveyed are planning to evolve from transactional relationships to strategic partnerships, and nearly half (49%) are interested in end-to-end RCM outsourcing to a single service provider," noted Mehta. "Long-term success will be defined by selecting a partner who can serve as a trusted advisor capable of delivering not only the technology, but also a comprehensive fusion of ongoing digital innovation, healthcare expertise, services as solutions, and proven operational and cybersecurity excellence."

Gen AI: Propelling RCM TransformationInterestingly, the survey found that more than half (51%) of healthcare providers are actively exploring gen AI in RCM, with 22% already testing proof-of-concept initiatives and 29% in the consideration stage, evaluating use cases and potential challenges. Although adoption varies by organization size, the overwhelming consensus is that gen AI will play a critical role in automating manual processes, improving billing accuracy, and reducing claim denials.

"As a benefit of the gen AI investments we have already made so our customers do not have to, our clients are already putting gen AI use cases into action and are seeing meaningful results across RCM functions," said Vijayashree Natarajan, SVP & Head of Technology, Omega Healthcare.  "The Omega Digital platform, powered by AI/gen AI/agentic AI solutions, is helping to enhance business outcomes for our customers, such as ~20-25% collections improvement; ~ 25-30% aged AR reduction; and ~ 30-35% improvement in charge lag."

Top Five Gen AI Use CasesRCM leaders' top five gen AI use cases are: Real-time eligibility and benefits verification; Claims data analysis and pattern recognition to avoid future rejections; Gen AI chatbots to resolve patient queries (billing, payments, scheduling) and enhance experience; Documentation improvement through AI scribing; and Synthetic data generation and automated medical coding from clinical documents.

Barriers to AdoptionMajor challenges to gen AI adoption in RCM include a lack of in-house expertise, with about 80% of executives citing it as a key hurdle, and barriers integrating with existing electronic health records systems. Additionally, 46% of survey respondents consider gen AI a high priority but are awaiting regulatory clarity before committing to large-scale investments.

Future Investment PrioritiesEmerging RCM challenges, including the need for real-time claims tracking, the transition to value-based care models, and increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance, are also influencing investment decisions.

Looking ahead, RCM leaders are prioritizing cybersecurity, payer collaboration, and AI-driven automation:

About the surveyTo explore the impact and effectiveness of technology-driven RCM outsourcing, Everest Group, supported by Omega Healthcare, surveyed 41 C-Suite executives (CTOs, CIOs, CEOs), senior vice presidents, and directors of RCM Operations at US-based healthcare provider organizations. The study included organizations of all sizes and types, such as health networks, independent hospitals, independent physicians and physician groups, and ambulatory surgical centers, and DMEs.

Strategies to combat rising cyber threats in the healthcare industry



Editor’s Note: This article was originally published in 2024 and has been updated to include the EU Action Plan information.

Healthcare organizations are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, averaging 1,463 cyberattacks per week in 2022, up 74% compared to the previous year [i]. The healthcare industry has also ranked highest in data breach costs for 12 years in a row [ii]. The potential impact of a cyber incident is not just financial–the consequences can be fatal [iii].

Hospitals and healthcare providers are targeted for several reasons. First, they are vulnerable targets as attackers seek to exploit them for the notoriety of claiming they successfully shut down such critical facilities. Healthcare data is also in high demand on the dark web and can fetch a hefty sum for attackers.

Another major reason hospitals are targeted is that they have large operational technology (OT) environments with thousands of entry points. On the medical side, this includes a vast array of equipment, from MRI machines to ventilators. On the building side, it includes assets like fire and life safety systems, HVAC and access control. The sheer volume of assets provides an attack surface far larger than almost any other industry. Moreover, many of these systems operate on legacy frameworks, making them more susceptible to exploitation.

EU Action Plan on the Cybersecurity of Hospitals and Healthcare Providers

In 2023, EU countries reported 309 significant cybersecurity incidents in the healthcare sector, more than any other critical sector. These cyberattacks can delay medical procedures and disrupt vital services. In response, the European Commission unveiled a new EU Action Plan that focuses on:

1.      Enhancing prevention of cyber threats with enhanced preparedness measures

2.      Better detection and identification of these threats with near real-time alerts

3.      Minimizing the impact of cyberattacks to mitigate additional damage

4.      Deterring cyber threat actors with the use of tools such as the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox

It also proposes establishing a pan-European Cybersecurity Support Centre to provide hospitals and healthcare providers with tailored guidance, tools, services, and training. These measures aim to ensure the resilience and security of healthcare systems across Europe, safeguarding patient care and maintaining the integrity of critical healthcare infrastructure. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, the EU aims to create a robust defense against cyber threats, ensuring that healthcare services remain uninterrupted and secure.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers new requirements

In response to this increasing threat, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a concept paper [iv] in 2023 introducing new measures designed to help protect the sector from cyberattacks.

These measures include:

1. Establishing voluntary cybersecurity performance goals for the healthcare sector to help healthcare organizations prioritize cybersecurity practices.

2. Providing resources to incentivize and implement cybersecurity practices, such as the establishment of an upfront investments program to help high-need providers.

3. Implementing an HHS-wide strategy to support greater enforcement and accountability, which includes potential increased financial penalties for HIPAA violations.

4. Expanding and maturing the one-stop shop within HHS for healthcare sector cybersecurity, thereby increasing HHS’ incident-response capabilities.

The intent is to better equip hospitals with cybersecurity education and resources, as well as discourage noncompliance by strengthening HHS’ enforcement authority.

Healthcare organizations don’t know what they don’t know

A big security hole at many hospitals is lack of awareness. They may think their OT systems are secure when they’re not. For instance, the systems may be air-gapped, which means they’re not connected to the internet, but most of them must be patched or updated regularly. This might mean that, on the first of every month, the systems are connected to the internet to download the patches or updates and thus they are not truly air-gapped.

Even if the patching and updating are done via USB, those OT systems may still not be safe. A 2024 Honeywell USB Threat study found that 51% of the malware discovered was designed for USBs  [v] . Another risk is that many cyberattacks target third-party OT systems whose providers may have access rights to perform maintenance and upgrades. This opens the door to yet another threat.

Three steps healthcare organizations should take now

The pressure is on for healthcare organizations to fortify their systems against cyberthreats and put necessary controls and defense measures in place. Here are the top three steps they should take to get started:

1. Create an incident response plan. This is essential for hospitals to swiftly recover if they’re hit with downtime or if critical equipment, such as ventilators or HVAC systems, are targeted in a cyberattack. Without a plan in place, a hospital can’t get back up and running quickly and efficiently, and make sure its patients and staff are safe. This should be tested using tabletop exercises

2. Maintain a full asset inventory with vulnerability management and threat detection. The reality is that most OT and control systems have an IP connection, e.g., HVAC, energy management, security, access control, video/closed-circuit television, patient monitoring, fire systems, medical devices and other IoT. However, IT often doesn’t monitor or manage these connections for cyberthreats as closely as it monitors or manages its own systems. In most cases they’re not aware of all the devices on the OT network. It’s essential that hospitals know exactly what they have running in their environment on both the enterprise IT network and their OT network

3. Have a trusted partner.  Securing operational technology is a complex task that lies in the intersection between engineering and cybersecurity. It requires knowledge of the underlying devices, control systems and proprietary protocols that exist in the environment, combined with cybersecurity technology and the skills required to implement the necessary controls that reduce risk. For this reason, healthcare organizations must work with trusted partners and vendors who build products that are secure-by-design, understand the underlying technology and combine it with cybersecurity experience to help them realize their risk reduction and compliance goals.

Honeywell is in a unique position to help healthcare organizations comply with new regulatory requirements and reduce their cybersecurity risk. With 50+ years of building automation experience and millions of facilities worldwide using Honeywell technology, we understand the attack surface that healthcare organizations operate with and what controls are required to reduce it. We’ve delivered 7,000+ cyber projects in 130+ countries worldwide, with a broad portfolio of solutions and services from cyber assessments, incident response, patch management, network monitoring, endpoint security and more.

RICHMOND, Va. — Thousands of Virginians are navigating the loss of job-based health care following massive layoffs from the federal government.

Enroll Virginia is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that wants to help those who need to enroll in a new health care plan.

Director Deepak Madala says they’ve seen a sharp spike in calls for assistance, especially in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond, following the federal layoffs.

Many of these Virginians without work have not had to navigate the challenge of enrolling in non-work-related health care in years, according to Madala.

That’s where Enroll Virginia can step in. Their statewide team of assisters can provide free, unbiased advice to help you review all of the options you may have.

"Sometimes they think COBRA may be their only option, but unfortunately, COBRA can be quite expensive, especially if your employer is not paying for it," explained Madala. "But in some cases, COBRA is the best option. So it's one of those things of just looking at all of what's out there, and then seeing what you can qualify for."

It’s important that if you do lose insurance from your job, you act quickly because you only have 60 days to enroll in new coverage.

"Make sure you're starting to collect all of your medical needs," Madala explained. "So, you know, what prescriptions are you taking? What, if you have any upcoming appointments, things like that, just kind of collect and make sure you know what those are. And then when you go to a navigator or even an agent and broker, they can be better positioned to help you understand what the best plan, or, you know, kind of best option may be for your family."
