According to Crypto Rover, Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed skepticism about the immediate feasibility of Trump's proposed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, citing that Congress is not yet prepared to accept the related bill. This development suggests potential delays in the adoption of significant cryptocurrency-related legislation, impacting market sentiment and strategic planning for investors.

 Howard Lutnick said Bitcoin will likely be treated differently than the other assets tipped to be in the US crypto reserve. 

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration will unveil plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

In an interview with The Pavlovic Today, Lutnick clarified that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely have a special status in the country’s national cryptocurrency reserve, which will include Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP).

“The president definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” Secretary Lutnick said. “Now, there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies. And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

President Donald Trump has faced criticism since announcing on social media that the country’s crypto reserve would include assets other than Bitcoin. Critics say centralized altcoins should not be included alongside Bitcoin, which is the only decentralized commodity that can be used as a long-term store of wealth.

Even notorious Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff, who refused to invest in the digital asset when it was valued at less than $100, said he understands the rationale behind a BTC-only reserve but not one that includes altcoins.

In response, Lutnick reiterated Trump’s interest in a Bitcoin-only stockpile without dismissing the other assets in the proposed basket.

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently,” said Lutnick.

President Trump is scheduled to hold the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where up to 25 participants have been confirmed so far. The invite list includes Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

The summit reflects the US government’s historic pivot toward digital assets under President Trump, who vowed to make America the blockchain and crypto capital of the world during the election. 

Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission has established a Crypto Task Force to carve out a “sensible regulatory path” for the sector. The task force has already met with several industry representatives to better understand their regulatory pain points. 

Meanwhile, the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence has engaged with industry experts on a range of issues, from stablecoin regulations to which agency should be given spot market authority over crypto.

Ethereum developers on Wednesday initially celebrated a seemingly successful test of Pectra, the blockchain’s most significant upgrade since 2024, on the Sepolia test network. However, hours after the test, Sepolia began to encounter errors.

It was the second buggy test for the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which is designed to improve Ethereum's efficiency, user experience, and validator system. The issues have led to calls from some developers that the upgrade be delayed.

Wednesday’s Sepolia test was expected to be the final step before Pectra’s launch on Ethereum’s mainnet. Initially, the test appeared to succeed, but later, developers noticed empty blocks being added to the chain.

The Ethereum Foundation attributed the issue to "an issue with Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract," which "prevented many execution layer clients from including transactions in blocks." In other words, the problem stemmed from a misconfiguration specific to the Sepolia test, rather than a flaw with Pectra itself.

Ethereum Foundation developers said they "identified the root cause within minutes" and deployed a fix to restore the network’s normal function.

Despite this, the test has raised concerns about whether Pectra has undergone sufficient testing. The previous test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet also ran into configuration issues, that time caused by misconfigured validators.

"I do think the incidents on both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets warrant a delay to Pectra mainnet activation," Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital told CoinDesk. Kim noted that while developers may feel ready, the broader Ethereum ecosystem—including major smart contract applications and wallet providers—needs to be prepared.

Kim suggested that Ethereum’s developers "spend the time to set up additional testing infrastructure" before launching the upgrade.

Ethereum core developers are set to meet on March 7 to determine Pectra’s official launch date. Any delay could stir controversy among Ethereum supporters, who are already on edge due to a lagging ETH token price, leadership drama at the Ethereum Foundation, and mounting competition from networks like Solana.

Survey insights show a demand for crypto knowledge as Ripple funds the National Cryptocurrency Association.

Ripple has taken a step toward advancing crypto education in the United States by spearheading the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) launch.

The NCA is positioned as an independent, non-partisan organization with no political affiliations. Its primary goal is to provide educational resources and promote a deeper understanding of crypto.

According to a March 5 statement, the initiative has a $50 million grant from Ripple to increase crypto literacy and foster safe adoption nationwide.

Although Ripple is backing the NCA financially, Ripple CEO Brad Garlingouse clarified that the organization will function independently.

Garlinghouse explained that the firm was finding the initiative because of the importance of education in unlocking the potential of digital assets. He noted that the $50 million funding will support awareness campaigns and showcase how crypto benefits individuals nationwide.

The initiative follows a recent survey conducted with Harris Poll, which gathered insights from thousands of US crypto holders.

The results showed a strong desire for a greater understanding of digital assets, with 81% of respondents expressing a strong interest in learning about the emerging industry’s future.

Additionally, 76% of participants reported positive financial impacts from their crypto involvement, citing greater financial independence and learning and personal growth opportunities.

Considering this, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer and the newly appointed president of the NCA, emphasized that the organization’s role would be to make crypto more accessible.

He noted that the NCA will simplify complex concepts through easy-to-understand explainers and real-life stories from crypto users.

He added on X:

“NCA is here to cut through the noise and make sure everyday Americans have the facts, resources and tools, and support they need to engage with crypto confidently. If you’re already benefitting from digital assets in your life or your business, now’s the time to join us and share your story. If you’re just curious, we are here for you to learn more.”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Newscom)

President Donald Trump's push for the U.S. government to hold a strategic bitcoin reserve has won the support of some crypto bulls in the U.S. Congress despite doubts that it could be accomplished in the near term.

One prominent supporter, Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who introduced the bill for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve, said the lack of congressional support remains a major hurdle.

"It was hard for me to hear that my colleagues, even on my side of the aisle, were not ready," Lummis said at the Bitcoin Investor Day event in New York City on Friday.

She cited Tim Scott, chairman of the House Banking Committee, whom she said argued that "we might need to put a pin for a little while in the bitcoin strategic reserve because we're not there yet," Lummis said. She says the biggest hurdle facing the creation of a strategic reserve is a lack of congressional support.

In a series of social media posts over the weekend, Trump said his administration would move forward with a crypto strategic reserve, naming several tokens that would be included. The named tokens included bitcoin, ethereum, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano, all of which soared in value after Trump's post on Sunday afternoon.



Creating a strategic reserve would effectively establish an institutional price floor for bitcoin and other tokens included in the reserve.

The mechanics behind how a strategic reserve would be created and run are also a source of controversy and debate. It remains unclear if Trump can use executive powers to create a strategic reserve or if it would require an act of Congress.

One alternative is to create a strategic reserve out of bitcoin and other crypto already confiscated through the Department of Justice, although the mechanism of such a transfer remains unclear.

Lummis, an established bitcoin bull, is well-known for her advocacy of bitcoin in government. In July 2024, the senator introduced the bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, where the Treasury would hold all bitcoins for at least 20 years unless used to pay off federal debt. The bill, which is often cited as a concrete way the government can establish a strategic reserve, was referred to the Senate Banking Committee where it has remained.

In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Lummis owned roughly $250,000 of bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls, meanwhile, remain undeterred. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest CEO, told IBD she fully expects the U.S. government's confiscated bitcoin will ultimately be used to establish the crypto reserve. She also expects the government to sell some of its land and gold to fund more purchases of bitcoin. "I think we could do some diversification of our asset base and get to that $1 million bitcoin goal with those sorts of asset sales," she said.

Other pro-bitcoin voices say the one-two punch of a strategic reserve and reduced government regulation are set to provide crypto with its new catalyst for rising valuation. "With regards to regulation, I think it should be clear rules, I think it should allow for international competition," Matt Cole, Strive Asset Management CEO, told IBD. "You can't do business in a country if you don't know the law."

During the Biden Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission pursued multiple investigations with the intent of establishing whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were securities and therefore should fall under SEC jurisdiction, a key step in future regulation. Ongoing cases against Robinhood, Coinbase and other major entities were dismissed by the SEC under the Trump Administration.

Other bitcoin bulls are cooler on the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. "I don't really think a strategic reserve is absolutely necessary," Dan Tapiero, CEO and chief investment officer of 1RoundTable Partners & 10T Holdings, told IBD. Tapiero is a leading investor in crypto-focused businesses, with $1.5 billion invested in various crypto-related ventures and funds.

While he thinks a reserve would ultimately help the crypto market and help taxpayers, he remains pessimistic over the mechanics of creating a new reserve. "It's very complicated when you look at assets that a central bank or a treasury holds," he said.

But Tapiero remains supportive of the rapid pace the Trump Administration is taking to crypto. "It's just been fantastic, the speed of change," he said. "Over the medium term we're going to see that also lead to an increase in adoption."

Trump's strategic reserve posts have provided rocket fuel for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin soared past $90,000 per coin in late Sunday trades on Trump's posts, this after dipping just below $80,000 on Thursday.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were previously on a hot streak, hitting market highs following in December and January following Trump's election on expectations of lowered regulations and campaign trail promises of a strategic reserve. But earlier in February, the cryptocurrency took a beating over a risk-off mood from investors, fueled by Trump's tariff threats and fears about economic shakiness.

Adding to the earlier sour mood around crypto, a recent hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit saw more than $1.4 billion in ether stolen through a sophisticated attack on a cold-to-warm wallet transaction. CEO Ben Zhou claims Bybit remains solvent.

New survey reveals consumers are benefitting from crypto in many ways but crave more education


Visit NCA.org to learn more and meet some of the everyday people benefitting from crypto in their personal and professional lives.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a new non-profit organization dedicated to helping Americans better understand crypto, launches today with the goal of boosting crypto literacy and safe adoption across the country. The NCA will demystify crypto and serve as a resource for anyone and everyone using, holding, or wanting to learn more.





“Crypto going mainstream is no longer a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’,” said Stuart Alderoty, President of the NCA. “Millions are already benefiting from crypto making it quicker and easier to shop online, send money anywhere in the world, create apps, art and games, or build financial futures. We’re giving a voice to users from all walks of life and serving as a guide for how to use crypto responsibly.”



The NCA partnered with Harris Poll to survey 10,000 current crypto holders in the U.S. and found that 81% are interested in learning more about the future of crypto. To bridge the gap, the NCA is providing educational resources, including easy-to-understand explainers and real stories from everyday people using crypto.



“The opportunity for crypto - especially in the US - is now stronger than ever,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. “That’s why I’m proud to announce that Ripple will be funding the NCA with a $50 million grant to educate, raise awareness and shine a spotlight on all the positives that crypto is bringing to people across the country.”



The survey also found that one in five American adults already use crypto and 76% of users say it has positively impacted their lives, giving them increased financial independence, opportunities for learning and personal growth, and fun and excitement from being part of a new and innovative field. Crypto is also providing opportunity for consumers far beyond finance:

About the National Cryptocurrency Association:



The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) is a 501(C)(4) organization dedicated to educating consumers about how to engage with crypto. Crypto is positively impacting the lives of millions of Americans but misinformation has held back those who stand to benefit. The NCA is here to help people make sense of crypto by sharing the stories of real people and businesses using crypto, providing educational resources to navigate the hype and confusion, and offering guidance and support through partnerships and services.



Harris Poll Survey Methodology



The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the National Cryptocurrency Association among 10,000 cryptocurrency holders. The survey was conducted January 22, 2025, through February 3, 2025. More detailed findings will be published in a report in March.



Data are weighted where necessary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, employment, household income, and political party affiliation to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.



Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within ± 1.2 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.



All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

You can’t really get a more bearish chart for BTC than this:

In my opinion, the future is very likely to unfold like this:

Only an incredible event can turn this around. $60,000 is a destination, and $40,000 is a possibility.

So, we have the U.S. Crypto Reserve becoming a thing. We have the SEC, etc., lifting its boot from crypto’s neck. We have trade wars, global conniptions, and all the other random factors that are supposed to propel bitcoin to the moon – and yet, the chart looks like a classic developing bust.

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Gold is for war, and bitcoin is for flight. You can see Ukrainian interests selling, buying, and selling their flight capital as the news flow surges back and forth.

So, what’s the big picture?

The U.S. economy is about to go into a tailspin because of tariffs – unless this is ‘3D Chess’!

Tariffs are a sales tax on Americans – a big, flat tax on everyone. The foreign suppliers don’t pay the tariff; the importer does. It’s a trillion dollar tax increase. If new money isn’t printed, a depression ensues. This leads to stagflation or stag-deflation – a drop in GDP. Then, the U.S. government cuts 15% from its spending. That triggers an even deeper economic collapse as the money stops circulating, a million government employees join the unemployment lines, and terrified consumers stop spending, causing the economy to fold.

So what does this mean for crypto? Crypto needs fiat inflows to rise in fiat price. When money’s too tight to mention, inflows reverse.

Does anyone think the stock market is going to keep rising like ‘homesick angel’ now? Can anyone not imagine the Nasdaq at 15,000?

Even if the current administration plays the situation like Paganini plucking a Stradivarius, the disruption already underway is going to knock the froth off risk assets – because only stability unleashes risk assets, while real risks kills them dead.
