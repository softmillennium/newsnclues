Inspira Technologies* reports groundbreaking clinical results for its AI-powered HYLA blood sensor, achieving 96% accuracy in a key parameter and 92.3% accuracy in detecting oxygen deficiencies. These impressive findings provide new validation the company's innovative non-invasive monitoring technology and strengthen its position in both the $5.7 billion blood gas analyzer market and the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market. With FDA submission on track for H2 2025 and the INSPIRA ART100 system already being deployed to U.S. hospitals, the company continues to build momentum in its multi-pronged strategy to revolutionize critical care.


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PESG Research releases an update following groundbreaking clinical evaluation results: Inspira Technologies* (NASDAQ: IINN) has reported exceptional clinical study outcomes for its HYLA blood sensor, with 96% accuracy achieved in a key parameter compared to traditional blood analyzers. This milestone achievement validates the company's AI-powered continuous blood monitoring technology and accelerates its path toward commercial deployment in multiple healthcare settings.





Promising Clinical Validation at Premier Medical Institution



The clinical study, conducted at Sheba Hospital (ranked among the world's top 8 hospitals by Newsweek), successfully demonstrated the HYLA sensor's capabilities across 6 patients undergoing open-heart surgery. The clip-on device monitored blood parameters in real-time as blood circulated through the cardiopulmonary bypass system, achieving impressive concordance with conventional laboratory testing methods. Notably, the study also validated a new indicator for identifying oxygen deficiencies, showing 92.3% accuracy – a critical capability for preventing hypoxia during surgical procedures.



This clinical validation at one of the world's premier medical institutions represents a significant de-risking event for the company's core technology. As Dagi Ben-Noon, CEO of Inspira, noted, "Achieving 96% accuracy as reflected in our clinical results in real-time blood monitoring without the need for blood draws represents a significant technological breakthrough."



Expanding Technology Ecosystem Shows Commercial Progress



The successful HYLA clinical results come amid accelerating commercial momentum for Inspira's broader product ecosystem. The company's INSPIRA ART100 system, which received FDA 510(k) clearance in May 2024 for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, is now being deployed at leading U.S. hospitals through distribution partner Glo-Med Networks. The system was recently enhanced with new support features designed to assist medical teams, reduce staff overhead, and improve efficiency during critical procedures.



Additionally, in February 2025, Inspira reported positive initial results from its collaboration with Ennocure MedTech Ltd. to develop a novel bio-electronic treatment for preventing bloodstream infections. Ex-vivo testing demonstrated a 95% reduction in bacterial presence within 4 hours, showing promise for addressing the estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections related to intravenous lines occurring worldwide annually.



Inspira’s Strategy Targets Multiple High-Value Markets



The successful clinical validation of the HYLA blood sensor represents a crucial step in Inspira's strategy to penetrate multiple high-value medical technology markets. As a standalone technology, HYLA targets the blood gas analyzer market, which the company projects will reach $5.7 billion by 2030 (up from previous estimates of $2.5 billion). When integrated with Inspira's respiratory support systems, the technology strengthens the company's position in the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market.



Inspira's approach of combining AI-enhanced monitoring capabilities with innovative respiratory support solutions addresses a critical unmet need in healthcare. With approximately 20 million patients annually requiring mechanical ventilation globally and mortality rates exceeding 50% under current protocols, Inspira's technology ecosystem offers a potential paradigm shift in critical care management by enabling conscious patient treatment with continuous monitoring.

At ITB Berlin, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and Trip.com Group introduced a trailblazing report, Technology Game Changers: Future Trends in Travel & Tourism, which unveils the transformative technologies set to revolutionize the travel industry.



This forward-thinking report highlights 16 cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of travel across four key domains: Digital Technologies, Financial Technologies, the Future of Mobility, and Breakthrough Innovations.



The Future of Travel
The report predicts that, by the end of the decade, artificial intelligence will transcend its role in automating travel bookings and searches. AI agents are expected to rival human intelligence in handling a variety of travel-related tasks, drastically transforming the tourism landscape.



Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers. These innovations will redefine the way we experience the world.



Julia Simpson, President & CEO of WTTC, said: “The Travel & Tourism sector is in the midst of a digital revolution. From AI-driven personalisation to advancements in aviation sustainability, innovation is reshaping how we explore the world.  



“As travellers turn to social media, streaming platforms, and cutting-edge tech to inspire and book trips in real time, platforms like Instagram are shifting from selling products to selling experiences. Meanwhile, technology is unlocking new adventures off the beaten track. 



“With innovation accelerating at an extraordinary pace, businesses embrace these advancements today will be the industry leaders of tomorrow.” 



Boon Sian Chai, Managing Director & Vice President of International Markets at Trip.com Group, added: “Travellers today expect planning and booking to be intuitive, efficient, and hyper-personalised.  



“At Trip.com Group, we are pioneering AI-powered travel assistance, Super Apps, and innovations to cater to, and even exceed such expectations. This report is also an essential guide for businesses looking to stay ahead of rapid digital change.” 



The Future of Travel Is Here
A recent report reveals exciting developments shaping the future of the travel and tourism industry, highlighting key trends that are already making waves.



AI Reshaping the Travel ExperienceArtificial Intelligence is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the industry, with 94% of leaders in the sector identifying it as essential. AI-powered services like TripGenie from Trip.com have seen a remarkable 200% increase in usage in 2024, revolutionizing the way travelers plan trips and engage with customer service, offering a more personalized and efficient experience.



Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.



Space Tourism Nears RealityOnce confined to the realm of science fiction, space tourism is now rapidly becoming a reality. With the accelerating development of infrastructure and rising consumer demand, the dream of commercial space travel is closer than ever, promising a new frontier for adventure tourism.



Transforming the Industry
The report stresses the urgent need for investment in digital skills and robust regulatory frameworks to fully harness the potential of these technologies.



With 91% of travel businesses planning to boost their tech investments, the industry is on the brink of its most profound transformation since the rise of the Internet. Exclusive insights from industry giants like Trip.com Group, Hilton, Qatar Airways, and MSC Cruises highlight how global leaders are already capitalizing on these innovations to drive change and enhance the travel experience for the future.

The report predicts that, by the end of the decade, artificial intelligence will transcend its role in automating travel bookings and searches. AI agents are expected to rival human intelligence in handling a variety of travel-related tasks, drastically transforming the tourism landscape.



Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers.

The Future of Travel Is Here
A recent report reveals exciting developments shaping the future of the travel and tourism industry, highlighting key trends that are already making waves.



AI Reshaping the Travel ExperienceArtificial Intelligence is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the industry, with 94% of leaders in the sector identifying it as essential. AI-powered services like TripGenie from Trip.com have seen a remarkable 200% increase in usage in 2024, revolutionizing the way travelers plan trips and engage with customer service, offering a more personalized and efficient experience.



Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.



Space Tourism Nears RealityOnce confined to the realm of science fiction, space tourism is now rapidly becoming a reality. With the accelerating development of infrastructure and rising consumer demand, the dream of commercial space travel is closer than ever, promising a new frontier for adventure tourism.

From fast horses to the internet, from type plucked by hand from a California job case to the Mergenthaler Linotype to computer typesetting, from presses hand-fed a single linen page at a time to electric-powered behemoths designed to spew out 70,000 complete papers an hour, The Providence Journal has ridden the crest of technology's wave for some 200 years.

As the paper closes its plant − moving print operations to a corporate cousin in New Jersey − it is only fitting to look back at the ways The Journal has used technology to meet the challenges of the times, constantly innovating the best way to gather and disseminate news to Rhode Islanders.

As The Journal retires the last flexographic newspaper press in the world, it bears recalling the ways Rhode Island's largest paper has helped innovate, and wondering what the next 200 years might hold.

Here is a brief look at some of the tools the paper used to be "a faithful reporter of the passing news," as its first publisher described it in 1820, nine years before it became a daily paper.

Jan. 3, 1820: Printer Honest John Miller, with the backing of Samuel Slater and other manufacturing leaders, establishes The Providence Journal, which publishes Mondays and Thursdays under the unwieldy title "Manufacturers' & Farmers' Journal, Providence and Pawtucket Advertiser." − with the period as part of its name.

July 21, 1829: First issue of The Providence Daily Journal, and General Advertiser. This four-page newspaper was typeset by hand and pressed, one linen page at a time, on an iron hand press capable of 240 impressions per hour.

1829: The Journal uses an early version of the Pony Express to deliver President Andrew Jackson's State of the Union address by horse 500 miles, from Washington to New York to Hartford to Boston to Providence to Journal readers, in only three days.

1846: Distant news begins arriving, at least partway, by telegraph.

1848: Providence ties into the New York-Boston telegraph line.

1856: A Hoe single-cylinder press, the first driven by steam power, comes into operation.

Jan. 26, 1863: After irregular issues of "Journal Extra" the previous two years, The Journal begins publishing The Evening Bulletin, a daily afternoon paper to bring news by telegraph from Civil War battlefields as well as updated financial reports.

1881: First web-perfecting press installed; it printed from a continuous roll of paper.

1885: Journal office lit by incandescent lamps powered by Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1886: First hand-drawn illustration to accompany a news story, about sailing.

1889: First typesetting machines in New England are installed, called the Mergenthaler Linotype.

1892: Journal builds a backup printing plant south of Rhode Island Hospital in case downtown is destroyed by fire. It would never be used.

1894: Presses powered for the first time by electricity from Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1903: Journal establishes wireless station at Point Judith; prints the Block Island Wireless, a daily paper published by The Journal on the island.

1912: Journal reporter Charles R. Stark Jr., at the New York City docks, asks Western Union to transmit the New York telephone book to tie up a telegraph line so he could use it to send the first interviews of arriving survivors after the sinking of RMS Titanic.

1918: The Journal stretches a sheet across Eddy Street outside the Old Journal Building next to City Hall and projects election result bulletins, a method used for several decades to bring breaking news to crowds who jammed the streets before the advent of radio took over newsflashes.

1925: First color comics section appears in The Sunday Journal.

1928: Journal becomes first paper delivered to Block Island by airplane.

1936: First use of AP Wirephoto, which transmitted photographs from distant news events over telephone lines.

1950: Journal licensed to use two-way radio for reporters and photographers.

1961: Spot color appears regularly in the news pages.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial regulator said on Wednesday it will launch a pilot program to relax merger and acquisition (M&A) loan issuance to technology firms, according to a statement released by the National Financial Regulatory Administration.

Under the pilot program, the proportion of such loans will be allowed to account for as much as 80% of a firm's total M&A transactions, up from no more than 60% under current rules, the regulator said. The loan term will be relaxed to a maximum of 10 years from the current seven years, it said.

The pilot program will cover 18 cities including Shanghai and Beijing, according to the statement.

Rare Dionysian Cult Fresco Uncovered in Pompeii, Revealing Secret Rites

Archaeologists have revealed a significant discovery in Pompeii—a large fresco depicting the initiation rites of an ancient mystery cult. The artwork, which stretches across three walls of a banquet hall, was found in the recently excavated House of Thiasus. The painting portrays maenads, female followers of Dionysus, engaged in hunting and rituals. Scenes of young satyrs playing the flute and offering wine sacrifices are also depicted. At the centre of the fresco, an elderly satyr is shown guiding a young woman through an initiation ceremony. The discovery sheds new light on the practices associated with the cult of Dionysus, a god linked to wine, revelry, and resurrection.

According to a statement by the Pompeii Archaeological Park, the fresco suggests that Roman initiates may have participated in hunting activities as part of their induction into the Dionysian mysteries. This aligns with earlier Greek traditions, where Dionysus was associated with the wilderness and untamed animals. The painting's vivid imagery, set against a deep red background, provides a rare glimpse into these secretive rites. The only other comparable fresco, discovered in 1909 at the Villa of the Mysteries, features similar figures but lacks any depiction of hunting.

Gabriel Zuchtriegel, Director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, said in an official statement that the fresco highlights a depiction of women breaking societal norms—dancing freely, hunting, and consuming raw meat. The presence of such imagery suggests that the cult's practices endured despite a Roman ban on Dionysian rituals in 186 B.C. The House of Thiasus and the Villa of the Mysteries both date back to the first century B.C., indicating that these secretive rites persisted long after they were officially outlawed.

As per a statement by Italian Minister of Culture Alessandro Giuli, the fresco represents an unparalleled historical record, offering insight into lesser-known aspects of classical Mediterranean life. Visitors to Pompeii can now view the House of Thiasus as part of the ongoing excavation tours, allowing a closer look at this rare and detailed depiction of an ancient mystery cult.
