French President Emmanuel Macron has told his country Russia threatens all of Europe, in a televised speech about Ukraine and security. Earlier, the US cut off intelligence sharing with Ukraine, which led to talk of new meetings. Listen to the latest episode of The World below.

Wednesday 5 March 2025 19:32, UK

Quite the statement from Emmanuel Macron now. 

The French president earlier mentioned France's nuclear deterrent (see our last post), but now returns to the subject. 

He cites the words of Germany's all-but-confirmed next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who said last month he wanted to discuss with France and the UK the possibility of extending their nuclear umbrella to cover his country. 

The UK and France are the only two nuclear powers in Europe. 

"We need reforms, we need to make choices, and we need to be brave," Macron says. 

"[Merz] has called for a strategic debate on providing that same protection to our European allies... whatever happens the decision will be in the hands of the president of the Republic and the heads of the army."

Macron also says he will hold a meeting of European army chiefs in Paris next week. 

"We need to prepare," the French president Emmanuel Macron continues. 

He repeats his willingness to commit French troops as a potential peacekeeping force in Ukraine if a ceasefire is reached.

He then addresses the American-sized elephant in the room. 

"I want to believe that the US will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case."

He previews tomorrow's European Council meeting, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend, and says it is a great opportunity for the nations of the continent to commit to rapidly increasing their defence spending. 

"France has to recognise its special status - we have the most efficient, effective army in Europe," he says, also noting that Paris has nuclear weapons to call on if necessary. 

Despite this, he says, it doesn't go far enough - so Macron now unveils new investments, but doesn't outline how it will be spent, although he appears to be referring to the defence sector. 

"These are new investments which will allow us to mobilise private financing and public financing without increases in tax."

"We are entering a new era," Emmanuel Macron tells his countrymen in a televised address. 

He quickly turns to Ukraine. 

"If a country can invade its neighbour in Europe and go unpunished, nobody can be sure of anything. 

"Beyond Ukraine, the Russian threat is real - it affects the European countries."

He also says that Russia is looking to rearm itself and is ramping up its defence spending. 

"President Putin is violating our borders to assassinate opponents, manipulate elections."

He also mentions how Russia has broken previous promises and guarantees.

It feels like the French president is gearing up to make some sort of announcement. 

The French president is set to address his nation in the next few minutes. 

Emmanuel Macron's pre-recorded speech, which you can watch below, is thought to be focused on the Ukraine crisis, European security and the threat of a transatlantic trade war amid the chaos wrought by Donald Trump in the US.

We've been following a White House press briefing which started just before 6.30pm UK time, and finished just now.

In our last few posts, we brought you the breaking news on Ukraine from the briefing. There was surprisingly little.

But Donald Trump's entire presidency is impacting the global economy and international affairs at the moment - so, if you're interested, we'll summarise some of the other key points from the news conference here.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt started by touting polling from YouGov for broadcaster CBS, which said 76% of Americans approved of Trump's speech to Congress last night.

She also attacked Democrats who opposed Trump's Congress speech - saying that one of the few moments when they applauded was for Ukraine - "not America".

Her answers also included:

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, has just said that Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement yesterday is a "positive step forward". 

The Ukrainian leader said Ukraine is "ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible" in the search for a "lasting" peace with Russia - and also that the disastrous White House meeting was "regrettable". 

Leavitt notes the statement, and says it can only be a move in the right direction. 

On the pause blocking US aid for Ukraine, she says: "They are reconsidering the funding for Ukraine... it's a pause for a review."

Talks on the minerals deal are happening "as we speak", she adds, but isn't drawn on when it could be signed.  

We're finally getting a few questions on Ukraine at this White House briefing. 

One reporter asks Karoline Leavitt why Volodymyr Zelenskyy's decision not to wear a suit in the Oval Office riled up White House officials - and potentially even Donald Trump himself - when ally Elon Musk didn't either. 

"Elon Musk wore a suit last night," she replies, dodging the fact the billionaire donned a T-shirt under a jacket and a cap during his visit to the Oval Office last month. 

Karoline Leavitt has taken to the podium for today's White House media briefing. 

She quickly recaps Donald Trump's marathon speech to Congress last night, but doesn't mention Ukraine.

As has become usual, she turns first to a reporter from a right-wing publication, this time the Daily Wire - which was set up by the outspoken Ben Shapiro about a decade ago.

The Wire's White House correspondent asks predictably friendly questions about how the Democrats reacted to Trump's speech last night and then on transgender people in sports - and we're forced to wait for any questions on what is arguably the biggest story of the day - Ukraine. 

Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Brussels tomorrow for a meeting of the European council, sources in Ukraine have told Sky News. 

It's a special summit - focusing on strengthening support for Kyiv and "European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine".

We're shortly going to be turning our attentions to the White House, where the daily media briefing is about to begin. 

It's being led by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

She'll be addressing the fallout from Donald Trump's major Congress speech last night. 

During the marathon address, the US president said Ukraine is ready to sign a minerals deal that Washington sees as key to reaching a peace agreement.

We'll bring you any key lines right here in this blog, but you can watch along in the livestream below...

 WASHINGTON — White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that U.S. officials have had “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas officials. 

 Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. Leavitt declined to provide detail on the the substance of talks. 

 "Look dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what’s in the best interest of the American people is something that the president has proven is what he believes is good faith, effort to do what’s right for the American people," she said. 

 Leavitt added that the Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, but noted that there are “American lives at stake.” 

 Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages — including Edan Alexander, an American citizen — as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. 

 The continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. President Donald Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn’t agree to terms to a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. 

 Adam Boehler, Trump’s nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, participated in the direct talks with Hamas. 

 The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. 

 The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials was first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios.

	The Department of Veterans Affairs is planning an aggressive reorganisation that includes cutting 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care for retired military members, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.


	The VA's chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top level officials at the agency that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000. That would require terminating tens of thousands of employees after the VA expanded during the Biden administration, as well as to cover veterans impacted by burn pits under the 2022 PACT Act.

	The memo instructs top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganisation in August to resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure. It also calls for agency officials to work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency to move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach to the Trump administration's goals.


	Veterans have already been speaking out against the cuts at the VA, which so far had included a few thousand employees and hundreds of contracts. More than 25 per cent of the VA's workforce are veterans themselves.


	In Congress, Democrats have decried the cuts at the VA and other agencies, while Republicans have so far watched with caution the Trump administration's changes.


	Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veteran's affairs, said in a statement that the Trump administration has launched an all-out assault" against progress the VA has made in expanding its services as the number of covered veterans grows and includes those impacted by toxic burn pits.


	Their plan prioritises private sector profits over veterans' care, balancing the budget on the backs of those who served. It's a shameful betrayal, and veterans will pay the price for their unforgivable corruption, incompetence, and immorality," Blumenthal said in a statement.


	Government Executive first reported on the internal memo.

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump’s first address in his second term to the joint session of the US Congress on Tuesday confirmed he is making five big bets straddling politics, foreign policy and the economy. How these play out in the next year is the big question.

Trump’s first bet is that he can dramatically downsize the US State and its regulatory apparatus, scale back its services, and reduce its international footprint. His support for the Department of Government Efficiency, praise for Elon Musk and recital of what Trump considered instances of waste, abuse and fraud on Tuesday show that this remaking of the American State will continue. This stems from an ideological conviction against big government, an economic calculus that this can help reduce the deficit, strategic logic that the US hasn’t gained from its commitments abroad, and a worldview that the US needs a far more focused set of interests. That much is now known.

What remains uncertain is whether Trump can do this without affecting core governance functions, sparking political backlash or harming America’s interests abroad. After all, abolishing agencies creates vacuums. Removing federal workers means work that no longer gets done. Eliminating regulatory oversight increases the chances of market failure and public harm. Withdrawing development assistance diminishes global influence and networks.

Trump’s second bet is that he can work with Russia, force Ukraine to accept peace terms that Washington and Moscow are comfortable with, and get Europe to handle its own security. Trump’s insistence that Ukraine offer a share of its minerals to the US, his rebuke to Volodymyr Zelensky last week, suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing, slight willingness to reopen doors to Zelensky after his somewhat regretful approach, open advocacy of direct talks with Russia, defence of Vladimir Putin, and consistently sharp messages to Europe all form part of this wider strategic play. This reflects his conviction that European security isn’t America’s perennial responsibility, his faith that the Atlantic can insulate America, and his belief that Russia poses no real threat to core American interests. This much is known.

The unknown is whether Trump can execute this balancing act without geopolitical costs. Maintaining dominance over the western alliance becomes difficult if Europe acts autonomously. Sustaining intelligence sharing across the Five Eyes network grows challenging if allies lose trust. Ensuring peace terms that leave a sovereign Ukraine intact becomes harder if Moscow feels emboldened. Preventing an empowered Russia from eyeing other Eastern European territories becomes more difficult if DC signals NATO commitment isn’t sacrosanct. And preventing this reset from signalling to China that territorial adventurism pays becomes harder.

Trump’s third bet is that he can reorder the international economic order to incentivise both American and foreign companies to invest in the US, force other countries to open markets to American goods, make the American market less accessible to foreign producers, and operate through bilateral deals rather than multilateral regimes. Trump’s attribution of recent US investment announcements to tariffs, his announcement of reciprocal tariffs from April 2, his message that non-tariff barriers will factor into determining reciprocal tariffs, and his defence of tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China all form part of this strategy. This reflects Trump’s conviction that others have exploited American openness, globalisation destroyed American jobs by making China the world’s production hub, and his faith in tariffs as the policy instrument to correct this while fulfilling his political promise to revive manufacturing and boost employment. This much is known.

The question remains whether this deliberate disorder will yield Trump’s hoped-for gains without corresponding costs. Increased tariffs shift burdens to importers and consumers, raising prices—contradicting Trump’s promise to keep prices low. Tariffs on close neighbours with intricate supply chain relationships can disrupt domestic industrial production. When tariffs trigger retaliation, American exporters including farmers—key parts of Trump’s coalition—suffer. Indiscriminate tariffs affect markets, that in turn concerns the New Yorker businessman in Trump. And if he appears too unpredictable as the self-styled “tariff king,” the world may pivot toward China rather than withdraw from it.

Trump’s fourth bet is to establish American dominance over the Americas. His instruction to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, from the stage, to take over the Panama Canal; repeated references to acquiring Greenland; criticism of Mexico as a den of cartels exporting illegal immigrants and fentanyl; earlier references to Canada as America’s 51st state; and reiteration of plans to build an iron dome to protect the homeland all align with this strategy. This appears to stem from Trump’s conviction that America’s core security interests require insulating the Americas from external (particularly Chinese) influence and ensuring that the US can call the shots from Greenland, through Canada, down to Mexico and Central America, all the way to Chile. This much is known.

The uncertainty is whether Trump’s strategy of coercion and vocabulary of threats will succeed in bringing countries into line, or whether American ultra-nationalism will trigger nationalist backlash among neighbours. Threatening to take over Canada angers even the most pro-American Canadian politicians. Calling Mexico cartel-controlled despite its reconciliatory actions alienates Mexican citizens. Forcing South American countries—many with China as their biggest trading partner—to make binary choices rather than offering incentives may backfire.

Trump’s four bets may succeed, given America’s immense power and Trump’s willingness to exercise it. So far, countries have sought bilateral deals with Trump to avoid his wrath. Those who had provoked him quickly sought reconciliation. Friends are nervous but value the relationship. Adversaries are wary but sense an opportunity to redirect American policy in their favour.

This reveals Trump’s hidden fifth bet. His address was conspicuously lacking a coherent policy statement on China. To be sure, the US has imposed an additional 20% tariff on China and there has been an absence of direct communication between Trump and Xi Jinping. But this marked the first time in years a US president didn’t characterise China as a peer-level adversary, mention the Indo-Pacific construct, address China’s military and economic threats in Asia, or even reference Taiwan—all against the backdrop of Trump’s signals that a deal with Xi is possible and desirable. How Trump ultimately plays his China hand, and how China responds, remains the major unanswered question after Tuesday. But the bets he has already made will transform America and the world in both anticipated and unanticipated ways.

 Further U.S. tariffs on imports would cause prices to rise and consumers to buy fewer products, Adidas chief executive officer Bjorn Gulden said on Wednesday as the business navigates higher levies implemented by President Donald Trump's administration on China, Canada, and Mexico.

Adidas has not estimated the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on Vietnam, its top manufacturing country, which President Donald Trump has threatened with higher levies, Gulden said.

"If there are 25% duties coming and it is on more countries, inflation will go up and volumes will go down," Gulden told journalists after reporting results. "We know that, but how much? I mean, we can give you a number, but the only thing we know is we will have to adjust very, very quickly."

Vietnam produces 27% of Adidas' total volume of products, followed by Indonesia at 19% and China at 16%.

But Gulden shrugged off the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, saying only a small portion of its product sold in the U.S. is made in China.

"We have less than 5% of our volumes going to the U.S. is (produced in) China," he said.

China warned it is ready for any “type of war” with the US in an alarming escalation as President Trump’s tariffs went into effect.

“If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said late Tuesday.

Tensions grew stiff between the two nations on Tuesday as Trump bumped up a 10% tariff on Chinese imports to 20%, claiming the trade measure would halt the flow of fentanyl into America.

Jian’s statement, reiterated on X by the Chinese embassy in Washington, cautioned that “intimidation” and “bullying” would not work — as China also imposed a 15% tariff on American agricultural goods.

“Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China. Anyone using maximum pressure on China is picking the wrong guy and miscalculation,” the spokesperson said.

Trump has justified his tariffs — 25% on Canadian and Mexican products and 20% on Chinese goods — by blaming the foreign nations for the fentanyl and opioid crisis in the US, saying they haven’t done enough to crack down on deadly and illicit fentanyl imports to justify pausing the tariffs.

China fired back, saying if the US “truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue,” the “right thing to do” would be to consult China with mutual respect.

Jian also defended China’s retaliatory 15% tariff on American goods, saying the country “has made clear its opposition” to the tariffs but must “defend our rights and interests.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth responded to China’s threats early Wednesday, telling Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” the US is “prepared” and doing everything he can to deter conflict with China.

“Those who long for peace must prepare for war,” Hegseth said. 

“That’s why we’re rebuilding our military. That’s why we’re re-establishing deterrence in the warrior ethos. We live in a dangerous world with powerful, ascendant countries with very different ideology.” 

“They’re rapidly increasing their defense spending, modern technology, they want to supplant the United States,” he continued. “If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.”

Hegseth’s warning came as Trump doubled down on his decision to roll out sweeping tariffs, claiming “other countries have used tariffs against us for decades.”

“And now it’s our turn to start using them against those other countries,” Trump told Congress.

Meanwhile, experts fear the cost of food and automobiles, among other goods, will swell as a result of the tariffs.

The tariffs will apply to about $1.4 trillion in Mexican, Canadian and Chinese imports, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. 

Trump also announced Monday that he would be adopting agricultural tariffs on April 2 to slap “reciprocal” levies on other countries, including European allies and Japan.

AFTER AMERICA announced on March 3rd that it is suspending military aid to Ukraine, it looks increasingly likely that Ukraine will have to depend on Europe. Donald Trump might be persuaded to reverse the suspension, for instance if Volodymyr Zelensky agrees to sign a deal on its minerals industry. A statement by Mr Zelensky on March 4th said that he was ready to sign, and to start peace talks, though it is not clear what Mr Trump’s response will now be. But the events of the last few days suggests that relying on America for weapons is no longer wise. A back-up is surely needed.

Could Europe fill the gap? On March 4th the European Union announced a programme to “Rearm Europe”. And even notoriously cynical financial markets are betting on a response of sorts. The combined market capitalisation of big European defence firms such as BAE Systems, Rheinmetall and Thales has soared by €40bn ($42bn), or 21%, in the past ten days. These firms are expected to raise their capital investment significantly in the next two years. That reflects optimism that defence spending will rise and that Europe’s military-industrial complex will be reinvigorated. Whether all that translates into a substitute for American aid for Ukraine is far less clear.

Start with money. Although it has given Ukraine €132bn in military and financial aid (more than America’s €114bn), Europe’s big countries could afford to do more. Over the past three years Germany and Britain have allocated less than 0.2% of one year’s GDP to Ukraine, about the same as America has. France, Spain and Italy have managed only half that. Christoph Trebesch of the Kiel Institute, a think-tank, points out that Germany spends three times as much subsidising diesel fuel. Europe has frozen €210bn of Russian assets, which could also be seized to help Ukraine.

As well as individual countries signalling a rise in defence spending as a share of GDP, on March 4th the head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the Rearm Europe plan. It aims to unlock up to €800bn ($845bn) by relaxing the EU’s debt rules so that members can boost annual military spending by 1.5% of GDP towards a new target of around 3.5%; creating a €150bn loan fund for programmes such as anti-missile systems; allowing more of the EU’s own budget to be spent on defence; and tapping bond markets and allowing the European Investment Bank to finance military projects. The plan will not immediately raise new funds but it could galvanise higher spending in time.

How will more cash change Europe’s defence posture and the course of the war in Ukraine? The good news is that Ukraine is not about to run out of crucial weaponry. Unlike in early 2024, when a freeze on aid by America’s Congress created severe difficulties, Ukraine should be able to keep fighting into the summer without fresh American supplies. An American officer says that the Biden administration shipped a lot of materiel before Mr Trump’s inauguration.

Ukraine is also rapidly expanding its own defence industrial base. During the Soviet era it had a mighty arms industry. Mr Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with American and European defence firms, such as Rheinmetall, of Germany and the Franco-German KNDS. Sir Lawrence Freedman, a British strategist, puts the figure even higher. Ukraine’s defence firms focus on producing drones of all shapes and sizes, electronic warfare systems and artillery.

Europe can funnel cash using an approach pioneered by Denmark in which it finances contracts between the Ukraine government and Ukrainian manufacturers. Last year Denmark in this way bought 18 domestically-produced Bohdana howitzers for the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s defence firms are fast-moving. Nico Lange, a former chief of staff in Germany’s defence ministry, says you can buy three Bohdanas for the price of a French Caesar gun, admittedly a more capable system.

Yet America was until this week still providing a large chunk of Ukraine’s military aid, the elimination of which will gradually cause serious strains. Because Europe emptied its military stockpiles early in the war, it will struggle to give Ukraine armoured fighting vehicles, howitzers and precision munitions. Tom Waldwyn, an expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says: “There is no point in rummaging around in a cupboard that has already been scraped clean.”

Europe’s defence industry is not expanding fast enough to fill key gaps. Sir Lawrence says the kit America has provided, such as Patriot interceptors and HIMARS rocket launchers, “is at the high end in quality”. Along with intelligence and logistics support, this is hard for Europe to replicate quickly. Cranking up complex, multinational programmes takes time. Eric Béranger, the boss of MBDA, a missile-maker that had record order books last year, admits that a system like the Franco-Italian Aster air-defence missile had been “developed in an era where time was not important”. Since 2022, however, “suddenly, brutally time matters”. The delivery time of the Aster has been cut from 42 months, but is still 18 months.

Plugging the gaps by buying off the shelf from abroad, often from American or South Korean companies, is tricky. Mr Waldwyn says that much of South Korea’s production over the next few years is already earmarked either for Poland, which has signed $16bn-worth of contracts since 2022, or for the country’s own armed forces. Good luck persuading Poland, which sees itself as a front-line state and has raised defence spending to 5% of GDP, to defer purchases of tanks and missile launchers.

Buying from America would appear to be the obvious step and one that the notoriously transactional Mr Trump might approve of. But Keir Giles, author of “Who Will Defend Europe?”, warns that if Mr Trump continues to regard Ukraine as the main obstacle to his peace deal, he might refuse American firms export permissions or demand limitations on the capabilities of any weapons they sell.

By far the best bet, says Mr Giles, is for Europe to use its own cash to invest heavily in Ukraine’s own defence companies. They are working at the cutting edge and know how to get new equipment to the front line within weeks or months. As one EU official notes: “Europe realises that it cannot produce the weapons that Ukraine needs. The easiest way to fill the deficit is for the Ukrainians to do it themselves.”

As for western Europe’s own defence, which America no longer seems committed to, the struggle is just beginning. Their armed forces, hollowed out by decades of neglect, have yawning capability gaps that must somehow be filled if America suddenly withdraws critical “enablers”. These include aerial refuelling, heavy lift, logistics and both airborne and space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. In addition, Europe is going to have to invest a lot in ground-based precision strike capabilities and air defence. For all of that, the EU’s package is not going to be enough. But it could be a start.

Coldplay performed at the 2016 Super Bowl half-time show with Beyonce and Bruno Mars

The 2026 World Cup final will stage a Super Bowl-style half-time show for the first time, with Coldplay helping to pick a "list of artists" to perform. 

The tournament, which will be co-hosted by the USA, Canada and Mexico, concludes with the final on 19 July 2026 at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. 

Though pre-match performances at showpiece occasions such as the Champions League final have become commonplace, there has never been a half-time show at a World Cup final. 

Half-times in the regular NFL season last around 15 minutes but they are extended up to 30 minutes at the Super Bowl in order to accommodate a half-time show. 

Fifa president Gianni Infantino says Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin and band manager Phil Harvey will help to establish a set of artists to perform in the 15-minute break at next year's final. 

"I can confirm the first ever half-time show at a Fifa World Cup final in New York New Jersey," Infantino wrote on Instagram.

"This will be a historic moment for the Fifa World Cup and a show befitting the biggest sporting event in the world."

The 2026 World Cup final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey 

Rap artist Kendrick Lamar headlined this year's Super Bowl half-time show in New Orleans, which drew record audience figures of 133.5m across the United States. 

The performance surpassed the long-standing record set by Michael Jackson in 1993. 

The likes of Rihanna, Beyonce and Lady Gaga have also performed in recent years, while Coldplay headlined in 2016. 

Between 25 to 30 minutes are allocated for Super Bowl half-time shows so that the various stages and equipment can be built and dismantled.

Russia has finished issuing passports to Ukrainians living in parts of the country seized by Moscow's army, officials said on Wednesday -- a process slammed by Kyiv as an illegal attempt to scrub the area of its Ukrainian identity.

Since launching its full-scale military offensive in February 2022, Moscow has pushed Ukrainians that live in the south and east of the country to become Russian citizens.

Those who refuse face restrictions on their movement and difficulties accessing public services, like healthcare and education provided by the Russian-installed authorities. Ukrainians who do not secure a Russian passport are classified as foreign citizens.

"Last year, the passportisation of residents living in the liberated areas of the Lugansk and Donetsk republics (and) Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, was virtually fully completed," President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of interior ministry officials in Moscow.

Russia claimed in 2022 to have annexed those four regions, despite not having full control over them.

Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said that 3.5 million passports had been handed out in total.

Even before its full-scale offensive, Russia was offering easy citizenship to residents of parts of Ukraine's Donetsk and Lugansk regions that were under the control of Moscow-backed separatists.

Kyiv has called the process "illegal" and a "gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty".

It has also been slammed by Western governments and rights groups, while the European Union does not accept the passports as legitimate travel documents.

US President Donald Trump addressed a joint Congress Tuesday (local time).

Donald Trump has vowed to construct a 'Golden Dome' - similar to Israel's 'Iron Dome' missile defence - as he build :"the most powerful military of the future". The first step, he told a joint sitting of the United States Congress is to fund a "state-of-the-art missile shield to protect our homeland".

Trump - who made a raft of eyebrow-raising declarations, many of which were fact-checked by American media and found to be false or incomplete, including comments about the price of eggs under his predecessor, Joe Biden - was referring to a shield against ballistic missiles, while are among the most complicated weapons systems to design, develop, and operationalise.

He claimed Ronald Reagan, the 40th US President, who served from 1981 to 1989, wanted to build a similar system but lacked the technology to do so. "Israel and other places have it... and the US should too," he said, "This is a very dangerous world. We're going to protect our citizens like never before."

Trump may have been referring to the Strategic Defense Initiative, announced in 1983 by Reagan to defend against Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles by intercepting and shooting them down. Plans for the system included space-based 'laser' weapons to track the missiles.

There were significant technological and even ethical challenges to the programme, which was eventually rendered obsolete after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

A ballistic missile defence shield consists of interlocked systems designed to detect, track, and intercept incoming ballistic weapons at various stages of flight - boost, midcourse, terminal.

The goal, though, is simple - to detect and shoot down a missile before it hits a target.

To begin with, the Space-Based Infrared System, or SBIRS, aids detection of missiles and aerial threats. This is accomplished by relying on SBIRS satellites for early warning of missile launches, and paired with a host of ground-based radars. Without these, detecting the launch of an incoming ballistic missile becomes almost impossible.

Space-Based Infrared System

The Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, is the backbone of the US' defence against intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. The GMD uses ground-based interceptors deployed at locations in Alaska and California to stop missiles during their midcourse phase.

The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, or BMD, is a sea- and land-based system that employs warships to engage short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.

The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, is a mobile, land-based system that intercepts short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles in their terminal phase. The THAAD uses hit-to-kill technology; i.e., how defensive missiles collide head-on with incoming threats to destroy them.

The THAAD system, incidentally, is also in Israel; in December last year it was used to intercept a ballistic missile reportedly fired from Yemen by the Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group.

Terminal High Altitude Area Defense

A standard THAAD battery includes six truck-mounted launchers with up to eight interceptors each, a radar that can detect threats up to 3,000km away, and a fire control system.

For shorter range ballistic missiles and other air threats in the terminal phase, the US relies on the Patriot Advanced Capability-3, or PAC-3, interceptor missiles. These are also part of a plan to counter possible deployment of Chinese hypersonic weapons in the Pacific region.

Patriot Advanced Capability-3

Development of the Israeli version - operation of which was on TV news channels at the height of Tel Aviv's war on Hamas and Hezbollah - began in 2007. It was up and running by 2011.

This is a multi-tiered system with the 'Iron Dome' at the heart. The other layers are 'David's Sling' for mid- to long-range missiles, and Arrow-2 and Arrow-3, which shoot down long-range ballistic missiles.

The United States funded roughly half of the annual development costs of the Arrow 2 system. By 2020, the total US. financial contribution toward the Arrow Weapon System exceeded $3.7 billion.

 JERUSALEM - Israel swore in a new commander of its military on Wednesday as a standoff over the fragile ceasefire in Gaza increased the risk of a resumption of fighting without an agreement to bring home the rest of the hostages still held by Hamas. 

 Eyal Zamir, who retired after 28 years with the rank of Major General, was promoted to Lieutenant General, before formally assuming command from General Herzi Halevi, who stepped down over the security disaster of Oct. 7, 2023. 

 "The mission I have been given is clear, to lead the IDF to victory," he said. 

 Fighting in Gaza has been halted since January under a truce brokered by Qatar and Egypt and supported by the United States that has allowed the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages and 5 Thais for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. 

 A related war in southern Lebanon, which broke out after Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces launched missile strikes against Israel after the October 7 attack, has also been silenced by a separate ceasefire agreement. 

 But Israeli ministers and officials have warned that their forces could resume fighting if there is no agreement on bringing back the 59 hostages that remain. 

 Israeli troops have pulled back from some of their positions in Gaza but talks that were intended to agree the release of the hostages and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces before an end to the war have not begun. 

 Israel has called for an extension of the truce until after the Jewish Passover holiday in April to allow the release of the remaining hostages, while Hamas has insisted on proceeding to talks on a permanent end to the war bafore agreeing to any further releases. 

 Zamir's appointment comes as a series of official inquiries have begun to examine the failures that allowed thousands of Hamas-led gunmen to storm Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages in one of the biggest military and security disasters in Israel's history. 

 Halevi led the military during the Israeli campaign in Gaza that killed more than 48,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the enclave, leaving most of the population sheltering in tents or bombed-out buildings. 

 But he announced in January, soon after the Gaza ceasefire deal was agreed, that he would step down from his command, accepting responsibility for the military's patchy and uncoordinated response to the Oct. 7 attack. 

 Both the Israel Defence Forces and the Shin Bet security agency have acknowledged that their failures allowed the attack to take place but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far resisted a more general inquiry that would look at the responsibility of his government. 

 The new commander will also have to respond to accusations from international bodies including the United Nations that Israeli troops committed war crimes during the campaign in Gaza. 

 Israel rejects those charges, which it says are motivated by political hostility towards the state of Israel but it has indicted some individual reservist soldiers for severe abuse of detainees. 

 Israel says Hamas, which has also been accused of war crimes by United Nations bodies, committed multiple atrocities during the October 7 attack and severely abused Israeli hostages in Gaza. Hamas denies the accusations.

Nine students who went missing on vacation in Mexico have been found dismembered by the side of the road along with a "bag of hands". According to the New York Post, the group, from the Mexican town of Tlaxcala, went missing on February 27. They had been travelling to the beaches in Oaxaca to celebrate their graduation. On Sunday, the cops found their remains in a truck of an abandoned vehicle in San Jose Miahuatlan on the border of the Mexican states of Puebla and Oaxaca.

According to the Post, four of the bodies were in the truck, while the other five bodies were left under the tarp. A bag of eight pairs of hands were also discovered at the scene, with two more hands left in the truck. Cops said that the bodies of the four women and five men, ages 19 to 30, all had bullet wounds and signs of torture. 

The victims, identified so far, are Angie Lizeth, 29, Brenda Mariel, 19, Jacqueline Ailet, 23, Noemi Yamileth, 28, Lesly Noya Trejo, 21, Raul Emmanuel, 28, Ruben Antonio, and Rolando Armando. The ninth victim has yet to be identified. 

A video capturing the last time they were seen alive showed their car driving along the Atlixcayotl highway, around 90 miles west of where their remains were eventually found, according to the outlet.

Police have launched an investigation into the incident. No suspects have yet been named. The Attorney General's Office in Puebla said it is collaborating with its colleagues in Tlaxcala and Oaxaca to try and track down the killers, as per the Post. 

"So far I cannot offer information. There are lines of investigation, but I cannot reveal them due to confidentiality," the head of Puebla's State Attorney General's Office, Idamis Pastor Betancourt, said at a press conference. 

"All relevant investigations are being carried out. When we have a response and the investigation is complete, we will be in a position to provide more information," the official added. 

Notably, the murder rate in Mexico continues to rise. According to the Post, 30,000 people were killed in 2023. It reportedly marked the most violent year in the country's recent history.

President Donald Trump urged Greenland to choose to join the United States but vowed to take the Danish-ruled island "one way or the other" -- a bid Denmark swiftly rejected on Wednesday.

"That won't happen," Danish Defence Minister Trouls Lund Poulsen told public broadcaster DR.

"The direction that Greenland wants to take will be decided by Greenlanders," Lund Poulsen said.

In a partisan speech to Congress on Tuesday, Trump offered only passing lines on world affairs, focusing on his domestic goals like rounding up undocumented immigrants and slashing government spending.

But he underlined his expansionist vision of the United States, as he repeated his aspirations to take Greenland and claimed an initial victory on retaking control of the Panama Canal.

One week before general elections in Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark with an independence movement, Trump said he had a message for the "incredible people" of the sparsely populated but mineral-rich and strategically-placed island.

"We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America," Trump said.

But he made clear he would not give up if persuasion fails, saying: "One way or the other we're going to get it."

"We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before."

China and Russia have been stepping up activity in the Arctic as climate change opens further sea routes.

'Taking it back'

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called for cool heads to prevail.

"I think everyone, including us, should be cautious about having all kinds of opinions about the future" of Greenland, he told Danish television TV2.

US threats to take Greenland would once have been thinkable, with Denmark a treaty ally of the United States under NATO.

But Trump has made clear he has little patience for European allies, which he again denounced for not spending more on their militaries, with Trump instead seeing a return to an era of big powers taking what they want.

He has similarly vowed to take back the Panama Canal, the crucial link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that the United States handed to Panama at the end of 1999.

Trump declared triumph after Hong Kong firm CK Hutchison decided to sell its Panama ports to a US-led consortium.

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio had complained that rival China had gained too much influence over the canal and could shut it down in a conflict with the United States.

"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said, as he mentioned the port deal.

"We didn't give it to China. Gave it to Panama -- and we're taking it back," he said.

Trump had earlier not ruled out military force to seize either the Panama Canal or Greenland.

Trump has paradoxically sought to cast himself as a peacemaker. He has vowed to end the war in Ukraine and has rattled allies by suspending aid to the country, which Russia invaded three years ago.

Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he visited the White House on Friday, calling him ungrateful.

Addressing Congress, Trump read a message from Zelensky in which the Ukrainian leader sought to repair the damage and voiced a willingness to a sign a deal in which the United States would take much of Ukraine's mineral wealth.

"It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides," Trump said.

Overseas aid

The Trump administration at the same time has canceled more than 90 percent of US development assistance, traditionally a key source of US non-military influence.

Trump has described aid as not in the US interest, with his advisor Elon Musk, the world's richest person, pushing massive cuts to make way for tax cuts.

Trump rattled off a list of previous aid grants and reserved mockery for a project in the landlocked African country of Lesotho, which has one of the world's highest rates of HIV/AIDS.

"Eight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho," Trump said, struggling with the pronunciation.

"Which nobody has ever heard of," Trump added to laughter from Republican lawmakers.

Lesotho, a small, landlocked African nation, unexpectedly found itself in the global spotlight after President Donald Trump mocked an $8 million US government grant supporting LGBTQ+ initiatives in the country.

"$8 million to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of," Trump declared during his fiery address to Congress on Tuesday, dismissing the funding as unnecessary.

During his speech, Trump declared his commitment to cutting what he called a "flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars." He announced the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency tasked with eliminating excessive spending, led by billionaire Elon Musk.

"To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars. To that end, I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE."

Trump listed several spending programmes -- funds allocated to housing for undocumented immigrants, diversity scholarships in Burma, an $8 million grant for LGBTQ+ initiatives in Lesotho -- he considered wasteful.

Why Does the US Fund Programmes in Lesotho?

Contrary to Trump's claim, Lesotho is not an unknown entity in international relations. The landlocked country, surrounded entirely by South Africa, has long been a recipient of US aid, primarily through initiatives focused on HIV/AIDS prevention, LGBTQ+ rights, and economic development.



Lesotho has one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world, with an estimated 22 per cent of its adult population living with the virus. US-funded programmes, such as PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief), have played a crucial role in addressing the crisis. LGBTQ+ rights initiatives, which Trump dismissed as wasteful, often support marginalised communities facing discrimination in healthcare access and social services.

Lesotho in the Global Arena

The country has also made significant strides in LGBTQ+ rights compared to many African nations. Same-sex relationships were decriminalised in 2012.

In a sharp retort to US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs charge, the Chinese embassy in the US said Beijing is ready to "fight till the end" in any type of war the US wants. "If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end," the Chinese embassy's official handle posted on X after Trump's explosive remarks in a joint session at Congress.

If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end. https://t.co/crPhO02fFE

Trump said other countries have used tariffs against the US for decades. " Now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher," he said.

"This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was... That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them," he said.

Trump has increased previously imposed 10 per cent levies on Chinese goods to 20 per cent. China has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the US.

"The United States' unilateral tax measures seriously violate WTO rules and undermine the foundation of China-US economic and trade cooperation," Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement.

While imposing the tariffs, Trump accused China of not doing enough to halt the trafficking of fentanyl and other highly potent opioids into the US.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has contested this. "The fentanyl issue is a flimsy excuse to raise US tariffs on Chinese imports. The US, not anyone else, is responsible for the #FentanylCrisis inside the US. In the spirit of humanity and goodwill towards the American people, we have taken robust steps to assist the US in dealing with the issue. Instead of recognizing our efforts, the US has sought to smear and shift blame to China, and is seeking to pressure and blackmail China with tariff hikes," it said in a statement.

"They've been PUNISHING us for helping them. This is not going to solve the US's problem and will undermine our counternarcotics dialogue and cooperation. Intimidation does not scare us. Bullying does not work on us. Pressuring, coercion or threats are not the right way of dealing with China. Anyone using maximum pressure on China is picking the wrong guy and miscalculating. If the US truly wants to solve the fentanyl issue, then the right thing to do is to consult with China by treating each other as equals," it added.

President Donald Trump's Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress highlighted several of the initiatives he's started in his first six weeks in office, but many of his comments included false and misleading information.

Here's a look at the facts:

He overstated the numbers on his immigration crackdown

Trump: "Illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded. Ever."

The Facts: Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday that Border Patrol apprehended 8,326 people on the U.S.-Mexico border last month. But U.S. government data show that Border Patrol routinely averaged below that number in the 1960s.

While February marked the lowest arrest total in decades, Border Patrol averaged less than February 2025 for the first seven years of 1960s. The government website does not track U.S.-Mexico border totals before 1960. Border Patrol's monthly average was 1,752 arrests in 1961.

He inflated the number of people who entered the U.S. illegally under President Joe Biden

Trump: "Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members."



The Facts: That figure, which Trump cites regularly, is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported more than 10.8 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through December 2024.

But that's arrests, not people. Under asylum restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

There is no evidence other countries are sending their criminals or people with mental illness across the border, despite this frequent line from Trump.

Economists differ with Trump on tariffs

Trump: "Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much."

The Facts: Trump is banking on the idea that taxing imports is the road to riches for the United States. Most economists say Trump's tariffs would hurt the country, as they're tax increases that could raise the costs of goods in ways that could also harm economic growth. Trump suggests that the impact on inflation would be minimal.

When the Yale University Budget Lab looked at the tariffs that Trump imposed Tuesday on Canada, Mexico and China, it found that inflation would increase a full percentage point, growth would fall by half a percentage point and the average household would lose about $1,600 in disposable income.

There's no evidence Social Security money is being paid to many people over age 100

Trump: "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. ... 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129. 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them, and we are searching right now."

The Facts: The databases may list those people, but that does not mean they are getting paid benefits.

Part of the confusion comes from Social Security's software system based on the COBOL programming language, which doesn't use a specific format for dates. This means that some entries with missing or incomplete birthdates will default to a reference point of more than 150 years ago. The news organization WIRED first reported on the use of COBOL programming language at the Social Security Administration.

Additionally, a series of reports from the Social Security Administration's inspector general in March 2023 and July 2024 state that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death information in its database, which included roughly 18.9 million Social Security numbers of people born in 1920 or earlier but were not marked as dead. This does not mean, however, that these people were receiving benefits.

The agency decided not to update the database because of the cost to do so, which would run upward of $9 million. As of September 2015, the agency automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old.

Trump did not inherit an 'economic catastrophe'

Trump: "Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare."

The Facts: Inflation peaked at 9.1% in 2022 under President Joe Biden, but Trump did not inherit a disastrous economy by any measure. The unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4% in January, the month he took office, while the economy expanded a healthy 2.8% in 2024. Inflation-adjusted incomes have grown steadily since mid-2023. And inflation, while showing signs of stickiness in recent months and still elevated at 3% in January, is down from its 2022 peak.

Trump's reference to an 'EV mandate' is inaccurate

Trump: "We ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction."

The Facts: There was no federal mandate to force the purchase of EVs, as Trump has falsely claimed many times before.

Biden had set up a non-binding goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal.

Biden's policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.

A closer look at Army recruitment numbers

Trump: "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years."

The Facts: Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Army's recruiting turnaround is tied to his time in office.

In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total coming in August 2024 - before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers.

A significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army's decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training.

In a high-stakes speech before a joint session of Congress, President Donald Trump outlined his vision for his second term, doubling down on trade policies, economic reforms, and cultural issues while drawing strong reactions from both Republicans and Democrats. His address, which came just weeks into his return to the White House, underscored his commitment to reshaping American policy both domestically and abroad.

One of the major takeaways from Trump’s speech was his announcement of reciprocal tariffs on foreign imports, set to take effect on April 2. Targeting India, China, and the European Union, Trump criticized the “unfair” trade practices that have harmed US businesses.

“India charges us tariffs, 100%. The system is not fair to the US, it never was,” Trump declared, adding that the new tariffs would level the playing field for American exporters. Under this policy, any country imposing high duties on US goods will face equivalent tariffs in return. Analysts warn that this move could strain trade relations, especially with India, which maintains significant tariffs on key sectors like automobiles, agriculture, and textiles.

The announcement of tariffs sent financial markets into turmoil, with stocks plummeting amid fears of an escalating trade war. Despite concerns about inflation, Trump remained steadfast in his approach.

“Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that,” he stated.


He also blamed rising egg prices on his predecessor’s energy policies and pledged that his administration’s “National ENERGY Emergency” would boost domestic drilling and reduce dependence on foreign energy sources.

Trump aimed at progressive policies, making sharp comments about transgender rights, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. He reiterated his commitment to banning transgender women from women’s sports and declared, “Our country will be woke no longer.”

He also called for making English the official language of the United States and criticized government spending on projects he deemed unnecessary, such as funding for LGBTQ+ rights in foreign nations.

Trump touted his administration’s “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.” His remarks were met with chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump!” from Republican lawmakers. He blamed his predecessor for what he described as “insane and very dangerous open border policies.”

His administration has vowed to intensify deportations, further tighten asylum policies, and restrict immigration in ways that align with his “America First” vision.

On the foreign policy front, Trump made headlines with his remarks on Ukraine and US strategic interests.

With a sweeping policy agenda, Trump is poised to push for additional tax cuts, a repeal of the CHIPS and Science Act, and deep government spending cuts. His administration also continues to push for tighter immigration controls and trade policies aimed at reducing foreign competition.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada’s efforts to tighten security at the border are “not good enough,” a day after triggering a North American trade war.

Trump spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday and the two leaders discussed “trade and fentanyl,” according to a readout from the Prime Minister’s Office.

“Both countries will continue to be in contact today,” the readout adds.

All eyes are on Washington after Trump slapped a sweeping 25 per cent tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods.

Trump said in a post Wednesday on his Truth Social platform that Trudeau called to ask him what can be done about the tariffs.

“I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped,” Trump wrote.

“He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ The call ended in a ‘somewhat’ friendly manner!”

Trump went on to write in another post he told Trudeau that he largely caused the problems the U.S. has with Canada because of his “weak border policies.”

In response to the U.S. tariffs, Canada is imposing an immediate 25 per cent tariff on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with additional tariffs on another $125 billion in American goods to follow three weeks later.

Trump has repeatedly cited the flow of fentanyl as the reason for imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico. At a press conference on Tuesday, Trudeau said that excuse was “completely bogus.”

“So we actually have to fold back on the one thing he has said repeatedly — that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us, is the second half of his thought.”

Trudeau met with premiers virtually on Tuesday to discuss the “unjustified” tariffs and Canada’s response, according to a readout from his office.

“The Prime Minister and the premiers denounced the U.S.’ decision to impose unjustified tariffs and committed to stand united against this economic threat,” the readout said.

“They underscored that tariffs would weaken both of our countries, put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk, and make life less affordable for both Canadians and Americans alike.”

Canadian provinces have swiftly responded to the U.S. tariffs, announcing a range of retaliatory measures on Tuesday.

According to the PMO, Ottawa will soon announce an initial support package to reduce the impact of U.S. tariffs on Canadian workers, families and businesses.

“First Ministers also discussed progress to reduce barriers to internal trade and labour mobility within Canada,” the readout said.

Meanwhile, Ottawa has requested consultations with Washington on Trump’s tariffs at the World Trade Organization, Canada’s ambassador to the WTO in Geneva said.

“The U.S. decision leaves us with no choice but to respond to protect Canadian interests,” Ambassador Nadia Theodore said in a statement posted on LinkedIn.

Business groups in Canada have raised concerns about the impact of the trade war and economists are warning that the Canadian economy is poised to plunge into a recession this year if the U.S. tariffs remain in place.

“No one wins in a trade war and the tariffs imposed today by the Trump Administration will hurt workers, farmers and families across North America — especially those in the United States,” Goldy Hyder, president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, said in a statement Tuesday.

Liberal MP John McKay, co-chair of the Canada-U.S. interparliamentary group, is in Washington, D.C., meeting with lawmakers Wednesday.

In an interview with Global News, McKay said: “It’s very difficult to know how to move forward” on the tariff tensions.

“It is .. a function of, ‘You poke me in the eye, then I poke you in the eye,’ and then back and forth, and we both end up blind,” he said.

“It doesn’t make any sense. And indeed, even with the Republicans, they can’t give you a coherent explanation of what Mr. Trump is trying to do.”

The U.S. move has angered many Canadians, with “elbows up” becoming a rallying cry online and on the streets.

Tariff tensions have also given rise to a “buy Canadian” movement in recent weeks, with consumers ditching U.S. products for local ones and businesses giving more prominence to local options.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she is expecting to speak with Trump on Thursday, but said on Wednesday if tariffs continue following that call, Mexico “will reach out to Canada and other nations.”

“It is a very definitive moment for Mexico,” Sheinbaum said. “Our economy is fine, but there will be no submission. … Depending on the circumstances, we will look to Canada and other countries.”

Trump may announce a deal on Wednesday with the two countries and meet them “in the middle,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday.

“Both the Mexicans and the Canadians were on the phone with me all day today trying to show that they’ll do better, and the president is listening because he’s very, very fair and very reasonable,” Lutnick said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday.

“So I think he’s going to work something out with them.

“It’s not going to be a pause. None of that pause stuff. But I think he’s going to figure out, ‘You do more, and I’ll meet you in the middle someway,’ and we’re going to probably be announcing that tomorrow.”

What's even better than a gold medal? U.S. soccer sensation Sophia Wilson announced her pregnancy shortly after marrying her college sweetheart, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson. 

Most fans might know Sophia Wilson by her maiden name, Smith, after she dominated the Paris Olympics with the U.S women's national soccer team. She was one of the squad's star forwards alongside Mallory Swanson and Trinity Rodman — affectionately referred to as "Triple Espresso."  

The Wilsons shared an Instagram post on Wednesday showing off their baby's sonogram. 

"Life just keeps getting sweeter," the couple's post read. 

The pair met while they were both freshmen student-athletes at Stanford University. Sophia Wilson went pro the next year while Michael Wilson stayed on to play football. 

He was selected by the Cardinals in the third round of 2023 NFL Draft, but she played in Oregon for the Portland Thorns. They made long-distance work, though, and were married in January during both their off seasons.

Their announcement Wednesday was full of excitement from fans, friends, and teammates. Fellow Stanford alum and U.S. national team star Naomi Girma commented "MY HEART." 

Rodman chimed in that her "life is complete." 

"OMG YAYYYY," wrote Morgan Weaver, a fellow Thorns forward. "Can’t wait to meet baby Wilson." 

The National Women's Soccer League solidified a new bargaining agreement with the players union that expanded parental and childcare benefits last year. Former player Alex Morgan, who retired last year after announcing her second pregnancy, said those benefits were a point of pride. 

Morgan told Good Morning America last year that the union had to think "outside of the box" as these issues are not prevalent in most men's leagues. 

 "We're able to now travel with our children and bring [a] child care provider, but also look at future planning as well for our families, and that's providing players with access to fertility clinics and a lot of other resources that weren't available to us before," Morgan said.

Sophia Wilson is in the final year of her contract with the Portland Thorns, and she'd be a free agent once it expires. There are currently no NWSL teams in Arizona, but there is a team in San Diego and a new team was approved for Denver earlier this year.

Ten Chinese hackers have been charged alongside two Chinese law enforcement officers in a global hacking campaign that targeted dissidents, news organizations and U.S. agencies, the Justice Department announced Wednesday.

The hacking by workers of I-Soon was done in some cases at the direction of China's Ministry of Public Security, which received the stolen information and selected targets for the intrusions as part of what U.S. officials say was a massive intelligence-gathering operation.

Among the targets of the hacking was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year.

I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an Associated Press investigation last year, of private hacking contractors are companies that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.

Over the past two decades, Chinese state security’s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.

A colossal winter storm was slamming the East Coast on Wednesday after tearing across the central U.S., unleashing a barrage of dangerous weather disruptions from hurricane-force winds to blizzard conditions and leaving three people dead in Mississippi.

The storm impacts have been felt from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast as whiteout conditions forced people off the roads in the High Plains and wildfires broke out amid bone-dry conditions in south Texas. Over 400,000 homes and businesses across half the country were without power from Texas to North Carolina.

While many areas will see a respite as the weekend arrives, AccuWeather meteorologists said they are monitoring the potential for multiple rounds of severe weather next week. One possible storm that could develop late next week could spark a "significant outbreak of severe weather" across the central U.S. for several days, AccuWeather said.

For Wednesday, forecasters expect severe weather to wallop much of the Eastern Seaboard from the Mid-Atlantic to Jacksonville, Florida. The worst conditions were anticipated across southeast Virginia and the eastern Carolinas, where authorities already are dealing with an outbreak of wildfires that began last weekend.

"The rain will be intense enough to knock down or cease the wildfire threat temporarily but will also trigger localized urban flooding of city streets," AccuWeather senior meteorologist Bill Deger said.

The downpours, gusty winds, severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes hitting the Atlantic Seaboard through Wednesday night will create a risk to lives and property and could trigger power outages and "significant" travel delays, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.

The harsh weather driven by an advancing cold front will span about 100 miles in width but extend more than 1,000 miles from north to south. The heaviest rain and the greatest risk of thunderstorms may only last 6 hours or less, but chaos could be widespread.

Developments:

∎ In Florida, Tallahassee schools opened an hour late Wednesday amid concerns tornadoes could develop. The region remained under a wind advisory into Wednesday night; gusts were expected to reach 45 mph.

∎ In Texas, a weather service damage survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado occurred Tuesday in the Fort Worth area. Peak winds were estimated at 110 mph for the tornado, which remained on the ground for about a half mile.

The Weather Channel warned that damaging winds and tornadoes were possible all day Wednesday from Pennsylvania to far northern Florida. Charleston, South Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are among a slew of cities facing the threat into Wednesday night.

"L​arge hail and perhaps an isolated tornado could accompany storms that develop in western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and northern West Virginia," the Weather Channel said.

In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said three people died as high winds swept across the state Tuesday.

"Please pray for their family during this difficult time,'' Reeves said on the X platform, adding that six other people have been reported injured.

The National Weather Service in Mississippi posted video of the roof ripping off a building at the Clay County Jail. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph on Wednesday could topple large branches and some trees could fall, resulting in more power outages and making travel risky, forecasters said.

In Iowa, crews from the Des Moines Fire Department's Hazardous Materials assisted with clearing an accident scene along Interstate 80 near Wednesday morning. The driver of a semitruck collided with another truck that had previously jackknifed under an overpass, the Des Moines Register reported.

Strong winds were expected throughout the day, leading to blizzard conditions and making winter roads dangerous. A blizzard warning was in effect for much of Iowa. Conditions overnight left roads in western Iowa "nearly impassable" and visibility Wednesday morning was near zero at times, according to the National Weather Service.

The dangerous conditions come as thousands try to descend on Des Moines for the Iowa girls' high school state basketball tournament, a major winter event in the state.

South-central Texas was facing "near critical" fire weather conditions Wednesday because of the dry air and wind gusts forecast for the area. A Rangeland Fire Danger warning was in effect as 20-mph wind gusts were likely to combine with a minimum relative humidity of 15% to 25%, the weather service said.

Areas of New Mexico and Texas were temporarily shrouded by a brown mist earlier this week, when dust storms known as haboobs swept across the southern Plains on Monday afternoon. More than a dozen fire reports were received by the National Weather Service office in San Antonio and Austin.

Blizzard conditions are expected "at times" Wednesday from north of Kansas City, Missouri, to Iowa and Illinois and up to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and several inches of snowfall combined with strong winds are likely, the National Weather Service said.

"The main concern today will continue to be the high winds with gusts expected to range between 50-65 mph through this evening," the NWS office in Kansas City said on X. The office in Marquette, Michigan, said strong winds along Lake Superior "will result in blizzard conditions, possible tree damage, and potential for power outages."

The US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine, the White House national security adviser has said.

When asked whether intelligence sharing had been put on hold along with military aid, Mike Waltz told reporters on Wednesday: "We have, we have taken a step back."

He added that the administration was reviewing all aspects of its intelligence relationship with Kyiv.

The US has shared intelligence with Ukraine since the early stages of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

It paused military aid to Kyiv on Monday following a dramatic breakdown in relations in the Oval Office last week, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was told to leave after an angry meeting with US President Donald Trump.

It remains unclear if the intelligence sharing pause is partial or complete, and how long it will remain in effect. The move was first reported by the Financial Times.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe also appeared to confirm the decision in an interview on Fox Business on Wednesday, saying Trump "had a real question about whether President Zelensky was committed to the peace process, and he said 'let's pause I want to give you a chance to think about that'."

He said the response came swiftly with Zelensky's statement saying he was ready for peace.

Ratcliffe then added: "On the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, will go away and we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine."

Waltz also suggested a more conciliatory tone was emerging between the US and Ukraine, adding that the military aid and intelligence sharing pause could be lifted in the near future.

"I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move towards these negotiations, and in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause," he told Fox News.

He also said he had "good talks" with his Ukrainian counterpart about the location and substance of potential negotiations, adding there will be movement in "very short order".

Ukraine has heavily relied on the US for military assistance since Russia invaded in 2022, and the decision to pause aid may have a significant effect on the war. 

Halting intelligence support, too, would likely have serious consequences on the battlefield.

The information is believed to help Ukraine both strategically understand Moscow's next moves and also tactically, for example providing information on Russian troop positions for weapons guidance and targeting.

Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence and retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC that cutting off intelligence to Ukraine "will have an immediate impact" on its ability to defend itself.

"There is no way to replace the capabilities that the US intelligence can provide from our European allies," he said. 

"This will likely inspire Russia to push harder on their efforts to take more terrain from Ukraine and away from the negotiating table."

The man allegedly swallowed two pairs of earrings worth $769,500 (£597,000) hoping to avoid being charged with theft.

Israel was consulted prior to the talks, according to the White House, after reports said the two sides were discussing the release of hostages.

The US president spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about trade tariffs on Wednesday.

The president declares "America is back" as he spars with Democrats and gives a shout-out to Elon Musk.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump touted his newly imposed tariffs and basked in Republican applause for his administration's swift early actions, while he drew a wave of protests from Democrats as he spoke to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.

Leaning into culture wars, Trump inveighed against transgender rights, “they/them” pronouns and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. He celebrated his crackdown on migration. He repeatedly taunted his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying the former president imposed “insane and very dangerous open border policies” and offering little in the way of olive branches to Democrats, instead touting his 2024 victory as a mandate to reshape the nation.

“Wokeness is bad,” Trump said. “It’s gone.”

Congressional Democrats in the room heckled and disrupted Trump, demanding that he not cut Medicaid, waving an eclectic mix of signs to protest him and periodically shouting antagonistically at him.

Here are five takeaways from the speech — and how it sets up the rest of Trump's 2025.

Trump defended the sweeping 25% tariffs he imposed Tuesday on products from Canada and Mexico, saying “now it’s our turn” after other countries have levied them against the United States.

“It’s very unfair,” Trump said as scores of Republicans stood to applaud his tariffs, which he said “are about protecting the soul of our country.”

It's a sign of how Trump has transformed the traditionally pro-free trade GOP, though there is some unease in the party about the tariffs' effects on prices and the broader economy.

“There’ll be a little disturbance,” Trump added. “But we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” 

The tariffs sent stocks tumbling Tuesday, and some Democrats shouted “stock market!” as Trump spoke.

Trump also promised an economic revival and blamed ongoing problems like inflation and egg prices on Biden.

Trump spent significant time on issues from transgender athletes to the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. But the biggest thing Congress may work on this year will be a massive tax and spending bill, and Trump outlined his priorities.

Trump reiterated his calls to cut taxes and include several campaign trail tax promises in a bill later this year — specifically killing taxes on tips and overtime. Congressional Republicans are wrestling with the feasibility of those proposals as they seek to pass a big party-line bill to advance core pieces of Trump's agenda. They are still seeking to find room for the trillions of dollars in tax breaks Trump has called for.

Trump also called for repealing the CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan law that passed the Senate 64-33 and was signed by Biden in 2022.

“We should get rid of the Chip Act,” Trump said, referring to the law that invests in domestic research and semiconductor manufacturing.

Within minutes of Trump’s beginning, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, interrupted and heckled him, yelling, “You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.” He was escorted out after he refused to stop shouting. There were other unintelligible shouts from Democrats during the speech. At another point, several Democratic members walked out in protest.

A group of House Democrats waved signs that read “MUSK STEALS,” “SAVE MEDICAID” and “PROTECT VETERANS.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., brought a whiteboard and wrote different messages on it through Trump’s speech, including “NO KING” and “LIES.”

Some Democrats laughed out loud when Trump said the era of rule by “unelected bureaucrats” is over, and they pointed at Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who watched from the gallery.

Other Democrats skipped the speech entirely, including Sen. Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, who wants to lead his party’s strategy, and Sen. Patty Murray, of Washington, the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee and the recent former Senate president pro tempore.

The top three Democratic leaders in each chamber attended. They, like most others in the party, sat quietly and listened without disrupting Trump’s remarks, as Democrats work through their loss last year and how best to advance their agenda and oppose Trump's in 2025 and beyond.

It has been months since Trump played to the crowd at one of his signature political rallies. He got a hero’s welcome and a standing ovation from Republicans in the Capitol, who regularly leaped to their feet to applaud him.

As Trump said he is waging the “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history” and touted actions he has taken, the GOP side of the aisle erupted into chants of “Trump! Trump! Trump.”

Trump had no olive branch to offer his opponents, instead needling Democrats at the beginning of his speech, saying there was nothing he could say that would make them clap or smile — and later blasting “radical left lunatics” whom he called weak on crime. In response, some Democrats yelled, “January 6th!” referring to Trump’s pardons of rioters who stormed the Capitol, some of whom attacked police officers.

Biden offered during his first address to Congress to team up on “bipartisan” goals — a word he used multiple times in 2021 — like infrastructure, cancer research and access to education.

Trump, meanwhile, chided Democrats early in his speech for refusing to give him enough. He set the tone early by calling Biden “the worst president in American history” and played to a longtime presidential tradition: blaming his predecessor for problems facing the country.

“Everybody here — even this side — I appreciate you,” Trump quipped, drawing laughter from the GOP side of the aisle.

A few thorny issues were mostly or entirely missing from the speech, reflecting the broad goal of rallying Republicans and packing in applause lines in Trump’s address.

The return of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas in Gaza earned a mention. But Trump didn’t delve much deeper into the broader issues facing Israel, its current ceasefire agreement with Hamas or the rebuilding of Gaza, about which he has repeatedly posted on social media.

As the GOP’s budget and spending plans take shape, there was no mention of Medicaid — a major part of the federal budget that could be a target for changes — or health care generally, beyond a brief endorsement of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

And while Elon Musk got a shoutout and Trump listed off spending the Department of Government Efficiency was seeking to cut, Trump didn’t delve into the federal worker cuts that have sparked anxiety among some congressional Republicans and pushback from the public. He did note that federal workers have been ordered to return to in-person work or be fired, and broadly, Trump said his “administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy” of “hundreds of thousands” of federal workers who he said haven’t been showing up.

Trump also appeared to ignore the looming government shutdown next Friday, which congressional leaders are struggling to avoid.

Trump lamented the billions of dollars the United States has spent to help Ukraine defend itself from Russia’s incursion, drawing ironic and extended applause from Democrats who support the military and economic assistance.

“You want to keep it going for another five years?” Trump asked.

“Pocahontas says yes,” he said, using a derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., which prompted numerous Democrats to walk out of the chamber.

Trump also kept up his calls to bring the Panama Canal and Greenland into U.S. control.

“We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama. We’re taking it back,” Trump said of the Panama Canal.

“We need Greenland for national security and international security,” he continued, calling it a “very, very large piece of land.”

“I think we’re going to get it. One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” he said as Republicans applauded and laughed.

The president's speech lasted about 1 hour and 40 minutes, including pauses for clapping, applause and other reactions. 

That makes it the longest address to a joint session of Congress since at least 1964, including State of the Union speeches, according to The American Presidency Project by the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The president ended his speech with an optimistic vision for the future. 

"We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world," he said. "We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond."

He continued: "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew [the] unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the golden age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."

Mr. Trump honored the family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter who was killed during the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year.

"Gunfire rang out, and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people," the president said. "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky."

The president said Comperatore was "a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector" who, when the sound of gunshots rang out, "knew instantly what it was and what to do."

"He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters, and shielded them from the bullets with his own body," the president said, while noting that Comperatore's wife and daughters were in the gallery. 

"Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on," Mr. Trump said. "Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selflessness devotion of a true American patriot."

The president added that he believes his life was saved in Butler that day "for a very good reason."

"I was saved by God to make America great again, I believe that," he said, reiterating a line he said in his inaugural address.

The president recalled the 13 American service members killed during a suicide bombing at the airport in Kabul during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling the withdrawal under the Biden administration "disastrous and incompetent."

"Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country," he said.

Mr. Trump then said he was pleased to announce that his administration has "just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice."

He credited the government of Pakistan for helping to arrest "this monster."

Mr. Trump, who has suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland, had a message for the Denmark-owned territory.

"I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland," Mr. Trump said. "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America." 

Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is "working with everybody involved to try and get it." 

"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other," Mr. Trump said. "We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security." 

Recent polling in Greenland showed 85% of residents did not support becoming part of the United States.

The president called on Congress to fund a "Golden Dome missile defense shield," similar to Israel's.

"As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future," Mr. Trump said. "As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the USA."

He added: "Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right?"

The president called on Congress "to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body." 

"This is a big lie," he said. "And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you." 

Mr. Trump's message is an extension of the anti-transgender policies he vowed to enact during the campaign. 

In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. Schools not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive. The order also affects U.S. visa policies for athletes who travel to the country to compete in the Olympics or other sporting events. 

Mr. Trump signed another executive order in January to halt federal funding for providers of gender-affirming care for transgender people under the age of 19. The order put restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures. Two federal judges have blocked the order. 

In a touching moment, the president highlighted a 13-year-old boy in the gallery who he said was diagnosed with cancer and "truly loves our police."

"His name is DJ Daniel, he is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer," Mr. Trump said. 

Daniel waved and held up his hands in the shape of a heart before being hoisted up by his father to see the chamber.

The president said Daniel suffered from brain cancer and had once been given five months to live. Now, more than six years later, Mr. Trump said Daniel and his father have "been on a quest to make his dream come true — and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer."

Mr. Trump then instructed the director of the U.S. Secret Service to officially make Daniel an agent, to cheers from the chamber. 

Mr. Trump previously signed an executive order encouraging the U.S. attorney general to push for the death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. On Tuesday night, he called on Congress to make that executive order a law. 

"I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer," the president said. "And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law." 

The executive order the president signed doesn't require the death penalty, but it does call on the attorney general, wherever possible consistent with law, to seek the death penalty for every federal capital crime involving the murder of a law enforcement officer. 

Mr. Trump said law enforcement deserves "support, protection and respect," though he issued sweeping pardons for those convicted or facing charges of assaulting police officers during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. 

"We're also, once again, giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous," Mr. Trump said. "The problem is, the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it." 

Hours after he was sworn into office in January, Mr. Trump granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the Capitol, including those who were convicted of violent and serious crimes. More than 140 police officers were injured during the attack.

The president also directed the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot. 

One day after announcing new investments in the U.S. by a Taiwanese semiconductor company, the president called on Congress to "get rid of" the CHIPS and Science Act, which was enacted under the Biden administration. The law is intended to boost semiconductor chip manufacturing in the U.S., both for economic and national security reasons. 

The bill had significant bipartisan support when it passed in 2022. 

"You should get rid of the CHIP Act, and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt, or any other reason you want to," Mr. Trump said. 

The president touted his administration's work to address border security and immigration so far, celebrating what he called "the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history."

"The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying, 'We needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border,'" Mr. Trump said. "But it turns out all we needed was a new president."

The president thanked his border czar Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem for their work so far. And he honored Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an immigrant in the U.S. illegally whose story became a rallying cry for Republicans on the campaign trail, declaring that "America will never ever forget" her. Riley's mother and sister were seated in the gallery.

Mr. Trump also shared the story of a 12-year-old girl who he said was killed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He addressed her mother in the gallery and highlighted an order he said he signed earlier to rename a wildlife refuge in her daughter's name. The president displayed the order, holding it up to applause from Republicans. 

Throughout the speech, a number of Democratic lawmakers have been holding up signs with slogans like "Musk Steals," "Save Medicaid," "Protect Veterans" and "False." Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has a whiteboard that she has used to respond to Mr. Trump in real time:

The president made his case for his reciprocal tariffs, which will commence April 2. He wants to impose the same tariff on imports from foreign countries as those nations impose on U.S. exports. 

"If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff, and in some cases, a rather large one," he said. "Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada — have you heard of them? — and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair.

"India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%," he continued. "China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that. Four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea but that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. The system is not fair to the United States and never was.

"April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in, and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them," the president said. "That's reciprocal. Back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them."

Mr. Trump praised American farmers, insisting the tariffs targeting imports from Canada and Mexico will benefit them. 

"I love the farmer, who will now be selling into our whole market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you," he said. "Because those goods that come in from other companies and countries, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting. And they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers."

Mr. Trump said he wants to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, "but only if the car is made in America." 

"By the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen," he said. "Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made." 

He said that his policies would allow the U.S. auto industry to "absolutely boom." 

Mr. Trump said last month that he could impose hefty tariffs on automobile imports, but would have more to say in early April. At the time, he said that the tariffs could be "in the neighborhood of 25%." 

"Already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America," he said. 

The president urged Congress, especially Democrats, to vote for tax cuts for "everybody." 

"The next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody," he said, referring to the House GOP's budget plan. "They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote."

"And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right but my right right here, I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts," the president told Democratic members. "Because otherwise, I don't believe that people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing a big favor by telling you that." 

Mr. Trump said they're "seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board," which would carry a price tag of at least $4.5 trillion over the next decade.

The president also called on Congress to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. 

Mr. Trump claimed he would soon balance the budget, but he has endorsed a plan by Republicans in Congress to extend tax cuts and enact spending reductions that would add trillions to the nation's budget deficit. 

"In the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years, balance the federal budget," Mr. Trump said. 

Last week, the House narrowly adopted a budget proposal that paves the way for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense and energy priorities. Mr. Trump has dubbed it a "big, beautiful bill." 

The House Republican resolution instructs committees to craft legislation that would cut $4.5 trillion in taxes and at least $1.5 trillion in spending over the next 10 years, while raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.

The president said his administration is preparing a "gold card" that would allow foreigners to pay $5 million to be placed on a pathway to citizenship, and said it would go on sale "very, very soon." Administration officials have said they won't discriminate based on country of origin, but candidates will be vetted. 

"For $5 million, we will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship," he said. "It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. These people will have to pay tax in our country."

"They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them being forced out," he added. "They're going to pay a lot of money and we're going to reduce our debt with that money." 

Mr. Trump, who has overseen a dramatic overhaul of the federal government, touted the changes that have been directed by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. 

"Perhaps you've heard of it," Mr. Trump said as he mentioned the task force. "Perhaps." 

Mr. Trump said Musk, who is in attendance, has been "working very hard." 

"He didn't need this. He didn't need this," he said. "We appreciate it." 

The president then listed various programs, particularly foreign aid-related programs, that his administration has terminated and claimed that the task force has found billions in fraud and waste.

"By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families," Mr. Trump said. 

The president falsely claimed that DOGE has found "hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud." DOGE claims on its website that it has saved $105 billion by slashing contracts and finding fraud. But as of Monday, the data DOGE has made available only itemizes a total of $8.86 billion in canceled federal contracts, and CBS News found this data contains numerous errors and often overstates the amount that was saved. 

The president acknowledged that Americans are hurting from inflation and blamed former President Joe Biden for higher prices. 

"Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families," he said. "As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans."

Mr. Trump said he's fighting to reverse inflation, the same day his tariffs went into effect that economists predict will contribute to higher prices.

"As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again," the president said to applause from Republicans.

The president then blamed Biden for the price of eggs, which has continued to skyrocket under Mr. Trump as bird flu spreads. 

 "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control," he said. "The egg price is out of control, and we're working hard to get it back down."

Mr. Trump listed off the litany of executive orders and other changes he's made in the first six weeks since the start of his second term, including renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," banning transgender women from playing in girls and women's sports and making English the official language of the U.S. 

"Our country will be woke no longer," he said, adding that workers should be hired based on "skill and competence, not race and gender." 

"We've ended the tyranny of so called 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion' policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military," Mr. Trump said. 

The president touted his administration's swift deportations of illegal immigrants, saying Democrats seated in the chamber should celebrate what he is doing. 

"This is my fifth such speech to Congress," Mr. Trump said. "And once again I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do."

He continued: "I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded. And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it, no matter what. Five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way."

Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas was escorted from the chamber after he heckled the speech and refused to comply with directions to be quiet and sit. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson warned raucous Democrats to be quiet before Green was escorted out. 

"Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions. That's your warning," Johnson said. "Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session." 

When Green declined to take his seat as Johnson asked, Johnson directed the sergeant at arms to restore order and "remove this gentleman from the chamber." 

The president quickly touted his election victory, but was met with jeers and boos from Democrats.

"The presidential election of Nov. 5 was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades," Mr. Trump said, noting that he won all seven battleground states. 

"We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country," Mr. Trump said, as Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas rose to interrupt him. Republicans quickly stood, coming to the president's support with chants of "USA."

Speaker Mike Johnson rose and instructed the chamber to maintain decorum.  

After greeting Johnson, Vance, the first lady and Congress, the president began his address. 

"America is back," the president said, to applause and chants of "USA, USA."

"Six weeks ago I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the golden age of America. From that moment on it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years, and we are just getting started," he said.

Mr. Trump entered the House chamber at 9:13 p.m. as Republican lawmakers applauded. Members of Congress lined the aisle to shake hands with Mr. Trump as he made his way to the dais.

House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Vice President JD Vance are seated behind the lectern where Mr. Trump will deliver the speech. First lady Melania Trump and members of the Cabinet took their seats before Mr. Trump's entrance. 

Many Democratic women in Congress are wearing bright pink in a display of defiance against the president. 

Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández of New Mexico, who leads the Democratic Women's Caucus, told Time magazine that the color signifies "our protest of Trump's policies which are negatively impacting women and families."

"Pink is a color of power and protest," she told the magazine. "It's time to rev up the opposition and come at Trump loud and clear."

The 96-member group spoke about their opposition to the president outside the U.S. Capitol prior to the address on Tuesday, where Leger Fernández asserted, "Women cannot afford Trump."

The following Supreme Court justices are attending the president's speech, and entered the chamber before Mr. Trump was introduced:

Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Sonya Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson are not in attendance.

Mr. Trump's motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m., accompanied by first lady Melania Trump. 

Billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk was in the president's motorcade, although not in the same vehicle.

Moments earlier, Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol, shaking the hands of the senators who not long ago were his colleagues. 

Doug Collins, the secretary of veterans affairs, is tonight's "designated survivor," the member of the president's Cabinet who is not attending the speech. The practice, which originated in the Cold War, calls for an official in the presidential line of succession to stay away from the proceedings in case a catastrophe strikes the House chamber.

The Constitution says the president shall, "from time to time," give a report on the "State of the Union" to Congress. This speech typically takes place in January or February, and gives presidents the opportunity to tout their accomplishments over the past year and lay out their agenda for the months ahead.

Since Mr. Trump has only been in office for six weeks and a day, his address is not technically considered a State of the Union. Rather, it's known as a joint address to Congress. But it will look and sound much like a State of the Union, with the president addressing lawmakers from the House chamber, and Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance seated behind him.

Mr. Trump is expected to address what he views as his accomplishments so far before discussing the economy, immigration and foreign policy.

President Donald Trump vowed to keep up his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” in reorienting the nation’s economy, immigration and foreign policy as he delivered an unyielding address Tuesday night to Congress and the nation.

President Donald Trump doubled down on his divisive agenda Tuesday night, vowing to continue his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” as he delivered a joint address to Congress and the nation - the first of his second term.

President Donald Trump has begun his address to Congress and the American people, laying out his plans for the months ahead. Trump said he’s stamped out diversity and inclusion initiatives nationwide. “Our country will be woke no longer,” Trump said.

House Democratic leaders had been urging their members to show restraint during Trump’s speech. Rep. Al Green did not heed that at all. But after the early outburst, most Democrats in the chamber have been silently sitting, holding up small signs that protest Trump’s policies and words.

Republicans cheered President Donald Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday night. Democrats expressed their disapproval, both during the speech and afterwards.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump vowed to keep up his campaign of “swift and unrelenting action” in reorienting the nation’s economy, immigration and foreign policy in an unyielding address before Congress that left Democratic legislators to register their dissent with stone faces, placards calling out “lies,” and one legislator’s ejection.



Trump’s prime-time speech Tuesday was the latest marker in his takeover of the nation’s capital, where the Republican-led House and Senate have done little to restrain the president as he and his allies work to slash the size of the federal government and remake America’s place in the world.



The president’s address, clocking in at a record 99 minutes, added up to a defiant sales pitch for the policies that Trump promised during his campaign and leaned into during his first weeks back in office. Trump pledged to keep delivering sweeping change to rescue the nation from what he described as destruction and mistakes left by his predecessor. He seldom addressed his comments directly to the American people, who are trying to keep up with the recent upheaval, while repeatedly needling the Democratic lawmakers seated before him.



Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response following Trump’s speech, allowed that “America wants change, but there’s a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.”



Emboldened after overcoming impeachments in his first term, outlasting criminal prosecutions in between his two administrations and getting a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress, Trump has embarked on a mission to dismantle parts of the federal government, remake the relationship with America’s allies and slap on tariffs that have sparked a North American trade war.



“It has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action,” Trump said of his opening weeks in office. “The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.”



Trump, who has billionaire adviser Elon Musk orchestrating his efforts to slash the size and scope of the federal government, said he is working to “reclaim democracy from this unaccountable bureaucracy” and threatened federal workers anew with firings if they resist his agenda.

Musk, who was seated in the House gallery, received a pair of standing ovations from Republicans in the chamber, as Trump exaggerated and shared false claims about alleged government abuse uncovered by the Tesla and SpaceX founder and his team of disrupters.



Trump repeated false claims that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, prompting some Democrats to shout, “Not true!” and “Those are lies!”



Trump spoke at a critical juncture in his presidency, as voters who returned him to the White House on his promise to fix inflation are instead finding economic chaos. All the gains the S&P 500 have made since Election Day are now gone, while consumer sentiment surveys show the public sees inflation as worsening. 



Trump seemed prepared to double down on his trade policies, which experts have warned will raise prices for consumers.



“Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,” Trump said. At the same time, he tried to ease concerns about the resulting price increases, saying, “There’ll be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that. It won’t be much.”



Trump said one of his “very highest priorities” was to rescue the economy and offer relief to working families. He promised to organize the federal government to lower costs on eggs and energy, blaming his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden for the situation and offering scant details of his own plans.



Trump also called for the extension of his first-term tax cuts and additional federal funding for his border crackdown, including for his promised efforts at “mass deportation” of people in the U.S. illegally. 



He celebrated his crackdown on migration, saying, “But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.”



Speaking about his promised tax cuts, Trump seemed to goad Democrats, saying: “I’m sure you’re going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise I don’t believe the people will ever vote you into office.”



The backdrop was the new economic uncertainty unleashed after the president opened the day by placing stiff tariffs on imports from the country’s neighbors and closest trading partners. A 25% tax on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday — ostensibly to secure greater cooperation to tackle fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration — triggering immediate retaliation and sparking fears of a wider trade war. Trump also raised tariffs on goods from China to 20%.

Republicans were boisterous as Trump stepped to the lectern in the House, chanting “USA! USA!” as the president basked in the cheers. The GOP lawmakers were jubilant, having won a trifecta of the White House, Senate and House in the elections. However, they face the challenging task of delivering on Trump’s agenda as well as avoiding a government shutdown later this month.



Across the aisle, out-of-power Democrats set the tone early, with most remaining seated without applauding or making eye contact with Trump as he was introduced in the chamber.



After several interruptions, House Speaker Mike Johnson jumped in and called for decorum to be restored in the chamber as Republicans shouted “USA” to drown out the cries from the other side of the aisle. Johnson then ordered Texas Rep. Al Green removed from the chamber.



“It’s worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up” to Trump, Green told reporters after being thrown out of the chamber.

Other Democrats held up signs criticizing like “Save Medicaid” and “Protect Veterans” during Trump’s remarks, seeking to drive public awareness to elements of Trump’s agenda they believed might offer them a pathway back to the majority.



Some Democrats chose to highlight the impact of Trump’s actions by inviting fired federal workers as guests, including a disabled veteran from Arizona, a health worker from Maryland and a forestry employee who worked on wildfire prevention in California. 



Trump also used his speech to address his proposals for fostering peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, where he has unceremoniously upended the policies of the Biden administration in a matter of just weeks. On Monday, Trump ordered a freeze to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, ending years of staunch American support for the country in fending off Russia’s invasion. 



Trump recited a letter he received earlier Tuesday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the wartime president wants to come back to the table after a explosive Oval Office meeting last week broke down negotiations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. “We’ve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace,” Trump said. “Wouldn’t that be beautiful?”



He also announced the arrest of a suspect in the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed U.S. troops during the withdrawal from Afghanistan.



Trump’s 1 hour and 39 minute speech was the longest annual address a president has ever delivered to Congress, breaking Bill Clinton’s record of 1 hour and 28 minutes. 



Watching from the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were guests including 15-year-old Elliston Berry, of Aledo, Texas, who was the victim of an explicit deepfake image sent to classmates.



Other White House guests included relatives of Corey Comperatore, the former Pennsylvania fire chief who was killed as he protected his family during an assassination attempt on Trump last summer.



Republican lawmakers cheered the conclusion of Trump’s address with chants that echoed his words after he was struck in the ear by a bullet: “Fight! Fight! Fight!”

A day into Donald Trump's North American trade war, the U.S. president remained adamant that tariffs would benefit America even as a key member of his team has floated that a compromise could materialize Wednesday.

Trump addressed a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, for the first time since he returned to office in January, by making a case for his massive tariff agenda. 

"We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth and we will not let that happen any longer," Trump told lawmakers in Washington.

The president's executive order hitting Canada and Mexico with 25 per cent across-the-board tariffs, with a lower 10 per cent levy on Canadian energy, took effect Tuesday. 

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the continental trade war "dumb" and said Canada was forced to push back. He framed Trump's ultimate tariff goal as "a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us."




Ottawa introduced immediate 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of American products, which will expand to cover another $125 billion in U.S. goods in 21 days.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government would announce duties on targeted products and other measures Sunday. She said "there is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations."

The tariffs caused immediate market turbulence as many business and industry groups condemned devastating duties against America's closest neighbours. 

Clips of Ontario Premier Doug Ford threatening to cut off electricity to the United States played repeatedly on U.S. TV stations. Images and video of American liquor being pulled off the shelves in Canadian stores signalled what could come if Trump continued his trade war path. 




Minutes after the U.S. stock market closed, following a second day of sharp decline, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said there could be a ramp off the devastating duties. Lutnick told Fox Business that the government was looking to "work something out" in a deal that could be announced on Wednesday. 

"It's not going to be a pause. None of that pause stuff," he said. "Somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome."

Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc spoke with Lutnick on Tuesday but Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly told CBC News she had not heard about any "middle" deal. Joly was to speak with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

It was unclear what Trump would consider as a concession. 

Lutnick tied the deal to the Canada-U.S.-Mexico agreement, which was negotiated under the first Trump administration to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. 




Trump has previously connected duties to wide-ranging complaints from defence spending to trade deficits. Trump has repeatedly claimed he wants to make Canada a U.S. state.

Lutnick's comments give additional credence to Canadian officials' supposition that tariffs are not actually connected to the flow of deadly fentanyl over the border -- the legal backing Trump is using for the duties. U.S Customs and Border Protection data shows the volume of drugs crossing from Canada into the United States is minuscule compared to Mexico.

"We think it's a bogus argument," Joly said. 

Tuesday was the first big test of how the markets would react to Trump's massive trade agenda — and it could signal how the president moves forward in his plan to upend global trade. 




Trump also ordered 25 per cent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States on March 12, which the White House has confirmed would stack on top of the other duties imposed on Canada.

Trump signed an executive order to implement "reciprocal tariffs" starting April 2. Other tariff targets include automobiles, copper, lumber and agricultural products.

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said President Donald Trump is considering a deal that would offer exemptions from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, including potentially for carmakers.

The possibility of a rollback, which he said could be announced on Wednesday, came as many US businesses raised concerns about Trump's decision to hit US imports from its two closest trade partners with a 25% import tax. 

After two days of declines, the main US stock indexes were trading slightly higher early on Wednesday. 

Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly told the BBC's Newsnight on Tuesday that her office had not been contacted about any plans around reducing tariffs.

US officials "can say many things" but "the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump," Joly said.

The US president used a large part of his speech to Congress on Tuesday to outline his trade policies, but he did not say whether he planned to cut the tariffs that came into effect this week.

Canada and Mexico announced retaliatory import levies on the US after Washington's 25% tariffs on its two neighbours came into effect on Tuesday.

Goods worth billions cross the borders of the US, Canada and Mexico each day and their economies are deeply integrated.

Trump says he wants to protect American industry and boost manufacturing, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.

On Wednesday, Lutnick said tariffs would be in place, but suggested some goods could be "left out".

"There are going to be tariffs - let's be clear - but what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that maybe he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2," Lutnick told Bloomberg on Wednesday. 

"It will be 25% but there will be some categories left out - it could well be autos. It could be others as well," he added.

A day earlier on Fox News, Lutnick had raised the possibility of a compromise and reduction of tariffs for Mexico and Canada, saying Trump was weighing offers to meet his allies "in the middle". 

Trump has said he would move ahead on 2 April with plans for reciprocal tariffs on other countries around the world that he sees as treating the US unfairly.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has slammed Trump's sweeping tariffs on his country, calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and vowed to conduct a "relentless fight" to protect its economy.

Trudeau announced retaliatory tariffs on US exports and warned that a trade war would be costly for both countries.

But Trump pushed even further in a post on his Truth Social platform, saying: "Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!"

Trudeau accused the US president of planning "a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us".

"That is never going to happen. We will never be the 51st state," he told reporters.

Washington also ramped up its trade war with Beijing on Tuesday as a new 10% levy on Chinese imports that came into effect - which adds to existing levies from Trump's first term and those announced last month.

"China will fight to the bitter end of any trade war," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said after their country announced tit-for-tat tariffs on agricultural imports from the US.

The man allegedly swallowed two pairs of earrings worth $769,500 (£597,000) hoping to avoid being charged with theft.

Israel was consulted prior to the talks, according to the White House, after reports said the two sides were discussing the release of hostages.

The US president spoke to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about trade tariffs on Wednesday.

Premium Lite will cost $7.99 per month and include "most" videos in key genres.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


YouTube is launching a less expensive tier of its “Premium” subscription service in the U.S., as the Google-owned video platform says that it now has more than 125 million subscribers to its YouTube Premium and YouTube Music services.


	The company announced the updates Wednesday.




	The new tier is called Premium Lite, and will cost $7.99 per month (compared to $13.99 per month for Premium). It will allow subscribers to watch “most videos” on YouTube ad-free, with a particular emphasis on genres like gaming, fashion, news, and beauty creators. Music content and Shorts will be where users see the most ads.

	At the same time, Lyor Cohen, YouTube’s global head of music, revealed that YouTube Premium and YouTube Music have a combined 125 million subscribers: “An incredible milestone that many laughed off as impossible when we first launched,” he wrote in his annual letter, released Wednesday. “This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there. This momentum is critical to our goal of becoming the No. 1 contributor of revenue to the industry, and we won’t stop until we get there.”


	YouTube announced that it had hit 100 million Premium and Music subscribers a year ago. It also revealed that its YouTube TV service passed 8 million subscribers.


	The new less expensive Premium tier is likely to further drive total subscribers.


	Cohen also used his letter to tease what he sees coming, including increased use of AI tools, and what he calls “the rebirth of the music video.”


	To hear Cohen explain it, YouTube is the new MTV, the place where culture-defining artists drop their latest work, or where new artists can be discovered.


	“As I look forward, I’m foreseeing a renaissance of the music video,” he wrote. “It’s not about having the biggest production budget; it’s about sharing authentic hero content that music fans can’t unsee. It’s about using the artist’s most influential asset – the music video – and cutting through the tidal wave of clutter and choice. Think about the iconic music videos that have shaped our culture. These weren’t simply videos; they were cultural moments. And they didn’t just break songs – they broke artists.”

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



With Wall Street focused on the impact of July's global IT outage on customer contract renewals, CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) delivered fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates. The cybersecurity firm's fiscal 2026 sales and profitability outlook for CrowdStrike stock underwhelmed.

The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based cybersecurity firm reported January-ended quarterly earnings after the market close on Tuesday.

CrowdStrike earnings climbed 8% to $1.03 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue, including acquisitions, rose 25% to $1.06 billion.

Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted earnings of 86 cents a share on revenue of $1.035 billion.

With CrowdStrike, Wall Street analysts focus on annual recurring revenue, or ARR. It's a key financial metric tied to subscription services growth. Analysts have lowered estimates for "net new" ARR amid expectations that many customers will seek price discounts when renewing contracts to help cover the cost of business disruptions. A software upgrade caused the IT outage.

In Q4, total ARR increased 23% to $4.24 billion. Analysts had predicted total ARR of $4.21 billion. But net new ARR fell 20% to $224.3 million.

"CrowdStrike put up strong Q4 results with $224 million in net new ARR coming in ahead of expectations, but offering little in the way of clarity into the timing or magnitude of a second half (fiscal 2026) reacceleration," said UBS analyst Roger Boyd in a report. "In addition, while the revenue guidance for 21% year-over-year growth was ahead of consensus, the outlook for margins was below expectations, with CrowdStrike guiding to 20% operating margin."

For fiscal 2026, which starts with the current quarter ending in April, CrowdStrike predicted revenue in a range of $4.744 billion to $4.805 billion vs. estimates for $4.768 billion.

CrowdStrike said it expects adjusted EPS of $3.39 at the midpoint of guidance, well below estimates of $4.40. CrowdStrike plans higher investments in marketing and artificial intelligence infrastructure. Higher taxes also will impact profitability

Also, CrowdStrike did not provide an outlook for total ARR versus estimates of $5.058 billion.

At William Blair, analyst Jonathan Ho noted that CrowdStrike management said it no longer is offering customers perks related to the IT outage.

"Guidance for revenue was offered only slightly above the consensus for 2026 with pro forma EPS guidance well below, due primarily to tax rate and incremental investments," Ho said in a report. "Fiscal 2026 is expected to be back-end loaded from an ARR perspective as customer commitment package — related revenue is expected to be renewed, but it is unclear at what levels."

He added: "CrowdStrike has been clear that it expects the business to accelerate in the back half of the year as it converts CCP-free products to be paid."

At Jefferies, analyst Joseph Gallo said in a report: "While risk remains on whether customers actually pay for free modules eventually, we have confidence in CrowdStrike's market position driving a fiscal second half 2026 net new ARR re-acceleration."

On the stock market today, CrowdStrike stock fell 7.5% to near 361 in early trading. Heading into the CrowdStrike earnings report, shares were up 15% in 2025.

"The company changed the accounting of employee payroll related to stock based compensation, hiding another 500 to 600 basis points of operating mrgin pressure, but management noted it now uses the same accounting practices as peers," said Bank of America analyst Tal Liani in a report. "Similar to other software vendors and to Zscaler (ZS), management raised the assumed tax rate from about 5% to 22.5% to account for full taxes post historical loss credits."

Further, CrowdStrike recently said its sales through Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing arm of Amazon.com (AMZN), had surpassed $1 billion in 2024.

CrowdStrike competes with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), SentinelOne (S), Microsoft (MSFT) and others in the "endpoint" market. Endpoint security tools detect malware on laptops, mobile phones and other devices that access corporate networks.

Also, CrowdStrike is building a broad, threat-detection cybersecurity platform called XDR, which stands for extended detection and response. It monitors endpoints as well as web/email gateways, web application firewalls and cloud business workloads.

The data-driven news brand 538 will be shuttered in the cuts.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Media & Business Writer


	The Walt Disney Co. is slashing just under 200 jobs at ABC News and at its Disney Entertainment Networks division as the traditional TV business continues to face economic headwinds, a source familiar with the decision tells The Hollywood Reporter. The cuts represented about 6 percent of the division’s workforce.


	ABC News will be hit particularly hard, with the data-driven digital news brand 538 being shuttered, teams from Nightline and 20/20 being consolidated, and all three hours of Good Morning America moving under the same top producer, Simone Swink. The company is also merging its digital and social operations.

	











	Disney’s entertainment networks will see cuts in program planning and scheduling, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the cuts there. Disney’s channels include FX and Freeform. The newsletter Status first reported the looming cuts at ABC News.

	ABC News last saw job cuts last fall, when around 75 jobs were eliminated. The news division had announced Almin Karamehmedovic as its president last August.


	Broadcast news divisions in general are grappling with the changing economics of TV, with structures increasingly consolidated in divisions alongside local TV stations, and the role of network news president being a smaller role than it was in they heyday of TV. Disney writ large announced structure-driven job cuts last September.

Virginia Acquisition Grows Penzance’s Industrial Portfolio


WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Penzance, a leading owner, operator, developer and investor in the Mid-Atlantic region, announced today the acquisition of Gateway & Linden, a six-building industrial portfolio totaling 212,086 square feet in Manassas, Virginia. The $55 million acquisition, completed this month, adds to Penzance’s growing industrial portfolio and reinforces its commitment to strategic investment across commercial real estate asset classes.





Gateway & Linden, acquired from a partnership owned by Davin Holdings and The Davis Companies, consists of two industrial flex parks:



Lauren Kowall, Senior Vice President of Investments at Penzance, said, “This acquisition aligns with our strategy to expand in high-demand industrial markets and capitalize on our in-house expertise to drive long-term value. In this supply-constrained Northern Virginia market, high-quality industrial flex assets like these are becoming increasingly scarce, making this a particularly valuable addition to our portfolio.”



The Gateway & Linden portfolio presented a compelling investment opportunity for Penzance due to its prime location in Manassas, a high-demand industrial submarket with strong regional connectivity. The property is strategically located in the Route 29/I-66 corridor, offering direct access to Interstate 66, Prince William Parkway, and Balls Ford Road, enabling seamless and efficient distribution throughout the D.C. metro area. Its location within Prince William County also positions it to serve warehouse users supporting the data center industry, where over 8.5 million square feet of data center currently exists, which is projected to increase to 80 million square feet over the next decade, further enhancing its long-term value.



Penzance aims to lease current and upcoming vacancies ranging between 6,000 and 33,000 square feet, as well as convert office-heavy suites to industrial use by raising dropped ceilings and adding dock doors. Penzance’s in-house property management team will oversee operations, driving efficiencies and value creation.



Working closely alongside the Penzance team, JLL's Metro DC Industrial Team has been selected to spearhead the leasing efforts for the project. Leveraging their extensive market knowledge and proven track record in the industrial sector, the team will be responsible for marketing the property and securing blue chip tenants.



Dan Coats, senior managing director at JLL, added, "We are thrilled to partner with such a dedicated and hands-on local owner. Penzance’s commitment to the community aligns perfectly with our approach to delivering tailored, high-touch solutions. Together, we look forward to bringing these exceptional properties to market and creating value for both the ownership and future tenants."



This acquisition expands Penzance’s industrial portfolio and strengthens its growing industrial development pipeline. JLL’s Mid-Atlantic Capital Markets team, including Bill Prutting, Craig Childs and Chris Dale served as the sole advisors on the sale transaction.



Bill Prutting, senior managing director of Capital Markets, said, “JLL is tracking over 7 million square feet of industrial tenant displacement driven primarily by data centers. Given this trend, the Gateway & Linden portfolio is exceptionally well-positioned. It's poised to retain current tenants who already supply goods and services to data centers, while also attracting new tenants ready to meet market rental rates in Manassas.”

President Donald Trump has moved forward with a plan to put sweeping tariffs on all goods coming into the United States from Canada and Mexico, threatening a trade war with its closest trading partners — and higher prices for Americans on thousands of consumer goods. 

The U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%. 

Businesses ranging from automakers to alcohol producers have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy. While some companies will look to source their goods from other countries or move production to the U.S., those moves could take years. 

In the meantime, companies have said they will have to pay the tariffs and then pick from two options: either pass the added costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorb the fees and either cut costs elsewhere or take lower profits. 

On Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month, which includes products such as electronics, footwear, medicines and cosmetics. Those tariffs are in addition to tariffs already put in place during Trump's first term in office.

Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.

Late Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. In an appearance on Fox Business News, Lutnick said an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree could come as soon as Wednesday.

"The Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better," Lutnick said. "And the president is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable. So I think he's going to work something out with them."

Lutnick continued: "It's not going to be a pause, that pause stuff, but I think he's going to figure out you do more, and I'll meet you in the middle some way, and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow. So somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way."

The move risks a tit-for-tat trade war with Mexico, Canada and China that could hurt U.S. businesses selling their products to those countries and upended one of the signature deals of Trump's first term: the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

That agreement, which Trump touted at the time as a negotiating victory, largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, similar to how they had for decades under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. Under the terms of the deal, the agreement wasn’t supposed to be up for renegotiation until July 2026, but Trump’s move to impose new tariffs could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday. In a news conference, she said the action would include "tariff and nontariff measures." Sheinbaum also said that Mexico had already taken steps during the past month to crack down on drug gangs and trafficking flows.

Canada will move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) of American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled. Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee, will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn.

"We don't want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don't want to see you hurt, either, but your government has chosen to do this to you," Trudeau said at a news conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people. 

Then, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: "Even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do."

He noted that even though less than 1% of fentanyl seized by the U.S. is coming across the Canadian border, the country has been taking action to further crackdown on the illegal drug trade. As a result, Trudeau said there was a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, "to a near zero low of less than half an ounce seized in January." 

China said it will impose additional tariffs on U.S. goods March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. China said that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.

“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.

Trump had previously threatened to place a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 before saying he was delaying those tariffs for a month, after the leaders of the two countries said they would be stepping up security at their borders. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to negotiate on the new import duties.

Economists across the political spectrum have warned that the tariffs, which are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods, would increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Stocks fell nearly 2% Monday, the worst day since December. 

“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy,” Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement Monday. “Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.”

Automakers are among the industries that will feel the greatest impact from the tariffs, since vehicles and their components cross between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico multiple times during the production process. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers. 

“Let’s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,” Farley said at an investor conference last month.

The tariffs could add as much as $12,000 to the price of a new car, according to a report from the Anderson Economic Group. The American Automotive Policy Council,  the industry association representing GM, Ford and Stellantis, said they believe their vehicles and parts that meet the tariff-free requirements under the previously negotiated trade deal during Trump’s first term should be exempt from the tariffs.

“Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the association, said in a statement.

The Aluminum Association, which represents aluminum production and jobs in the U.S., said in February that the U.S. sources two-thirds of the primary aluminum it uses every year from Canada and about 90% of scrap metal from either Canada or Mexico. It added that U.S.-based smelters, even at full capacity, “cannot produce nearly enough metal to meet demand.” 

The tariffs could also contribute to higher grocery prices since Mexico is one of the top suppliers to the U.S. of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years — an issue Trump pledged to tackle on the campaign trail. 

The tariffs could also increase the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico and Canada and hurt sales of U.S. spirits sold in those countries. The Distilled Spirits Council estimates that a 25% tariff on distilled spirits imports from Mexico and Canada could lead to a loss of more than 31,000 U.S. jobs. In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, as well as $622 million worth of Canadian spirits, according to the association. 

“Tariffs on spirits products from Canada and Mexico will jeopardize the industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy,” the group said in a statement. “The North American spirits sector is highly interconnected and, as a result, tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey will harm U.S. spirits companies that have these products in their brand portfolios.”   

Trump has indicated that further tariffs will be on the way. He reiterated Monday that previously announced “reciprocal” tariffs would be coming April 2, and that tariffs on “external product” from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.

Last month, Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States from all countries, and raised his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.

Trump has repeatedly cited tariffs as a tool he can use to raise revenue to pay for other domestic spending priorities and as a measure to pressure companies to relocate production to the U.S.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) and TWG Global (TWG) today announced a joint venture to redefine AI deployment in banking, investment management, insurance and other financial services. By pairing Palantir’s unmatched AI infrastructure with TWG’s deep expertise in business operations and financial services, this initiative will enable financial institutions to integrate AI at scale—moving beyond fragmented, piecemeal solutions to a singular, fully embedded, enterprise-wide approach.





Led by Palantir CEO Alex Karp and TWG Global’s Mark Walter, Thomas Tull, and Chief Data & Analytics Officer Drew Cukor—the joint venture brings together a team with a deeply established history of collaboration, spanning over two decades in deploying AI at scale across high-stakes defense, government, and commercial applications. Over the past year, TWG and Palantir have actively worked together to embed AI into TWG’s own companies, refining their approach and proving its impact. This is the next step in that effort—a battle-tested, operational AI offering designed to revolutionize financial services and insurance and accelerate industry-wide adoption.



“Palantir is proud to partner with TWG Global to further seamlessly weave AI into the fabric of financial services and help forward-looking companies unlock enormous opportunity," said Alex Karp, co-founder and chief executive officer of Palantir Technologies. "By combining TWG's deep industry expertise with Palantir's world-leading software, we are empowering businesses to not just navigate today's complex global market, but to position themselves for dominance in it by remaining at the forefront of the AI revolution.”



More than a mere partnership, this initiative represents a fundamental rethinking of AI’s role in business—moving beyond a tool managed by IT teams to an “artificial workforce” integrated into every core function. Leaders who understand strategy, human capital, and operational impact must take ownership of AI—not as a side project, but as the backbone of their business’s growth and resilience. This isn’t optional. As industries shift at an unprecedented pace, AI is the defining factor of who leads and who falls behind in the next era of global competitiveness.



“AI is no longer an add-on—it’s woven into the fabric of every decision, every process, and every outcome, delivering tomorrow’s competitive advantage," said Tull. “From Wall Street to the Pentagon, AI is already reshaping industries. But what was once a competitive advantage is now a competitive necessity. Companies that fail to incorporate AI into their core operations will find themselves outpaced by those that do.”



This full-scale AI solution embeds intelligence across every core function of financial institutions and insurance companies—from compliance and customer growth to operational efficiency, fraud detection, risk monitoring, credit and lending, and capital optimization. Unlike fragmented AI tools, this holistic program drives real business impact by mitigating risk, reshoring capabilities, adapting to shifting labor dynamics, and future-proofing banks and insurers against market volatility and regulatory pressures.



Drew Cukor, TWG Global’s Head of Data and Analytics (former Head of AI Transformation at JPMorgan and Head of the Pentagon’s Project Maven), brings a track record of introducing AI to some of the world’s most complex organizations. At the Pentagon’s Project Maven, he helped shape AI-driven defense capabilities, and later at JPMorgan Chase, he scaled AI solutions across financial operations, integrating machine learning into one of the most intricate banking systems globally and resulting in JPMorgan being recognized as the top-rated bank in AI globally for three consecutive years.



“AI is fundamentally reshaping the workforce—changing who does what and how effective employees can be. It’s not just something to add to a company’s tech stack; it requires a complete shift in how businesses operate,” said Cukor. “That’s why we’ve redefined AI as a management and business process issue, not just a technical deployment. The real question isn’t whether to adopt AI, but who should own and lead its implementation.”



“Encouraging the deployment of emerging technology within our portfolio businesses is at the core of our investment strategy,” said Walter. “By expanding our model beyond our own portfolio, we’re ensuring that companies remain at the forefront of global competitiveness. This is just the beginning, and we’re excited to use this partnership to redefine the future of financial services.

After more than a century, the Poor Clares, an order of Roman Catholic nuns, have moved out of their historic monastery in the 700 block of Henry Clay Avenue near Audubon Park, leaving vacant an entire city block in the heart of one of Uptown’s priciest neighborhoods.

Just four nuns, all in their 80s, had been living in St. Clare's Monastery, as the nearly 2-acre property is formally known. It stands behind a brick wall and encompasses the entire block bounded by Henry Clay, Magazine, Constance and Calhoun streets.

Given their advanced age and dwindling numbers, maintaining the buildings and sprawling grounds was simply too much for the nuns to manage, said Sr. Charlene Toups, who leads the order.

“We do our own work and are pretty self-sustaining,” said Toups, a New Orleans native, who joined the order in 1966 after dropping out of college. “But we’re older now and it’s hard for us to climb up and down ladders to change light bulbs and tend to the gardening.”

The nuns are working to sell the property to a local developer and hope to finalize a deal soon, said Toups, who declined to provide details, citing a nondisclosure agreement. They recently relocated to a house on Valmont Street about a mile from the monastery.

The monastery dates to 1912 and includes a main three-story building with a chapel, offices, meeting rooms, dining space and an infirmary. The upper floors of the building house dozens of bedrooms, most of which have been empty for years, and was designated in 1979 as a historic landmark by the city's Historic Districts Landmarks Commission.

The monastery grounds are extensive, and include a mortuary chapel, where members of the order are buried, and a garden shed. There are also two live oaks named St. Anthony and St. Roch, a grotto, a grassy labyrinth and benches for contemplation.

Earlier this year, the monastery was assessed at nearly $7 million, according to the Orleans Parish Assessor’s Office, which valued the land at nearly $4 million and the buildings nearly $3 million.

Experts say given its size, location, historic architecture and storied past, the unique piece of property is hard to put a price tag on.

“It’s prime real estate, obviously,” said Larry Schedler of Larry G. Schedler and Associates, who specializes in the local apartment market. “There would be tremendous demand for it as market-rate or affordable housing. It’s really going to come down to how many historic tax credits can a developer get to renovate it.”

The Poor Clare order is more than 800 years old and was founded by St. Clare of Assisi, who was born into nobility in 13th-cenutry Italy and gave up her life of privilege to follow the example of poverty and simple living set by her contemporary, St. Francis of Assisi.

Poor Clare nuns are cloistered, meaning, they spend their lives in the monastery, praying and working, rather than ministering to the needy out in the world. Members of the order pledge chastity, poverty, obedience and enclosure when they enter the monastery, and devote themselves to a life of contemplative prayer.  

Today, there are about 20,000 Poor Clare nuns living in more than 70 countries worldwide, according to Santa Clara University, which is affiliated with the order.

Toups entered the order in the mid-1960s, when many other priests and nuns were rethinking their vocations and leaving. At the time, there were 27 Poor Clares at the local monastery.

“Everybody was dropping out. I was dropping in,” said Toups, who felt called to a life of poverty and contemplative prayer.

In the nearly six decades since, Toups said she hasn’t looked back and has found living in community both rewarding and meaningful. Though the Poor Clares are cloistered, they have played an active role in the local community.

For years, they ran a small printing business that printed stationery and brochures for small local museums. They also had a gift shop, where they sold homemade art and ornaments. Additionally, they baked communion wafers for local Roman Catholic parishes and held Sunday mass in their main chapel, which continues even though the nuns have moved.

“We are hoping to reestablish our gift shop once we get settled,” Toups said. “We’re still in the process of moving everything out. After more than a century, it takes a little while.”

The Poor Clare monastery is the latest of several large parcels of real estate owned by the Roman Catholic church and its affiliated orders that have been sold or listed for sale, amid changing demographics, aging priests and nuns and other financial pressures.

Locally, the Archdiocese of New Orleans’ need to raise money to settle claims with hundreds of survivors of sex abuse by priests, deacons and brothers has prompted Archbishop Gregory Aymond to sell nearly $20 million of real estate in recent years.

The Poor Clare order is not under the control of the archdiocese and the nuns own the monastery independent of the local church. Their deal to sell the property is not related to the church bankruptcy. 

While the Poor Clare property is valued at nearly $7 million by the assessor, it’s unclear how much the property would fetch on the open market, experts say.

A full city block in Mid City, including the shuttered Sacred Heart of Jesus Church on Canal Street, was assessed last year at $6.1 million. Its current asking price is $1.95 million, down from $2.28 million in late 2023.

But the Mid City property, though comparable in size to the monastery Uptown, is hamstrung by a couple of factors. It includes a large, aging former church building, which doesn’t lend itself to reuse as an apartment complex or condos. Also, a former school building on the Mid City site has already been converted to a rent-adjusted apartments for low-income seniors.

Schedler says the value of the Uptown monastery will come down to the amount of historic building tax credits a developer is able to secure to renovate the building and convert it to residential use.

Highlights Sapporo’s Unaddressed Governance Deficiencies and Lack of Commitment to Maximizing Corporate Value



Encourages Shareholders to Appoint Mr. Paul Brough as a Director who is a Member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee at the Company’s Upcoming Annual General Meeting to Enhance Board Oversight


TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3D Investment Partners Pte. Ltd., the asset management company of 3D OPPORTUNITY MASTER FUND (collectively referred to as “3D,” "we" or "our"), today released a supplemental presentation in response to a presentation released on February 28, 2025 (the "February 28 Presentation") by Sapporo Holdings Limited ("Sapporo" or “the Company") (2501.T) in connection with the Company’s 101st Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the "AGM"), scheduled to be held on March 28, 2025.



Sapporo’s February 28 Presentation failed to allay our concerns about Sapporo’s governance, Board composition, commitment to maximize the proceeds of its Real Estate business, or lack of capital discipline needed to deploy the proceeds from the divestiture of the Real Estate business in an optimal manner.



Our presentation is available at: https://www.3dipartners.com/engagement/sapporo-agm-en-202503-addition.pdf



Our Engagement with Sapporo



3D is Sapporo’s largest shareholder, holding approximately 19% of its outstanding shares. For nearly three years, we have sought to engage constructively with the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and its executives to improve governance and oversight and enhance corporate value. Our engagement has had a meaningfully positive impact on the strategic direction and plan to divest its Real Estate business, which resulted in Sapporo’s share price outperforming compared to its competitors and the market.



We are supportive of Sapporo’s efforts to focus on its core Alcoholic Beverages business and divest most of its real estate assets. However, Sapporo has the lowest profit margin and ROE of all listed beer companies in the world, and it has also recorded impairment losses on all of its major overseas alcoholic business acquisitions. Furthermore, it has never achieved its sales and operating profit targets including the final year of its mid-term management plan for the past 19 years. Considering the above, we are deeply concerned that the strategic review process that is underway to introduce external capital into the Real Estate business is not designed to maximize corporate value. Furthermore, given Sapporo’s stated policy to deploy the proceeds for large-scale investments in the beer business, we are deeply concerned that, without more effective oversight and enhanced capital discipline, the Company may repeat the capital allocation mistakes of the past and once again incur significant impairment losses.



Concerns Regarding Sapporo’s February 28 Presentation



The Company’s February 28 Presentation did not address these concerns.



Not once in its 35-page presentation, or any of its prior communications, has Sapporo pledged to maximize the proceeds from the divestiture of Sapporo’s Real Estate business. In our view, such a clear affirmation is a prerequisite for an effective process therefor and entirely consistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties. Such a commitment should not be controversial. The fact that the Board is unwilling to make this simple commitment illustrates why improved oversight is urgently needed to avoid making such process arbitrary.



In the February 28 Presentation, Sapporo touts the number of meetings held by the Audit and Supervisory Committee and the proportion of independent outside directors on the Board as supposed evidence of “strengthened” corporate governance. In our view, however, the effectiveness of a governance system should be judged by the outcomes it generates. Despite Sapporo’s claims that the current Board is optimal for improving corporate value and shareholder interests, we believe the Company’s shortcomings – a suboptimal business configuration; the lowest profit margin and ROE in the world in the Company’s core Alcoholic Beverages business; and a track record of value-destructive acquisitions – reflect inadequate oversight that has impaired Sapporo’s corporate value.



At least, Sapporo's shareholders have never benefited from the Board that Sapporo has evaluated as “optimal”.



We find it telling that, in the Company’s February 28 Presentation, the Company did not dispute the fact that:



Our Proposal: Strengthening the Audit and Supervisory Committee to Enhance Board Oversight



We believe it is essential for the Audit and Supervisory Committee to be comprised of independent directors with expertise in accounting standards, financial management, auditing, M&A, capital allocation and real estate. Only then will the Audit and Supervisory Committee be positioned to effectively evaluate the reasonableness of Sapporo’s business strategies and transactions such as maximizing the proceeds from divesting the Real Estate business and optimally allotting its proceeds and prevent failures in judgment which is important and irreversible.



We are seeking to appoint Mr. Paul Brough as an outside director who is a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee.



Mr. Brough is extremely well qualified for the role, given his extensive knowledge of accounting, real estate, business development and restructuring, M&A, asset sales and capital allocation. However, in the February 28 Presentation, Sapporo seeks to justify its opposition to Mr. Brough’s appointment by making false and misleading claims regarding his independence and expertise. To be clear:



Conclusion



We encourage our fellow shareholders to review today’s presentation and the other materials we have prepared highlighting the case for strengthening the Audit and Supervisory Committee to enhance Board oversight at Sapporo and to vote in favor of our proposal to appoint Mr. Brough as an outside director who is a member of the Audit and Supervisory Committee at the Company’s upcoming AGM.

According to Crypto Rover, Senator Cynthia Lummis has expressed skepticism about the immediate feasibility of Trump's proposed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, citing that Congress is not yet prepared to accept the related bill. This development suggests potential delays in the adoption of significant cryptocurrency-related legislation, impacting market sentiment and strategic planning for investors.

 Howard Lutnick said Bitcoin will likely be treated differently than the other assets tipped to be in the US crypto reserve. 

US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has confirmed that the Trump administration will unveil plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7.

In an interview with The Pavlovic Today, Lutnick clarified that Bitcoin (BTC) will likely have a special status in the country’s national cryptocurrency reserve, which will include Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP).

“The president definitely thinks that there’s a Bitcoin strategic reserve,” Secretary Lutnick said. “Now, there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies. And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

President Donald Trump has faced criticism since announcing on social media that the country’s crypto reserve would include assets other than Bitcoin. Critics say centralized altcoins should not be included alongside Bitcoin, which is the only decentralized commodity that can be used as a long-term store of wealth.

Even notorious Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff, who refused to invest in the digital asset when it was valued at less than $100, said he understands the rationale behind a BTC-only reserve but not one that includes altcoins.

In response, Lutnick reiterated Trump’s interest in a Bitcoin-only stockpile without dismissing the other assets in the proposed basket.

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently — positively, but differently,” said Lutnick.

President Trump is scheduled to hold the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, where up to 25 participants have been confirmed so far. The invite list includes Strategy founder Michael Saylor, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.

The summit reflects the US government’s historic pivot toward digital assets under President Trump, who vowed to make America the blockchain and crypto capital of the world during the election. 

Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission has established a Crypto Task Force to carve out a “sensible regulatory path” for the sector. The task force has already met with several industry representatives to better understand their regulatory pain points. 

Meanwhile, the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Artificial Intelligence has engaged with industry experts on a range of issues, from stablecoin regulations to which agency should be given spot market authority over crypto.

Ethereum developers on Wednesday initially celebrated a seemingly successful test of Pectra, the blockchain’s most significant upgrade since 2024, on the Sepolia test network. However, hours after the test, Sepolia began to encounter errors.

It was the second buggy test for the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which is designed to improve Ethereum's efficiency, user experience, and validator system. The issues have led to calls from some developers that the upgrade be delayed.

Wednesday’s Sepolia test was expected to be the final step before Pectra’s launch on Ethereum’s mainnet. Initially, the test appeared to succeed, but later, developers noticed empty blocks being added to the chain.

The Ethereum Foundation attributed the issue to "an issue with Sepolia's permissioned deposit contract," which "prevented many execution layer clients from including transactions in blocks." In other words, the problem stemmed from a misconfiguration specific to the Sepolia test, rather than a flaw with Pectra itself.

Ethereum Foundation developers said they "identified the root cause within minutes" and deployed a fix to restore the network’s normal function.

Despite this, the test has raised concerns about whether Pectra has undergone sufficient testing. The previous test on Ethereum’s Holesky testnet also ran into configuration issues, that time caused by misconfigured validators.

"I do think the incidents on both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets warrant a delay to Pectra mainnet activation," Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital told CoinDesk. Kim noted that while developers may feel ready, the broader Ethereum ecosystem—including major smart contract applications and wallet providers—needs to be prepared.

Kim suggested that Ethereum’s developers "spend the time to set up additional testing infrastructure" before launching the upgrade.

Ethereum core developers are set to meet on March 7 to determine Pectra’s official launch date. Any delay could stir controversy among Ethereum supporters, who are already on edge due to a lagging ETH token price, leadership drama at the Ethereum Foundation, and mounting competition from networks like Solana.

Survey insights show a demand for crypto knowledge as Ripple funds the National Cryptocurrency Association.

Ripple has taken a step toward advancing crypto education in the United States by spearheading the National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) launch.

The NCA is positioned as an independent, non-partisan organization with no political affiliations. Its primary goal is to provide educational resources and promote a deeper understanding of crypto.

According to a March 5 statement, the initiative has a $50 million grant from Ripple to increase crypto literacy and foster safe adoption nationwide.

Although Ripple is backing the NCA financially, Ripple CEO Brad Garlingouse clarified that the organization will function independently.

Garlinghouse explained that the firm was finding the initiative because of the importance of education in unlocking the potential of digital assets. He noted that the $50 million funding will support awareness campaigns and showcase how crypto benefits individuals nationwide.

The initiative follows a recent survey conducted with Harris Poll, which gathered insights from thousands of US crypto holders.

The results showed a strong desire for a greater understanding of digital assets, with 81% of respondents expressing a strong interest in learning about the emerging industry’s future.

Additionally, 76% of participants reported positive financial impacts from their crypto involvement, citing greater financial independence and learning and personal growth opportunities.

Considering this, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer and the newly appointed president of the NCA, emphasized that the organization’s role would be to make crypto more accessible.

He noted that the NCA will simplify complex concepts through easy-to-understand explainers and real-life stories from crypto users.

He added on X:

“NCA is here to cut through the noise and make sure everyday Americans have the facts, resources and tools, and support they need to engage with crypto confidently. If you’re already benefitting from digital assets in your life or your business, now’s the time to join us and share your story. If you’re just curious, we are here for you to learn more.”

BREAKING: Stocks Await Tariff News



Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call/Newscom)

President Donald Trump's push for the U.S. government to hold a strategic bitcoin reserve has won the support of some crypto bulls in the U.S. Congress despite doubts that it could be accomplished in the near term.

One prominent supporter, Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis, who introduced the bill for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve, said the lack of congressional support remains a major hurdle.

"It was hard for me to hear that my colleagues, even on my side of the aisle, were not ready," Lummis said at the Bitcoin Investor Day event in New York City on Friday.

She cited Tim Scott, chairman of the House Banking Committee, whom she said argued that "we might need to put a pin for a little while in the bitcoin strategic reserve because we're not there yet," Lummis said. She says the biggest hurdle facing the creation of a strategic reserve is a lack of congressional support.

In a series of social media posts over the weekend, Trump said his administration would move forward with a crypto strategic reserve, naming several tokens that would be included. The named tokens included bitcoin, ethereum, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano, all of which soared in value after Trump's post on Sunday afternoon.



Creating a strategic reserve would effectively establish an institutional price floor for bitcoin and other tokens included in the reserve.

The mechanics behind how a strategic reserve would be created and run are also a source of controversy and debate. It remains unclear if Trump can use executive powers to create a strategic reserve or if it would require an act of Congress.

One alternative is to create a strategic reserve out of bitcoin and other crypto already confiscated through the Department of Justice, although the mechanism of such a transfer remains unclear.

Lummis, an established bitcoin bull, is well-known for her advocacy of bitcoin in government. In July 2024, the senator introduced the bill to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, where the Treasury would hold all bitcoins for at least 20 years unless used to pay off federal debt. The bill, which is often cited as a concrete way the government can establish a strategic reserve, was referred to the Senate Banking Committee where it has remained.

In 2021, the Wall Street Journal reported that Lummis owned roughly $250,000 of bitcoin.

Bitcoin bulls, meanwhile, remain undeterred. Cathie Wood, ARK Invest CEO, told IBD she fully expects the U.S. government's confiscated bitcoin will ultimately be used to establish the crypto reserve. She also expects the government to sell some of its land and gold to fund more purchases of bitcoin. "I think we could do some diversification of our asset base and get to that $1 million bitcoin goal with those sorts of asset sales," she said.

Other pro-bitcoin voices say the one-two punch of a strategic reserve and reduced government regulation are set to provide crypto with its new catalyst for rising valuation. "With regards to regulation, I think it should be clear rules, I think it should allow for international competition," Matt Cole, Strive Asset Management CEO, told IBD. "You can't do business in a country if you don't know the law."

During the Biden Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission pursued multiple investigations with the intent of establishing whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were securities and therefore should fall under SEC jurisdiction, a key step in future regulation. Ongoing cases against Robinhood, Coinbase and other major entities were dismissed by the SEC under the Trump Administration.

Other bitcoin bulls are cooler on the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. "I don't really think a strategic reserve is absolutely necessary," Dan Tapiero, CEO and chief investment officer of 1RoundTable Partners & 10T Holdings, told IBD. Tapiero is a leading investor in crypto-focused businesses, with $1.5 billion invested in various crypto-related ventures and funds.

While he thinks a reserve would ultimately help the crypto market and help taxpayers, he remains pessimistic over the mechanics of creating a new reserve. "It's very complicated when you look at assets that a central bank or a treasury holds," he said.

But Tapiero remains supportive of the rapid pace the Trump Administration is taking to crypto. "It's just been fantastic, the speed of change," he said. "Over the medium term we're going to see that also lead to an increase in adoption."

Trump's strategic reserve posts have provided rocket fuel for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin soared past $90,000 per coin in late Sunday trades on Trump's posts, this after dipping just below $80,000 on Thursday.

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were previously on a hot streak, hitting market highs following in December and January following Trump's election on expectations of lowered regulations and campaign trail promises of a strategic reserve. But earlier in February, the cryptocurrency took a beating over a risk-off mood from investors, fueled by Trump's tariff threats and fears about economic shakiness.

Adding to the earlier sour mood around crypto, a recent hack of cryptocurrency exchange Bybit saw more than $1.4 billion in ether stolen through a sophisticated attack on a cold-to-warm wallet transaction. CEO Ben Zhou claims Bybit remains solvent.

New survey reveals consumers are benefitting from crypto in many ways but crave more education

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA), a new non-profit organization dedicated to helping Americans better understand crypto, launches today with the goal of boosting crypto literacy and safe adoption across the country. The NCA will demystify crypto and serve as a resource for anyone and everyone using, holding, or wanting to learn more.





“Crypto going mainstream is no longer a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’,” said Stuart Alderoty, President of the NCA. “Millions are already benefiting from crypto making it quicker and easier to shop online, send money anywhere in the world, create apps, art and games, or build financial futures. We’re giving a voice to users from all walks of life and serving as a guide for how to use crypto responsibly.”



The NCA partnered with Harris Poll to survey 10,000 current crypto holders in the U.S. and found that 81% are interested in learning more about the future of crypto. To bridge the gap, the NCA is providing educational resources, including easy-to-understand explainers and real stories from everyday people using crypto.



“The opportunity for crypto - especially in the US - is now stronger than ever,” said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple. “That’s why I’m proud to announce that Ripple will be funding the NCA with a $50 million grant to educate, raise awareness and shine a spotlight on all the positives that crypto is bringing to people across the country.”



The survey also found that one in five American adults already use crypto and 76% of users say it has positively impacted their lives, giving them increased financial independence, opportunities for learning and personal growth, and fun and excitement from being part of a new and innovative field. Crypto is also providing opportunity for consumers far beyond finance:

About the National Cryptocurrency Association:



The National Cryptocurrency Association (NCA) is a 501(C)(4) organization dedicated to educating consumers about how to engage with crypto. Crypto is positively impacting the lives of millions of Americans but misinformation has held back those who stand to benefit. The NCA is here to help people make sense of crypto by sharing the stories of real people and businesses using crypto, providing educational resources to navigate the hype and confusion, and offering guidance and support through partnerships and services.



Harris Poll Survey Methodology



The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the National Cryptocurrency Association among 10,000 cryptocurrency holders. The survey was conducted January 22, 2025, through February 3, 2025. More detailed findings will be published in a report in March.



Data are weighted where necessary by age, gender, race/ethnicity, region, education, marital status, household size, employment, household income, and political party affiliation to bring them in line with their actual proportions in the population.



Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have agreed to participate in our surveys. The sampling precision of Harris online polls is measured by using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, the sample data is accurate to within ± 1.2 percentage points using a 95% confidence level. This credible interval will be wider among subsets of the surveyed population of interest.



All sample surveys and polls, whether or not they use probability sampling, are subject to other multiple sources of error which are most often not possible to quantify or estimate, including, but not limited to coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.

You can’t really get a more bearish chart for BTC than this:

In my opinion, the future is very likely to unfold like this:

Only an incredible event can turn this around. $60,000 is a destination, and $40,000 is a possibility.

So, we have the U.S. Crypto Reserve becoming a thing. We have the SEC, etc., lifting its boot from crypto’s neck. We have trade wars, global conniptions, and all the other random factors that are supposed to propel bitcoin to the moon – and yet, the chart looks like a classic developing bust.

Trade what you see, not what you think.

Gold is for war, and bitcoin is for flight. You can see Ukrainian interests selling, buying, and selling their flight capital as the news flow surges back and forth.

So, what’s the big picture?

The U.S. economy is about to go into a tailspin because of tariffs – unless this is ‘3D Chess’!

Tariffs are a sales tax on Americans – a big, flat tax on everyone. The foreign suppliers don’t pay the tariff; the importer does. It’s a trillion dollar tax increase. If new money isn’t printed, a depression ensues. This leads to stagflation or stag-deflation – a drop in GDP. Then, the U.S. government cuts 15% from its spending. That triggers an even deeper economic collapse as the money stops circulating, a million government employees join the unemployment lines, and terrified consumers stop spending, causing the economy to fold.

So what does this mean for crypto? Crypto needs fiat inflows to rise in fiat price. When money’s too tight to mention, inflows reverse.

Does anyone think the stock market is going to keep rising like ‘homesick angel’ now? Can anyone not imagine the Nasdaq at 15,000?

Even if the current administration plays the situation like Paganini plucking a Stradivarius, the disruption already underway is going to knock the froth off risk assets – because only stability unleashes risk assets, while real risks kills them dead.

Look out below.

Key industry figures, including Michael Saylor and Brian Armstrong, to join Trump at White House crypto summit.

US President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to unveil the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy at the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7, according to The Pavlovic Report.

According to the report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that President Trump will outline his vision for the crypto industry during the event. His address will include a strategy for a Bitcoin reserve alongside broader regulatory plans for digital assets.

Lutnick noted that while the President supports the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, discussions on the regulatory approach for altcoins are ongoing.

Lutnick said:

“A Bitcoin strategic reserve is something the President’s interested in. He spoke about it all during the campaign trail, and I think you’re going to see it executed on Friday.”

Meanwhile, Lutnick also confirmed that Bitcoin will receive special recognition under Trump’s plan, while other cryptocurrencies will be handled differently under the new policy.

According to Lutnick:

“So Bitcoin is one thing, and then the other currencies, the other crypto tokens, I think, will be treated differently—positively, but differently.”

This clarification is necessary, considering Trump’s recent social media post hinted that the crypto reserve plan might include multiple assets such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP.

The White House Crypto Summit will bring together prominent industry figures to discuss regulatory clarity, financial innovation, and economic growth opportunities.

Strategy chairman Michael Saylor confirmed on X that he has been invited to the event, which will be hosted by the President. Strategy is the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world, with nearly 500,000 BTC.

Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey and executives from leading US crypto trading platforms, including Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Kraken’s Arjun Sethi, and Robinhood’s Vlad Tenev, will also attend.

Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett noted that several high-profile industry players, including Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, have also confirmed their participation.

Additionally, venture capitalists, such as Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang and Multicoin Capital managing partner Kyle Samani, will also be present.

Huang emphasized the importance of US leadership in crypto innovation, stating:

“I look forward to discussing how America can take a leadership role in promoting the principles of open crypto and enabling builders in ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.”

Bitcoin has broken back above $90,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back after a roller coaster week that’s seen U.S. president Donald Trump trigger bitcoin and crypto price chaos.

The bitcoin price has climbed around 10% over the last 24 hours, pushing the combined crypto market back over $3 trillion, helped by BlackRock revealing a market game-changer.

Now, as Elon Musk issues a “foolish” crypto warning, Trump’s Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly confirmed Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit.

“The President definitely thinks that there’s a bitcoin strategic reserve,” Lutnick, who has claimed to have millions of dollars worth of exposure to bitcoin, told independent news site The Pavlovic Today. “Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.”

Lutnick added that bitcoin would receive a "unique status" under Trump's plans.

“This is massive,” Pete Rizzo, the former Coindesk editor-in-chief who styles himself as a “bitcoin historian,” posted to X.

On Friday, the first White House crypto summit will see influential crypto executives, founders and investors meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets to hash out a regulatory road map for crypto as well as confirm details of Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve.

“After a turbulent week of trading bitcoin has sharply rebounded to the $90,000 mark ahead of this Friday’s inaugural crypto summit," Petr Kozyakov, the chief executive of payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments.

“Renewed optimism that U.S. president Donald Trump will make the announcement of a bitcoin reserve strategy is triggering a wave of buy orders for the king of crypto. A road map forward towards a crypto strategic reserve and a model for how it would be structured will be foremost in the minds of industry leaders attending the summit. The prospect of such a monumental move is bullish and may turn sentiment around in a digital token space still reeling from the recent hack of the Bybit exchange, the biggest of all time, and an implosion of the meme coin sector.”

Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano all rocketed higher last weekend after Trump posted to his Truth Social account that he plans to create a U.S.-focused crypto reserve.

“A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding in a follow up post that bitcoin and ethereum would also be included.

Smaller cryptocurrencies being named ahead of bitcoin in a potential reserve sparked a backlash from some bitcoin supporters and led to criticism of Trump’s advisors who are believed to be acting in their own interest.

In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve.

"We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC.

"Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve.

In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

 Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet, but developers may delay the mainnet launch due to unresolved issues on Holesky. 

Ethereum’s highly anticipated Pectra upgrade was successfully deployed on its final testnet, Sepolia, marking a major milestone in the lead-up to the mainnet activation. However, potential delays remain as developers continue to address outstanding issues from a previous testnet failure.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade has gathered significant community support as it aims to improve Ether (ETH) staking, layer-2 (L2) network scalability and overall network capacity.

Pectra was successfully rolled out on its final testnet, Sepolia, at 7:29 am UTC on March 5.

The upgrade, which consists of 11 separate Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), went live on Sepolia “with a perfect proposal rate,” according to core Ethereum contributor Terence.

The Ethereum Foundation previously confirmed that once both the Holesky and Sepolia testnets are successfully upgraded to Pectra, a mainnet activation epoch will be chosen. 

However, the upgrade was activated on the Holesky testnet on Feb. 24 and failed to finalize. This may mean Ethereum developers will further delay the mainnet launch as they investigate the issues.

Investors expect more information on the final date of the Pectra mainnet implementation on March 6 during Ethereum’s All Core Developers call.

Developers now anticipate that it will take at least 18 more days for the Holesky upgrade to finalize, with issues related to “correlation penalties” and “validator balance drains” still under investigation, Terence noted.

Industry watchers are expecting Pectra to be a transformative upgrade for Ethereum.

One of Pectra’s most exciting aspects is that it may pave the way for the first staked Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.

“Pectra aims to significantly improve staking flexibility and could potentially pave the way for staking to be integrated into Ethereum exchange products,” the analyst told Cointelegraph, adding:

“With competitors like Solana gaining traction due to faster transaction speeds and lower costs, Pectra’s innovations could bolster Ethereum’s appeal, attracting further institutional participation,” he added.

Institutional appetite for Ether staking products has been growing since Donald Trump’s victory during the 2024 US presidential election, partly due to expectations of a more crypto-friendly regime in the country over the next four years.

A Trump administration will likely embrace more crypto industry innovation, including the debut of the first staked Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Edward Wilson, an analyst at Nansen. He added:

Ether ETF issuers are expecting regulatory approval for staking, according to Consensys founder Joe Lubin.

The G1 robot isn’t just agile — it’s learning kung fu. 

Video via the Chinese official state news agency Xinhua.

We have a new entry on the ever-growing “Robots and algorithms doing things no one asked them to do” list. Introducing the G1 robot, a humanoid machine with impressive balance, smooth agility, and — unexpectedly — kung fu skills. Yes, it can punch. Yes, it can pull off a roundhouse kick. And yes, that begs the question: why?

G1 first appeared on the global stage at China’s Spring Festival Gala, one of the most-watched TV events in the world. Its debut, however, was a little awkward, showcasing a humanoid figure that seemed more of a novelty than a serious technological breakthrough.

That changed quickly. In January, Unitree, the company behind G1, demonstrated the robot effortlessly jogging across uneven terrain. Now, it’s showing off complex martial arts moves, proving how much humanoid robots are advancing in terms of coordination, stability, and movement precision.

Priced at 99,000 yuan (US$13,622), the robot is equipped with 43 joints and mimicry learning. It’s capable of learning complex movements and demonstrates precise maneuverability.

The G1 comes with a price tag of 99,000 yuan (US$13,622) and is equipped with 43 joints and advanced mimicry learning capabilities. This allows it to perform highly dynamic actions with remarkable precision. But what’s even more fascinating is how it learns.

Before G1 ever takes a physical step, its training begins in a virtual world. Unitree leverages NVIDIA’s Isaac AI-driven robotics platform, where the robot first learns the fundamentals of movement.

From there, G1 is shown a digital twin — another humanoid robot performing actions. Using motion capture and video data, it observes and gradually refines its skills, mirroring the process humans use when learning by imitation. Over time, the robot’s movements become more complex, fluid, and customizable.

This blend of simulation-based training and real-world refinement is a major step forward in robotics, making humanoid machines significantly more adaptable.

Beyond its acrobatics, one of the most remarkable aspects of the G1 is that it’s open source.

Much like DeepSeek made headlines not just for its affordability but for its open-source accessibility, Unitree has made its training data, algorithms, and hardware specifications publicly available on GitHub. This means developers, researchers, and robotics enthusiasts can explore, tweak, and enhance G1’s capabilities in ways even its creators might not anticipate.

The dataset includes an interactive mesh and inverse kinematics algorithms, allowing G1 to monitor joint positions, limitations, and motion efficiency. In short, it can learn and optimize movements autonomously, whether it’s performing a kung fu routine or something more practical.

Despite the flashy martial arts demo, Unitree insists that G1 is built for practical applications — not combat. The company envisions its humanoid robot assisting in workplaces, homes, and even hospitals, handling repetitive and complex tasks.

However, because the robot is open source, its potential extends far beyond Unitree’s vision. Researchers, engineers, and AI developers now have a powerful humanoid platform they can customize for various real-world applications — from rehabilitation and elder care to industrial automation and education.

Despite its impressive capabilities, G1 raises a bigger question — are we ready to accept robots like this in our daily lives?

For now, G1 is an impressive display of engineering, a symbol of how far robotics has come. But whether we embrace robots as co-workers, assistants, or even companions remains an open question — one that society will have to answer in the years to come.

Texas-based researchers have developed a sustainable plant-based material that could potentially reduce or eliminate reliance on bottled water while addressing water scarcity, a major global issue.  

The material, known as a hydrogel, acts like a sponge, pulling in moisture from the air and releasing it when heated at low temperatures. It can be used anywhere, even in remote, off-grid locations with low humidity levels, and the absorbed water is safe for drinking.

“The water collected from our hydrogel meets international safety standards, with metal ion concentrations well below the World Health Organization limits,” said Guihua Yu, the study’s lead investigator and a professor at The University of Texas at Austin’s Materials Institute.

Globally, at least two billion people lack access to safe drinking water, a number that is expected to climb as the climate continues to heat up. In response, the United Nations is aiming for “universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water” by 2030.

As the atmosphere holds an estimated 13,000 trillion kilograms of water, tapping into this abundant resource could be the key to meeting this target.    



Yu and his team at created the hydrogels by chemically modifying cellulose, starch, and chitosan –– a compound found in crustacean shells and fungi –– to enhance their ability to absorb and release water.

Polymeric hydrogels, while good at retaining water, are often made from petroleum-derived polymers, Yu said. Unlike fossil fuels, which have limited reserves, biomass materials are renewable, so their supply is ensured. 

The modification process involved grafting certain functional groups onto the chemical structures of cellulose, starch, and chitosan to improve water retention and promote water desorption at lower temperatures, making the process more energy-efficient.

The researchers also embedded lithium chloride, a salt, within the hydrogel to boost its water-absorbing performance. Due to their chemical structures, salts have a natural affinity for water, a property known as hygroscopicity—this is why salt is so effective at preserving food.   

“Unlike free salts, which can dissolve and leak, we immobilized lithium chloride within the hydrogel matrix, allowing it to retain its hygroscopic properties while preventing unwanted loss,” Yu explained.

“This combination ensures that the hydrogel remains highly effective in capturing atmospheric moisture, even in arid conditions,” he added.  



To find out how much water could actually be harvested from the hydrogel in a real-world scenario, the researchers tested the cellulose-based hydrogel, which had the highest water uptake in initial indoor tests, in an outdoor experiment in Austin, Texas.

For six days, they alternated between absorption and desorption cycles, in which the water captured by the hydrogel from the air during each absorption cycle was evaporated by heating the hydrogel on an electric hotplate at 60 °C. They collected the water vapor by condensing it onto a glass covering above the hotplate.

The researchers found that 95% of the captured water could be released at this temperature over each four-hour heating period. Based on the amount of water collected during each desorption cycle, they calculated that a kilogram of the sorbent can provide over 14 liters of water per day on average. 

According to Yu, this amount of water exceeds what other sorbents being investigated for atmospheric water harvesting, including metal–organic frameworks, have been reported to yield. These materials can also require much higher temperatures to release the stored water. 

Aside from the environmental benefits, including avoiding plastic waste and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with bottled water production and transportation, atmospheric water harvesting has the potential to be much more economical than buying bottled water.

Based on the current average price of bottled water in the United States and considering operational costs, Yu and his colleagues estimated that the hydrogel-based water harvester could fully offset its initial investment costs within a year of use.

“Over multiple years, the savings could amount to hundreds to thousands of dollars per household, depending on water needs and local bottled water prices,” Yu said.

Yu and his team are currently working on improving the energy efficiency and practicality of the hydrogel sorbent and its water-harvesting process.

“Moving forward, we aim to enhance the hydrogel’s performance by optimizing its porosity and internal water transport pathways to accelerate sorption–desorption kinetics,” Yu shared.  

Yu and his team are also developing hydrogels that can use direct sunlight, rather than electric heating, to drive water release, which would lower the energy consumption even more.    

“Scaling up production is another key focus, as we work toward making these materials viable for widespread deployment in water-scarce regions,” Yu stated.

Inspira Technologies* reports groundbreaking clinical results for its AI-powered HYLA blood sensor, achieving 96% accuracy in a key parameter and 92.3% accuracy in detecting oxygen deficiencies. These impressive findings provide new validation the company's innovative non-invasive monitoring technology and strengthen its position in both the $5.7 billion blood gas analyzer market and the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market. With FDA submission on track for H2 2025 and the INSPIRA ART100 system already being deployed to U.S. hospitals, the company continues to build momentum in its multi-pronged strategy to revolutionize critical care.


NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PESG Research releases an update following groundbreaking clinical evaluation results: Inspira Technologies* (NASDAQ: IINN) has reported exceptional clinical study outcomes for its HYLA blood sensor, with 96% accuracy achieved in a key parameter compared to traditional blood analyzers. This milestone achievement validates the company's AI-powered continuous blood monitoring technology and accelerates its path toward commercial deployment in multiple healthcare settings.





Promising Clinical Validation at Premier Medical Institution



The clinical study, conducted at Sheba Hospital (ranked among the world's top 8 hospitals by Newsweek), successfully demonstrated the HYLA sensor's capabilities across 6 patients undergoing open-heart surgery. The clip-on device monitored blood parameters in real-time as blood circulated through the cardiopulmonary bypass system, achieving impressive concordance with conventional laboratory testing methods. Notably, the study also validated a new indicator for identifying oxygen deficiencies, showing 92.3% accuracy – a critical capability for preventing hypoxia during surgical procedures.



This clinical validation at one of the world's premier medical institutions represents a significant de-risking event for the company's core technology. As Dagi Ben-Noon, CEO of Inspira, noted, "Achieving 96% accuracy as reflected in our clinical results in real-time blood monitoring without the need for blood draws represents a significant technological breakthrough."



Expanding Technology Ecosystem Shows Commercial Progress



The successful HYLA clinical results come amid accelerating commercial momentum for Inspira's broader product ecosystem. The company's INSPIRA ART100 system, which received FDA 510(k) clearance in May 2024 for cardiopulmonary bypass procedures, is now being deployed at leading U.S. hospitals through distribution partner Glo-Med Networks. The system was recently enhanced with new support features designed to assist medical teams, reduce staff overhead, and improve efficiency during critical procedures.



Additionally, in February 2025, Inspira reported positive initial results from its collaboration with Ennocure MedTech Ltd. to develop a novel bio-electronic treatment for preventing bloodstream infections. Ex-vivo testing demonstrated a 95% reduction in bacterial presence within 4 hours, showing promise for addressing the estimated 250,000 bloodstream infections related to intravenous lines occurring worldwide annually.



Inspira’s Strategy Targets Multiple High-Value Markets



The successful clinical validation of the HYLA blood sensor represents a crucial step in Inspira's strategy to penetrate multiple high-value medical technology markets. As a standalone technology, HYLA targets the blood gas analyzer market, which the company projects will reach $5.7 billion by 2030 (up from previous estimates of $2.5 billion). When integrated with Inspira's respiratory support systems, the technology strengthens the company's position in the $19 billion mechanical ventilation market.



Inspira's approach of combining AI-enhanced monitoring capabilities with innovative respiratory support solutions addresses a critical unmet need in healthcare. With approximately 20 million patients annually requiring mechanical ventilation globally and mortality rates exceeding 50% under current protocols, Inspira's technology ecosystem offers a potential paradigm shift in critical care management by enabling conscious patient treatment with continuous monitoring.

Wednesday, March 5, 2025

At ITB Berlin, the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) and Trip.com Group introduced a trailblazing report, Technology Game Changers: Future Trends in Travel & Tourism, which unveils the transformative technologies set to revolutionize the travel industry.



This forward-thinking report highlights 16 cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of travel across four key domains: Digital Technologies, Financial Technologies, the Future of Mobility, and Breakthrough Innovations.



The Future of Travel
The report predicts that, by the end of the decade, artificial intelligence will transcend its role in automating travel bookings and searches. AI agents are expected to rival human intelligence in handling a variety of travel-related tasks, drastically transforming the tourism landscape.



Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers. These innovations will redefine the way we experience the world.



Julia Simpson, President & CEO of WTTC, said: “The Travel & Tourism sector is in the midst of a digital revolution. From AI-driven personalisation to advancements in aviation sustainability, innovation is reshaping how we explore the world.  



“As travellers turn to social media, streaming platforms, and cutting-edge tech to inspire and book trips in real time, platforms like Instagram are shifting from selling products to selling experiences. Meanwhile, technology is unlocking new adventures off the beaten track. 



“With innovation accelerating at an extraordinary pace, businesses embrace these advancements today will be the industry leaders of tomorrow.” 



Boon Sian Chai, Managing Director & Vice President of International Markets at Trip.com Group, added: “Travellers today expect planning and booking to be intuitive, efficient, and hyper-personalised.  



“At Trip.com Group, we are pioneering AI-powered travel assistance, Super Apps, and innovations to cater to, and even exceed such expectations. This report is also an essential guide for businesses looking to stay ahead of rapid digital change.” 



The Future of Travel Is Here
A recent report reveals exciting developments shaping the future of the travel and tourism industry, highlighting key trends that are already making waves.



AI Reshaping the Travel ExperienceArtificial Intelligence is quickly becoming a cornerstone of the industry, with 94% of leaders in the sector identifying it as essential. AI-powered services like TripGenie from Trip.com have seen a remarkable 200% increase in usage in 2024, revolutionizing the way travelers plan trips and engage with customer service, offering a more personalized and efficient experience.



Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.



Space Tourism Nears RealityOnce confined to the realm of science fiction, space tourism is now rapidly becoming a reality. With the accelerating development of infrastructure and rising consumer demand, the dream of commercial space travel is closer than ever, promising a new frontier for adventure tourism.



Transforming the Industry
The report stresses the urgent need for investment in digital skills and robust regulatory frameworks to fully harness the potential of these technologies.



With 91% of travel businesses planning to boost their tech investments, the industry is on the brink of its most profound transformation since the rise of the Internet. Exclusive insights from industry giants like Trip.com Group, Hilton, Qatar Airways, and MSC Cruises highlight how global leaders are already capitalizing on these innovations to drive change and enhance the travel experience for the future.

Quantum computing is another frontier set to drastically impact the industry, with the potential to solve problems once thought impossible. Whether it’s optimizing global air traffic in real-time or advancing the possibilities of space and underwater tourism, these innovations will bring new dimensions to the travel world.
One of the most exciting developments is the resurgence of supersonic flight. After more than two decades since the Concorde retired, companies like Boom Technology, in collaboration with United, are working to offer passengers supersonic journeys within the next four years, ushering in a new era of ultra-fast travel.



Meanwhile, the evolution of smart cities, with autonomous vehicles and advanced air mobility, promises to not only transform the most popular tourist destinations but also make remote and previously inaccessible locations a reality for travelers. These innovations will redefine the way we experience the world.



Julia Simpson, President & CEO of WTTC, said: “The Travel & Tourism sector is in the midst of a digital revolution. From AI-driven personalisation to advancements in aviation sustainability, innovation is reshaping how we explore the world.  



“As travellers turn to social media, streaming platforms, and cutting-edge tech to inspire and book trips in real time, platforms like Instagram are shifting from selling products to selling experiences. Meanwhile, technology is unlocking new adventures off the beaten track. 



“With innovation accelerating at an extraordinary pace, businesses embrace these advancements today will be the industry leaders of tomorrow.” 



Boon Sian Chai, Managing Director & Vice President of International Markets at Trip.com Group, added: “Travellers today expect planning and booking to be intuitive, efficient, and hyper-personalised.  



“At Trip.com Group, we are pioneering AI-powered travel assistance, Super Apps, and innovations to cater to, and even exceed such expectations. This report is also an essential guide for businesses looking to stay ahead of rapid digital change.”

AI-powered services like TripGenie from Trip.com have seen a remarkable 200% increase in usage in 2024, revolutionizing the way travelers plan trips and engage with customer service, offering a more personalized and efficient experience.



Super Apps Transforming TravelA survey of 8,000 travelers reveals that 97% prefer an all-in-one platform that integrates flights, hotels, activities, and payments into one seamless interface. This desire for frictionless travel has prompted the rise of super apps, changing how we book and experience travel.



Sustainable Travel on the RiseSustainability continues to gain momentum in the travel industry. Virgin Atlantic’s pioneering flight using 100% sustainable fuel for a transatlantic journey marks a major step in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation. Meanwhile, initiatives like Port Miami’s expansion of shore power systems are setting a new standard for eco-friendly operations in the sector, pushing the industry toward a greener future.

From fast horses to the internet, from type plucked by hand from a California job case to the Mergenthaler Linotype to computer typesetting, from presses hand-fed a single linen page at a time to electric-powered behemoths designed to spew out 70,000 complete papers an hour, The Providence Journal has ridden the crest of technology's wave for some 200 years.

As the paper closes its plant − moving print operations to a corporate cousin in New Jersey − it is only fitting to look back at the ways The Journal has used technology to meet the challenges of the times, constantly innovating the best way to gather and disseminate news to Rhode Islanders.

As The Journal retires the last flexographic newspaper press in the world, it bears recalling the ways Rhode Island's largest paper has helped innovate, and wondering what the next 200 years might hold.

Here is a brief look at some of the tools the paper used to be "a faithful reporter of the passing news," as its first publisher described it in 1820, nine years before it became a daily paper.

Jan. 3, 1820: Printer Honest John Miller, with the backing of Samuel Slater and other manufacturing leaders, establishes The Providence Journal, which publishes Mondays and Thursdays under the unwieldy title "Manufacturers' & Farmers' Journal, Providence and Pawtucket Advertiser." − with the period as part of its name.

July 21, 1829: First issue of The Providence Daily Journal, and General Advertiser. This four-page newspaper was typeset by hand and pressed, one linen page at a time, on an iron hand press capable of 240 impressions per hour.

1829: The Journal uses an early version of the Pony Express to deliver President Andrew Jackson's State of the Union address by horse 500 miles, from Washington to New York to Hartford to Boston to Providence to Journal readers, in only three days.

1846: Distant news begins arriving, at least partway, by telegraph.

1848: Providence ties into the New York-Boston telegraph line.

1856: A Hoe single-cylinder press, the first driven by steam power, comes into operation.

Jan. 26, 1863: After irregular issues of "Journal Extra" the previous two years, The Journal begins publishing The Evening Bulletin, a daily afternoon paper to bring news by telegraph from Civil War battlefields as well as updated financial reports.

1881: First web-perfecting press installed; it printed from a continuous roll of paper.

1885: Journal office lit by incandescent lamps powered by Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1886: First hand-drawn illustration to accompany a news story, about sailing.

1889: First typesetting machines in New England are installed, called the Mergenthaler Linotype.

1892: Journal builds a backup printing plant south of Rhode Island Hospital in case downtown is destroyed by fire. It would never be used.

1894: Presses powered for the first time by electricity from Narragansett Electric Lighting Co.

1903: Journal establishes wireless station at Point Judith; prints the Block Island Wireless, a daily paper published by The Journal on the island.

1912: Journal reporter Charles R. Stark Jr., at the New York City docks, asks Western Union to transmit the New York telephone book to tie up a telegraph line so he could use it to send the first interviews of arriving survivors after the sinking of RMS Titanic.

1918: The Journal stretches a sheet across Eddy Street outside the Old Journal Building next to City Hall and projects election result bulletins, a method used for several decades to bring breaking news to crowds who jammed the streets before the advent of radio took over newsflashes.

1925: First color comics section appears in The Sunday Journal.

1928: Journal becomes first paper delivered to Block Island by airplane.

1936: First use of AP Wirephoto, which transmitted photographs from distant news events over telephone lines.

1950: Journal licensed to use two-way radio for reporters and photographers.

1961: Spot color appears regularly in the news pages.

1968: First use of computers in the composing room.

1975: The end of the "hot lead" era. Computers create columns of type on paper that are pasted up onto pages from which printing plates are made photographically.

1976: Installation of electronic writing and editing equipment in the newsroom.

1985: Searchable electronic archive of Journal stories launched.

1987: $60-million Journal printing plant with flexographic presses opens on Kinsley Avenue, designed to produce 70,000 papers an hour, 20,000 more than the letterpresses they replaced.

1995: Journal launches Rhode Island Horizons, an online newspaper hosted by the Prodigy dial-up service.

1996: Journal launches projo.com, the paper's first website.

2001: Journal ends phase-in to digital photography.

2003: Journal correspondent in Iraq sends stories from the battlefield to Providence via satellite telephone.

2003: Journal launches daily email newsletter, starting with deals from the paper's advertisers, followed by Red Sox stories and breaking news.

2008: Journal website regularly includes video.

2011: Journal mobile app debuts.

March 9, 2025: The last Journal to be printed in Providence rolls off the flexographic press at Kinsley Avenue.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's financial regulator said on Wednesday it will launch a pilot program to relax merger and acquisition (M&A) loan issuance to technology firms, according to a statement released by the National Financial Regulatory Administration.

Under the pilot program, the proportion of such loans will be allowed to account for as much as 80% of a firm's total M&A transactions, up from no more than 60% under current rules, the regulator said. The loan term will be relaxed to a maximum of 10 years from the current seven years, it said.

The pilot program will cover 18 cities including Shanghai and Beijing, according to the statement.

Rare Dionysian Cult Fresco Uncovered in Pompeii, Revealing Secret Rites

Photo Credit: Parco archeologico di Pompei

Archaeologists have revealed a significant discovery in Pompeii—a large fresco depicting the initiation rites of an ancient mystery cult. The artwork, which stretches across three walls of a banquet hall, was found in the recently excavated House of Thiasus. The painting portrays maenads, female followers of Dionysus, engaged in hunting and rituals. Scenes of young satyrs playing the flute and offering wine sacrifices are also depicted. At the centre of the fresco, an elderly satyr is shown guiding a young woman through an initiation ceremony. The discovery sheds new light on the practices associated with the cult of Dionysus, a god linked to wine, revelry, and resurrection.

According to a statement by the Pompeii Archaeological Park, the fresco suggests that Roman initiates may have participated in hunting activities as part of their induction into the Dionysian mysteries. This aligns with earlier Greek traditions, where Dionysus was associated with the wilderness and untamed animals. The painting's vivid imagery, set against a deep red background, provides a rare glimpse into these secretive rites. The only other comparable fresco, discovered in 1909 at the Villa of the Mysteries, features similar figures but lacks any depiction of hunting.

Gabriel Zuchtriegel, Director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, said in an official statement that the fresco highlights a depiction of women breaking societal norms—dancing freely, hunting, and consuming raw meat. The presence of such imagery suggests that the cult's practices endured despite a Roman ban on Dionysian rituals in 186 B.C. The House of Thiasus and the Villa of the Mysteries both date back to the first century B.C., indicating that these secretive rites persisted long after they were officially outlawed.

As per a statement by Italian Minister of Culture Alessandro Giuli, the fresco represents an unparalleled historical record, offering insight into lesser-known aspects of classical Mediterranean life. Visitors to Pompeii can now view the House of Thiasus as part of the ongoing excavation tours, allowing a closer look at this rare and detailed depiction of an ancient mystery cult.

Home > LMH Health Foundation honors those who support community healthcare

Published on March 05, 2025

 

LAWRENCE – LMH Health Foundation is pleased to announce recipients of the 18th annual Elizabeth Watkins Community Caring Award. The Watkins Award celebrates people and organizations who have provided significant service to LMH Health and community healthcare.

Honorees are community members Dward and the late Jeanine Moore, Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson, Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner, and Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson. Information on each honoree is included below.

The Foundation is also pleased to announce a record annual transfer of more than $9.1 million in philanthropic contributions to support LMH Health priorities in 2024. The previous record of $4.3 million was established in 2020.  

Over the last two years, donors have provided more than $7.2 million in support for the expansion and renovation of the LMH Health Cancer Center, anticipated to open this summer. This expansion will ensure the Cancer Center facilities reflect the extraordinarily high level of physician care and expertise, leading-edge technology and patient-centered programming found within the center. Additional funds were transferred in support of new PET imaging technology, clinic renovations in the Anderson Health Plaza, charitable care needs, and other patient-centered initiatives.

“We are fortunate to be part of a community that values access to exceptional healthcare, and donor support helps ensure our community hospital continues to be among the very best in the country," said Rebecca Smith, LMH Health Foundation executive director and LMH Health vice president of strategy and communications. “From investing in facilities and technology typically only seen in major medical centers to ensuring those advancements are available to every single member of our community regardless of ability to pay, donors have had a real and tremendous impact over this past year. We are incredibly grateful for this support and all it makes possible.”

  

Here’s a closer look at the Watkins honorees:



Dward and the late Jeanine Moore



Dward and Jeanine Moore were married for 56 years. They met at a music camp in Missouri — Jeanine was a violinist; Dward, a baritone vocalist. The young couple joined the Peace Corps after college, teaching two years at a school for boys in Uganda. Back in the States, they eventually settled in a small town in Maryland. Dward taught anthropology and later worked at an employee-owned survey research company. Jeanine worked in libraries, taught music and performed in professional quartets. In 2015, to be closer to extended family, they moved to Lawrence.  As always, they looked for ways to give to their community.

“One day in the newspaper I saw an article about the Help & Healing Fund, and we knew that was it,” Dward said. The fund pays for medication and durable medical equipment for patients in need as they leave the hospital. “We had some personal experience with LMH Health — the doctors here are very good. It made us feel good that we can support people who need the help.”

Through their generosity, both Dward and Jeanine continue to touch lives.

 

Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson



At some point after Sam Porritt and Leann Johnson moved to Lawrence about 25 years ago, they realized LMH Health is extraordinary.

“We didn’t choose Lawrence because we saw it had great healthcare, but we lucked into it!” Sam said.

“This is a small-enough community — you get to see your healthcare providers in real life. You can be out to dinner, or the grocery store, and there’s your doctor. You get to see them as real people,” Leann explained. “I love having those relationships here.”

Sam and Leann have given generously to support renovations to the LMH Health Cancer Center and patient-centered technology, as well as patient expenditures for physical therapy and occupational therapy. Additionally, Sam founded Falling Forward Foundation, which funds continued rehab after insurance benefits run out.

“The culture and the people at LMH Health are all about kindness and caring, and the quality of care is remarkable,” Sam said. “Hospitals used to be about fixing things that were already broken. Today, it’s more about being proactive, and that’s very true here. I mean, they even changed the name of the hospital to LMH Health.”

  

Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner



Dan Schriner and Sally Hare-Schriner moved back to Lawrence in 2001.

“It seems like we end up at the hospital a lot,” said Dan, laughing. “I fell off a ladder a few years ago and cracked some ribs. I’ve also had a total knee replacement and back surgery here. When Sally had chest pain, they ushered us right in to a special cardiac care unit. I think it’s a pretty big deal that LMH Health is independent and not-for-profit. They do a great job looking after our community — and so I decided to do my part and look after LMH.”

Dan served on the LMH Health Foundation board of directors and has listed the foundation in his estate planning. They have shared several generous gifts to the hospital and were early donors to the LMH Health East Heights primary care clinic.

“We share a philosophy about giving,” Sally said.  “If you want something done, just do it. And why wait until you die? If it’s possible, give now and reap the emotional benefit while you’re alive. The amount doesn’t matter as much as the willingness to give.”

 

Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson



For 25 years, Dr. Mike and Cheri Thompson have been part of the LMH Health family. Dr. Thompson — “everyone calls me Mike,” he said — saw a job posting for a pathologist in Lawrence in 2000 and came for an interview.

“We got here and knew right away,” said Cheri, a registered nurse and nurse anesthetist who went to work at Lawrence Plastic Surgery.

While their boys grew up here, the Thompsons invested in LMH Health in myriad ways. Mike served as chief of staff, on many committees and on the foundation board of directors; together they co-chaired Rock the Block–Kick Cancer. They have supported patient-centered technology, cancer care and specific needs in the laboratory.

“We’re just big believers in a community hospital,” Cheri said.

Mike added, “The hospital is sort of the heartbeat of the community. It’s amazing to see how much ours has grown since we moved here.” 

Both have retired recently but stay connected.

“This is a family,” Mike said. “I try to be an example for younger docs, and they are proud to report back that they went to a meeting, played in the Penny Jones Golf Tournament. When you give to something you have ownership in, you want it to do well.”

One of the most robust and influential grant foundations in New York recently extended its generosity to the Le Moyne College community. Mother Cabrini Health Foundation awarded $1.275 million to the Le Moyne Healthcare Advancement Resource Center (HARC), which supports international medical professionals in obtaining healthcare jobs in New York.

Mother Cabrini Health Foundation is a non-profit, private organization that provides healthcare services, particularly to historically underserved communities. The foundation’s mission is rooted in Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini, an Italian immigrant who dedicated her career to advocating for immigrants and social justice. The foundation follows in her footsteps and provides grants to programs and services that support the health and well-being of people across New York. 

Since its establishment in 2018, the foundation has awarded over 2,700 grants, approximately over $800 million. In 2024, 529 grants were distributed, amounting to $208 million for organizations across New York. This money has been used to fund community healthcare programs to serve people facing health and social disparities, providing basic food and shelter as well as access to healthcare and mental health services. These programs focus on serving vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, immigrants, and veterans. The funding from the grants is necessary to allow these programs to flourish and provide for their communities. 

One such program is Le Moyne’s Healthcare Advancement Resource Center; this program is designed for foreign-trained medical graduates (FMGs) who are searching for jobs in New York. Professions and career pathways of clients include Registered Nurse, Physician’s Assistant, Physician, Occupational Therapy, Medical Researcher, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, and others. Obtaining the necessary training and certifications to work as a medical professional is often challenging, as it involves a degree of knowledge about American healthcare and education systems. 

This challenge is exacerbated by language and cultural barriers. HARC seeks to address these issues and provides clients with resources such as English classes, resume reviews, educational case managers, interview and job searches, academic scholarships, community networking, and many more. The clients of this program come from over 25 countries such as Brazil, China, Afghanistan, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ghana, and Yemen.

HARC is a vital contributor to Syracuse’s healthcare system; with growing populations and increased health disparities, culturally and linguistically appropriate providers are needed to connect with communities and provide appropriate care to Syracuse residents. Foreign-trained medical graduates offer unique perspectives and skill sets that are essential to advancing healthcare services and practices. The additional support provided by the Foundation’s grant will help this program flourish and provide resources to its clients.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--One Equity Partners, a middle market private equity firm, today announced that portfolio company Prime Time Healthcare (“Prime Time” or “the Company”), a leading staffing and solutions platform that provides outsourced workforce solutions, as well as physicians, allied health and nursing professionals, to public and private sector clients throughout the U.S., has rebranded to Fortis Healthcare Solutions (“Fortis Healthcare”) following its acquisition of healthcare staffing services business, AB Staffing (“AB”). Terms of the private transaction were not disclosed.





AB Staffing includes two businesses, AB Staffing Solutions and Adaptive Workforce Solutions (AWS), both headquartered in Gilbert, Arizona.

GE HealthCare Technologies introduced Genesis Solutions, a new portfolio of cloud enterprise imaging SaaS solutions, aimed at enhancing efficiency and precision in healthcare. This development occurred amid a challenging market environment, with major indexes alternating between gains and losses, influenced by tariff discussions and mixed economic data. The company's share price moved 1.57% over the last quarter, a potentially modest increase considering the launch of Genesis, as well as recent upcoming products like Freelium and Flyrcado. Additionally, the company reported strong Q4 2024 earnings with increased revenue and net income, factors that likely held shareholder interest. Despite market volatility and broader economic concerns, GE HealthCare's innovations and market position kept investor confidence relatively stable compared to a broader market decline of 3.1% over the same period. Overall, the company's strategies and product developments may have offset broader market trends.

Take a closer look at GE HealthCare Technologies's potential here.

In the last year, GE HealthCare Technologies experienced a total return decline of 8.03%, underperforming both the US Medical Equipment industry, which saw a 9.7% gain, and the broader US market, which rose by 13.1%. While the company's earnings grew significantly by 43.5%, revenues only increased marginally at 3.8% annually, which may have deterred investors accounting for slower growth prospects compared to market expectations. The company's guidance for moderate organic revenue growth, between 1% to 2%, further tempered investor enthusiasm amid macroeconomic pressures such as weakness in the China market.

Despite these challenges, GE HealthCare's product innovations, including the launch of the Freelium MRI platform, which uses less than 1% helium, and the Flyrcado PET MPI agent, highlight its commitment to advancing technological solutions. Additionally, the strategic partnership with UCSF to advance imaging solutions signals a strong focus on clinical improvement. Nonetheless, these developments were not enough to counterbalance the broader market headwinds impacting its share performance over the period.

HIMSS President and CEO speaks at a press conference during HIMSS25.

Susan Morse/Healthcare Finance News, HIMSS

LAS VEGAS - HIMSS President and CEO Hal Wolf addressed funding cuts for medical research during a press conference at HIMSS25 here on Tuesday.

"I think we're at the beginning of a very shaky period," Wolf said. "I think that we're all concerned."

Fifty percent of healthcare in the United States is funded by the federal government, he said. This includes Medicare and Medicaid.

However, Wolf said, the strength of the system has always been in taking the long term.

A federal judge last month temporarily blocked the cuts, according to Reuters.

Trump's pick to head the National Institute of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, is expected to be confirmed following a Senate hearing. If confirmed, Bhattacharya would oversee a nearly $50 billion budget and funding for thousands of scientific projects. The NIH director oversees 27 institutes and centers that conduct early-stage research, according to Reuters.

For hospitals, the biggest challenge is the workforce shortage. Wolf estimated a shortage of 8-9 million people on a global basis. 

Hospitals need to turn to digital health. Digital health allows care to be extended into the home.

Healthcare comes down to an anomaly, Wolf said. When an anomaly is found,  people are put on care pathways.

Helping this search for what's not normal are devices and watches that allow people to monitor their own health.

Nurses are now doing work formerly done by physicians.

"Now we have to stretch those resources and that's where digital health comes in," Wolf said.

Flexibilities for remote patient monitoring and telehealth - which allow for care in the home including acute care, will end on March 31 without Congressional action.

HIMSS is involved in getting these flexibility extended, Wolf said. 

An estimated 28,000 people are attending HIMSS25 in Las Vegas, he said. Last year a little over 26,000 people attended HIMSS24.

In late February, healthcare organizations across the US started receiving extortion demands by mail claiming that their organization’s data had been stolen in a ransomware attack and giving them 10 days to respond.

According to the letters, printed on paper and delivered in envelopes purporting to be from the BianLian ransomware group, the data would be leaked unless the organization paid a ransom of between $250,000 to $350,000 in Bitcoin.

Now for the good news: the breaches never happened, and the letters are almost certainly fake. Two security vendors that have studied the letters, Arctic Wolf and Guidepoint Security, now believe that the whole letter-writing campaign is a ruse by someone pretending to be BianLian, one of the ransomware industry’s up-and-coming threat groups.

Targeting healthcare organizations, the strange incident is a reminder that ransomware today is really two industries: a larger one that carries out the serious ransomware attacks everyone hears about and a much smaller and less well publicized one that tries to impersonate them.

But how can organizations distinguish a real attack with menaces from an entirely simulated one?

Judging from published examples, not easily, at least for a non-expert. The letters had Boston postmarks and a city center return address, links to Tor data leak sites associated with BianLian and, in two cases, an example of what was claimed to be a compromised password.

“We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money. Our industry only works if we hold up our end of the bargain,” stated the attackers in a letter analyzed by Guidepoint Security.

“If you follow our instructions and pay the full requested amount on time, all of your company’s data will be permanently destroyed and none of it will ever be published,” the letter continued.

A clue that something is amiss is simply that the attackers would use a letter to communicate. There is no record of this tactic being deployed before by organized ransomware groups such as BianLian and for good reason: sending demands by post is uncertain and very slow.

Letters sent to multiple organizations were also identical to one another, Arctic Wolf noted, apart from small variations tailoring text for each recipient. This is the same tactic used by random email attacks and smacks of opportunism. They also refused to negotiate and offered no channel to do this. In ransomware circles, that is almost unheard of.

That said, sending demands by letter does have a useful characteristic: they won’t be filtered by spam systems which makes them more likely to be read by someone.  It’s a form of social engineering in which if even one company falls for the tactic out of a thousand letters, the pay day will make it worth the effort.

If stolen credit cards are used to pay for the postage costs, it’s probably also cheap or even free with the letters themselves sent via print-to-mail services that feed them to the US Postal Service.

Ransomware impersonation is nothing new. In 2019, organizations across the US reportedly received emails deploying the same fake breach modus operandi as the recent letter writers – ‘pay up now because we have your data’. In truth, such campaigns are probably commonplace but are dismissed as obvious ruses and rarely reported on.

However, by 2023 the tactic had evolved into something more sophisticated with a separate campaign backing up its bogus threats by attaching snippets of genuine data culled from dark web trawls. This raises a disturbing possibility: the organization has been breached but the group threatening them is not one who carried out the attack.

Underlying all this is how organizations should defend themselves in practical ways against yet another fraud tactic.

“Attacks like this are unlikely to succeed in the majority of cases, but the perpetrators only have to have a small number of victims fall for it for it to be a big pay day for them,” cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley said via email.

The first line of defense against this type of attack is simply to develop a process to deal with it, he said. Incidents like this should be reported internally to increase awareness of the scammers’ techniques. At the same time, every ransom threat should be reported to the IT team as well as to the security companies supporting the organization.

Attackers would typically include evidence that data has been exfiltrated in the form of genuine data. However, organizations need to be careful they aren’t being tricked:

“These protocols include verifying the authenticity of any ransom demands. It is important to establish whether that data could have been stolen in an earlier data breach or may have been collected from a different third-party source,” said Cluley.

Cluley also stressed the need for organizations to have a response plan that could assess the possibility of a breach itself while engaging with law enforcement.

“There should be named members of staff in your plan who coordinate communications with any potential extortionist, who ensures that all relevant departments are involved in any important decisions. Make sure that you engage with law enforcement. If you have received a fake ransom snail-mail, chances are that other businesses have as well,” said Cluley.

Ransom demands are always designed for their shock value, agreed John Shier, Field CISO at security vendor Sophos. Sending a demand by letter was unusual but that might be the point.

“Teams need to bring awareness of this latest scam to their leadership. If an organization receives a letter, they shouldn’t panic, but they still need to investigate if there is any basis to the claim,” he said.

“At the very least, companies should review network logs for any unauthorized access and large data transfers that don’t conform to normal patterns. While it appears that the letters are fake, some due basic diligence needs to be performed to rule out a data breach,” he said.

Patients with disabilities are less likely to feel health care workers treat them respectfully, according to new research from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, patients with disabilities were also significantly less likely than those without disabilities to say that their providers gave them information that was easy-to-understand. The findings are published this month in Annals of Internal Medicine.

"People with disabilities make up 20 percent of American adults. This group already faces multiple barriers to accessing care, and they have large disparities in health outcomes. When they perceive disrespect from their providers, it can make them less proactive in engaging with the health care system, especially preventative care," said Mihir Kakara, MBBS, MSHP, who led the study as a neurology fellow at the Perelman School of Medicine and is now an assistant professor of Neurology at the NYU Grossman school of Medicine. "It is easy to imagine these patients not following up on certain recommendations-for example, getting that repeat brain scan to follow up on a certain lesion-if they don't feel respected." 

Overall, 2.9 percent of people without disabilities reported that they felt their providers didn't treat them with respect. But among patients with disabilities, 4.8 percent reported feeling that way.

A narrower analysis revealed greater disparities for patients with conditions affecting vision, hearing, mental health, and cognitive abilities. The proportion of respondents with these conditions who felt disrespected was nearly twice that of those without disabilities.

These findings prove that we must continuously strive toward ensuring our patient care is culturally humble and inclusive. While we have clear standards from the Americans with Disabilities Act, they should be the floor that medical professionals build upon, not the ceiling we strive for. We are seeing where great strides need to be made." 

Jaya Aysola, MD, DTMH, MPH, senior author, associate professor of General Internal Medicine and executive director of the Penn Medicine Center for Health Equity Advancement

Data analyzed in the study was pulled from 2017's National Health Interview Study. Almost 23,000 of the study's participants who had visited a health care provider in the last year were asked about their providers' "cultural competence"-sensitivities to different people's circumstances and customs. Among them, almost 5,000 of the participants-roughly 20 percent-identified as having a disability, roughly in line with reported national averages.

Participants in the 2017 study were asked whether their provider gave them instructions that were easy to understand. Wide gaps were found between those with disabilities and those without: 11.3 percent of patients with disabilities didn't feel health care workers explained things well, and 7.1 percent of those without disabilities felt the same.

At least 13 percent of those with either vision, hearing, mental health, or cognitive conditions all felt that they weren't given easy-understand directions.

Patients had also been queried whether their providers "asked opinions about their care." Here, the researchers found that a significant number of respondents both with and without disabilities expressed that their providers did not ask their thoughts: 41.1 percent of patients without disabilities said they weren't asked, compared to 44.9 percent of patients with disabilities. Again, those with visual impairments reported significantly worse experiences.

In 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) officially designated people with disabilities as a population demonstrating disparities in health driven by social disadvantages. That designation meant that more NIH funds could be used to support that underserved population with research. 

Moving forward, Aysola and Kakara believe there should be follow-up studies examining the potential health implications for patients with disabilities who feel disrespect from their providers or have trouble understanding what they're being told.

They also see opportunities to examine the effect of system-level policies, and call for ensuring a patient-centered care approach in every setting. 

"It's about empowering and meeting the needs and preferences of our patients," Kakara said. 

When patients have disabilities, patient-centered care can involve, as an example, maintaining eye contact and speaking directly to them, rather than only addressing their family members. Another example is printing out instructions with large font for those with low vision.

"Patient-centered care models have now been adopted by many health care systems, but there is still a critical gap in providing disability-inclusive care in medical education and training, and our analysis highlights a need to incorporate such disability-specific training into our daily practice," Kakara explained. 

Kakara was funded by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality T32 training grant during the period of this study.

HCA Healthcare recently encountered significant investor activism with proposals advocating changes in corporate governance, including a shift to plant-based diets and adjustments in executive compensation. Management's opposition to these proposals could have played a role in the company's 3.71% share price decline over the last quarter. Despite strong full-year earnings growth, with sales increasing to USD 70.6 billion, net income rising to USD 5.76 billion, and a substantial share buyback program, the response to shareholder activism and broader market fluctuations may have influenced investor sentiment. During this period, the broader market experienced volatile trading, with investor concerns around tariffs impacting general market sentiment, evidenced by a 3.1% market decline over the same timeframe. This context underscores how external factors and internal governance disputes can outweigh positive financial performance, impacting shareholder returns for HCA.

Dig deeper into the specifics of HCA Healthcare here with our thorough analysis report.

HCA Healthcare's shares delivered a total return of 167.58% over the past five years, reflecting its robust long-term performance. Key drivers behind this result include consistent earnings growth, with profits increasing by 9.3% annually. A significant share repurchase program, cumulating in buybacks worth US$5.24 billion, also contributed to the shareholder value. Additionally, HCA's operations showed resilience, with continued profit growth and dividends, which increased to $0.72 per share recently declared.

The healthcare company's relative valuation, trading at 47.4% below the estimated fair value, has made it a compelling option, especially within its industry. Its Price-To-Earnings ratio has remained favorable compared to both industry and peer averages. HCA's proactive steps to enhance operational efficiencies and expand healthcare access have further supported its sustained share price appreciation, despite challenges from investor activism and broader market fluctuations.

The Trump administration is looking to roll back staffing at the department charged with caring for American veterans by firing as many as 80,000 workers who were hired as part of a Biden administration initiative to improve care and cover veterans exposed to burn pits and toxic substances.

The plan is laid out in a memorandum, first reported on by Government Executive, which came from VA chief of staff Christopher Syrek and calls to reduce the number of employees on the payroll to 2019 levels.

It instructs top-level staff to prepare for an agency-wide reorganization in August to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure."

The memorandum also calls for agency officials to work with the White House's Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to meeting objectives laid out by the administration, which has started a concerted effort to reduce the number of people on federal payrolls.

In public social media posts, Musk, the world’s wealthiest man and a prominent Trump campaign donor, has alluded to presidential election results in the District of Columbia — a heavily Democratic city that has never given its electoral votes to a Republican candidate — as justification for slashing the federal workforce.

Veterans have already been speaking out against the cuts at the VA, which so far have included a few thousand employees and hundreds of contracts. More than 25 percent of the VA's workforce are veterans themselves.

In Congress, Democrats have decried the cuts at the VA and other agencies, while Republicans have watched the Trump administration's changes with caution.

Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees veteran's affairs, said in a statement that the Trump administration "has launched an all-out assault" against progress the VA has made in expanding its services as the number of covered veterans grows and includes those impacted by toxic burn pits.

"Their plan prioritizes private sector profits over veterans' care, balancing the budget on the backs of those who served. It's a shameful betrayal, and veterans will pay the price for their unforgivable corruption, incompetence, and immorality," he said.

In brief: Quipt Home Medical cooperates, Bellevue Healthcare grows, Tennr hires expert

Updated 11:02 AM CST, Wed March 5, 2025

CINCINNATI – Quipt Home Medical says David Kanen, Philotimo Fund and Kanen Wealth Management have agreed to withdraw their notice to solicit proxies in support of four director candidates in opposition to those recommended by the company. 

As part of a new cooperation agreement, the company's board of directors has granted Kanen certain board access rights for as long as Kanen maintains aggregate beneficial ownership of at least 3.5% in the company’s outstanding shares. This includes the right to request and conduct quarterly discussions with either the chairman of the board or another non-executive director designee of the board. 

“We want to thank Kanen for their constructive discussions and valuable insights,” said Mark Greenberg, lead independent director of the board. “We appreciate the perspectives of all shareholders and welcome ongoing engagement as management executes on our strategic growth plans to drive long-term growth.” 

As part of the agreement, Quipt has also agreed to establish a new committee of the board to review and provide analysis and non-binding recommendations pertaining to Kanen’s previously communicated recommendations on corporate governance and other areas related to the company’s operations. 

Additionally, Kanen has agreed to a customary standstill, a voting commitment and other provisions. 

“We appreciate the company’s willingness to engage with us and its commitment to maximizing value for Quipt shareholders,” said David Kanen, president and CEO of Kanen. “The formation of this committee is an important step, and we look forward to working constructively with the company to help unlock long-term value.”

Study: Sleep apnea linked to increased risk of Parkinson’s, but CPAP may reduce risk 

MINNEAPOLIS – People with obstructive sleep apnea have an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, but if started early enough, CPAP therapy may reduce that risk, according to a preliminary study released March 2, 2025, that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 77th Annual Meeting taking place April 5–9, 2025, in San Diego and online. 

The study found using CPAP within two years of a sleep apnea diagnosis reduced the risk of Parkinson's. 

"Obstructive sleep apnea is common, and previous research has found when untreated, it is associated with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke," said study author Gregory D. Scott, MD, PhD, of the VA Portland Health Care System in Oregon. "While our study found an increased risk of Parkinson's disease, the good news is people can do something about it, by using CPAP as soon as they are diagnosed with the sleep disorder." 

For the study, researchers reviewed more than 20 years of medical records to identify nearly 1.6 million veterans who had obstructive sleep apnea and nearly 10 million veterans who did not. 

Researchers looked at rates of Parkinson's disease five years after a sleep apnea diagnosis. After adjusting for age, sex and health factors such as smoking, researchers found among people with sleep apnea, there were 1.8 more cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people compared to people without sleep apnea. 

Of participants with sleep apnea, 10% had documented use of a CPAP machine. These participants were divided into two groups: Those who received a CPAP machine within two years of their diagnosis and those who received one after two years. 

Researchers found similar rates among people with sleep apnea who started CPAP after two years as those who did not use CPAP, with 9.5 and 9 cases of Parkinson's disease per 1,000 people respectively. However, researchers found a lower rate of Parkinson's among those who started CPAP early, within two years of diagnosis, with 2.3 fewer cases per 1,000 people when compared to people who did not use CPAP. 

"It is encouraging to know that while obstructive sleep apnea may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease, treating it right away with CPAP may reduce that risk," said Scott. "Future studies are needed to follow people more closely after receiving a sleep apnea diagnosis and over longer periods of time." 

A limitation of the study was that, while researchers could identify which people had a CPAP device, they were unable to tell if people used the treatment daily, as prescribed. 

The study was supported by the U.S. Veterans Administration and the U.S. Department of Defense. 

Bellevue Healthcare expands in Oregon 

‘Our vision has remained unchanged, to serve every household in Washington, Oregon and Idaho with same day delivery service, and the Salem location brings us one step closer to that’ 

BELLEVUE, Wash. – Bellevue Healthcare will open a new location in Salem, Ore., later this month, its 22nd brick-and-mortar location. 

Located at 2661 Cascadia Industrial St SE, directly across from the Salem Municipal Airport, this new branch will provide a full range of mobility and respiratory equipment, as well as serve the equipment needs of hospice customers. 

“As part of our ongoing commitment to organically expand our service footprint, we’re excited to bring our high level of service and patient care to more customers in Oregon,” said Joel Gallion, president of Bellevue Healthcare. “Our vision has remained unchanged, to serve every household in Washington, Oregon and Idaho with same day delivery service, and the Salem location brings us one step closer to that end. We’ve been able to deliver this level of service for some time now throughout Washington, so it's exciting to see our vision expand to more sites in Oregon." 

Bellevue Healthcare says the new location marks another milestone in its 25-year journey of providing top-quality care, and it plans further growth in 2025.

NCART update: Two more states approve power seat elevation 

LUBBOCK, Texas – The Medicaid programs in North Dakota and Idaho have given the green light to power seat elevation, according to NCART. In North Dakota, the Medicaid program has approved the organization’s request to consider power seat elevation (E2298) as a covered benefit and has implemented coverage retroactively back to Feb. 1, 2025.

ACHC renewed as deeming authority for home health accreditation 

CARY, N.C. – The Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC) has received continued approval from CMS as a national accrediting organization for home health agencies (HHAs). This renewal, effective until 2031, affirms that ACHC’s accreditation program meets or exceeds Medicare Conditions of Participation (CoPs) for HHAs. “ACHC remains committed to delivering high-quality, patient-centered accreditation services that help home health providers ensure compliance with CMS requirements while driving excellence in care,” said Susan Mills, ACHC senior program director. “This six-year renewal reflects our dedication to upholding the highest standards in the home health industry and supporting agencies in their mission to deliver outstanding patient care.” Deeming authority allows ACHC-accredited home health agencies to demonstrate compliance with Medicare CoPs without undergoing routine state surveys. Instead, ACHC conducts rigorous accreditation surveys that assess HHAs on critical operational and clinical performance standards, ensuring quality and safety in home-based health care services. To achieve continued CMS approval, ACHC underwent an extensive evaluation process, which included a comprehensive review of ACHC’s accreditation standards to ensure alignment with federal regulations, an assessment of ACHC’s surveyor training and performance to ensure consistency and effectiveness, a comparison of ACHC’s accreditation process with CMS survey requirements, including monitoring noncompliance and responding to deficiencies, and an analysis of ACHC’s ability to report survey findings and corrective actions in a timely manner.

The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center) and Flatiron Health are teaming up to make clinical trials more efficient by reducing administrative burdens on researchers.

The partnership brings Flatiron Clinical Pipe to CU Cancer Center and UCHealth, allowing clinical trial data to move directly from electronic health records (EHRs) to electronic data capture (EDC) systems.

The technology eliminates the need for manual data entry. Instead, it transfers information directly from the EHR to trial databases.

The system is in use at over 85 academic medical centers and community oncology sites, covering more than 300 locations.

Clinical trials require massive amounts of data, and entering this information by hand is one of the most time-consuming parts of the research process.

Clinical Pipe integrates with UCHealth's EHR through Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs), an installation process that took about 11 hours.

Flatiron Health's Head of Research Network Emily Akin told MobiHealthNews that Clinical Pipe can help reduce the burden on clinical trial site teams, streamline data management, and accelerate study timelines.

The company recently published the first peer-reviewed paper on a commercially available EHR-to-EDC system that showed the average case report form completion time was just 37 seconds when using Clinical Pipe.

"That's ten times faster than manual data entry, which typically takes about 30 seconds per data point," Akin said. "With Clinical Pipe, it only takes three seconds."

The study, published in ESMO Real-World Data and Digital Oncology, found that researchers using Clinical Pipe transferred more than 11,000 data points and nearly 1,000 CRFs.

By automating this process, sites like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth can conduct more trials with greater ease, Akin said.

"By reducing the administrative workload, Clinical Pipe allows providers to spend more meaningful time with patients," Akin said. "This improved efficiency enhances the overall care experience for trial participants."

Faster data entry and reduced errors also mean fewer delays in research, which can speed up trial completion and bring new treatments to patients sooner, she said.

As handling sensitive patient data requires strict security measures, Clinical Pipe meets SOC-2 and HITRUST CSF certification requirements and complies with HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 regulations.

All data is encrypted during transfer and storage, ensuring privacy and protection.

Akin explained one of the biggest challenges in clinical research is making trials more accessible to patients, with many research sites struggling with administrative barriers that limit the number of trials they can run.

Clinical Pipe is designed to reduce these challenges, allowing institutions like CU Cancer Center and UCHealth to conduct more studies and expand research opportunities.

"This collaboration makes clinical trials more accessible by reducing the operational challenges that often limit trial availability at research sites," Akin said. "It allows institutions to efficiently conduct more trials and ultimately broadens patient access to research opportunities."

An innovative healthcare approach that cuts out insurance companies— and with them, surprise charges — could get a boost in Wisconsin with the passage of a bill moving through the Legislature.

State Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara, a Republican from Appleton, has again introduced legislation that would exempt this newer model, called direct primary care, from health insurance law and regulations, as well as define the specifics of agreements between patients and those providers.

Direct primary care is a membership-based healthcare system in which patients pay a flat, monthly fee out of their pocket, rather than for visits and services. Most care is then covered by the membership fee. Proponents argue it gives doctors more time and personalized care with their patients and cuts much of the headache of dealing with insurance companies and surprise charges from out-of-network providers.

Cabral-Guevara, the chair of the Senate’s health committee, is also a nurse practitioner who runs her own healthcare practice.

“Direct primary care has become more popular over the years simply because insurance costs are going up,” she said.

Her bill aims to provide some protections for the young industry as it grows, the senator said, and also protections for patients, by defining and clarifying primary care agreements.

These types of laws, which have passed in states across the country, shield direct primary care practices from being regulated like traditional health insurance companies, reinforcing the model’s focus on direct patient-physician relationships without third-party payers, said Amanda Preimesberger, a physician and the founder of rootsMD, a direct primary care practice in Madison.

“Direct primary care agreements are not insurance plans,” she wrote in an email. 

Without clear legislation, regulators may classify them as such, subjecting direct primary care practices to complex regulations, like obtaining insurance licenses, that could force increased costs on them, Preimesberger noted. That would result in higher prices for patients, blowing up the entire premise of direct primary care, which can keep costs low due to the lack of middlemen.

Nicole Hemkes, a physician who founded Advocate MD, a direct primary care practice with several clinics in Dane County, said the vast majority of her patients also have health insurance on top of paying her membership fee, “but they are using us for the majority of their stuff.”

Folks with high deductible plans in the thousands of dollars likely have to pay for most healthcare services at a traditional clinic out of pocket, so buying membership-based direct primary care and using it for most of their healthcare on top of paying insurance premiums can often be cheaper for the patient.

“We are filling that gap,” Hemkes said.

Regarding the bill, Hemkes said she had “mixed feelings,” as she worries it might hold direct primary care practices to a higher standard than traditional ones, but overall she is supporting it.

A version of the bill has been introduced for several legislative sessions, according to Cabral-Guevara’s office. After passing both houses of the legislature with only Republican votes in 2019, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, vetoed the bill due to fears it might be discriminatory, the senator said.

Seeking to win over the governor, Cabral-Guevara got an opinion from the Legislative Research Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency that assists legislators in developing and analyzing bills, saying other laws on the books already offer discrimination protections. A recent U.S. Supreme Court case affirmed those protections for gay or transgender people, she noted.

The governor’s press office did not respond to messages asking if those things have changed his mind.



Potential drawbacks of direct primary care

Direct primary care does not make sense for everyone. Memberships do not cover everything, and patients still need to buy insurance so they are covered for major medical expenses and specialty care. But memberships are relatively inexpensive, generally around $50-100 per month depending on age and location, and may be cheaper than paying for healthcare services out of pocket under high-deductible plans.

Also, direct primary care memberships may not accept Medicare and Medicaid, limiting their access for some. And because it is not part of your health insurance, spending on memberships have no effect on your deductible.

Approximately half of the adults in the United States (116 million) have high blood pressure, or hypertension, with 91.7 million needing prescription medication in addition to lifestyle changes. As of 2017, the self-reported prevalence of hypertension in adults aged 20 and older in Georgia is 30.1% to 31.9%, reported Tim Hall, senior business intelligence developer at Piedmont Healthcare.

Piedmont Health is a not-for-profit health system with 1,755 locations serving communities that comprise 85% of Georgia's population.

"If patients were more adherent to their hypertension medications and blood pressure was better controlled, patients would decrease their risk for heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease, which are leading causes of death, disability and high healthcare expenditures," Hall explained.

"Using prescription fill data and predictive analytics systems integrated into its health information systems, Piedmont Healthcare developed a project to identify the highest priority patients for intervention to increase their medication adherence rates, improving clinical outcomes and patient safety while meeting value-based care goals."

Initial results showed improvements in adherence measured by the proportion of days covered, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure values in the treatment group as well as a reduction in wasted clinician intervention.

Hall will be presenting results and much more in a HIMSS25 session entitled "Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence," Thursday, March 6 at 8:30 a.m. in Caesars Forum 115. Hall's co-presenters will be Dr. Thomas Wells and Melissa Robinson, PharmD, both from Piedmont Healthcare.

"In addition to these promising results, we want to share in the session our approach to the development of a predictive analytics model and the feasibility of implementation into an existing workflow within our population health department," he added.

Predictive analytics is playing a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in tackling medication nonadherence, he said.

"By integrating predictive analytics scores into electronic health record systems and other health information technologies, providers can identify at-risk patients and intervene earlier," he continued. "Incorporating additional prescription fill history from a population health management system further refines prioritization, allowing for more precise, data-driven decisions.

"Additionally, by leveraging intervention-level data and social determinants of health from EHRs, healthcare organizations can develop more targeted and potentially automated interventions to improve adherence and patient outcomes," he said.

Hall has plenty of advice he shares here and in his educational session.

"Leveraging predictive analytics and prescription fill data to inform and design patient interventions, we can positively impact medication adherence, which, in turn, improves patient outcomes," he explained.

"Developing a successful predictive analytics model and implementation is an investment, both of time and resources," he concluded. "A multidisciplinary team approach that includes developers, business owners, executives, operations, clinicians, analysts and other stakeholders will help to ensure success. Choosing metrics to measure the success of your predictive analytics project should include the clinical impact in addition to any other financial or operations problem your organization is trying to solve."

The Piedmont education session, "Implementing Predictive Analytics to Improve Medication Adherence," is scheduled for Thursday, March 6, from 8:30-to 9:30 a.m. in Caesars | Forum 116 at HIMSS25 in Las Vegas.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WICS) —  Physician assistants from across Illinois gathered at the state capitol today to advocate for a bill aimed at improving healthcare access by removing certain restrictions on their practice.

The proposed legislation seeks to eliminate requirements that currently prevent physician assistants (PAs) from immediately assisting patients, such as the necessity for a specific physician agreement to practice medicine.

"Right now in Illinois there’s unfortunately a lot of red tape that doesn’t allow these physician assistants to get hired the way they should be and we need them," said Jayson Coble, a physician assistant with HSHS.

He added, "We're trying to modernize our practice act on our lobby day here at the state capitol in order to improve access for patients."

Nationwide, physician assistants account for more than 500 million patient visits each year.

At HIMSS25, the focus for attendees should be on actionable innovations – technologies that eliminate friction and enhance collaboration, advised Dr. Colin Banas, chief medical officer at DrFirst.

DrFirst (Booth 1058) is a vendor of medication management technology that works from prescription through adherence and is used by nearly half a million prescribers, 70,000 pharmacies, 270 EHRs and health information systems, and more than 2,000 hospitals in the U.S., the company reported.

"I recommend health IT leaders at HIMSS25 prioritize AI and automation in practical, measurable ways," Banas said. "AI already is making an impact, but the key for CIOs and IT leaders is to deploy AI where it solves real pain points.

"Whether it's automating prior authorization workflows, integrating predictive analytics for medication adherence, or enabling chat-driven clinical decision support, the focus should be on reducing administrative burden and improving patient outcomes," he continued. "Look for AI systems that provide real, quantifiable value to clinicians and patients alike."

On another front, break down data silos to enable better collaboration, Banas advised.

"One of healthcare's biggest obstacles is fragmented data, which prevents providers, pharmacies and payers from working together efficiently," he said. "IT leaders should prioritize interoperability with integrations that facilitate real-time data exchange across the healthcare ecosystem. When clinical data is accessible and actionable within workflow, it leads to faster treatment decisions, fewer errors and better patient engagement."

Also, CIOs and other health IT leaders should empower patients with targeted information to improve adherence and reduce readmissions, he added.

"When patients end up back in the hospital, it's often connected to taking their prescribed medications incorrectly – or not at all," he noted. "Patient engagement programs that include personalized, targeted information connect people with cost-saving resources and relevant clinical information that drives medication adherence.

"CIOs and IT leaders should focus on patient engagement platforms that give patients the information they need while not adding administrative burden to busy clinicians," he said.

Along these lines, Banas noted what he has observed to be the big technologies for HIMSS25.

"AI has been a dominant topic in healthcare for years, but in 2025, it's shifting from hype to real-world applications," he said. "This year, the industry is focusing on AI's practical impact – especially in areas like patient engagement, clinical decision support and accelerating time to therapy.

"For patients, AI agents are transforming the medication journey by acting as concierges that provide real-time updates on copays, prior authorization status and financial assistance options," he continued. "These innovations are eliminating long hold times and back-and-forth calls between providers, insurers and pharmacies – easing frustration and giving patients greater control over their care."

On the provider side, AI-enhanced clinical decision support tools now are embedded directly into EHR and prescribing workflows, enabling clinicians to quickly search clinical literature for informed decisions, he said. This reduces cognitive overload and improves patient safety by ensuring providers have the most up-to-date treatment insights at the point of care, he noted.

"In addition, disruptive innovation is poised to revolutionize how e-prescriptions are sent to pharmacies, breaking out of an outdated system that strangles innovation and limits clinical collaboration," Banas said. "Prescriptions are, after all, clinical orders. Yet e-prescriptions are handled by an archaic claims-based system that treats them more like financial transactions.

"A new approach with customizable workflows allows prescribers and pharmacists to fully collaborate, connect with payers and patient support programs, eliminate time-consuming manual workarounds, and reduce the delays that impact patient care – particularly for specialty and high-cost medications," he concluded.

Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense.

Health systems have had the same workforce concerns for years. They’re scrambling to fill nursing shifts, struggling to attract and retain nurses, and spending far too much time and money on temporary staffing. Health system leaders have told me time and again they’re striving for workforce resilience, an emerging ideal that emphasizes the personal and professional wellbeing of the workforce — structurally, culturally, and on an individual level by prioritizing work-life balance.

It’s not a completely novel concept, but it’s trendy given the state of healthcare’s labor force. 

However, it’s not exactly congruent with health systems’ workforce strategies. Ask the average health system leader about how they manage their workforce, and you’ll get the same response you might have received in 2005. In fact, many are still relying on the same processes to fill shifts that they did when I was a practicing nurse nearly twenty years ago: spreadsheets, phone calls, last-minute texts. 


					Mike Wirth of ProviderTrust shares insights about the company in this interview at the ViVE 2025 conference in Nashville last month.				

On big campuses where innovative new technologies are being used to save lives every day, these staffing habits may seem inconsequential. But they actually signal a much larger problem: healthcare’s workforce blueprint is out of date. 

Today’s nursing workforce is not the workforce of 20 years ago. If hospitals want to build a resilient workforce, they need to embrace flexibility. 

Flexibility and the modern workforce

Walk into any hospital and you’re likely to see a nursing workforce that spans five generations. Each has a unique expectation for their career, and a different perspective of flexibility. It’s not just about striving for work-life balance. It’s about finding ways to build a shift schedule that works for Gen Z nurses and Baby Boomer nurses, for nurse managers and hospital executives, and most importantly, for patients. 


					When it comes to managing inbound phone calls, underperformance has devastating cost implications.				

Younger nurses expect technology-driven solutions that allow them to manage their schedules from the palm of their hands. Mid-career nurses balancing family and professional responsibilities want stability above all — predictable but adaptable scheduling options. Older nurses approaching retirement may want to work just enough to keep their licenses active, or serve as mentors to newer nurses. 

Beyond generational preference, flexibility won’t mean the same thing for every hospital. For some, it might be an internal resource pool that enables full-time staff to float. For others, it could mean building staggered shift structures that can help rotate core staff out of a physically taxing three-on, four-off schedule. Some hospitals have begun leveraging an on-demand workforce to supplement core staff, bringing in on-demand nurses to supplement cultural workforce resilience programs. 

Change is hard. Uncertainty is uncomfortable. But the reality is, the old ways aren’t working anymore. Hospitals are in a hiring hole, straining against tightening budget constraints, and depending on a workforce that expects flexibility as a given — not a perk. The time to try new things is now. 

Designing a blueprint for today

If we could rethink care delivery overnight during the pandemic, why aren’t we applying those lessons now? In 2020 and 2021, health systems adapted on the fly — launching telehealth programs, restructuring shifts, and mobilizing both internal and external staffing resources. 

Somehow, once the pandemic began to wane, most health systems reverted back to the status quo, back to old ways that don’t work for a workforce and industry that has undergone rapid transformation. The industry missed a key opportunity to build on those gains.

New care delivery models present perfect opportunities to experiment with flexible workforce strategies. Hospital-at-home programs are gaining traction, requiring new, flexible staffing approaches. Those that are able to tap into on-demand staffing resources will be better able to support full-time staff as they extend care beyond the four walls of the hospital. Forward-thinking health systems are testing the waters by staffing virtual nursing programs with nurses nearing retirement, and activating per diem nurses to fill the gaps left in facilities. 

Many older nurses want to remain in the workforce, albeit in a much less rigorous capacity. Developing formal mentorship programs — where experienced nurses can provide guidance, training, and support for incoming nurses — can help retain institutional knowledge that health systems cannot afford to lose, while providing additional career pathways. 

Health systems want to achieve workforce resilience, but the old staffing blueprint will never allow it. Those that fail to adapt their workforce strategies will remain stuck in crisis mode, scrambling to fill shifts and struggling to retain nurses in the face of a nursing shortage. But for those willing to welcome change, the opportunity is immense. 

Flexibility is no longer a luxury. Today, it’s a necessity. The time for health systems to define what it means for them is now.

A shift toward strategic partnerships is underway, with RCM outsourcing budgets expected to riseMore than half of healthcare providers surveyed are actively exploring or testing gen AI use cases

BOCA RATON, Fla., March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- An overwhelming majority (85%) of senior healthcare executives surveyed believe AI will improve efficiencies in revenue cycle management (RCM) operations over the next five years, according to the results of a new Everest Group report, supported by Omega Healthcare, titled "Realizing the Promise of Tech-Enabled, AI-Driven Revenue Cycle Management (RCM): Outsourcing in the New Era." The study highlights how healthcare providers are leveraging AI-enabled technology services (such as gen AI and agentic AI) and a shift to more strategic outsourcing partnerships to address challenges, enhance financial performance, and streamline revenue cycle processes.

"The hope and promise of AI, gen AI and agentic AI are no longer just hype," said Anurag Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder, Omega Healthcare.  "While the technology is important, it is only part of the equation. To fully harness the power of AI it will become increasingly critical for healthcare providers to work with the right partners."

Shift to More Strategic RCM Outsourcing PartnershipsAs gen AI investments continue to accelerate, more than half (51%) of healthcare leaders polled expect an increase in RCM outsourcing budgets by 2030, emphasizing the significance gen AI will have on the sector.

"More than seven in 10 (71%) healthcare executives surveyed are planning to evolve from transactional relationships to strategic partnerships, and nearly half (49%) are interested in end-to-end RCM outsourcing to a single service provider," noted Mehta. "Long-term success will be defined by selecting a partner who can serve as a trusted advisor capable of delivering not only the technology, but also a comprehensive fusion of ongoing digital innovation, healthcare expertise, services as solutions, and proven operational and cybersecurity excellence."

Gen AI: Propelling RCM TransformationInterestingly, the survey found that more than half (51%) of healthcare providers are actively exploring gen AI in RCM, with 22% already testing proof-of-concept initiatives and 29% in the consideration stage, evaluating use cases and potential challenges. Although adoption varies by organization size, the overwhelming consensus is that gen AI will play a critical role in automating manual processes, improving billing accuracy, and reducing claim denials.

"As a benefit of the gen AI investments we have already made so our customers do not have to, our clients are already putting gen AI use cases into action and are seeing meaningful results across RCM functions," said Vijayashree Natarajan, SVP & Head of Technology, Omega Healthcare.  "The Omega Digital platform, powered by AI/gen AI/agentic AI solutions, is helping to enhance business outcomes for our customers, such as ~20-25% collections improvement; ~ 25-30% aged AR reduction; and ~ 30-35% improvement in charge lag."

Top Five Gen AI Use CasesRCM leaders' top five gen AI use cases are: Real-time eligibility and benefits verification; Claims data analysis and pattern recognition to avoid future rejections; Gen AI chatbots to resolve patient queries (billing, payments, scheduling) and enhance experience; Documentation improvement through AI scribing; and Synthetic data generation and automated medical coding from clinical documents.

Barriers to AdoptionMajor challenges to gen AI adoption in RCM include a lack of in-house expertise, with about 80% of executives citing it as a key hurdle, and barriers integrating with existing electronic health records systems. Additionally, 46% of survey respondents consider gen AI a high priority but are awaiting regulatory clarity before committing to large-scale investments.

Future Investment PrioritiesEmerging RCM challenges, including the need for real-time claims tracking, the transition to value-based care models, and increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance, are also influencing investment decisions.

Looking ahead, RCM leaders are prioritizing cybersecurity, payer collaboration, and AI-driven automation:

 Reaching 10 Million Patients by 2035 With a Focus on Underserved Communities 

AUSTIN, Texas, March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- BB Imaging, a leading sonography services company, announced its goal to reach 10 million patients annually in the next 10 years. Building on its legacy of serving half a million patients, the company is determined to address the urgent need for improved maternal healthcare and combat the maternal mortality crisis, underscored by the United States' D-plus preterm birth grade from the March of Dimes and Texas' D grade.

BB Imaging to Reach 10M Patients, Transforming Maternal Healthcare Access


"When we started BB Imaging, we knew access to quality prenatal care was essential, but the maternal mortality rates in the United States are alarming," said Blanca Lesmes, President, Chairperson, and Co-founder of BB Imaging. "Our goal is to move the needle on this critical issue by ensuring pregnant patients, especially in underserved communities, receive timely and comprehensive prenatal ultrasounds."


"When we started BB Imaging, we knew access to quality prenatal care was essential, but the maternal mortality rates in the United States are alarming," said Blanca Lesmes, President, Chairperson, and Co-founder of BB Imaging. "Our goal is to move the needle on this critical issue by ensuring pregnant patients, especially in underserved communities, receive timely and comprehensive prenatal ultrasounds."

BB Imaging is expanding access to maternal healthcare in areas of greatest need. Initial expansion plans focus on Dallas, Houston, and border towns in Texas, as well as Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Oklahoma, and Washington. This is driven by the urgent need to improve maternal health outcomes, especially in Texas, which ranks 47th in the nation for access to prenatal care, with 22 percent of women receiving inadequate care compared to the national average of 15.7 percent.

"We recognize the urgent need for qualified sonographers, especially in rural areas," said Sanjay Patel, CEO of BB Imaging. "The industry average to fill a sonographer role is between 36 and 42 days, but in rural settings, it can take up to 180 days. This delay in hiring can significantly impact patient care. BB Imaging can place highly skilled, accredited sonographers in clinics in as little as 30 days, ensuring timely access to vital diagnostic services."

BB Imaging provides a comprehensive solution for sonography staffing, handling everything from recruitment and training to scheduling and benefits. BB Imaging employs hundreds of sonographers. All are specialized, accredited professionals who meet the highest industry standards.

Looking ahead, BB Imaging is committed to partnering with healthcare providers, community organizations, and technology innovators like Telescan® to expand access to prenatal care and improve maternal health outcomes. "Telescan® has been a game changer," said Ben Buentipo, Chief Imaging Officer and Co-founder for BB Imaging. "It allows us to bridge geographical gaps and provide timely care to patients who might otherwise have limited access to specialists."

The company's goal of reaching 10 million patients annually in the next 10 years underscores its dedication to transforming healthcare access for all. "We invite healthcare providers and community organizations to join us in this mission to ensure that every mother and baby has access to the quality care they deserve," concluded Lesmes.

Strategies to combat rising cyber threats in the healthcare industry



Editor’s Note: This article was originally published in 2024 and has been updated to include the EU Action Plan information.

Healthcare organizations are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, averaging 1,463 cyberattacks per week in 2022, up 74% compared to the previous year [i]. The healthcare industry has also ranked highest in data breach costs for 12 years in a row [ii]. The potential impact of a cyber incident is not just financial–the consequences can be fatal [iii].

Hospitals and healthcare providers are targeted for several reasons. First, they are vulnerable targets as attackers seek to exploit them for the notoriety of claiming they successfully shut down such critical facilities. Healthcare data is also in high demand on the dark web and can fetch a hefty sum for attackers.

Another major reason hospitals are targeted is that they have large operational technology (OT) environments with thousands of entry points. On the medical side, this includes a vast array of equipment, from MRI machines to ventilators. On the building side, it includes assets like fire and life safety systems, HVAC and access control. The sheer volume of assets provides an attack surface far larger than almost any other industry. Moreover, many of these systems operate on legacy frameworks, making them more susceptible to exploitation.

EU Action Plan on the Cybersecurity of Hospitals and Healthcare Providers

In 2023, EU countries reported 309 significant cybersecurity incidents in the healthcare sector, more than any other critical sector. These cyberattacks can delay medical procedures and disrupt vital services. In response, the European Commission unveiled a new EU Action Plan that focuses on:

1.      Enhancing prevention of cyber threats with enhanced preparedness measures

2.      Better detection and identification of these threats with near real-time alerts

3.      Minimizing the impact of cyberattacks to mitigate additional damage

4.      Deterring cyber threat actors with the use of tools such as the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox

It also proposes establishing a pan-European Cybersecurity Support Centre to provide hospitals and healthcare providers with tailored guidance, tools, services, and training. These measures aim to ensure the resilience and security of healthcare systems across Europe, safeguarding patient care and maintaining the integrity of critical healthcare infrastructure. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, the EU aims to create a robust defense against cyber threats, ensuring that healthcare services remain uninterrupted and secure.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considers new requirements

In response to this increasing threat, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a concept paper [iv] in 2023 introducing new measures designed to help protect the sector from cyberattacks.

These measures include:

1. Establishing voluntary cybersecurity performance goals for the healthcare sector to help healthcare organizations prioritize cybersecurity practices.

2. Providing resources to incentivize and implement cybersecurity practices, such as the establishment of an upfront investments program to help high-need providers.

3. Implementing an HHS-wide strategy to support greater enforcement and accountability, which includes potential increased financial penalties for HIPAA violations.

4. Expanding and maturing the one-stop shop within HHS for healthcare sector cybersecurity, thereby increasing HHS’ incident-response capabilities.

The intent is to better equip hospitals with cybersecurity education and resources, as well as discourage noncompliance by strengthening HHS’ enforcement authority.

Healthcare organizations don’t know what they don’t know

A big security hole at many hospitals is lack of awareness. They may think their OT systems are secure when they’re not. For instance, the systems may be air-gapped, which means they’re not connected to the internet, but most of them must be patched or updated regularly. This might mean that, on the first of every month, the systems are connected to the internet to download the patches or updates and thus they are not truly air-gapped.

Even if the patching and updating are done via USB, those OT systems may still not be safe. A 2024 Honeywell USB Threat study found that 51% of the malware discovered was designed for USBs  [v] . Another risk is that many cyberattacks target third-party OT systems whose providers may have access rights to perform maintenance and upgrades. This opens the door to yet another threat.

Three steps healthcare organizations should take now

The pressure is on for healthcare organizations to fortify their systems against cyberthreats and put necessary controls and defense measures in place. Here are the top three steps they should take to get started:

1. Create an incident response plan. This is essential for hospitals to swiftly recover if they’re hit with downtime or if critical equipment, such as ventilators or HVAC systems, are targeted in a cyberattack. Without a plan in place, a hospital can’t get back up and running quickly and efficiently, and make sure its patients and staff are safe. This should be tested using tabletop exercises

2. Maintain a full asset inventory with vulnerability management and threat detection. The reality is that most OT and control systems have an IP connection, e.g., HVAC, energy management, security, access control, video/closed-circuit television, patient monitoring, fire systems, medical devices and other IoT. However, IT often doesn’t monitor or manage these connections for cyberthreats as closely as it monitors or manages its own systems. In most cases they’re not aware of all the devices on the OT network. It’s essential that hospitals know exactly what they have running in their environment on both the enterprise IT network and their OT network

3. Have a trusted partner.  Securing operational technology is a complex task that lies in the intersection between engineering and cybersecurity. It requires knowledge of the underlying devices, control systems and proprietary protocols that exist in the environment, combined with cybersecurity technology and the skills required to implement the necessary controls that reduce risk. For this reason, healthcare organizations must work with trusted partners and vendors who build products that are secure-by-design, understand the underlying technology and combine it with cybersecurity experience to help them realize their risk reduction and compliance goals.

Honeywell is in a unique position to help healthcare organizations comply with new regulatory requirements and reduce their cybersecurity risk. With 50+ years of building automation experience and millions of facilities worldwide using Honeywell technology, we understand the attack surface that healthcare organizations operate with and what controls are required to reduce it. We’ve delivered 7,000+ cyber projects in 130+ countries worldwide, with a broad portfolio of solutions and services from cyber assessments, incident response, patch management, network monitoring, endpoint security and more.

Healthcare system collaborates with Dario to offer AI-powered chronic care management solutions as a benefit for their employee base of healthcare workers, expected to contribute to the current total of 15 new client signings in 2025, representing a significant head start in its 2025 net new client goal.

NEW YORK, March 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) ("Dario" or the "Company"), a leader in the global digital health market, announced today the signing of a contract with a major healthcare system to be added to its employer book of business, set to go live in the first quarter of 2025. We believe that this milestone reinforces the growing recognition of digital health solutions among healthcare professionals, a group uniquely positioned to understand the value of proactive, technology-driven care.

The new healthcare system contract marks a significant step for Dario. As self-insured employers, these organizations carefully evaluated Dario's ability to deliver measurable value for both employees and patients. Their decision to integrate Dario's solutions reflects confidence in the company's ability to enhance care delivery while addressing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, and mental health challenges.

Dario aims to position itself at the forefront of the evolution of the digital health landscape, demonstrating the ability of digital health solutions to drive meaningful clinical outcomes. Peer-reviewed studies highlight Dario's effectiveness in reducing A1C levels for diabetes patients by 2.3 points, as well as decreasing anxiety and depression by 28-30% over eight weeks through its behavioral health platform, Dario Mind. By combining AI-driven personalization with a seamless user experience, Dario is closing the gap between traditional care models and scalable digital interventions.

"We are thrilled to add such a unique segment to our employer book of business," said Steven Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer at Dario. "Healthcare workers have a deep understanding of the impact that poor chronic condition management can have on a person. Having our solutions trusted by this audience is truly meaningful. These employers recognize the clinical importance of Dario's cardiometabolic and behavioral health solutions, and we are excited to provide them with tools that improve health outcomes and overall well-being."

Historically, healthcare systems have been slower to adopt digital wellness and self-care therapies. Inconsistent reimbursement models and provider skepticism about engagement and clinical efficacy have all contributed to delayed integration. However, recent industry shifts—including coverage, stronger clinical evidence and more innovative approaches to engagement —are accelerating adoption.

As the digital health landscape continues to evolve, collaborations with healthcare systems will play a critical role in expanding access to high-quality, technology-enabled care. By prioritizing innovation and clinical rigor, Dario remains committed to driving the next wave of digital health adoption for both employers and healthcare providers alike.

RICHMOND, Va. — Thousands of Virginians are navigating the loss of job-based health care following massive layoffs from the federal government.

Enroll Virginia is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that wants to help those who need to enroll in a new health care plan.

Director Deepak Madala says they’ve seen a sharp spike in calls for assistance, especially in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond, following the federal layoffs.

Many of these Virginians without work have not had to navigate the challenge of enrolling in non-work-related health care in years, according to Madala.

That’s where Enroll Virginia can step in. Their statewide team of assisters can provide free, unbiased advice to help you review all of the options you may have.

"Sometimes they think COBRA may be their only option, but unfortunately, COBRA can be quite expensive, especially if your employer is not paying for it," explained Madala. "But in some cases, COBRA is the best option. So it's one of those things of just looking at all of what's out there, and then seeing what you can qualify for."

It’s important that if you do lose insurance from your job, you act quickly because you only have 60 days to enroll in new coverage.

"Make sure you're starting to collect all of your medical needs," Madala explained. "So, you know, what prescriptions are you taking? What, if you have any upcoming appointments, things like that, just kind of collect and make sure you know what those are. And then when you go to a navigator or even an agent and broker, they can be better positioned to help you understand what the best plan, or, you know, kind of best option may be for your family."

BNP Paribas Open Indian Wells returns to Sky Sports Tennis with Emma Raducanu, Jack Draper, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek all playing; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Wednesday 5 March 2025 10:15, UK

Tennis returns to the desert - live on Sky Sports Tennis - with the first combined WTA and ATP 1000 event of the year at the BNP Paribas Open Indian Wells.

The tournament kicked off with the qualifying stages on Sunday March 2, with the main draw action commencing on Wednesday March 5. It all ends on Sunday March 16 when both the men's and women's singles finals will take place.

Yes! Emma Raducanu's ranking has earned her direct entry into the main draw after she required a wildcard to play the first two WTA 1000 events of the year in Doha and Dubai.

She is expected to be offered enhanced security in Indian Wells after she was the target of "fixated behaviour" from a man during the Dubai Championships last week.

The 22-year-old will play Japan's Moyuka Uchijima on opening Wednesday and will face Coco Gauff if she progresses to the next round.

Raducanu will be joined in the main draw by British No 1 Katie Boulter, who automatically goes straight to the second round as she's seeded.

Sonay Kartal defeated Marina Stakusic 6-2 6-2 to book her place into the final qualifying round, but she couldn't make the main draw after losing to Clervie Ngounoue 3-6 7-5 7-5.

Novak Djokovic will play at the ATP 1000-level tournament, as the Serbian resumes his hunt for a 100th singles title.

The 24-time Grand Slam winner retired from his Australian Open semi-final against Alexander Zverev with a hamstring issue last month and lost in the Qatar Open first round last week.

The 37-year-old said that he "played without pain" in Doha but his disappointing display raised concerns among fans that he would not play in the Southern California event.

"A legend returns to the desert," the tournament wrote on X, quieting concerns about whether he would play.

Djokovic will play Nick Kyrgios in the second round, if the latter comes through his first match, with Carlos Alcaraz in line to face the 24-time Grand Slam champion in the quarter-finals.

Five-time Indian Wells winner Djokovic will aim to become the third man to claim 100 singles titles in the professional era, behind Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103).

Djokovic is expected to be joined in Indian Wells by coach Andy Murray, with the partnership set to continue "indefinitely".

Speaking in her monthly column for Sky Sports, Laura Robson said she was encouraged by the news. "Andy Murray continuing with Novak Djokovic is really positive. Andy has four young kids and probably doesn't want to do all of these weeks on the road now that he's just stopped playing, so I'm sure that after the Australian Open, it just took them a minute to figure out their schedules," she wrote.

"I think it was a case of picking and choosing which tournaments they partner up at, and it sounds like he's going to be at Indian Wells and Miami coming up in March."

Jannik Sinner will miss Indian Wells after accepting a three-month ban in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Carlos Alcaraz is the two-time reigning Indian Wells champion, having downed Daniil Medvedev in the final of the last two editions, while Alexander Zverev will be the top seed on the men's side.

Iga Swiatek is the reigning women's champion, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Australian Open winner Madison Keys will aim to topple the Pole.

Joao Fonseca, an 18-year-old Brazilian prodigy who recently won his maiden ATP title at the Argentina Open, and Learner Tien, a 19-year-old who made a stunning run to the fourth round of the 2025 Australian Open as a qualifier and is one of the brightest young American prospects, received wild cards.

Legendary seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams will not play after declining her wild card.

Williams, who has reached the semi-finals on three occasions in Indian Wells, had boycotted the tournament between 2002 and 2016 after her sister Serena was booed by the crowd in the 2001 final, with the family also saying they were subjected to racist abuse.

Two-time Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova was also awarded a wildcard. The Czech will be returning to action after the birth of her first child, son Petr, last July.

"The 'sunshine double' of Indian Wells and Miami is very tough for any player to pull off because it's totally opposite conditions - even though it's two hard-court tournaments," said former British No 1 Robson.

"It's a really long stint - both events are 12 days - and it's just a massive change conditions-wise, to go from one to the other as Miami is so hot and humid, compared to being in the desert of Palm Springs.

"Indian Wells, in particular, I always struggled at because it's much slower than you think. It doesn't always favour the Brits, who in general prefer slightly faster conditions and a pacier hard court that plays more lively, because you get a bit more out of your shots."

Indian Wells Tennis Garden is located near Palm Springs, California, in the Coachella Valley.

Alongside its 16,100-capacity centre court - the second largest tennis-specific stadium in the world - the complex also boasts 29 hard-courts.

Oracle co-founder and CEO Larry Ellison assumed full ownership of Indian Wells in 2009 for a whopping $100m. The tech billionaire is the world's fourth richest man, worth an estimated £165bn.

Expect a star-studded field on and off the court, with film stars including Zendaya, Tom Holland, Charlize Theron, Yvonne Orji, Ben Stiller and singer Gwen Stefani.

Stiller became the unwitting support act when Nick Kyrgios clashed with a fan at the event in 2022.

FARMINGTON, Utah - Portland State senior Nika Beukers has been named the Big Sky Women's Tennis Player of the Week, the conference announced Wednesday.

Beukers, a native of Den Bosch, Netherlands, delivered a perfect start to the Vikings' Big Sky slate, going 4-0 at the No. 1 spot to lead PSU to wins over Weber State and Idaho State.

She dominated Sunday's match against Weber State, defeating Sydney Schnell 6-2, 6-0 in singles and earning a 6-2 doubles victory alongside Nene Uemura. The duo carried that momentum into Monday, securing a 6-0 doubles win before Beukers capped the weekend with a 6-3, 6-4 singles victory over Idaho State's Stefanya Shalakhova.

Additionally, with her back-to-back doubles victories, Beukers surpassed former teammate Capu Sanoner's program record for Big Sky doubles wins in a career, achieving a new program record of 22 wins.

Wednesday's honor is the first of Beukers' career.

British tennis star Emma Raducanu says she struggled to breathe and “couldn’t see the ball through tears” when her match last month was paused at the Dubai Tennis Championships while security led a "fixated" man out of the crowd.

Raducanu, 22, told reporters this week that she could “barely breathe” when the umpire halted the match in order for security to escort the man out of the arena. Raducanu eventually lost the second-round match to Karolina Muchova in back-to-back sets after the umpire resumed the contest.

“I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told reporters in Indian Wells, Calif., this week, according to the Associated Press. The 2021 U.S. Open Winner will return to tennis at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells this week, her first since the incident in Dubai last month.

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.' I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears,” Raducanu said, according to the AP. “I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather here.’ “

Raducanu said she “did break down in tears” after the match, “but not necessarily because I lost.”“It was a very emotional time,” she added.

ESPN reported that Raducanu had been approached by the man twice off the court during her time in Dubai leading up to the match. Raducanu told reporters that the man had been at her matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha in the weeks prior, as well.

The man was detained by Dubai police following the incident, who reported that the man also left her a note and took her picture in addition to following her at her matches, the AP reported last month.

“There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here,” Raducanu said this week, noting that she feels “a lot better” after a few weeks away.

Raducanu has dealt with stalkers before, receiving a restraining order against a fan in 2022 who came to her home three times, according to the AP.

“Thank you for the messages of support,” she wrote on Instagram last month following the most recent incident. “Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be okay and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match.”

Ben Shelton has enjoyed a roller-coaster 2025 season already, with a strong Indian Wells run now likely on his agenda.

Andy Roddick thinks Shelton can impress at Indian Wells, with the ATP Masters 1000 tournament shortly getting underway.

Shelton is the 2025 Indian Wells 11th seed, and gets his tournament underway in the round of 64 on Friday.

The American, who has just clinched a career-high rank of 12th on the ATP Tour, plays the winner of Learner Tien and Mariano Navone.

Shelton heads to Indian Wells on the back of a round of 16 exit at the Mexican Open, having also exited the Dallas Open at that stage.

A round of 16 exit was also suffered at the ASB Classic at the start of the year, but he recovered superbly to reach the Australian Open semi-finals.

The 22-year-old has now shared insight into his superb career so far, telling Vogue: “Tennis was my dad’s thing. It was my sister’s thing.

“And for me, growing up in American public schools tennis wasn’t really cool. Football is cool, basketball is cool – even baseball is cool.

“But playing quarterback – being on that field, hitting people – for me, that was the most fun you can have in athletics.”

Asked if that meant hitting receivers with passes, he replied: “Oh, no, no, no – hitting. Actually hitting them.

“I love contact. That’s the one thing I regret about choosing tennis – not being able to play a contact sport.”

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

Tennis certainly runs in the Shelton family, with his father Bryan spending eight years on the professional tour before coaching at Georgia Tech and the University of Florida.

His mother Lisa meanwhile competed at college level, with his sister Emma having been a highly ranked juniors player.

Ben meanwhile is seemingly closing in on a top 10 debut, a feat recently achieved by his fellow American Tommy Paul.

Paul has since dropped out of the top 10 ahead of Indian Wells, but another American in Taylor Fritz occupies fourth spot in the rankings.

Sharing his verdict on the very top ATP players, Shelton said: “Most of these guys who are at the top of the game right now, they were prodigies – five or six years old, racket in their hand, training every day.

“I wasn’t really supposed to be this great player. And so to get to top 20 in the world within two years of playing college tennis? That’s something that I don’t take for granted. It’s tough to be a finished product by 18 if you start at 12 – but I’m not a finished product.”

Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray made tennis headlines last year as they joined forces in a coaching capacity.

The 24-time Major champion made a significant change at the end of his 2024 season, as Djokovic hired Murray as his coach.

They immediately found success together, as Djokovic reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open, retiring with an injury against Alexander Zverev.

Djokovic has appeared just once since, losing in the first round of the Qatar Open to Matteo Berrettini, an event Murray chose not to attend.

The pair will be re-united for the year’s first Masters 1000 tournament at Indian Wells, as the Serb searches for a sixth title in California.

Ahead of the 37-year-old’s return to action, his countryman and friend shared his thoughts on Djokovic’s decision to bring Murray in as a coach.

Appearing as a guest on The Tennis Podcast, former ATP world number eight, Janko Tipsarevic gave his honest opinion on Murray as a coach.

“When I talk about glorified towel boys and people who are on tour just to pick up balls, 100% Andy Murray does not fall into that category,” he said.

“This has nothing to do with him being the ex-world number one, there are a lot of ex-top players who are s— coaches.

“My description of Andy Murray as a coach has nothing to do with his prior successes as a tennis player, by his character, you can clearly see that he loves the sport.”

Tipsarevic revealed that he spoke to the Brit in Melbourne earlier this year, and was impressed by his attention to detail.

“I spoke with him in Australia and I know him, we played quite a few times on tour, this is somebody who is taking his job extremely seriously, in terms of looking at the tiniest details in terms of what Novak [Djokovic] can do,” he said.

“I think we can say this will be the final quarter of his career, talking about Novak, whether it be two years or four years, I think we can say it’s the final quarter.”

The 40-year-old gave his verdict on the hire, suggesting Murray was the best possible option for Djokovic.

“So I feel from every possible person on tour, this was and I’m not saying this because we were friends, this was the best possible hire Novak could take,” said Tipsarevic.

“I really feel if he is healthy he can have another great season.

“There is nobody better on tour for Novak as a full package, that he knows personally, that he respects, that he knows will give 100% into the job like he is giving in this moment of his career than Murray.

“I am 100% certain of that, he is a way better hire than [Pete] Sampras or some legend like that or a top player or a Grand Slam winner.

“Because in Andy you have everything in one in terms of somebody who knows the feeling of the pressure that Novak needs his coach to know, and he has been playing with the guys that Novak has still been competing against.”

Djokovic will return to action in California later this week, as he searches for a record-sixth title at Indian Wells.

He’s been handed a tough draw, however, and could potentially face off against world number three Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals.

Djokovic beat Alcaraz in their most recent encounter at the Australian Open, battling back from a set down to win, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4.

The pair have faced off twice before in Masters 1000 tournaments, as Alcaraz beat Djokovic at the 2022 Madrid Open before Djokovic exacted revenge at the Cincinnati Open in 2023.

He won’t want to get too far ahead of himself, however, as he’ll first work hard with Murray to figure out a gameplan worthy of taking down either Botic van de Zandschulp or Nick Kyrgios in the second round.

The Australian star leads the head-to-head with Djokovic, 2-1, but many are concerned he won’t appear at the event after Kyrgios appeared to re-injure his wrist during a practice session ahead of the tournament.

It remains to be seen whether Djokovic will take on Kyrgios or Van de Zandschulp in the second round, but it’ll certainly be worth a watch as the Serb looks to win his 41st Masters 1000 title.

Women's tennis star and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu spoke openly about an incident at last month's Dubai Tennis Championships, when she had to stop playing after discovering a man who had been stalking her was in the crowd. Raducanu will return to competition at Indian Wells, where she will have enhanced security for her personal safety.

During Raducanu's second-round match at Dubai, an unexplained stoppage  occurred when Raducanu approached the umpire's chair after the second  game, saying a few words before standing in the space between the back  of the official's chair and barrier netting adjacent to Court 2. Raducanu became distressed due to the presence of a man who had been exhibiting "fixated behavior" toward her in the first few rows of the stands. The man approached her twice in public in Dubai and was also present at her matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha  in weeks prior.

The man was ejected from the match and detained by Dubai police. Though Raducanu elected to drop charges against him, the individual in question has been banned from all WTA tournaments.

"I was obviously very distraught," Raducanu told reporters in Indian Wells. "I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, 'I don't know how I'm going to finish.'  I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, 'I need to just take a breather.'"

Unfortunately, this is not the first time Raducanu has dealt with stalkers. As a teenager, Raducanu was stalked at her family home in London by a 35-year-old man who was later arrested and had a five-year restraining order issued against him. After this latest incident, Raducanu took a week off from tennis, explaining she had been going through an "emotional time" and now feels much better.

Raducanu, who eventually lost her match in Dubai 7-6 (6), 6-4, is set to play Japan's Moyuka Uchijima in the first round at Indian Wells. A victory would advance her to a match against third-seeded Coco Gauff.

Emma Raducanu is thrilled to be back playing in America as she prepares for the start of the Indian Wells Masters.

The 22-year-old experienced the greatest moment of her career to date while competing in the United States.

This came in 2021 where she became US Open champion after coming through qualifying rounds and did not drop a set.

Four years later Emma Raducanu is ready to make her fifth appearance in Indian Wells, which has come at just the right time for the former British number one.

Each player has the tournaments or countries they enjoy competing in more than others and it brings out the best in them.

In Raducanu’s case, she loves competing in the United States, as her thrilling US Open title win would illustrate.

But the former British number one indicated that the Indian Wells Masters is her favourite tournament to play outside of the Grand Slams, and she shared why she loves playing in America.

“I’m happy to be in Indian Wells. It’s my favourite tournament outside of the Grand Slams. Being here I feel a lot better,” Raducanu told Sky Sports.

“I always loved playing in America since junior days, I had this fascination with it. And I remember the first time I saw a palm tree. It was amazing, like I was in heaven.

“Then, obviously, it was pretty epic in New York and ever since, I’ve just had an amazing fanbase in America and I love it here. It’s just so easy. Everything is so practical, relaxed, and spacious. So I’m just very happy to be here.”

As mentioned above the most successful tournament of Raducanu’s career is her 2021 US Open title win.

Raducanu has won six of her 10 matches at Indian Wells and has reached the fourth round in 2023 where she lost to Iga Swiatek.

In 2022 Raducanu defeated Serena Williams on the way to reaching the third round at the Cincinnati Masters.

Prior to her 2025 Indian Wells campaign, Raducanu last played in America at the Citi Open in the nation’s capital of Washington D.C. in July 2024.

Raducanu reached the Citi Open quarter-finals, and was leading Paula Badosa by a set until the Spaniard came back to win 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, which led to her becoming champion.

March 5 (UPI) -- Emma Raducanu spoke publicly for the first time about being followed by a fixated fan, telling reporters that she could barely see the ball during a tennis match after spotting the "middle-aged creep" in Dubai.

Raducanu made the comments to a group of reporters Tuesday at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., her first tournament since the Feb. 18 Dubai Tennis Championships incident.
"I'm here because I feel a lot better now," Raducanu said. "A lot happened obviously after Dubai, so I just needed to kind of take my time after.
"I think the allure of Indian Wells being my favorite tournament, I just couldn't really step away from it."

Raducanu also was targeted by a stalker, who traveled to her home, in 2021. That man was charged in 2022.
The 22-year-old British tennis star was first approached by the man in Dubai on Feb. 17. She spotted the same man in the first few rows of seats during a Round of 16 match against Karolina Muchova the next day at Dubai Duty Free Tennis Stadium.
Raducanu, who lost the match 7-6 (8), 6-4, was brought to tears early on in the match after spotting the man. She briefly stood behind the umpire's chair as security removed the man from the stadium. Play eventually resumed, but Raducanu was obviously rattled.

"I literally couldn't see the ball through the tears, I could barely breathe," Raducanu said. "I was playing Karolina, who's like top 17 in the world or something, and I can't see the ball. Then the first four games kind of ran away from me because I was not on the court, to be honest.
"I'm not really sure how I regrouped."
The WTA later said the man "who exhibited fixated behavior" was ejected and "banned from all WTA events," pending a threat assessment.
Dubai Police went on to detain the man, but said Raducanu chose to drop charges against him.
The 2021 U.S. Open women's singles champion said she decided last Wednesday to compete at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.
"There's a part of you that thinks, 'I'm not gonna let a middle-aged creep stop me doing what I love to do,'" Raducanu said.
Raducanu, the No. 55 player in the WTA singles rankings, will take on No. 52 Moyuka Uchijima of Japan in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open on Thursday in Indian Wells.

            British tennis star Emma Raducanu has spoken about the emotional toll of noticing what the WTA called a “fixated” man during one of her recent matches in Dubai, explaining how she “couldn’t see the ball through tears.”
    


            Raducanu was playing in the second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships when the incident occurred early on in her match against Czech Republic’s Karolína Muchová, causing her to become visibly distressed and hide behind the umpire’s chair.
    


            The Dubai government later said that the individual in question signed a formal restraining order and had been banned from future tournaments.
    


            “I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told reporters on Tuesday, per Reuters. “I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish.’
    


            “I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.’”
    


            Raducanu managed to recover and take the first set against Muchová to a tie-break, but ultimately lost in straight sets. Two weeks on, she is now in California to play at Indian Wells, which will be her first appearance since the ordeal.
    


            “It was a very emotional time,” said Raducanu, who was speaking to reporters for the first time about the incident. “After the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.
    


            “There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here. I feel a lot better.”
    


            The world No. 55 added that the same individual had been at her previous tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha before appearing in Dubai.
    


            Raducanu told BBC Sport that the incident “could have been dealt with better,” adding that she has now taken precautions to prevent similar situations from arising.
    


            “Since that incident, I have definitely got increased attention and greater security,” she told the BBC. “All we can do is look at what happened and react to it in a better way, in a more positive way, rather than looking back and blaming the situation.
    


            “Now, it is being dealt with better, so for me that’s important. I’m always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I’m always with someone and always being watched.”
    


            The WTA, the governing body of women’s tennis, had not been made aware of the individual following Raducanu until 24 hours after he had approached the 22-year-old in a public area in Dubai.
    


            After the second-round match, the WTA released a statement saying that the man was displaying “fixated behavior” and had been ejected from the tournament.
    


            “Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events,” the statement said.
    


            “The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support. We remain committed to collaborating with tournaments and their security teams worldwide to maintain a safe environment for all players.”
    


            CNN has contacted the Dubai Tennis Championships for comment.
    


            In her first match since the incident, Raducanu will face Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima in Indian Wells on Thursday. She could then face American third seed Coco Gauff, a fellow former US Open champion, in the second round.
    


            “I’m very happy to be in Indian Wells, it’s my favorite tournament outside of the slams,” Raducanu said. “Being here, I feel a lot better. I wasn’t necessarily sure if I was going to come and compete so soon after what happened in Dubai, but I’m glad I made the decision to come here and I’m loving being here. I’m happy on the court.”

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. (AP) — Emma Raducanu says she “couldn’t see the ball through tears” and struggled to breathe after spotting a man who was “fixated” on her during a match.

The British tennis player and 2021 U.S. Open winner was left distressed during a match at last month’s Dubai Championships by the presence of the man in the stand.

The man, who had already approached Raducanu earlier in the tournament, was ejected from the arena after she spoke to the chair umpire during a second-round match against Karolina Muchova. He was later detained by Dubai police and signed a document pledging to “maintain distance” from Raducanu. The WTA said he had “exhibited fixated behavior.”

“I was obviously very distraught,” Raducanu told British reporters at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first tournament since the incident.

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish’. I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather here’.”

Raducanu regrouped to play on after the man was removed from the arena but lost 7-6 6-4.

“It was a very emotional time,” added Raducanu. “After the match I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost.”

Raducanu told the BBC that the incident “could have been dealt with better” but that security improvements have now been made.




“I’m always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I’m always with someone and always being watched,” Raducanu told the BBC.

In 2022, an obsessive fan of Raducanu was given a restraining order after coming to her house three times.

Raducanu will face Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima, who is ranked three places above her at 52nd in the world, in the first round in California on Thursday. The winner is guaranteed to face third-seeded Coco Gauff, with the top 32 players all receiving byes through to the second round.

Tennis

The way phenomenal and accomplished athletes’ minds work can often catch regular folks off-guard. How is it that a tennis player like Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion and former world No. 1, would ever get to a place where she might question her ability?

It happens all the time, even with the all-time greats — a subset of the tennis species that Patrick Mouratoglou, the longtime coach and tennis media impresario, has spent most of his career studying. He coached the best of the best, Serena Williams, at the scene of so many of her greatest triumphs.

In September 2024, three-quarters of the way through her comeback season after giving birth to her daughter, Shai, Osaka hired Mouratogou to replace Wim Fissette. Osaka had reunited with Fissette (who coached her between 2019 and 2022) the previous summer, to prepare for her return to competitive tennis last January. At first, she was magnanimous about the relationship between improvement and outcome. When she came within a point of beating Iga Swiatek at last year’s French Open, Osaka wasn’t down: “Obviously the results aren’t resulting right now, but I think I’m growing every tournament,” she said in her news conference.

When the results still didn’t result, Osaka found herself again struggling with her confidence and decided to move away from the coach with whom she won two of those four Grand Slam titles.

Osaka, 27, hasn’t won a title of any kind with Mouratoglou yet, but she has come awfully close. She had to retire with an abdominal injury when she was up a set against Clara Tauson in the final of the Auckland Classic in New Zealand in January and she has played her best tennis since becoming a mother in the past five months, when her body has allowed her to do so.

“I just had to believe in myself a lot more,” Osaka said at the Australian Open after her second-round win over Karolina Muchova, one of the world’s most gifted players, who had eased past Osaka at the same stage of the U.S. Open four months prior. There in Melbourne, Osaka was talking about coming back to win the last two sets after losing the first 6-1, but she could have been talking about how, when healthy, she has rediscovered her swagger and her ability to take the racket out of her opponents’ hands.

That is not an accident.

In an interview in February from Los Angeles, where he and Osaka prepared for her comeback from that abdominal injury, Mouratoglou said they have been working on confronting those moments when she feels her belief slipping and on figuring out ways to overcome them.

“You earn confidence with what you do every day in practice,” Mouratoglou said.

After two weeks of hard training, Osaka will try to bring that swagger to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells, Calif., this week.

In the interview, Mouratoglou, 54, said he expects nothing less from Osaka, a player he says comes to the court every day with an open mind and a hunger to try anything to get better.

GO DEEPER

Naomi Osaka and the gravity of a superstar at the U.S. Open

How is her injury feeling?

She has no pain anymore. We have been serving, but slowly and progressively. She’s done the work to try to make sure she does not get hurt again.

What is it like to work with players at her level? How does she compare with Serena Williams?

I don’t compare anyone to Serena. It is very exciting, because of her potential. She has the potential to win very many more Slams. Her motivation is very high. Tennis is a big priority and she is prepared to come back all the way.

How do you know if you are a good fit with her? 

I don’t know if it’s a good fit — all the players are different, and as a coach you need to adapt.

Is it any different when you are coaching a superstar rather than some of the players you have worked with who are not at that level?

It’s very important when you work with a superstar that you do the same as if the player is not a superstar. You need to talk to a person in a normal way, like she is a normal player. When they achieve so much they have certainties about what they do, but they have to be open enough to learn and continue to grow. That’s where Naomi is. She really wants to improve. She’s really taking the advice, and giving 100 percent. She is not scared. That’s the champion’s mindset.

It’s interesting you say that. I would have thought people who have won so much in the past think they know how to do it again. 

They are champions because they are doing what it takes to improve; their ability to trust the person working with them to tell them what to do and what it takes. That makes them champions.

Rafa (Nadal) and Novak (Djokovic), they went through so many technical changes. They see the sport as a race. Everybody is improving. That is how Serena was seeing the world. If you’re happy with what you have and don’t try new things, you will be overtaken by others. The progress comes from seeing which areas you can get better with.

Why is Osaka better now than she was last year?

Her confidence is much higher. This comes from what she has done at practice. She’s practising extremely well. She pushes herself. Her game has gained in consistency. A player has to be aware of how she is feeling, even if she feels she is losing confidence. Before, she didn’t express it to herself. Most of the matches, she lost because she stopped believing and this is not allowed.

We do practice matches. She is aware of what she is feeling. We talk about it. We work on it in the moment. It’s fine to have that feeling, it’s natural — there is no shame in being nervous. We just have to be aware of it. It can affect you but it can’t affect you too much — Novak gets super-nervous or angry, but the most important thing is the ability to come back very fast. Otherwise, you are losing points and points and points. You have the right to become nervous and lose confidence, but not too much and not for too long.

You don’t talk much during matches other than small messages of encouragement. Why?

There is not so much to say, unless I see she is not following the plan one way or another. The match, we prepare it before. The only thing I can do is to support her.

In the Muchova match in Melbourne, Muchova was playing great and Naomi was struggling to get to her level. I’ve seen that in the past year. I found out that when she was in trouble, her confidence level would drop a lot and the game was affected.

Her first tournament in China, she had lost 20 matches in a row when she had lost the first set. This time, she didn’t let what was happening on the court play with her mind.  It’s impossible not to be affected by the score. They need to be affected by the score. How much it affects you and does it affect you in a way that can harm you is the question. You want to be affected but stay under control. Keep believing in what you are doing.

Is that what she did against Muchova? 

She stayed mentally there. You don’t go away. Nobody plays perfectly from the first point to the last.

When you coached Serena, you went up against Osaka. Did you share your old game plans with her?

No. You don’t want to reinforce the spots that are weaker. I also don’t think you win by improving your mistakes so much. You prepare solutions, and you make your strong points better. If someone has a good game plan to beat Jannik Sinner, I would like to see it. Players at that level, you have to catch them on a certain day when there are weak spots.

I want my players to know how to turn their strengths into weapons: ‘What is my player’s game style and how do they win points?’.

So what are Osaka’s strengths at this point that should be her weapons?

When she is at the top of the game, she plays faster than anyone. She makes it very difficult to organize a point against her. She comes back to you with the ball in such a short time. When the ball touches the racket, it goes so fast to the other side of the net, and she can be very accurate with hitting her spots.

She also has big room for improvement. She can return better, be more aggressive on the second serve, take time away from the opponent better. The good thing is that she is extremely open to new ideas. I told her what I thought when I arrived and she told me she was very excited to get to work because she believed she was going to learn new things.

Is that what the best ones tell you?

Absolutely. They forget what they have achieved one minute after they achieve it. Serena finishes 2012 winning Wimbledon and the U.S. Open and the Olympics and the WTA Tour Finals. She’s walking off the court and tells me to come up with a plan for her to win the French Open. She says, “I’ve been chasing it for 10 years. I want to win Roland Garros, make a plan for me to win it.” (Williams won the 2013 French Open.)

The past is the past. It’s important not to look at the past. ‘Let’s move on. Always focus on the journey, where we want to go’. That’s Naomi right now. She’s very ambitious. She believes her story is still to be written. That’s important, because when you hold a trophy it only lasts a few minutes. You have to be excited about what’s next.

What has changed about tennis in recent years?

In general, the fitness level has improved a lot. It’s easy to explain. All of the top players travel with a fitness coach and physiotherapist. It was not true before. The movement of the players is so much better. On the women’s side, (Aryna) Sabalenka, for her height, is moving so well. And then Iga (Swiatek) and Coco (Gauff).

(Carlos) Alcaraz, Sinner, it’s crazy how they move on the court. Even someone like Tomas Machac. So it’s harder to hit winners, to get the ball through the court. If Naomi keeps evolving as she is, she will be able to hit as many winners again.

Naomi said she didn’t know if you would actually be a good coach, because you had coached Serena and she wondered whether Serena even needed coaching. Others sometimes question how much impact you have when you are coaching these all-time greats? How does that affect you? 

People who say that don’t know what they are talking about. If I coach Naomi and she doesn’t do something well, I’m going to hear about it. I take no special pride in coaching champions. For me, if I don’t bring her to her top level, I didn’t do a good job.

British tennis star Emma Raducanu said she was so distraught after seeing her stalker in the stands during last month that she didn't know if she would be able to finish the the match. 

The former U.S. Open champion spoke about the distressing incident at the Dubai Tennis Championships for the first time Wednesday, ahead of the Indian Wells in California, where she will return to play with enhanced security. 

“I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, ‘I don’t know how I’m going to finish’,” Raducanu told reporters, according to Sky News. “I literally couldn’t see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, ‘I need to just take a breather.’” 

The 22-year-old tennis player's distress was visible on camera after she spotted the man "fixated on her" during her opening match against Czech player Karolina Muchova.

She broke down in tears before approaching the umpire, where she appeared to be explaining the situation. She then hid behind the umpire’s chair while the man was escorted out by security.

When she resumed the match, she lost 7-6(6) 6-4 and took a week off before returning to the tour.

“It was a very emotional time,” Raducanu said.

“After the match, I did break down in tears, but not necessarily because I lost,” she said, adding, “There was just so much emotion in the last few weeks of the events happening, and I just needed that week off to take a breather and come here.”

Raducanu said the man had also been present during her previous matches in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha.

In Dubai, she was approached by the man twice off the court, including at the Aviation Club Tennis Centre the day before her match, the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) said in a statement.

Following the incident, Dubai Police said it had detained the “tourist” who “left [Raducanu] a note, took her photograph, and engaged in behavior that caused her distress.” 

The man signed a restraining order and agreed to keep his distance from her, it added, before he returned to her match the next day. 

Raducanu subsequently decided not to press charges against the man. The WTA said he had been banned from its tournaments in the future.

“The WTA is actively working with Emma and her team to ensure her well-being and provide any necessary support," the association said at the time.

It added, “Player safety is our top priority, and tournaments are advised on security best practices for international sporting events.” 

Following the incident, Raducanu thanked her fans for the “messages of support” in an Instagram story. 

“Difficult experience yesterday but I’ll be okay and proud of how I came back and competed despite what happened at the start of the match,” Raducanu wrote.

The incident in Dubai was not Raducanu’s first troubling encounter with a fan. In 2022, another man was charged with stalking and received a five-year restraining order after he showing up at the British tennis player’s home on three separate occasions and left her unwanted gifts and flowers.

Raducanu, who rose to fame after winning the 2021 U.S. Open at the age of 18, currently ranks 55 in the world rankings. 

She will next play against Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima in the first round of Indian Wells, with the winner to face off Coco Gauff in the third round.

“I wasn’t necessarily sure if I was going to come and compete so soon after what happened in Dubai but I’m glad I made the decision to come here," Raducanu said Wednesday, ahead of her next match.

“I feel a lot better,” she added.

At First Major Rally of the Semester, HOOP Protests Israeli Tanks in West Bank

In a weekend that featured dominant victories over Memphis and Quinnipiac, a packed Murr Center witnessed a three hour battle on Sunday afternoon as No. 11 Harvard fought past a talented and unrelenting No. 36 Middle Tennessee State squad, 4-2.

Featuring four intense three-set singles matches and a heroic effort from junior Melchior Delloye, razor-thin margins on deuce points ultimately propelled the Crimson to victory. The showdown between the perennial NCAA tournament contenders solidified the team’s standing as a force to be reckoned with as the outdoor season approaches.

Opening doubles action, junior Masato Perera and freshman Benjamin Privara, the 18th-ranked team in the nation, quickly struck first with a break of serve. However, their advantage wouldn’t last long as the Blue Raiders’ consistency and lack of unforced errors quickly gave their opponents a decisive 6-2 victory.

Just as the court one match was wrapping up, seniors Daniel Milavsky and David Lins — who jumped out to a lead with an early break of their own — held serve the entire set, securing a 6-4 victory.

As the Crimson evened up the tally at one, all eyes darted towards the third court, where things stood even at 4-4 between the junior tandem of Delloye and Valdemar Pape and Middle Tennessee’s Rostislav Halfinger and Shu Matsuoka.

Battling from a break down, the juniors overcame several unforced errors to score a break of their own. Returning serve at four games apiece, Pape blistered a down-the-line backhand past the net player, giving Harvard a 15-0 advantage as the crowd erupted. A string of high quality points featuring a balanced attack earned the Crimson a break, putting the match — and doubles point — on Pape’s racquet.

“We're two tall guys who have great serves,” said Delloye. “There's no reason why we can't  provide the goods in the tight moments.”

In his service game, Pape didn’t miss a beat. At 15 all, the Dane dialed up a flat ace down the T, inching the team towards the finish line. Two more unreturnable serves gave Harvard the edge it needed to secure the doubles point — its 11th on the season — as play shifted to singles.

In the second hour of the contest, things looked good for the Crimson as it won the first set of singles on courts one, two, four, and six.

Freshman Mitchell Lee, stepping into the court and dictating points with his inside-out and inside-in forehands, extended the lead to 2-0 as he closed out his match 6-2, 6-3.

Similarly, Milavsky pushed his opponent over with strong, overpowering forehands and a smooth touch at the net. The 21st-ranked singles player in the nation put Harvard just one point away from victory with a 7-6(6), 6-3 victory.

“He’s been an amazing senior captain,” said Head Coach Andrew Rueb ’95. “His maturity, his composure. I mean, he's really one of the top players in all of college tennis.”

The four remaining courts featured tight matches in which the players split the first two sets. All the Crimson needed was one domino to fall to secure its weekend sweep.

On court three, after battling back from behind a set, sophomore Rohan Murali fell victim to a controversial line call in the opening game, ultimately falling behind a break and dropping the set, narrowing the gap to 3-1. Similarly, the speedy Perera fell behind early in his deciding set and was unable to recover, falling to Matsuoka.

With the score standing at 3-2 in Harvard’s favor, Delloye and Pape found themselves in a similar situation: fighting to clinch the deciding point. As Pape started to fall behind in the third set, the coaches, fans, and players alike started to focus in on Delloye’s court, where the match would likely be decided.

“It was definitely a physical match, especially in the third set. We stepped up our game at the same time. In the first and second set, we were both serving well and coming to net and playing more attacking tennis,” said Delloye.

In back-and-forth rallies that often eclipsed 20 shots, Delloye utilized his precise down the line backhands to facilitate opportunities to be aggressive and approach the net. Controlling these points, he was able to hold serve throughout the set.

“We both were matching each other. So I just wanted to be a little bit more aggressive and hit a little bit harder, and commit to my game a little bit more than him,” added Delloye.

At 5-3 in the third, Delloye served for the match in comfortable form. The energized team cheered in celebration after every point that ended in the junior’s favor. Finally, as he clinched the match, the Murr Center’s dedicated fans gave the star of the match a long ovation.

The victory should provide confidence for the team as it prepares for its spring break swing in Southern California.

“You got to bring your A game, otherwise people will take it from you,” said Rueb. “Melchior’s finish there was spectacular.”

Now, the team shifts its focus to the outdoor tennis season and starts a road trip that includes a challenge against No. 7 University of San Diego.

Channing Tatum is reportedly "doing well" amid his rumored new romance months after his split from ex-fiancée Zoë Kravitz. 

Tatum recently sparked romance rumors after being seen with model Inka Williams in Los Angeles last month. On Tuesday (March 4), a source close to Tatum claimed to People that the 44-year-old Magic Mike star and the 25 year old were "seeing" each other "romantically," adding, "Channing's doing well. [Inka] makes him happy." 

The insider also addressed the nearly 20-year age gap between the pair, noting that the model "seems older" than her age.

"They met through friends. She's great," the source said. "She has her own life. She's young, but seems older."

Prior to his reported romance with Williams, Tatum was engaged to Kravitz. The pair were together for three years after meeting while filming her directorial debut Blink Twice before they called it quits in October 2024. 

In addition to his reported new relationship, Tatum has been spending "a lot of time" with his 11-year-old daughter Everly, whom he shares with ex-wife Jenna Dewan, after wrapping up filming in North Carolina and returning home to Los Angeles. His work will also see him reunite with Kravitz in the near future as they are both set to star in an upcoming film that was announced around the same time as their split.

"He's reuniting with Zoë later this spring for another movie project," the insider said. "It shouldn't be too awkward — they ended things on okay terms."

Millie Bobby Brown loves her husband Jake Bongiovi so much she got a sweet tribute inked in his honor.

The Stranger Things star debuted a tiny tattoo of what is seemingly her husband's initials on her ankle this week, putting the ink on display during a stylish stroll in London on Tuesday (March 4), per Page Six, which also shared photos of the body art. The ink, a subtle "JB" placed on the inside of her left ankle, could be seen through her sheer black tights that she paired with platform loafers, leopard print trench coat-style outfit, mini umbrella and pillbox hat. 

Brown and the 22-year-old son of rocker Jon Bon Jovi first got married in a "private ceremony" in May 2024 just over a year after getting engaged following three years of dating. They held a second intimate ceremony in Italy in October. 

Brown's newest ink joins her growing list of tattoos she has gotten over the past few years. She has a pair of delicate flowers inked on her back as well as the name "Ruth" on her ribcage in honor of her grandmother who passed away in 2020. She also has a small heart on her collarbone and the number "011" on her wrist, commemorating her breakout role as Eleven in Stranger Things. 

Earlier this week, the Enola Holmes star slammed haters constantly criticizing her looks, calling out the harmful "bullying" in a powerful message and refusing to "apologize for growing up."

Stuart Ashman, a friend who met the late Gene Hackman at Pilates classes, shared with Fox News Digital that the actor was very "fit." Video by Derek Shook for Fox News Digital.

While authorities continue to investigate the mysterious death of legendary actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, a misstep was found in the case. 

The dog that was found dead near Arakawa's body was misidentified by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Department in the investigation, Fox News Digital can confirm. 

The owner of the Santa Fe Tails, the pet care facility that took in Hackman’s two other surviving dogs, explained that the dead dog was a different breed than what is listed in the search warrant affidavit, obtained by Fox News Digital.

Hackman and his wife’s three dogs were named Zinna, Bear and Nikita.

"Zinna was a mutt … a mixed breed," Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails, shared with Fox News Digital. "Bear is the purebred German shepherd and Nikita's the shepherd mix."

"Our deputies, they don’t work with canines on a daily basis," she said, according to The Associated Press. 

Padilla told Fox News Digital that the shepherd mix appeared frightened by the mysterious events that unfolded surrounding their now-deceased owners.

"Nikita's the shepherd mix, and she was the one that was really terrified of what was going on when all of this was happening. She was really difficult," Padilla added.

While it is unclear how long the surviving dogs were left unattended, the pet care facility owner said the shepherd mix "was hungry," and their team attempted to give her treats. However, the dog did not immediately take the treats since there were "too many people" around. 

He continued to explain that the animal services "utilized a trap" for the shepherd mix and then the pet care facility picked up the dog.

Authorities have been searching for answers after the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa, whose partially mummified bodies were discovered on Feb. 26 at their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home.

Authorities did not perform a necropsy on Zinna, who was found in a kennel in a bathroom closet near Arakawa, the search warrant stated. Investigators initially noted the discovery of a "deceased brown in color German-Shepard canine."

Hackman and Arakawa may have died up to two weeks earlier, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said.

The Oscar-winning actor and his wife, a classical pianist, tested negative for carbon monoxide, according to the Santa Fe Sheriff's Department. Hackman likely died about nine days before his body was discovered by authorities.

According to a press release obtained by Fox News Digital Tuesday, the New Mexico Gas Company "confirmed it conducted an extensive investigation for gas leaks and carbon monoxide" Feb. 26 and made "no significant findings" at the couple's secluded home.

Detectives recovered two cellphones, two different prescriptions and a 2025 planner while inspecting the residence, according to the search warrant inventory list obtained by Fox News Digital.

While Hackman and Arakawa's bodies were found under what detectives are calling "suspicious" circumstances, officials confirmed no external trauma was seen on either Hackman or Arakawa and the case remains open pending autopsy and toxicology results.

The Wednesday layoffs account for roughly 6% of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks’ staff

ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks are laying off just under 200 employees, or roughly 6% of its staff, across news and entertainment starting on Wednesday, TheWrap has learned.

A majority of these cuts come from ABC News, where its employees are largely based in New York. 

In line with the changes, ABC News Studios, “20/20,” “Nightline” and “Impact x Nightline” now fall under one leadership structure. ABC News’ digital, editorial and social teams are similarly now integrated within the news gathering, shows and owned stations units.

Additionally, the “Good Morning America”-branded shows have been consolidated into one under Simone Swink, while Seni Tienabeso was named VP of ABC News Live.

TheWrap has reached out to Disney and ABC News for comment.

The ABC News layoffs are just the latest in a rocky start for media jobs in 2025. Scripps also underwent cuts this week, while Indiewire let go of three top editors last month, Forbes cut 5% of its staff in late January and Vox was recently hit by its third round of reductions in just two months. The Washington Post and the Huffington Post also let go of employees last month.

In October, Disney laid off about 75 employees from ABC News and its eight ABC Owned Television Stations in another effort to cut costs.

Oliver Darcy’s Status newsletter was first to report the cuts were taking place this week.

At one time, actor Stephen Collins seemed to have it all: fame, wealth and the undying love of legions of fans.

The handsome actor who starred as Jake Cutter in ABC’s adventure series, Tales of the Gold Monkey, and Diane Keaton’s wayward husband in the hit feature film, The First Wives Club, was perhaps best known for his role as wholesome pastor and dad Eric Camden on the WB series, 7th Heaven.

But in Hollywood, Calif., the land of make-believe and illusion, not everything is as it seems.

Collins’ picture-perfect world was turned upside down in 2012 when news broke that he was being investigated by police for allegedly sexually abusing underage girls.

The investigation came after a recording of Collins allegedly confessing his transgressions to a therapist was leaked to TMZ.

Collins made headlines again in 2014 when he released a lengthy statement to PEOPLE admitting he had inappropriate sexual conduct with three female minors over twenty years, from 1973 to 1994.

Shortly after, Collins told Katie Couric in an exclusive interview that aired on ABC News’ 20/20 that he was “absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted to children.”

Collins’ shocking fall from grace is detailed in Investigation Discovery’s new six-part series, Hollywood Demons.

ID/Investigation Discovery

Premiering Monday, March 24, from 9 to 11 p.m. ET/PT on ID and streaming on Max, the series features six mini-documentaries that pull back “the glamorous curtain of fame to expose the hidden struggles, sacrifices and scandals of life in the spotlight,” according to an ID press release.

“Each gripping two-hour episode features accounts from Hollywood insiders, project collaborators, and survivors who endured harrowing abuse and struggles,” ID says in its release. (The trailer is exclusively debuted below.)

Addiction specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky and culture writer Scaachi Koul share their perspectives on each scandal.

“The majority of people don’t know the true story,” former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills castmate Taylor Armstrong says in the trailer.

The two-hour premiere, Stephen Collins: America’s Dad, tells the story of Collins and other stars who are “far from” the characters they play, according to ID.

The episode includes a shocking, tell-all interview with one of Collins’ alleged victims and with 7th Heaven cast members including Jeremy London, who open up about how they felt when they learned about the accusations.Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Covering some of Hollywood’s biggest scandals, the series includes an episode called "Child Stars Gone Violent," premiering March 31, about the “path of crime, addiction and violence” that ensued for some young celebrities once their moment in the spotlight had faded.

Former child actors Brian Bonsall of Family Ties and Dee Jay Daniels of The Hughleys open up about “the harsh reality of life after fame,” according to ID.

Episodes to follow are: "The Dark Side of the Power Rangers," premiering Monday, April 7; "Housewives Gone Bad," premiering Monday, April 14; "The Real Iron Claw," premiering Monday April 21; and "Stalking the Stars," premiering on Monday, April 28.

Each episode airs from 9 to 11 p.m. ET on ID/Investigation Discovery and will be available to stream on Max starting March 24.

Actress Neetu Chandra filed a PIL in Patna High Court requesting the government to impose a complete ban on vulgar Bhojpuri and Hindi songs.

On the occasion of International Women's Day, the National Award-winning actress said, 'Vulgar Bhojpuri and Hindi songs are not leaving the girls and women going to school and college in Bihar and they are forced to walk on the road with their eyes down. Due to these songs, women do not even like to watch TV at home. Many singers singing such songs have gained fame today, which can become an obstacle in the development of society and country.'

She further added, 'When girls or women will not be able to walk safely on the road, then will they be able to think about development. If a government can bring a law to ban liquor in its state to save women from drunken husbands, then can it not ban these vulgar songs for school-college going girls and women. I want there should be a complete ban on the production and playing of these songs in Bihar.'

She even said that these songs create a feeling of insecurity in women and can hurt small children. These songs can take society in the wrong direction and reduce respect for women. She even appealed to the people of Bihar to strongly oppose these songs and said that a case should be registered against the singers who sing such songs. A PIL has been filed in Patna High Court today, which has been led by Senior Advocate Nivedita Nirvikar. The PIL has been filed in Patna High Court today by Shashi Priya. 'Women should never make the mistake of treating anyone as an object because insulting a woman has always resulted in painful consequences,' read the PIL.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of 'My Mother and I,' discusses how the Duchess of Sussex isn't going to be welcomed back across the pond anytime soon following her royal exit.

There is "no comparison" between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, according to one royal expert.  

On Tuesday, the same day that Markle's new lifestyle series premiered, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams noted to Fox News Digital that Princess Kate and husband Prince William's popularity is "very high."

Meanwhile, Markle has a 21% approval rating, another British royals expert, Hilary Fordwich, told Fox News Digital, citing a recent YouGov poll in Britain, adding that the Princess of Wales is "Britain's most popular living royal."

"With Love, Meghan," premiered on Netflix on Tuesday and includes the Duchess of Sussex in the kitchen and garden with friends and celebrities.

"Princess Catherine actually is a beekeeper," Fordwich said, referencing Markle’s beekeeping segment shown in a preview for "With Love, Meghan." "Her bees are at Anmer Hall, in the corner of the gardens on the Sandringham estate. Instead of monetizing her real hobby, back in the summer of ’21, she actually took honey from the hives whilst visiting schoolchildren attending the biodiversity hub at London’s Natural History Museum."

Fordwich said that everything Middleton "does is to help others, those mentally challenged, the less privileged, the disadvantaged, the young, as well as those suffering from cancer, to name a few causes."

"She never belittles others, whereas this Netflix show is actually denigrating to those less fortunate," Fordwich opined.

She added that, to her, Markle is "not only doing everything for money, she is seeking more fame and self-aggrandizement," whereas Middleton and her husband, Prince William, do everything "without fanfare."

In December 2018, William and Kate flew on a Royal Mail flight that was loaded with cards and presents from the families of those serving at a Royal Air Force base in Cyprus, Fordwich mentioned.

"Also, a few years ago, they enjoyed a fake snowball fight at the palace's temporary Orangery cafe, played games and helped children make Christmas cards and treats," she said. "Supported by the Royal British Legion in recognition of the sacrifices serving personnel and their families make year-round, and especially when they are separated during the festive period, again without public fanfare. This is what is really comforting versus jars of bath salts."

"Meghan married for titles and prestige," Fordwich added. "Catherine married in spite of the title and prestige."

"Meghan married for titles and prestige. Catherine married in spite of the title and prestige."

She said that while the duchess "claimed she felt unsafe and needed privacy and a quiet life," her family bought a house near bustling Los Angeles and hired three public relations firms and multiple publicists.

"Princess Catherine has never been involved in any legal issues or lawsuits," she continued. "She is genuine, honest and true. She is devoted to her children, so doesn’t use them to monetize projects. She lives her life in spite of the media and paparazzi."

Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner disagreed. 

"The beauty of Meghan is she is very precise with all the intricate ingredients and presentation and, obviously, with the usual Netflix styling the show looks immaculate," he said, adding, "I am a self-confessed Meghan fan and for me the show works."

Pelham Turner called it a "shame there is such a chasm with King Charles," noting that the longtime environmentalist "would like the show content, especially using the homeopathic herbs from the garden."

He added that the royal family would be "fools" not to watch Markle’s show because "royal members like Meghan show how [a] 21st century monarchy can be."

Fordwich said that with the royal family, it’s important to note what they don’t say compared to what they do say when it comes to Markle’s show.

"The Royal family's social media accounts issuing a tribute today" to Sophie, the Duchess of Edinburgh "regarding her steadfastness and loyalty to King Charles is extremely noteworthy both timing and content wise," she explained. "By covering her latest outing with her visiting British troops whilst wearing army camouflage gear just hours after [Markle] released her Netflix show is majorly significant."
