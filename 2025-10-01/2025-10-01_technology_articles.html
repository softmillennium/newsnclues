                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thinking Machines Lab, a heavily funded startup cofounded by prominent researchers from OpenAI, has revealed its first product—a tool called Tinker that automates the creation of custom frontier AI models. “We believe [Tinker] will help empower researchers and developers to experiment with models, and will make frontier capabilities much more accessible to all people,” says Mira Murati, cofounder and CEO of Thinking Machines, in an interview with WIRED ahead of the announcement. Big companies and academic labs already fine-tune open source AI models to create new variants that are optimized for specific tasks, like solving math problems, drafting legal agreements, or answering medical questions. Thinking Machines Lab is helmed by researchers who played a core role in the creation of ChatGPT. Tinker currently allows users to fine-tune two open source models: Meta's Llama and Alibaba's Qwen. Users can write a few lines of code to tap into the Tinker API and start fine-tuning through supervised learning, which means adjusting the model with labeled data, or through reinforcement learning, an increasingly popular method for tuning models by giving them positive or negative feedback based on their outputs. Users can then download their fine-tuned model and run it wherever they want. She briefly served as OpenAI's CEO after the board ousted Sam Altman in late 2023. Murati cofounded Thinking Machines Lab with a handful of other OpenAI veterans, including John Schulman, an OpenAI cofounder; Barret Zoph, the ex-vice president of research; Lilian Weng, who worked on safety and robotics research; Andrew Tulloch, who worked on pretraining and reasoning; and Luke Metz, a post-training specialist. Schulman led work on fine tuning the large language model that powers ChatGPT through reinforcement learning. Input from human testers provides a reward signal that makes the model much better (although not perfect) at holding coherent conversations, answering questions without going off track, and avoiding undesirable behaviors. He claims Tinker will make it easier for more people to coax new abilities out of big models by leveraging reinforcement learning and other training tricks. “There's a bunch of secret magic, but we give people full control over the training loop,” Schulman tells WIRED. Thinking Machines Lab will let users apply for access to Tinker starting on Wednesday. The API has been made available to some beta users already, including Eric Gan, a researcher at Redwood Research, a company focused on the risks posed by AI models, who says he is using Tinker's reinforcement learning functionality to tune models to write backdoors in code. Gan says Tinker has made it possible to coax capabilities out of a model that simply wouldn't be revealed using an API. “Tinker is definitely much simpler than doing the RL from scratch,” Gan notes, adding: “RL is especially good for if you have a very specialized task and existing models aren't capable of doing it.” Another beta tester, Robert Nishihara, the CEO of Anyscale, a company that supplies technology for managing large-scale AI projects, says that while other fine-tuning tools like VERL and SkyRL already exist, Tinker offers a remarkable mix of abstraction and tunability. A lingering fear around open source models is that they can be downloaded and modified in nefarious ways. Thinking Machines currently vets those who get access to its API but Schulman says the company will eventually introduce automated systems to guard against misuse. Tinker might be Thinking Machines Lab's first product, but the company has already been publishing fundamental research on model training, including advances on maintaining the performance of neural networks and fine-tuning large language models more efficiently, which it leverages behind the scenes for tools like Tinker. The company's plan to open up the process of tuning big models also shows a commitment to openness at a time when most US AI companies keep their best models closed and accessible only through an API. China currently has more open source frontier AI models than the US, and these models are being used by many companies and researchers around the world. Murati says she hopes that Tinker will help reverse the trend of commercial AI models becoming increasingly closed. “If you consider what's being done in frontier labs and what other smart people in the world of academia, they're sort of diverging more and more,” she says. “And that's not great if you think about how these powerful systems are coming into the world.” In your inbox: Our biggest stories, handpicked for you each day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PC Game Pass subscribers drew the short straw. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Microsoft is significantly restructuring its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, and whether these changes are viewed as beneficial or detrimental depends on individual perspectives. The reality of the situation is that gamers will face a price increase of up to 50% for Game Pass Ultimate and roughly 38% for PC Game Pass plans. It appears that the company aims to maintain this tradition, as it has announced a price increase from $19.99 to $29.99, a 50% increase, effective immediately. Microsoft has expanded the access of Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to over 400 titles, including offerings from Fortnite Crew (valued at $11.99 per month) and Ubisoft+ Classics (approximately $15.98 per month). Enthusiasts of the former will also benefit from access to the Fortnite Battle Pass and receive 1,000 V-Bucks each month starting November 18. Additionally, subscribers will have access to over 75 launch day titles annually, featuring high-profile releases such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, High on Life 2, Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and The Outer Worlds 2. As part of the Xbox Game Pass revamp, Ultimate subscribers are now able to earn up to $100 per year (100,000 points worldwide) simply by gaming. Microsoft emphasizes a 30% increase in value on selected Game Pass titles, along with fourfold points on purchases of games and add-ons, a 10% return in points on select Game Pass library titles and add-ons, and discounts of up to 20% on select Game Pass games. However, logically, the highest-paying customers of Game Pass are granted priority access and experience the shortest wait times. Among the new benefits are access to over 200 games and unlimited use of Xbox Cloud Gaming. Premium subscribers have the opportunity to earn up to $50 per year, which is half the potential amount of Ultimate subscribers. Subscribers within this tier now have access to over 50 games, doubling the number available under the previous Core subscription.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I am out of office for the foreseeable future because Senate Democrats voted to block a clean federal spending bill (HR 5371), leading to a government shutdown that is preventing the US Small Business Administration from serving America's 36 million small businesses. Every day that Senate Democrats continue [to] oppose a clean funding bill, they are stopping an estimated 320 small businesses from accessing $170 million in SBA-guaranteed funding.” “It feels like coerced speech where the government is forcing employees to spread its propaganda in communicating with the public,” says Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. SBA did not respond to a request for comment (and none of its press team members appear to have used the suggested out-of-office reply template). Employees at other government agencies received more standard out-of-office directives. At the US Department of Agriculture, the out-of-office template states that employees are “on furlough without access to email, due to the lapse in federal government funding” and refers readers to USA.gov for further information. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, employees were instructed to set an out-of-office message that reads, “The federal government's spending authority expired at 11:59 on Tuesday, September 30, 2025, therefore, most HUD programs have been temporarily interrupted, and most HUD employees have been told they cannot work…We regret any inconvenience the government lapse of appropriations may cause.” “You can't click anything without these annoying pop-ups. HUD did not respond to a request for comment. Department of Justice websites are not currently regularly updated.” The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the US Senate due to unrelated policy demands.” “The tone of the language is very antagonistic and partisan in a way we don't expect from formal messaging from agency leaders,” says Moynihan. “If you had a federal employee who emailed their colleagues blaming president Trump for the shut down, they'd be pursued for a Hatch Act violation and probably fired in the meantime.” In a memo posted on X that appeared to be sent to the heads of executive departments and agencies, Russell Vought, the head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), alleged that the government was shutting down due to “insane policy demands” from Democrats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is naming one of the company's top executives to an even bigger role, and redefining his own job in a new effort to capitalize on the AI revolution. Judson Althoff, a 12-year Microsoft executive who has spent nine years leading the company's commercial sales organization, will take on the newly created position of CEO of its commercial business. He will oversee a reformulated commercial team that includes engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance leaders representing more than 75% of Microsoft's revenue. It also shows Nadella's intent to delegate much of Microsoft's day-to-day commercial execution, giving him more time to work with the company's engineers on its long-term technology ambitions. “This isn't just evolution, it's reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft,” Nadella wrote in an email to employees Wednesday outlining the changes and summing up the moment. Microsoft has grappled with a public cybersecurity crisis, internal turmoil from widespread layoffs, and growing scrutiny over the role of its technology in international conflicts. It's also spending unprecedented sums on AI infrastructure and seeing its overall business reach new heights in the stock market. Nadella has been at Microsoft for 33 of its 50 years, including 11 as CEO. He said Althoff's expanded role positions Microsoft to accelerate growth while strengthening its standing as the “partner of choice for AI transformation.” Althoff is an Ohio native who joined Microsoft in March 2013, after holding senior sales positions at Oracle and EMC. In his role as Microsoft EVP and chief commercial officer, he has been responsible for the sales strategy and revenue growth of the company's commercial business. Nadella outlined other internal reporting changes as part of the new structure: Microsoft's commercial businesses — spanning Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics, LinkedIn, and related services — generated about $220 billion of the company's $282 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025, according to the company's most recent annual report. Here is the full text of Nadella's email, as made public by Microsoft. We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both. Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Instead of actual tested and packaged DRAM chips or HBM stacks, the companies will supply Stargate undiced wafers, according to Bloomberg, which highlights the vast volumes of memory and other components that Stargate needs. For now, it looks like Stargate could consume nearly half of global DRAM output. Both Samsung and SK Hynix confirmed that OpenAI's anticipated demand could grow to 900,000 DRAM wafers monthly, which is an incredible volume that may represent around 40% of total DRAM output. DRAM capacity — which includes both commodity DDR5 and LPDDR4/LPDDR5 as well as premium HBM, and specialty DRAM types — accounted for a 22% share (2.07 million WSPM) in 2024. Analysts predict that DRAM capacity could grow by 8.7% in 2025 to around 2.25 million WSPM, which means that Stargate plans to consume 40% of it. Stargate — controlled by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank — aims to build multiple huge AI data centers globally. These facilities will require an enormous number of servers (each containing hundreds, if not thousands, of chips, including state-of-the-art compute GPUs like Nvidia's Blackwell), cooling equipment, and power delivery equipment. In addition, these data centers could even require dedicated power plants to feed them. As a result, Stargate executives, such as OpenAI's Sam Altman, are touring around the world to secure strategic supply contracts and partnerships, including those across the Asia-Pacific region. In addition to the memory wafer supply deal, Samsung companies are mulling other wide-ranging partnerships with OpenAI. The company will also offer consulting and integration services for businesses aiming to incorporate OpenAI's models into internal systems. Additionally, Samsung SDS has secured a reseller role for OpenAI services in South Korea and plans to help local firms adopt ChatGPT Enterprise. Samsung C&T and Samsung Heavy Industries will work with OpenAI to develop floating data centers that improve cooling efficiency and cut emissions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chukwudi Iwuji addresses those Man of Tomorrow rumors. Plus, does the MCU have big plans for two X-Men villains? THR reports Jeremy Irons will play a second major villain in Chad Stahelski's Highlander remake. Details on his character are not available at this time. The Russo brothers have released a new, shadowy set picture from filming, featuring Joe Russo sitting surrounded by various bits of stage equipment, alongside the caption “Look hard…”. According to Variety, Lana Parilla will star in Synthetic, a “sci-fi thriller” from comic book writers Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing. Directed by Oliver Ridge, the story is “set in the near future, where a retired soldier's isolated existence is shattered when a runaway female android seeks refuge on his farm, sparking an unexpected bond that forces them to fight for their survival and for each other.” Parrilla's character is described as “the ruthless proprietor of a shadowy electronic brothel whose obsession sets her on a relentless pursuit.” Colin Farrell revealed he has “an even smaller role” as the Penguin in The Batman, Part II, than he had in the first movie in a new interview with THR. I've got an even smaller role in this one. But it's deeper, scarier, the stakes are bigger. 3 and Evil star Chukwudi Iwuji addressed rumors he's in the running to play Brainiac in Man of Tomorrow. If James picked up the phone and called me, absolutely. You're like the 12th person that's mentioned it. The ‘no' I said is just to let everyone know James hasn't…this isn't me lying to you. But this is not lying to you at all. There has to be something maniacal about the Joker, right? But ‘maniacal' has such a huge range,” [What] moved me most [about Heath Ledger's version] was when you realize that he keeps making up a story about his father each time. And when I asked myself, ‘Well, why would you do that?' Again, that loneliness and that he's covering up with this flamboyant thing, but he keeps making up a story about his father. I just feel there's so much richness about sadness with the Joker. And when you're so laser-focused on your inner turmoil, the things you could do to other people without even it counting is very scary. Speaking with Deadline, James Gunn revealed “someone who is a really good creator… talked to [him] the other day” about his planned Authority movie. However, Gunn suggested it's far more likely to become a TV series due to the team's relative obscurity. I'm probably not going to do certain movies with characters who (audiences) don't know; it's harder to get people in the theater for that kind of thing. A new rumor from entertainment insider Daniel Richtman (via CBR) alleges Mr. Sinister and Apocalypse will feature as the main villains of the MCU's “next saga,” likely following their introduction in the X-Men movie. Richtman also has word Deadpool will star in “his own mutant team-up movie” around that time as the MCU continues to promote its X-Men characters. THR reports Zach Galifianakis, Dolly Wells, Spencer House, Nikki Crawford, Kumail Nanjiani, and Cary Elwes will star in the Very Young Frankenstein pilot at FX.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A consortium of top U.S. cancer centers has developed an AI platform that trains models on clinical data from multiple institutions while protecting patient privacy, with the goal of cutting the timeline for new discoveries in cancer research from years to months. Officials with the Cancer AI Alliance (CAIA), led by Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, say the approach will help researchers identify patterns across larger and more diverse patient populations than any single institution would have access to on its own. The alliance, announced a year ago, also includes Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Johns Hopkins University, with support from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Deloitte, Slalom, NVIDIA, and Seattle's Allen Institute for AI (Ai2). “Literally, 10 minutes back, we were able to get to a result that nobody has seen ever before … because nobody has been able to run that analysis across four cancer centers' data,” said Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, an Ai2 research scientist, in an interview Monday afternoon. Members of the alliance spent much of the past year building a system that allows AI to learn from data spread across institutions without pooling patient records in a central database. The system is a federated learning platform: models are trained locally on de-identified data inside each institution's firewalls, and only summaries of those learnings are shared. “It cannot be overstated how momentous it is that we came together to launch this platform in just one year, and we did it as a unified alliance with a shared mission to eradicate cancer,” said Brian M. Bot of Fred Hutch, director of the CAIA strategic coordinating center, in a news release. The Seattle-based institute is officially launching DataVoyager this week as part of its broader Asta platform for scientific research. The Ai2 tool works as an AI agent, allowing scientists to ask questions of the data in plain language and receive clear answers backed by reproducible code and visualizations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI is leaving few stones unturned in the race to build compute capacity for its AI efforts. The ChatGPT maker on Wednesday said it had struck agreements with two of the world's biggest manufacturers of memory chips, Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, to make DRAM wafers for the Stargate AI infrastructure project, and build data centers in South Korea. The companies signed the letters of intent following a meeting in Seoul between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, South Korea's president Lee Jae-myung, Samsung Electronics' executive chairman Jay Y. Lee, and SK chairman Chey Tae-won. SK Group noted in a separate statement that this would be more than double the current industry capacity for high-bandwidth memory chips. Just a couple of weeks ago, Nvidia said it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as part of a deal that would give the ChatGPT maker access to more than 10 gigawatts of compute capacity via Nvidia's AI training systems. The following day, OpenAI said it would build out five data centers with SoftBank and Oracle for the Stargate project, aiming to increase its total compute capacity to 7 gigawatts. OpenAI said it is also working with the Korean Ministry of Science and ICT to find opportunities to build AI data centers outside Seoul, and that it had struck a separate deal with SK Telecom to build an AI data center. The AI company also signed a few other agreements with Samsung subsidiaries to explore avenues for building more data centers in the country.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hot on the heels of Amazon's own Ring and Blink security camera blitz, Google is announcing new Nest cameras with its Gemini AI chatbot as the main selling point in addition to improved image quality. Thankfully, there are only three new Nest products, and they're relatively easy to understand, unlike Amazon's entire lineup, which may require a PhD to figure out the differences between each model. See onn Wired Indoor Security Cam at Walmart I prefer my security cameras to blend into the walls and ceilings, but if you've ever wanted a bright, berry-colored camera watching you from above, now you can live out your wildest dreams. On the hardware front, all three Nest cameras boast 2K-resolution image sensors with HDR. With older Nest cameras and the doorbell, they could only send notifications alerting you to motion or sound, but with Gemini, Google says users will be able to get more specific notifications that describe what's happening. For example, if a delivery person comes by your door to drop off a package, Gemini should send a notification describing their clothing and might even get as specific as telling you which delivery service they may be from if it can see a uniform logo or truck in the background. At home, with the Nest Indoor Camera and Outdoor Camera, Gemini could send a notification telling you that your cat knocked over a glass vase or perhaps your child named John (you need to allow face recognition) was playing in the backyard at 4 p.m. instead of doing his homework like you asked him to. Gemini also has a feature called “Ask Home,” which combines computer vision from the cameras and natural language processing to find specific clips instead of you having to scrub frame by frame, through hours of footage. There are some additional quality-of-life improvements for springing for the new cameras, including “Home Brief” (summary of hours of footage), the ability to zoom in a crop the field of view to focus on only one area for monitoring, and six hours of free event video history (up from three hours). All of these features are accessible in the redesigned Google Home app that's simpler, faster, and more stable. It's only a matter of time before the Nest app is phased out sometime in the future, so don't get too attached. I've not seen any of the new Nest Cameras in action, so I can't say with what degree of accuracy Gemini is able to recognize people, vehicles, animals, packages, and other objects within footage in and around the home. But I'm hella interested in seeing how well the Ask Home feature works. I'd love to know which one of my two cats knocked over certain things in my apartment while I was at the office. The new Nest smart home products are feature-packed, but if you have a tighter budget—like a lot tighter—you may want to consider some of Walmart's new Onn-branded devices like the $23 Indoor Camera Wired and the $50 Video Doorbell Wired. These aren't comparable to the Nest Indoor Camera and Nest Doorbell—they only record 1080p, and the field of view isn't as wide—but it does provide a more basic security camera system that integrates nicely with the new Google Home app. If you want the Gemini features like intelligent alerts and event history, you'll need to pony up for a Google Home Premium subscription, which is split into Standard ($10) and Advanced ($20) plans.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly took a quiet trip to Taiwan this week to hold meetings with representatives of TSMC and Foxconn and discuss collaborating on chip design and manufacturing, as well as AI server infrastructure development, according to Digitimes. Although not announced by any of the involved companies or Altman himself, there's no denying he's in the region, as it was confirmed just one day later, Wednesday, September 30, that Altman had been in South Korea meeting with President Lee Jae Myung. The alleged meetings in Taiwan were arguably more important, however. Although Altman and OpenAI have been doing deals around the world to build out AI infrastructure, it needs many hundreds of thousands of chips to do it with, and TSMC and Foxconn are set to be major suppliers. TSMC is the world's largest and most advanced chip design and manufacturing company, while Foxconn is the largest supplier for Oracle, the cloud computing company that OpenAI has struck a deal worth $300 billion for compute power. Foxconn is an integral partner with Japanese investment vehicle Softbank, which is also heavily invested in OpenAI and a range of its data center projects. Altman's meetings with TSMC and Foxconn, if real and fruitful, likely further entrenched their cooperation on scaling up OpenAI's global AI infrastructure, as well as gaining deeper insight into TSMC's planned advanced process nodes for future chip designs. Another area likely discussed, and potentially more impactful for the future, is OpenAI's own chip design ambitions. Alongside China and other countries and companies, OpenAI wants to untether itself from being so reliant on Nvidia moving forward, so it is developing its own AI application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for AI inference. OpenAI reportedly formed an ASIC design team in 2024 and is alleged to be working with Broadcom to develop a custom AI chip on TSMC's advanced 3nm process. Combining high bandwidth memory and advanced packaging technologies, OpenAI's bespoke hardware is expected to enter mass production in Q3 2026, following a recent delay.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited and highly anticipated monster movie, Frankenstein, is coming to theaters in a few short weeks before its debut on Netflix on November 7. Now, as we get closer and closer to the release, Netflix has released a full trailer for the film, showing the epic scope of del Toro's vision. Written and directed by the Oscar-winning filmmaker behind Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, and Hellboy, Frankenstein stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein, “a brilliant but egotistical scientist who brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creation.” Jacob Elordi plays that creature, and they're joined by Mia Goth, Felix Kammerer, David Bradley, Lars Mikkelsen, and Christian Convery, with Charles Dance and Christoph Waltz. It's an incredible cast, an even better filmmaker, and now, it's got a new trailer. Wonderful cinematography, haunting music, lovely costumes, terrifying makeup work, the works. What is slightly worrying is that as the film has played the festival circuit (it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month, for example), buzz has been good, but not great. As of publication, it's sitting at 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is certainly solid, but probably a little underwhelming for the combination of del Toro and Frankenstein. Of note, though, the film has yet to screen for critics who didn't see it at a festival, and there's a good chance that number goes up. And while many fans will do their best to see the film early in theaters, most people are going to see it on Netflix. It's his first film for a streamer, and his movies aren't ones you can half-watch. What did you think of the trailer? Are you going to see it in theaters?

The fourth season of the hit fantasy series, with Hemsworth stepping in for Henry Cavill, arrives October 30 on Netflix.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The command word remains, “Hey Google,” but now it'll activate Gemini. Nearly 10 years ago, Google Assistant was the company's answer to Amazon's Alexa. It kick-started a voice assistant war, but after a period of stagnation, these chatbots have been revived with the advent of large language models. You can talk to them more conversationally without being restricted by rigid commands, which marks a step-change in how we interact with voice assistants in the home. Along with Gemini's infusion, the Google Home app is getting a redesign to make use of its new capabilities, and there are new devices as well: a Google Home Speaker ($100), Nest Cam Indoor 2K ($100), Nest Cam Outdoor 2K ($150), and Nest Doorbell 2K ($180). Walmart is also partnering with Google to offer an uber-cheap indoor camera and doorbell with its Onn brand, both of which can be added directly via the Google Home app. These products are available for purchase today, though the Google Home Speaker launches early 2026. Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa are really great at telling you the weather, but they're not quite as proactive as we wanted them to be. “As we think about this next era, the vision is still very much the same—to give people a partner in their home that can act as an extension of them to do things for them and make their lives a little better, and Gemini is well-positioned to do that.” And it's not just for you, it has to be designed for everyone in the home, whether that's a spouse, visiting parents, guests, or kids. You can also continue talking to Gemini about a topic, and it will understand the context, so you don't have to keep repeating the subject matter. The answers it delivers are richer, and you won't get routed to Google Search results as much. Whereas Amazon says the fastest way for you to access Alexa+ is by buying one of the new Echo devices it announced yesterday, Google is prioritizing existing devices first. (Support doesn't include third-party devices like Lenovo's smart displays, which Google stopped updating in 2023.) That's because Gemini Live has a few hardware dependencies, like better microphones and background noise suppression. However, Kattukaran says adding actions to Live is on the roadmap. Gemini is also able to handle complex automations for you, plus chained commands. And routines are as easy as just asking it to repeat an action every night; no need to fuss with a routine tool. You're even able to ask data about home device usage consumption, like “How many hours of TV did I watch this weekend?” (Maybe don't answer that.) If your Google Home ecosystem is powered by security cameras, they'll now get richer notifications. Instead of “Person seen,” Gemini can be far more descriptive. This influx of more precise information is also summarized every evening via a feature called Home Brief in the Home app (more on this below). However, some of these new capabilities are locked behind a subscription. Gone is the Nest Aware subscription in favor of a new service called Google Home Premium, and there are two plans to choose from. Redesigned and simplified, the new Google Home app consists of three tabs with a persistent header search bar, called Ask Home, that you can use to find what you're looking for: The Google Home app has seen a host of small improvements over the last few months to enhance stability and polish. However, Google says with this new update, you can expect to see 70 percent faster startup with the app and 80 percent fewer crashes. You now get preview images from the last event before the live view loads, the ability to swipe between timeline and events, double-tap to fast forward or rewind, and better notifications with a static thumbnail expandable to a large animated preview. Google says the merger of features and devices from the old Nest app is now complete, and folks should be able to transition seamlessly, though the legacy app won't be disappearing yet. All of them jump from 1080p to 2K resolution, and retain the same high frame rate (30 fps) and HDR support as the previous generation. This resolution bump enables you to zoom in on details like car license plates, but it also provides far more data for Gemini to analyze and interpret (more on that in a moment). They have bigger sensors for more accurate detection, come in a variety of new colors, and they have a special resin coating that guards against UV discoloration (the outdoor cameras are IP65-rated). To ensure you get the complete picture of what's happening at your front door, this video doorbell has an enhanced field of view (from 152 degrees to 166 degrees) and switches to a 1:1 aspect ratio. All of the new cameras feature 6X digital zoom. The new wired Nest Doorbell is only available in the US and Canada for now, and comes in Snow, Hazel, or Linen. The Nest Cam Indoor is available in a wide variety of markets, including the US, UK, and Japan, and comes in Snow, Hazel, or a bright red Berry, but those last two colors are US-only. The Nest Cam Outdoor is widely available and comes in Snow or Hazel (US-only), and you can snag a two-pack of the Nest Cam Outdoor for $250. Kattukaran says there's a shift in interior design from muted colors to brighter tones and pops of color, so the company wanted to offer a bold option. It's very uncommon to see a red security camera! You will need a fairly strong signal to stream in 2K (at least 3.3 Mbps). With the addition of Gemini AI on the software side, your notifications about a person or package being detected are going to get a whole lot more descriptive. Gemini can watch the footage and determine that FedEx dropped off a package or tell you when your kids got home. You can even get a home brief at the end of the day that presents a kind of highlight reel, and you can tweak that brief to focus on your kids or pets or whatever you want. But many of these features require a subscription. Each of the new Nest cameras comes with six hours of event history in 10-second video clips for free, but if you want to unlock the AI capabilities, you'll have to stump up for one of the new Google Home Premium subscription plans. Google is also partnering with third parties on more Gemini for Home-compatible devices that will work in the Google Home app. There hasn't been a Google Home smart speaker since the Nest Audio in 2020, but that's finally changing with the aptly named Google Home Speaker. It costs $100, and while the audio quality may not be as up to par as the larger Nest Audio, this device has a snazzy, round design made from a 3D knit recycled yarn that isn't too different from the new Echo Dot Max. There's an expressive light strip around the base to indicate when Gemini is listening or talking, and you get 360 audio from this little orb. Naturally, it can be grouped with other Nest speakers for stereo sound or multiroom music. There's also a physical toggle to mute the microphone. It has been a rocky road for Google's smart home platform over the last few years, with a clunky transition from the Nest app, missing features, and a lack of polish in the Home app. Today's announcements are a crucial step forward for its smart home ambitions, especially since the home voice assistant wars seem to be picking back up where they left off.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's similar to how Google offers its own flagship Android devices with its Pixel line but allows other companies that make products compatible with Google's platform to build their own Android smartphones with different form factors and price points. “We're going to build flagship hardware in certain categories where we think there's a lot of room to showcase innovation and push the boundaries of what's possible with Gemini,” said Anish Kattukaran, Chief Product Officer at Google Home and Nest, in a press briefing ahead of Wednesday's announcement. “And then we're going to complement that with the second part, which is, we don't think that Gemini should be constrained to one set of devices from one OEM, at one set of price points that may make it accessible or inaccessible to a certain group of people,” he said. It also teased an upgraded version of its Google Home speaker, due out in spring 2026, and a low-cost camera and doorbell sold in partnership with Walmart. However, the company decided to first bring Gemini to its existing device owners, provided they have certain hardware capabilities like sufficient processing power. Those devices are connected through the company's Google Home Cloud-to-Cloud APIs and the smart home standard Matter, an industry protocol that allows devices from different manufacturers to work together. Meanwhile, Google is offering its “Works with Google Home” partners a toolkit for building AI cameras, a new reference hardware design, recommendations about System on Chips (SoCs, the main processors that power smart devices), a new Google Camera embedded SDK, and more. With Gemini, the idea is to offer AI-powered devices that you can converse with in more natural ways, whether that's interrupting or adding details after an initial inquiry, or asking more complex questions. For instance, if you said, “Play that song from that movie with Ben Affleck where he's on a rocket and going off to like an asteroid or something,” the device could play an Aerosmith song from the movie “Armageddon.” As it streams the music, you could ask what the lyrics mean, and when it finishes, you could ask for other songs with a similar theme. In terms of household coordination, Gemini will be able to handle things like calendars, lists, timers, reminders, and other things that make your life easier at home. For instance, instead of telling the smart speaker to add individual recipe ingredients to a shopping list, you could just tell it you want to make “vegetarian pad thai,” and Gemini may respond with something like, “For how many people?” If you don't have a shopping list started, it will then make one for you with the right amount of ingredients. Another example is that instead of asking the smart device to set a timer for a particular period of time, you could tell it, “I'm boiling eggs, can you set a timer?” Gemini might then ask if you want a hard boil or soft boil, then set the timer based on your response. Plus, users won't have to remember the names of their various smart home devices anymore. Gemini will also help more people take advantage of more complex features, like preset routines that control multiple devices automatically, or better understand their energy use by asking questions. If they're what you wanted, Gemini can set it up. All this is controlled via a redesigned version of the Google Home app, which is now faster, more stable, and powered by Gemini AI. In addition to AI-powered features, you can also chat in a free-flowing conversation with Gemini Live by saying to your smart device, “Hey Google, let's chat.” This will start a back-and-forth conversation where you don't have to preface your requests by saying “Hey Google” again and again. This allows you to have a more natural chat, where you can ask complex questions, brainstorm with an AI partner, have the AI come up with creative ideas, and more. “I'm so bullish on this experience becoming the de facto thing,” he says. “Between having a more conversational assistant, Gemini Live, the access to endless information and creativity, ‘Ask Home' — all of these converging together — is really this foundation that we're setting in place,” says Kattukaran. “We're starting to deliver on this promise of a home that can actually see, hear, understand, and ultimately act on your behalf to make your life a little bit easier in smaller ways, so you can go and spend time on the things that you actually care about.” The Google Home app update is rolling out in early access today. The Nest and Walmart devices are now becoming available, but Google's new Home speaker launches in spring 2026. Specs for manufacturers are available through the Google Home developers site.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enterprise giant Salesforce is looking to ride the vibe coding wave — where developers describe what they want in natural language and AI agents write the code — with its new AI-powered developer tool. Salesforce announced its new vibe coding offering, Agentforce Vibes, on Wednesday. This new coding tool helps developers work autonomously on Salesforce apps and agents by handling much of the technical implementation automatically. This new tool includes an autonomous AI coding agent named Vibe Codey. Dan Fernandez, the vice president of product for developer services at Salesforce, told TechCrunch that Agentforce Vibes being connected to a company's existing Salesforce account gives enterprises the best of both worlds. “So rather than having to spend a bunch of time on setting up [model context protocols — systems that let AI models securely communicate with external tools and data], setting up a dev environment, setting up tools, everything's prebuilt and ready for you, including AI requests to get started. And that really is sort of a differentiator on how we're lowering the barrier to entry.” This isn't Salesforce's first foray into vibe coding, Fernandez said, but rather the latest addition to its suite of AI developer tools. Salesforce first released an AI-powered code building tool back in 2023. These new capabilities are built on a fork from open source AI coding agent Cline's Visual Studio Code Extension. Fernandez said the company tried a lot of different open source coding tools before deciding to go with Cline partially due to its strong support of MCP, or the ability for AI models to securely communicate with external tools and data. This release comes at an interesting time for the vibe coding industry. Many vibe coding startups are continuing to raise large funding rounds at eye-watering valuations from investors. Vibe coding startup Lovable, for example, is allegedly turning down unsolicited funding offers from investors after garnering a $1.8 billion valuation just eight months after launching. Vibe coding startup Anything recently claimed to hit $2 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) just two weeks after launching. Due to the sheer volume of large language model usage required to run these platforms, costs for these companies are high and resulting margins are tight, TechCrunch reported in August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is not only streaming NBA games for the first time this season — it's also aiming to establish a new data-driven way to understand the sport. The league on Wednesday announced a new multi-year partnership with Amazon Web Services on Wednesday that includes “NBA Inside the Game,” a new basketball intelligence platform fueled by AI. The platform, built on AWS' AI infrastructure alongside billions of data points, will enable new statistics such as “Defensive Box Score,” which uses AI to assign responsibility and measure individual defensive impact. The partnership will also roll out “Play Finder,” a tool that lets broadcasters and fans search thousands of games for similar plays. “The reason we do these deals is to let us tell highly technical stories in really accessible ways,” Souza told GeekWire. The partnership highlights Amazon's dual role in sports: distributing games through Prime Video while embedding its technology deeper into leagues' data and operations. Later this month, Amazon Prime Video will kick off new 11-year NBA rights deal, with 67 games streaming globally each season. “NBA on Prime” is a significant addition to Amazon's sports streaming catalog, which includes the NFL's “Thursday Night Football” as well as live action from MLB, NASCAR, and Premier League soccer.
