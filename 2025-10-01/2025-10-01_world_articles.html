                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. The government of Israel has hired a new conservative-aligned firm, Clock Tower X LLC, to create media for Gen Z audiences in a contract worth $6 million. At least 80 percent of content Clock Tower produces will be “tailored to Gen Z audiences across platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, podcasts, and other relevant digital and broadcast outlets” with a minimum goal of 50 million impressions per month. Clock Tower will even deploy “websites and content to deliver GPT framing results on GPT conversations.” In other words, Clock Tower will create new websites to influence how AI GPT models such as ChatGPT, which are trained on vast amounts of data from every corner of the internet, frame topics and respond to them — all on behalf of Israel. As part of this work, the firm will also use search engine optimization software MarketBrew AI, a predictive AI platform that helps clients adapt to algorithms and promote their work on search engines like Google and Bing, to “improve the visibility and ranking of relevant narratives.” Clock Tower will integrate its pro-Israel messaging into Salem Media Network properties, a conservative Christian media group that boasts a vast radio network and produces high-profile shows such as the Hugh Hewitt Show, the Larry Elder Show, and the Right View with Lara Trump. Salem Media Network did not respond to a question clarifying whether it would be compensated by Clock Tower for promoting messages on behalf of Israel, or how these messages would be integrated. Clock Tower's work will be targeting a sector of the American populace that has broken sharply from its support for Israel. A July Gallup poll found that only 9% of Americans aged 18-34 support Israel's military action in Gaza. Other polls show Israel's favorability falling more generally among the American public. Clock Tower will also complete an “initial cultural, demographic, and sentiment research report” for Israel within 30 days. Another American firm, Stagwell Global, recently conducted a similar survey for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. While the findings were far more favorable to Israel than other surveys, the poll, which was leaked to Drop Site, still found that a 47% of Americans believed that Israel is committing genocide. In a meeting with pro-Israel influencers on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained that social media is the most important weapon Israel has at its disposal. Clock Tower is not the only American firm Havas has subcontracted as part of its work. Earlier this month, Sludge reported that Havas had hired Democratic-aligned public relations firm SKDKnickerbocker on a $600,000 contract to run a bot farm promoting pro-Israel narratives on social media. Clock Tower drafted a contract on August 27, two days before SKDK deregistered its work for Israel. In a statement to Politico, a spokesperson for SKDK declined to explain why the firm ended its work for Israel, simply stating that the work “had run its course.” SKDK, Havas, and an associate of Clock Tower did not respond to requests for comment on this article.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jane Goodall, whose lifelong work as a primatologist helped broaden the world's understanding of animal behavior and emotions, has died, her institute said Wednesday. Her field studies with chimpanzees not only broke barriers for women and changed the way scientists study animals, but documented emotions and personality traits within these primates that blurred the line between humans and the animal kingdom. Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” the institute said in a statement on social media. The United Nations, which named her a Messenger of Peace in 2002, mourned her death, said on X she “worked tirelessly for our planet and all its inhabitants, leaving an extraordinary legacy for humanity and nature.” There, the 26-year-old who had long been fascinated with Africa and its animals – but had no formal higher education – began her groundbreaking work observing and studying these intellectual primates in their natural habitat. “They'd never seen a white ape before,” Goodall told Deepak Chopra in 2019. After following David through the forest, she offered him a palm nut. Living among the chimpanzees in Gombe, Goodall discovered that chimps ate meat and not only used tools – but made them too. “That was object modification, the crude beginning of tool making – it had never been seen before.” This young Briton, who was pursuing her Ph.D in animal behavior despite not having an undergraduate degree, spent months ingratiating herself with the local chimpanzee population, instead of studying them at arm's length. She gave them names and learned to read their emotions. Goodall's discoveries and her methodology caused quite a stir within academic and scientific circles:  Crawling through the forest to study chimpanzees that she named instead of numbered, documenting their personalities and feelings — this shocked her fellow ethologists. “My observations at Gombe would challenge human uniqueness,” Goodall said. “There were some who tried to discredit my observations because I was a young, untrained girl and should therefore be disregarded.” Goodall was one of three women selected by Leakey to study primates in their natural habitat as part of his effort to better understand human evolution. The world would learn about Goodall and her work in 1963 after her first article appeared in National Geographic titled “My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees.” Leakey secured a grant from the National Geographic Society for Goodall to continue her work, and in 1962, National Geographic sent filmmaker Baron Hugo van Lawick to Gombe to document Jane's work with the chimpanzees. Goodall earned her doctorate in ethology – the study of animal behavior – from Cambridge University in 1965, and that same year she and van Lawick established the Gombe Stream Research Center. “It was really exciting, I can still remember meeting cows and pigs and sheep face to face,” Goodall recalled in 2019 on Chopra's Infinite Potential podcast. At the farm, she wandered off to an empty henhouse where she waited patiently to observe a hen laying an egg. “Mom had been desperately looking for me, nobody knew where I was, they'd called the police,” Goodall said. Goodall spent much of her childhood outside, at the top of her favorite tree reading “in my own private world … daydreaming about life in the forest with Tarzan.” She never wavered from her dream and, as a young woman, she worked and “saved every penny I could” to travel to Africa. “Everybody laughed at me because I was just a girl, we didn't have any money (and) World War Two was raging,” she recalled. She was always encouraged by her mother, who told her to “work hard, take advantage of opportunity, but above all, never give up.” Jane Goodall's original mission in Gombe was to learn everything she could about chimpanzees – humans' closest living relatives – in the hopes that their behavior “might provide us with a window on our past,” she said. “Chimpanzees learn by observing … but (humans) can with words discuss the past and tell stories about it, and perhaps make use of it. Chimpanzees can certainly make plans for the immediate future – but we can make plans for what we're going to do 10 years ahead.” Jane Goodall is world-famous for her work with chimpanzees. Today, the Jane Goodall Institute that she founded in 1977 devotes a huge portion of its efforts to wildlife conservation, working closely with Gombe National Park's surrounding communities to advance human prospects and guard its natural treasures. Goodall showed no signs of slowing down in her 80s, traveling some 300 days a year to meet with world leaders about climate change, visit conservation projects, and support her Roots & Shoots youth environmental program. “Our too close relationship with wild animals in the markets or when we use them for entertainment has unleashed the terror and misery of new viruses,” she said on Anderson Cooper Full Circle. When asked what she thought her legacy should be, Goodall told CNN's Becky Anderson that she hoped it would be “giving young people hope and … a sense of empowerment.” CNN's Thomas Page and Olivia Yasukawa contributed to this report</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeland Security's Kristi Noem mentioned plans to build similar immigration jails in Arizona, Nebraska, and Louisiana. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Rivas Velásquez suffered a severe medical incident on August 5 — captured in real time through a phone call from another detainee that we shared publicly with consent given — and collapsed and lost consciousness. He was left in this state for about seven minutes until guards, who failed to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation properly, finally dragged him away to the nearest hospital, about two hours away. The Florida Division of Emergency Management, which administers “Alligator Alcatraz,” would not answer questions from Velásquez's family, lawyer, or the media about his condition while he was hospitalized. After days of anguish, the family was finally told through a statement by DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin that Rivas Velásquez was, in fact, alive and hospitalized. Those detained in this migrant jail have effectively been administratively disappeared, and fail to show up in any federal or state public database. Rivas Velásquez's story and many others like it show that since “Alligator Alcatraz” opened on July 1, it has been operating as an extrajudicial black site. A recent Miami Herald report highlights what the organization I work for, the Florida Immigrant Coalition, and others have been warning about since this site began operating: that those detained in this migrant jail have effectively been administratively disappeared, and fail to show up in any federal or state public database. In an attempt to evade the National Environmental Policy Act process, Florida essentially cut ties with the federal government and DHS/ICE, and it has been running “Alligator Alcatraz” as a completely state-run facility through the Florida Division of Emergency Management. The fact that it's completely state-run has been repeatedly stressed by lawyers representing Florida in the environmental lawsuit filed in federal court. This effort by Florida to distance itself from the federal government has manifested in its refusal to sign federal legal agreements that would give the Florida Division of Emergency Management the authority to detain immigrants at “Alligator Alcatraz.” These agreements, like 287(G) or IGSA contracts, would clarify which entity has legal custody of people jailed at “Alligator Alcatraz” and would help inform legal processes for detainees. Two federal judges have so far requested that state and federal governments produce these legal agreements to clarify jurisdiction and administrative responsibilities over immigration detention at the Everglades detention camp. One request was prompted by the previously mentioned environmental lawsuit, and the other by a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups alleging that the people jailed at “Alligator Alcatraz,” whom they represent, have not been afforded due process. They argue their constitutional rights are systemically violated, as the lack of a process and jurisdictional clarity denies them access to legal counsel, while also being held without formal charges, and stripped of bond hearings following the cancellation of immigration court proceedings. This state-run, extrajudicial model for immigration jails is threatening to proliferate not just in Florida but across the U.S. Working with family members whose loved ones were trapped at “Alligator Alcatraz,” we encountered numerous cases of people being held there for over a month, in some cases nearly two months, without having the opportunity to meet with their lawyers, nor with immigration officers or judges. People detained at the immigration jail said their arrival dates were being falsified, reportedly altered when their wristbands were scanned, to hide the fact they've been held longer than the 14-day legal limit without a specific action, like a custody transfer or case review, being taken after an ICE detainer was issued against them. It serves to deny due process and legal recourse to people jailed at “Alligator Alcatraz.” We have seen hundreds of people jailed at “Alligator Alcatraz” who don't appear on the ICE locator tool; people are being deported before scheduled bond hearings; and the Miami Herald reports that DeSantis is lying when he claims that everyone detained at “Alligator Alcatraz” has final orders of removal, meaning that an immigration order has ruled that an individual must leave the United States. Moreover, the complete lack of acknowledgement and communication with families when a loved one is hospitalized, which happens with frequency, is both unacceptable from a moral standpoint and puts the people who are trapped in the jail at further medical risk. This state-run, extrajudicial model for immigration jails is threatening to proliferate not just in Florida but across the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said “Alligator Alcatraz” is a model for state-run detention centers moving forward, detailing plans to build more facilities by commandeering airports and facilities across the country, with sites reportedly under consideration in Arizona, Nebraska, Louisiana, and Florida. DeSantis has already opened a new migrant jail in North Florida dubbed “Deportation Depot,” which sits at the previously closed and now recommissioned Baker Correctional Institution. Public numbers say there are currently around 250 detainees held at the jail, but sources I have spoken to put the number closer to 400. A third facility near Pensacola is in the works, dubbed “Panhandle Pokey” by state officials. This is not the only method to award no-bid contracts, however, as the Florida Division of Emergency Management also has an extensive list of pre-approved vendors that allows disbursement without a competitive process. Hefty political donations often preceded the disbursement of these multimillion-dollar contracts; for instance, IRG Global Emergency Management Inc., a Texas-based emergency management company, donated $10,000 to the Republican Party of Florida and, within days, received a $1.1 million contract to provide “operational support services” at “Alligator Alcatraz.” The company would also be awarded two more contracts, totaling $5.1 million. According to procurement records reported by journalist Jason Garcia, Florida's state government has awarded more than $350 million in contracts to companies connected with “Alligator Alcatraz,” and the DeSantis administration has already admitted in court that $218 million has been spent on the migrant jail's operation. Just one obscure but connected company from Jacksonville scored a whopping $78 million contract to provide a range of different services at the site, including staffing, training, and security. The human impact is enormous, as detainees and their families are living through a nightmare, struggling to navigate what immigration attorneys described to the Miami Herald as “an alternate system where the normal rules don't apply.” In further display of the many conflicts of interest plaguing the state of Florida and its immigration detention framework, a new report published by Prism details how Judge Barbara Lagoa, who issued a stay reopening Alligator Alcatraz after an injunction temporarily shut down the site, is married to Paul Huck, partner at one of Florida's most politically connected conservative law firms, earning millions from contracts tied to the state's legal battles. Judicial ethics rules suggest that judges recuse themselves when their spouses' financial interests could be affected by a ruling. What's happening in Florida needs to be restated clearly: We are seeing the proliferation of extrajudicial black sites, where people are administratively disappeared. This erosion of due process is now systemic and pervasive across the country, part of a much larger assault on constitutional rights being waged by the Trump administration, not just against immigrants but against all citizens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German police arrested three suspected Hamas members who were allegedly procuring weapons “for assassinations targeting Israeli or Jewish institutions,” German prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday. The three accused, who police only identified by first names and initials of their last names, were charged with membership in a foreign terrorist organization and preparing an act of violence endangering the state. The suspects were arrested in Berlin and are scheduled to appear before a judge on Thursday. Two of the accused are German and the third was born in Lebanon. “Since at least the summer of 2025,” prosecutors claim in their statement, the three “have been involved in procuring firearms and ammunition” for Hamas. During the arrests, prosecutors say, police found “various weapons, including an AK 47 assault rifle and several pistols, and a considerable amount of ammunition.” Hamas denied any connection to the suspects in a statement on Wednesday, calling the allegations that they are members “baseless.” The militant group claimed further that it “limits its struggle” to Israel and the Palestinian territories. Police have arrested suspected members of Hamas in Germany before. In December 2023, German and Dutch law enforcement arrested four people accused of plotting to attack Jewish institutions in Europe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mette Frederiksen tells EU leaders all countries are affected by ‘Russian hybrid war' via drones or sabotage Mette Frederiksen is hosting EU leaders in Copenhagen for talks on aiding Ukraine and firming up European defence projects intended to ensure the continent is ready to deter invaders by 2030. Urging unity, Frederiksen said all European countries were affected by the “Russian hybrid war”, whether through drone incursions or sabotage. “I hope that everybody recognises now that there is a hybrid war, and one day it's Poland, the other day it's Denmark, and next week it will probably be somewhere else that we see sabotage or … drones flying,” she told reporters on Wednesday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who expressed solidarity with Denmark over recent drone incursions, struck a more restrained note: “We have to be strong to deter any aggressions, but we have to remain above all very cautious and avoid any escalation.” Macron said it was “a very good thing” France was investigating an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's shadow fleet, but did not confirm a reported link between the vessel and drones over Denmark. In the run-up to two European summits this week, including a broader gathering of leaders on Thursday, Danish authorities closed airspace to civilian drones, after a spate of unidentified aircraft were spotted at airports. In March, von der Leyen chose to flesh out her €800bn (£700bn) defence spending plan at the Royal Danish Military Academy in Copenhagen, where she endorsed the 2030 goal. In a paper to European capitals before Wednesday's meeting, the commission said the EU needed to pursue two plans with “special urgency”: a “drone wall” to detect, track and shoot down such aircraft and a broader system to defend the EU's eastern borders – on land, in the air and at sea – known as eastern flank watch. EU member states were urged to agree these broad plans by late October, as well as two other big joint projects, missile defences and a space “shield”. But leaders are divided over a €140bn reparations loan for Ukraine based on Russia's frozen assets. “When assets are frozen, one has to respect international law,” Macron said on Wednesday, voicing his agreement with Belgium's prime minister, Bart De Wever, who has said he is concerned his country could be left alone with the risk. “Taking Putin's money and leaving the risks with us: that is not going to happen,” De Wever told local media last week. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, a longtime supporter of using Russia's frozen assets to aid Ukraine, said her team wanted to move as fast as possible but acknowledged that not all member states supported the plan.</p>

A Pakistani restaurant has become one of the latest to leave the struggling San Francisco Centre mall, where dwindling visitors and major store departures have left the 1.5 million-square-foot mall practically vacant.

Mashaallah Halal Pakistani Food, run by owners Mohammad and Rabia Waqar, shut its doors after three years in the food court, joining Sarku Japan, which departed on Sept. 25, and Charley's Philly Steaks, which is set to close this week. The moves leave just two restaurants—Panda Express and Shake Shack—in the once bustling mall's food court.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. government partially suspended operations Wednesday in a dispute over health care funding as opposition Democrats remained determined to obstruct President Donald Trump's agenda and fight back against cuts to social spending. The shutdown will see 750,000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay and a range of government services either closed or scaled back. Many of these shutdowns have lasted just a few days, with the longest stretching for more than a month in 2018 and 2019 during Mr. Trump's first term. This time, Democrats have refused to let a budget pass unless Mr. Trump's Republicans agree to extend tax credits for people purchasing subsidized health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Democrats are also demanding that Republicans reverse a nearly US$800-billion cut to Medicaid passed earlier this year as part of Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Once implemented, that cut is expected to take health care away from nearly eight million people. Although Republicans control both houses of Congress, they need Democratic help to reach the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of 100 seats. The governing party has said that they will only negotiate over Obamacare tax credits after the funding legislation has passed. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune accused “far-left Democrats” of shutting down the government out of personal animus against Mr. Trump after a last-ditch effort to keep the money flowing with a short-term spending bill failed in the Senate late Tuesday. He said Democrats had voted for such short-term measures in previous Congresses. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that, unlike on previous budget legislation, Republicans had refused to negotiate. “Republicans are plunging America into a shutdown, rejecting bipartisan talks, pushing a partisan bill and risking America's health care,” he said. Layne Morrison, left, and Courtney Creek, who were let go from their jobs with the Education Department and a USAID funded grant respectively, on Capitol Hill during a rally with former federal employees, on Tuesday.Jacquelyn Martin/The Associated Press If the shutdown goes on for weeks, it could include more drastic consequences as government programs use up monetary reserves. In the 2018 to 2019 shutdown, for instance, the program that provides food stamps for tens of millions of poor Americans nearly ran out of money, as did another program that provided subsidized housing vouchers. Essential workers, such as border guards and the military, will keep working but will not be paid during the shutdown. In March, Mr. Schumer earned the ire of some Democrats for voting for a Republican funding bill that avoided a government shutdown. Mr. Trump, for his part, has accused Democrats of being too lenient with the undocumented people he wants to deport. “It's a disgusting video and we are going to make clear: bigotry will get you nowhere. Mr. Trump then posted to Truth Social a doctored version of this MSNBC video as well, featuring himself playing mariachi music behind Mr. Jeffries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The parliamentary elections in Moldova are not just a disgrace but another "global defeat for the West," with everything in the country being purged systematically, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik radio. I see and read various assessments of the elections. I believe this is a global defeat of the West. Zakharova emphasized that "everything was done so openly in a dictatorial fashion that no one can prove otherwise." It's a failure, another Western setback, which, like in Romania, will go down in the history of Western policy," she added. The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman noted that such policies cannot exist if we are talking about democracy based on law. "If we're talking about democracy under liberal dictatorship, then this is exactly how it happens, there's no other way. The information space is being cleared, the political space is being purged, punitive measures are introduced, persecutions begin—from harassment to, let's say, imprisoning people who are promoting their own agenda, not a foreign one, not an illegal one, but their own, which they consider necessary. This is what they are persecuted for, to the point of being entirely eliminated," Zakharova said. She compared the persecution of the Moldovan opposition to how former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was treated in France. "I absolutely don't consider him an angel, close to that political current, this is not about that. This is real persecution," Zakharova said, noting that in terms of persecuting the opposition, France is "more inventive," while in Moldova "the same scheme is applied outright, to the point of absolute banality." First, they put a piece of cheese called democracy, excited people, told them they could actively participate in civil society, that they needed to be active in politics," the diplomat emphasized. "When people inside the country, believing in this so-called European course, started participating, they were caught. And they were caught according to a single principle because this mousetrap is standardized—7 years for everyone (referring to the 7-year imprisonment of Gagauzia's head Evgenia Gutsul and the 7.5-year sentence handed to a former member of the Parliament of Moldova Marina Tauber—TASS note)." Parliamentary elections were held in Moldova on September 28. The opposition has already expressed disagreement with the results and plans to challenge them due to numerous violations of voters' rights, while Moldovan authorities considered these violations minor.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A relative of Paula Callejas (pictured on cell phone), a Canadian woman who was detained by ICE for nearly five months, told The Globe they did not receive adequate consular support while she was in custody.Sammy Kogan/Supplied Canadians seeking consular support from the federal government say they are struggling to obtain information on family members in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and facing imminent deportation, records obtained by The Globe and Mail show. E-mails and messages to a Canadian consular assistance hotline obtained under freedom of information laws show details of some cases in which Canadians were unable to locate family members in detention because of communication issues with U.S. officials. “I'm trying to locate a family member that was detained by US customs and been moved from prison to prison,” reads one message. As of late August, more than 61,000 people were in ICE detention, surpassing the levels set in Mr. Trump's first term and raising significant concerns over detention conditions and due process. Sixteen people have died in ICE custody this year, including Johnny Noviello, a 49-year-old Canadian whose June death is under FBI investigation. Canadian Johnny Noviello is one of the 16 people who have died in ICE custody this year. One hotline message from a concerned family member said their brother is a Canadian citizen and former dissident in his country of origin who was detained by ICE in the United States. The message said ICE officials “repeatedly pressured” him to sign deportation papers that would have resulted in him being sent to a country “where he faces certain persecution and likely execution for his political beliefs.” “Terrified for his life, he has begged to be sent anywhere else,” the message reads. His health has deteriorated so severely that I fear he may not survive much longer.” In several online conversations reviewed by The Globe, a Global Affairs Canada live agent told the person seeking assistance to call a phone number for the department's Emergency Watch and Response Centre, a 24/7 contact point for Canadians in need of urgent consular assistance. A relative of Paula Callejas, a Canadian woman who was detained by ICE for nearly five months, told The Globe they did not receive adequate consular support while she was in custody. Ms. Callejas had been living in Florida on a work visa when she was arrested after an altercation with her then-boyfriend.Paula Callejas/The Canadian Press Ms. Callejas, a 45-year-old swimwear designer, had been living in Florida on a work visa when she was arrested after an altercation with her then-boyfriend. County court records from the March 29 incident indicate that police took statements from Ms. Callejas and her then-boyfriend, and observed that the man had physical injuries while Ms. Callejas did not. Based on this and the statements, Ms. Callejas was placed under arrest for battery. A relative of Ms. Callejas said her immigration status was precarious at the time because she was seeking a visa extension that had not yet been granted. The family posted a $2,000 bond on April 18, expecting Ms. Callejas to be released from police custody, but she was immediately rearrested under a controversial program that bestows local law-enforcement officers with the power to carry out some immigration enforcement duties, ICE data obtained by The Globe show. The relative said they finally received an e-mail from a consular official, but it did nothing to assuage their concerns about Ms. Callejas's access to due process. On one occasion, a consular official did engage with Ms. Callejas's file, attempting to facilitate the return of crayons that had been confiscated from her Arizona cell, the relative said. Global Affairs Canada did not respond directly to questions about Ms. Callejas's consular file, citing privacy concerns. “The Government of Canada cannot intervene on behalf of Canadians who do not meet entry or exit requirements for the United States,” she said. “Subject has been held in the detention centre for about a month and informs that he was ‘forced' to sign deportation papers,” reads one e-mail from an operations officer with Global Affairs Canada's Emergency Watch and Response Centre.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SANAM VAKIL is Director of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Program. Why Washington Will Rue the Costs of Israeli Aggression Israel's war in Gaza, its expansionist military policies, and its revisionist posture are reshaping the region in ways that few anticipated. But rather than consolidate Israeli power or improve relations with Arab states that have long been wary of Iran and its proxies, these actions are backfiring. States that once regarded Israel as a potential partner, including the Gulf monarchies, now perceive it as a dangerous and unpredictable actor. But its prospects are dim as long as Israel continues to behave aggressively and ignores the legitimate demands and concerns of Palestinians. Before the October 2023 attacks, Israel, with strong American backing, had hoped to remake the region to its advantage, casting itself as a partner for Arab governments while sidelining rivals, notably Iran. Now, Israel has only isolated itself, made Arab states reluctant to stomach the reputational and political costs of working with it, and turned former partners into wary adversaries. Many countries in the region are responding to Israeli aggression by diversifying their security partnerships, investing in their own autonomy, and moving away from normalization with Israel. Unstinting American support for Israel is undermining Washington's standing in the region. If Washington refuses to rein in Israel and does not search for a just political answer to the Palestinian question, it risks weakening ties with key regional partners and losing influence over the emerging regional order. Failing to address the issue of Palestine and allowing Israel to behave aggressively with impunity will also fuel a new wave of radicalism that will threaten U.S. interests, regional stability, and global security. For more than two decades, Israel had been able to make common cause with a number of Arab countries. The peace between the two countries has held for nearly four decades, even though significant connections and exchanges at a deeper societal level have failed to materialize. Until recently, Egypt viewed Turkey as its primary rival in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey strongly supported him and opposed the coup that brought Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to power. As a result, Egypt under Sisi cut bilateral deals with Israel and worked with Israel inside the East Mediterranean Gas Forum, a regional organization that coordinates energy development to encourage the joint exploration of offshore gas reserves. Beyond energy cooperation, Egypt has also deepened its security coordination with Israel in the Sinai desert, allowing Israeli strikes against militant groups there and helping manage the Gaza border. Israel's campaigns have forced Cairo to take a different position. He also took the symbolic step of downgrading security cooperation with Israel. Egypt and its erstwhile rival Turkey undertook a joint naval drill in the eastern Mediterranean, aiming to deepen their defense cooperation. Before the current war, certain Gulf states tentatively aligned with Israel because they regarded Iran as the paramount threat to their security. The devastating war in Gaza, the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank (often justified with religious rhetoric), Israel's uncompromising approach in Lebanon, and its repeated strikes in Syria and encroachment into Syrian territory, have turned the maintenance of formal ties with Israel into a political and strategic liability for Arab governments. Indeed, Israeli actions have provoked such outrage across the Arab world that any form of visible alignment with Israel has become a direct threat to the legitimacy and security of regimes. According to an analysis of recent surveys by the research group Arab Barometer, public backing for normalization with Israel remains extremely low across the region, with no country exceeding 13 percent support and Morocco dropping from 31 percent in 2022 to just 13 percent in 2023 after the October 7 attacks. Saudi Arabia, once under intense American pressure to normalize relations with Israel, now hesitates not only because of domestic risks but also because of doubts over Israel's reliability as a strategic partner, given the range of aggressive Israeli actions in recent years. After Israel's strike on Hamas negotiators in Doha, Qatar has positioned itself as the principal Arab critic of Israeli policy in Gaza. Kuwait and Oman remain aloof and wary of being drawn into any association with Israel that could undermine the domestic legitimacy of their governments, antagonize their publics, or complicate their careful regional balancing strategies. Israel, for its part, did not overtly seek to antagonize Turkey in geopolitical and security matters. Israeli President Isaac Herzog paid an official visit to Ankara in 2022, and only weeks before October 7, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, exploring potential energy cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey has suspended trade with and closed its airspace to Israel as punishment for the campaign in Gaza. Israeli actions in Syria have also deeply alarmed Turkey: its longest land border is with Syria, and millions of refugees have crossed into Turkey since the eruption of the Syrian civil war over a decade ago. Israel, by contrast, has been supporting minority groups in southern Syria, as well as advancing into Syrian territory, undermining the country's new government and promoting division and instability. States are drawing lessons from these two years of conflict, including the poor performance of Russian weaponry in the conflict between Iran and Israel and the political and security constraints that come with reliance on American weapons systems. Governments are hedging by investing in domestic capabilities and diversifying their suppliers. Saudi Arabia has expanded cooperation with China on missiles and drones, sought to further localize defense production, and recently signed a defense cooperation pact with Pakistan signaling its desire for alternative security partnerships and intent to build ties with a fellow Muslim power outside the U.S.-led security architecture. The United Arab Emirates has purchased French fighter jets and partnered with South Korea on missile defense and nuclear energy, strengthening its technological capacities while reducing its dependence on the United States. For its part, Turkey unveiled its Steel Dome integrated air defense system in August, comparable to Israel's Iron Dome system of antimissile defense—suggesting a doctrinal shift in which Turkish planners now feel obliged to measure their capacities against Israel's. This widening network of partnerships leaves shrinking space for Israel. Israeli policy has made the very subject toxic, turning normalization into a domestic and strategic risk for Arab leaders and their governments. Qatar is a mediator between Israel and Hamas, as well as a close American ally hosting the largest U.S. base in the region. The attack undermined not only Qatar but also American prestige and credibility: from that episode, Gulf rulers have taken the lesson that Israel is unpredictable and aggressive—and American security guarantees are unreliable. As a result, they will seek diversified relations with other powers and expanded investment in homegrown defense industries. These developments will create new alignments that could reshape the region. Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two of the most significant regional powers, will likely cooperate more closely. Although they were previously rivals in many regional hot spots, including in Libya, the two now share concerns about regional instability and Israel's disruptive role. Indeed, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has called for the establishment of a joint security platform with regional states, notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Both Erdogan and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia must manage domestic political costs from the Gazan war. Erdogan faced mounting public anger over continued trade with Israel, which Ankara has since suspended, and pressure from Islamist and conservative constituencies to take a harder line; Mohammed faces criticism within his kingdom and in the wider Arab world for having even considered normalization with Israel. Both must also contend with the prospect of further conflict between Israel and Iran. Saudi Arabia and Turkey will have to tread carefully. For Saudi Arabia, that means continuing the cautious détente with Iran that was launched with Chinese mediation in 2023, reducing escalation risks in Yemen and the Gulf. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey are seeking to ensure that they can counter Iran without making it feel cornered, since a cornered Iran could double down on asymmetric tactics and create new crises. For the United States, these dynamics demand a reevaluation of strategy. Continued unconditional support for Israel undermines American influence and reinforces perceptions that Washington sees the region solely through the prism of Israeli interests. Regional elites are already hedging by cultivating China, Europe, Russia, and other powers. This trend will only accelerate as long as the United States blithely backs Israel and ignores the attending collateral damage to its own relations with other regional countries. That would be a sharp departure from its recent track record of encouraging the militarization of the region and bloc politics.
