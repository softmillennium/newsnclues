                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$21M in Bitcoin and Other Crypto Stolen From Japanese Miner SBI, Says Blockchain Sleuth He added that the funds were moved to "instant exchanges" or laundered through coin mixer Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a coin mixing app that allows users to hide their Ethereum transactions. The U.S. Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies globally have alleged that North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus Group had used the app to launder stolen funds. Investigators have linked Lazarus to the Bybit exploit and a number of other incidents. The group typically tries to hide stolen funds through decentralized exchanges and obfuscating apps. ZachXBT wrote on Telegram that "several indicators share similarities to other known Democratic People's Republic of Korea attacks." He added that SBI Crypto had yet to publicly disclose the incident. Decrypt reached out to SBI Crypto but did not immediately receive a response. The company's crypto arm, SBI VC Trade, last year agreed to take control of Bitcoin exchange DMM Bitcoin's customer assets and accounts following a $308 million hack.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent webinar from Shufti Pro sees the UK firm digging into the age assurance question, exploring how platforms can comply with age verification mandates without compromising privacy or user experience. Moderated by Sofia Perez Flores, the panel assembled for “Age Assurance in Practice: Global Frameworks and Client Experiences” includes Alan Goode of Goode Intelligence, who collaborated on Biometric Update's 2025 Online Market Report and Buyer's Guide for the UK age assurance market. Collectively, they address what Corby calls a “tsunami” of age assurance legislation around the world. How can compliance be achieved without deterring legitimate adult users? This is something that people understand and apply around the world. Corby says the ISO/IEC standard on a framework for age assurance,  27566-1, “will finally come into force next month.” “So that will hopefully allow us to then negotiate with people who are passing legislation or the regulators who are then developing the detail around it to say, could you please just point to these standards, and at least as a sort of underlying baseline requirement for everybody they should be compliant to those standards. And then you can add on the specific requirements for each particular jurisdiction.” The ISO standard won't solve everything; Corby notes the messy situation in the U.S., where laws can vary from state to state; “you could end up with 200 different regimes in just one country and clearly that's not going to be efficient for anybody involved.” The question of where in the stack to put age assurance measures also continues to be contested territory, as stakeholders at various levels (device, operating system, app store, content provider) make their case for why someone else should be responsible. “Offcom and the ICO are aware of the public debate about how VPNs may be used by children to bypass online safety protections and age assurance measures that services are put in place to meet their obligations,” he says. Murray notes the “many legitimate reasons why people may want to use a VPN. But he also points out what Corby has often argued: simply because the workaround exists, that doesn't negate legal responsibilities. “Organizations should remember that they continue to have responsibilities under the OSA and under the UK GDPR to have accurate and effective age assurance.” Alan Goode speaks about the 2025 Online Biometric Age Assurance Market Report & Buyers Guide, which shows that organizations were already trying to adapt to the new regimes before enforcement. Since July, “deployment of age assurance solutions has greatly accelerated, in particular for the adult content industry,” which, according to AVPA, has posted an additional 5 million age checks daily since the OSA rules became mandatory. He also notes how “popular digital identity and age assurance apps are constantly appearing at the top of the leaderboard in both Google Play and Apple stores.” Gadsden notes the importance of liveness detection as an additional layer, specially for age estimation, to ensure models aren't providing highly accurate age estimates of fake people. He also notes the problem of customers engaging age assurance providers – then asking them to turn off certain authentication settings. “We're now trying to insist that our members have to be very, very clear with their clients, that if they don't use the full scope of services then they're not going to be compliant with the regulation.” As for the VPN question, Corby echoes Murray in saying that it's possible to detect VPN use, and age assurance providers are working on solutions. “We can even see that in our statistics, which show how many 15 to 17 year olds are on adult sites, for example. Or how much time they're spending on those sites, and those have dropped significantly, as well showing that potentially they're only able to get to the landing page and not deep into the site.” “How do you put in place a system that promotes accuracy, transparency and security while protecting users personal information?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — the Facebook-famous crypto billionaires — have emerged as President Donald Trump's fiercest allies in the digital assets world. President Donald Trump has showered cryptocurrency billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, pictured, with compliments over the last year. A pair of the cryptocurrency industry's best-known billionaires is going full MAGA. Over the past year, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — the Facebook-famous brothers who turned an early bet on bitcoin into a crypto empire — have emerged as Trump's fiercest allies in the digital assets world and major Republican donors. Their transformation into MAGA heavyweights has handed them new power on big decisions. But the brothers' outright embrace of Trump is also beginning to stoke concern within the industry, which has sought to keep its political activity bipartisan. For some, the Winklevoss' rise within the MAGA movement is undermining that effort, threatening to make crypto toxic to Democrats. That could put the industry on shaky ground if and when Democrats take back control in Washington. Biden-era financial regulators cracked down on crypto's biggest players, triggering a backlash against Democrats that, for some in the industry, rages on today. And while crypto supports the Trump administration's deregulatory moves, many executives have avoided ostracizing Democrats, since bipartisan support will be needed in Congress for any crypto legislation to pass. “The cardinal rule of politics is that the pendulum always swings back,” said Rep. Sam Liccardo, a crypto-friendly Democrat whose California district includes parts of Silicon Valley. If it becomes “a Republican-only issue, crypto is just going to get killed,” the official said. In January, it paid $5 million to settle the CFTC case. The Winklevoss brothers, who gained widespread fame from their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over who gets credit for inventing Facebook, have been long-time players in crypto. And their hand in derailing the CFTC chair nomination of Brian Quintenz, a well-regarded former regulator who led policy for venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz's crypto fund, revealed how influential they have become inside the administration. Quintenz has suggested the Winklevoss twins turned on him because he wouldn't promise to “make amends” for the CFTC's prosecution of crypto firms like Gemini. Politically, the brothers have become far more active than ever before. They each donated $1 million in bitcoin to Trump's campaign last year after initially putting their money behind other GOP primary hopefuls like Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott. And they've already funneled virtually all of their political spending for next year's midterms — more than $5 million, as of June 30 — toward GOP candidates and groups, campaign finance records show. Their donations this year include $1 million to the pro-Trump super PAC MAGA Inc., hundreds of thousands of dollars each to Republicans' House and Senate campaign committees and maximum donations to roughly two dozen Republican candidates. They also dished out more than $160,000 each in January to a committee linked to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Winklevoss twins have given to only two Democrats so far this cycle — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Ritchie Torres, both of New York. That's in sharp contrast to when the pair first entered political giving in 2018, when their contributions, though far smaller at the time, went exclusively toward Democrats. The approach is also at odds with other industry-led political spending efforts that have sought to cultivate support from both Democrats and Republicans. The twins donated during the last election cycle to a super PAC network known as Fairshake that showered more than $130 million on pro-crypto House and Senate candidates from both parties across the country. That group has replenished its war chest with more than $140 million ahead of the 2026 elections. But this time, the Winklevoss twins are spurning that effort and supporting their own PAC. “We know from [Democrats'] past behavior that they will resort to whatever bad faith tactics and tricks they can think of … to try to derail the President,” Tyler Winklevoss said in a post on X announcing the brothers' support for the group. On Capitol Hill, the Winklevoss brothers have also become a sounding board for some. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican and one of Congress' staunchest crypto advocates, said she has reached out to the pair before for their thoughts on devising a new regulatory framework around crypto. “I see an industry that is moving further and further right because of Donald Trump and his efforts to take the issue only for Republicans,” said former Rep. Wiley Nickel of North Carolina, who was among the crypto industry's most fervent Democratic supporters in the run-up to last year's election. “The best outcome in Washington is that we continue to keep digital innovation in the United States and keep this issue as a bipartisan one,” he added. For Malik, the concerns of crypto becoming a political football are overblown. “That's going to rub some people the wrong way,” he said. Many Democrats are still engaging with the industry, however. A dozen Democratic senators are pushing their Republican counterparts for more sway over a pending crypto bill that would outline how the SEC and CFTC should oversee the industry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The search for the top crypto to buy often comes down to projects that can back their story with strong utility, clear growth metrics, and near-term catalysts. Markets are buzzing with developments across DeFi and exchange-driven ecosystems, but not all tokens provide the same mix of value and upside. Four tokens in particular stand out right now. BlockchainFX (BFX) is making its mark with a live platform and an ongoing presale offering one of the best bonus deals of the year. HYPE continues to draw attention with NFT launches and major institutional comparisons, while ASTER is posting record trading volumes in perpetuals. Over $8.5 million has already been raised from more than 10,000 participants, and the entry window is getting tighter by the day. Unlike speculative plays, BlockchainFX already has a live multi-asset trading super app in beta. Users can trade crypto, equities, forex, ETFs, commodities, bonds, and futures all in one place. It is also cross-chain compatible with Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Base, and Tron, ensuring smooth asset movement. The staking system offers daily rewards with current yields between 4–7%, and long-term holders also benefit from deflationary tokenomics through fee buybacks and burns. The platform adds to its appeal with exclusive Visa cards for presale buyers, offering global spending limits of up to $100K per transaction and $10K monthly ATM withdrawals. Security has been strengthened with multiple audits, team KYC, and verified contracts, and forecasts put the token anywhere between $1 to $10+ in the long term. With bonuses expiring on October 3, BlockchainFX is positioned as one of the most compelling picks for those chasing the top crypto to buy. Hyperliquid's HYPE token is one of the most active names in the decentralized perpetuals space, and it has had an eventful end to September. However, there are risks: a lending protocol called Hyperdrive was exploited for $782,000, showing that vulnerabilities can still undermine confidence. HYPE trades around $40–$50 with analysts watching resistance near $52, but looming token unlocks of 12 billion coins could put downward pressure on the price. Even so, the mix of hype, institutional endorsements, and active NFT-driven growth keeps it on the radar as a top crypto to buy contender. ASTER has exploded into the perpetuals exchange market, surpassing Hyperliquid in both trading volume and daily fees. Over a seven-day period, it processed around $185 billion in trades, compared to Hyperliquid's $80 billion, and at one point generated more fees than any protocol in the market, even topping Circle and Tether. Endorsements from figures like CZ have added to its credibility, and the token's fully diluted valuation has climbed to around $15 billion. Trading at roughly $1.80–$2.00 after hitting a peak of $2.43, ASTER is experiencing pullbacks that reflect early-stage volatility. Its product design is also unique, with hidden order functionality and up to 1,001x leverage, though this comes with significant risk. Concerns include concentrated supply, governance transparency, and the XPL perpetual glitch on September 25, which caused liquidations and forced Aster to issue refunds. Despite those risks, the record-breaking revenue and aggressive feature rollouts keep ASTER firmly in the conversation as a top crypto to buy this year. More than 5,600 DApps now run on the network, with around $3.6 billion in TVL. Deflationary tokenomics remain a strong narrative, as nearly 1.6 million BNB worth more than $1 billion have already been burned in 2025 alone. Binance is rolling out new features like Crypto-as-a-Service and the TRUTH token launch on October 1, tying the ecosystem closer to AI and data verification. With bullish momentum, strong fundamentals, and consistent burn mechanics, BNB continues to hold its place as a top crypto to buy among established networks. ASTER's rapid growth in trading volumes is rewriting the leaderboard in perpetuals, but governance and token distribution risks are evident. With a working product already live, an aggressive rewards system, and the limited-time OCT35 bonus offering 35% more tokens until October 3, the timing could not be sharper. At $0.025, with a guaranteed 2x at launch and bullish long-term forecasts, BlockchainFX represents one of the strongest opportunities to secure a position before the window closes. For those seeking the top crypto to buy, it combines utility, growth, and urgency in a way few others can match right now. Readers should do their own due diligence before taking any actions related to the promoted company or any of its affiliates or services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite being in early stages, the plan could lead to a more robust bridge between TradFi and DeFi. This is a testament to a growing interest in tokenization, and more precisely, tokenized stock products, which might help strengthen mainstream crypto acceptance, potentially leading to rallies. Meanwhile, retail investors are showing increased interest in crypto presales due to their low prices and explosive potential. Having raised over $280K in the first stage and proposing an AI-powered trading suite, community members highlight DeepSnitch AI as the best crypto presale in 2025. Priced at $0.01701, traders believe the DSNT token could balloon 100x after launch, potentially allowing investors to turn $500 into $50k. SEC Chair Paul Atkins already praised tokenization, citing it's an innovation the SEC should help advance instead of restricting its reach. Atkins also noted that tokenized assets may not only improve access to financial markets but could also reduce costs. Tokenization isn't a fresh idea, as Nasdaq also sought a permit to tokenize and trade listed equities and ETPs. Brokerages and clearing houses raised concerns that tokenization could threaten their role in the trading process, with the WFE group also sending a letter to the SEC asking for more oversight surrounding tokenized assets. Moreover, these new equities might become a stepping stone toward hybrid finance. While institutional strides in Web3 often provide momentum to the market, regular retail traders are more concerned with capitalizing on the long-awaited October rally. DeepSnitch AI, despite its early-stage status, raised over $280K in the first stage. Building an AI-powered trading suite, DeepSnitch AI will use five AI agents specialized in processing raw on-chain data, turning it into actionable and accessible crypto analytics. The AI dashboard will allow traders to track whales, access digestible on-chain data, scan for contract risks, evaluate new tokens, and receive brand-new alpha news. This could provide retail traders with an edge in the market dominated by insiders and whales. As a result, DeepSnitch AI could reach a wide audience, which may drive adoption and help the DSNT become the next crypto moonshot. Priced at $0.01701, DSNT not only provides an affordable entry into a growing AI market, but the combo of utility and affordability could lead to a 100x upside potential. Due to high market caps and oftentimes excessive prices, established coins generally don't carry such explosive gain potential, unless you invest thousands of dollars. Fortunately, Pepenode could not only help bring mining to the masses, but also aims to do so through gamification. Since it's virtual, it doesn't require any hardware, only PEPENODE tokens that you can use to set up a virtual server. Launching new rights will help increase mining power, and players who mine the most will climb the leaderboard, with the highest-ranked players receiving airdrops for established meme coins such as BONK or PEPE. Although the project certainly has potential, it's not the only virtual mining project available, meaning that Pepenode may end up struggling to grow organically. Bitcoin Hyper aims to introduce modern bells and whistles that will update the base network and significantly speed up transactions. While the transactions will ultimately be settled on Bitcoin, the off-chain processing will provide a boost to transaction speed, without sacrificing any of Bitcoin's legendary security. HYPER is in its late stages and is currently priced at $0.012965, which may limit the upside for those who invest now. As digital assets gain more attention from Wall Street, the market will likely receive floods of liquidity and fresh capital. Although the rally probably won't be limited to Bitcoin alone, established altcoins may not provide retail investors with massive earning opportunities without investing thousands upon thousands of dollars. Thus, finding the best crypto presale, such as DeepSnitch AI, is a great way to achieve a massive ROI with smaller investments. Many traders highlight DeepSnitch AI as the best crypto presale in 2025 thanks to its AI-driven utility and strong early fundraising momentum. Presales allow early investors to buy at low entry points, offering higher upside potential compared to established coins with large market caps.

Traditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's "real-time" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They're just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970's architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises "instant" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities. This isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers? Public blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails. When BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met. The point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is "real?" The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck. The thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. It's technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold prices surged to record highs on Wednesday, following a rally for bitcoin in recent days as investors appeared to search for a safe haven in the wake of the first government shutdown in nearly seven years, though economists noted the broader economic impact could be minimal. The price of bitcoin has rallied nearly 7% over the last five days, including a 2.8% jump so far today, rising from just over $109,000 to around $117,200 as of Wednesday morning. Gold tends to be favored by investors amid periods of “elevated” economic and policy uncertainty in the U.S., Goldman Sachs commodities strategist Lina Thompson wrote earlier this year, though UBS strategist Joni Teves wrote Wednesday the price of gold could continue to rise as hopes are high for the Fed to cut interest rates again later this month. Risk assets like bitcoin or equity often decrease in value during these periods, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each declined slightly as of  Wednesday morning, though bitcoin—which has risen to record highs during the Trump administration—appeared to be viewed as a less risky investment. Shutdowns over the last 50 years have lasted eight days on average, Turnquist wrote, and a 34-day shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 saw a roughly 10% rally for the S&P 500. A 16-day shutdown in October 2013 added about 3.1% to the S&P. Turnquist noted investors will likely prioritize corporate earnings and broader economic trends in the coming weeks. A government shutdown could impact whether key economic data is released ahead of the Fed's policymaking meeting on Oct. 28. The Labor Department said last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics would “suspend all operations” during a shutdown and that data scheduled to be released during the blackout would not be released, including Friday's planned release for nonfarm payrolls and unemployment data and an inflation report on Oct. 15. The Senate failed to pass a “continuing resolution” that would stave off a shutdown by allowing the federal government to operate under its existing budget through Nov. 21. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of initiating the shutdown ”because they wouldn't protest Americans' health care,” while President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other leading Republicans have placed blame on Democrats.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The model enables banks to access blockchain on existing systems The initiative connects Swift's global messaging system network with Chainlink's Runtime Environment (CRE), which allows banks to manage digital asset workflows using existing infrastructure. In a pilot with UBS Tokenize, the tokenization arm of UBS, Chainlink, and Swift showed how banks can use ISO 20022, the global standard for financial messaging, to initiate blockchain-based transactions. UBS initiated the process by sending standardized messages through Swift. These were processed by CRE, which activated subscription and redemption via Chainlink's Digital Transfer Agent. The process enables institutions to connect to blockchain networks using their existing systems, thereby eliminating the need for new identity, key management, or settlement tools. Chainlink describes the model as “plug-and-play”  as it provides global banks with access to blockchain without the cost and complexity of full system replacements. The initiative extends work first carried out in Project Guardian in November 2024, which was a Monetary Authority of Singapore pilot where Chainlink, Swift, and UBS tested tokenized asset settlement with off-chain cash transfers. However, the new phase introduces interoperability, which allows on-chain events to be triggered directly from traditional messaging rails. This seeks to address a major hurdle in institutional adoption of tokenized finance.</p>

North Korea's clandestine IT Worker (ITW) program, which is long known for targeting U.S. technology firms and crypto firms, has broadened its scope to attempt to infiltrate a variety of industries worldwide, including finance, healthcare, public administration, and professional services.

Okta's threat researchers have identified over 130 identities associated with DPRK-linked facilitators and workers, which collectively pursued more than 6,500 interviews across 5,000+ companies until mid-2025, and have found that the threat is far more pervasive: 50% of targeted entities are not technology companies, and 27% of them lie outside of the United States.  ￼



ITW operations have also expanded into other countries (Source: Okta)

According to Okta, organizations in every vertical offering remote or hybrid roles are now potential targets.
 ￼
Beyond payroll diversion, successful placements allow these workers to access to sensitive systems and networks, opening the door to data exfiltration, extortion, or intelligence gathering.  ￼

DPRK IT Workers aren't just applying for coding roles anymore: they are increasingly targeting finance, payments processing, and engineering support positions.

While they continue to focus overwhelmingly on remote software development and IT consulting roles, in tech companies, service providers, and IT consultancies, Okta has also noticed a marked increase in DPRK-linked job interviews within:

“Although our data does not confirm whether any of these interviews resulted in employment, the attempts demonstrate that government agencies are not immune to the campaign,” Okta noted.

“More significant is the exposure to public administration via government contractors, service providers and consultancies. These organizations often have extensive access to government networks and sensitive projects, but face high hiring volumes, fast turnaround times, and large pools of remote workers.”

DPRK ITW units have learned from earlier missteps and have refined their methods to bypass traditional identity and vetting controls.

To counter this threat, Okta advises organizations to adopt a multi-layered defense that will include:

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is being tipped as the next in line. The rise of BNB showed that tokens with clear utility and strong exchange support can deliver massive returns. But today, BNB's large size makes it harder for new investors to expect the same explosive growth. With daily rewards, token burns, and a platform that links both crypto and traditional markets, BlockchainFX is starting to look like the fresh opportunity in 2025 for crypto traders. At first, its main use was to give traders discounts on the Binance exchange. The success of BNB is tied to its strong use cases and Binance's global presence. Its token burns have also created scarcity, which supported long-term growth. BNB is already a top coin with a massive market cap, and it just recently broke $1,000 for the very first time. For new investors, it is harder to expect the same kind of gains seen already. It's a long-term play backed by smart tech and real strategy.Long-term thinkers are locking in their spots early.Join the $BFX presale 👉 https://t.co/obxqQkwFJh#BFX #Blockchain #Presale #Crypto #Web3 pic.twitter.com/7hx6BnciWN BlockchainFX is stepping into crypto with a clear value offer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The People's Bank of China's regulated digital currency (e-CNY) piloted in major cities during 2020, and since then digital currency holders in China have become the third-most active users for payment purposes, according to GlobalData's 2025 Financial Services Consumer Survey. China has now taken up the quest by relying on its solid network of nations that are part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Similar cross-border payment motivations drove the opening of Shanghai's new e-CNY operating centre too. So far, a key barrier to the widespread adoption of non-US currencies and payment rails for major international payment flows has been the inferior technological capabilities compared to US rails. China's shift in its approach and attitude is a significant signal of blockchain's, crypto's, and stablecoins' strategic importance reaching far beyond payment superiority. Despite China's long-standing concerns over capital flight from the country, it now seems clear that the demand for the national currency and treasuries created by stablecoin- and CBDC-backing requirements outweighs these concerns. With US stablecoin issuers buying up US debt in large scale, bond yields and therefore the cost of servicing national debt decreased. Given the ambiguous state of Chinese trade balances currently, these new endeavour in digital currencies will help in maintaining demand for the renminbi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue. SWIFT is building a blockchain-based shared ledger as an add-on to its existing network for global money transfers. International payments need a fresh coat of modern paint. Old-school solutions from Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), MoneyGram, and Western Union are too slow and too expensive. Ripple transactions can move money from one country to another in seconds, with average fees of $0.0002 per transfer. Ripple Labs has established local banking partnerships in dozens of countries, making the transfer experience seamless for most users. Send a few dollars to Sweden, and your friend, uncle, or e-commerce retailer receives a handful of Swedish kronor (SEK) right away. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Surely, the XRP/Ripple system must disrupt international payments over time. No one else is working on a modern, digital global money transfer platform, right? Except good old SWIFT is actually making digital moves right now. The Belgium-based organization just kick-started its own crypto-powered payment system. The first step is an early stage conceptual prototype by Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) developer ConsenSys. This approach combines SWIFT's decades of trust-building with a fast, secure, and low-cost digital ledger, most likely using tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. "A digital shared ledger, created with the SWIFT community, offers transparency and interoperability, two priorities to effectively manage cross-border payments in a 24/7 world," said AJ McCray, Bank of America's head of global payments, in a prepared statement. XRP gained 0.2% on Monday -- a bit slower than Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) 2.5% jump or Ethereum's 2.3% price increase, but still a solid price gain. SWIFT's blockchain ambition is just not that big of a deal -- yet. You see, SWIFT appears to hold most of the cards in this game. There may be other blockchain programs in the works that just haven't seen daylight and made headlines yet. Indeed, SWIFT might end up with several new transaction rails that can handle payments faster and cheaper than the old money wires. I'm not saying that these cryptos absolutely have active SWIFT work going on, but I sure wouldn't be surprised to hear the news. At their core, blockchains and cryptocurrencies are just a new way to manage secure transactions and ownership on a global scale. I see no reason why SWIFT shouldn't explore these newfangled digital ledgers in several concurrent development projects. If I'm on the right track with this line of thought, I'm sure XRP will handle plenty of that business. Then again, so will Ethereum and maybe even the old bank-messaging systems. But SWIFT is not going quiet into that good night, choosing instead to explore the new world of digital payments. It's not the end of XRP's hopes and dreams, but perhaps the start of a more pleasant SWIFT experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shielded Technologies is the core dev team behind Midnight Network, a privacy-centric blockchain project spearheaded by Cardano's founder, Charles Hoskinson. CCN caught up with Shielded's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Bob Blessing-Hartley at TOKEN2049 in Singapore. Midnight is considered one of the more exciting projects out there, as it ultimately aims to reimagine privacy standards. But it really aligns with our intent for Midnight to be a multi-chain ecosystem.” He believes it's about bringing “everyone together,” which is why Midnight collaborated with eight ecosystems to distribute its tokens. This brings Midnight's programming language, Compact, to the LF's open-source hub for decentralized technology and digital identity. “The goal,” Hartley points out, is to make Minokawa a “cross-chain privacy-centric smart contract.” “The collaboration with Google really enables us to take advantage of cutting-edge capabilities. They have a wonderful faucet of technology that we'll be connecting into.” Hartley adds that they're engaging with Google's security services, which could “ensure” Midnight and its operations are secured. “They've also signed on to be one of the node operators for our initial launch.” It's “long had” this problem, says Hartley, “businesses, banks,” and even us as individuals, “don't operate that way.” “When I make a deposit at my bank, you don't see that. All those checks are carried out, “it's a unique platform in that sense.” ZK-proofs are notoriously resource-intensive, which may present a barrier for enterprise and mass adoption. Hartley highlights that Shielded benefits from the broader Input Output ecosystem, “which has a really fantastic research division.” “We have recently developed additional modalities for the proof server, which is an important part of the solution that will allow it to be usable by a person with a web browser without having to install any software.” In WASM, for example, Hartley remarks that Shielded is working with some “industry players,” who he can't mention, and they're collaborating to create “proving networks.” Pointing to Brazil's central bank, Hartley says that they've opted not to use blockchains for their CBDC effort because they lack the “core privacy components that we all need.” Moving ahead, Midnight is working on a new project with the LF called Nightstream. Its purpose is to usher in the next generation of Lattice-based proving systems “for post-quantum cryptography.” This is where hackers/adversaries gather encrypted data in the hope of a future technological breakthrough that will give them access. He says that a “sufficiently large” quantum computer is still at least five to seven years away, “if not more.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Market analysts and several metrics suggested that Bitcoin's massive upward move was about to begin after BTC price closed September green. The stablecoin SSR RSI signals “buy,” indicating high buying power. Bitcoin's green September close historically precedes Q4 rallies, averaging 78% gains. Bitcoin (BTC) whipsawed through September, but managed to close the month 5% higher at $114,000 on Tuesday. Several key indicators now suggest that the recent recovery from $108,000 could signal a “big move” ahead, according to analysts. The Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which measures the buying power of stablecoins relative to Bitcoin, has declined, with its relative strength index (RSI) reaching its lowest in four months. Related: Pro Bitcoin traders' view on BTC's flash crash to $112.6K: Did anything change? The Bitcoin “SSR RSI is at 21, and is ‘buy' territory,” said onchain data provider CryptoQuant in part to an X thread on Tuesday. A lower SSR suggests that there is more stablecoin “buying power.” This is reinforced by the ever-expanding stablecoin supply, which signals increased liquidity and investor confidence. “This is a clear sign of fresh liquidity entering the market,” CryptoQuant noted, adding: Additionally, Bitcoin long-term holders continue to grow their stash with these accumulation addresses now holding a record 298,000 BTC. This trend suggests that they are optimistic about Bitcoin's potential to continue rising. “These signals could shape Bitcoin's next big move,” CryptoQuant concluded. As Cointelegraph reported, several onchain and technical indicators suggest that last week's drop to $108,650 may have marked the local bottom for BTC. The metric has dropped to 20% from over 100% a few weeks ago. “At that exact point, the Impulse Signal collapses to zero. Swissblock highlighted that this reset has only occurred three times since early 2024, with each instance marking a “cycle bottom” followed by a sustained recovery in Bitcoin's price. September delivers the lowest monthly returns for Bitcoin, which now averages –3% across 13 years from 2013. However, Tuesday's close above $114,000 marked a rare bullish end to September, a scenario that has historically been followed by massive gains in Q4 (see figure below). Popular analyst Mikybull Crypto said in an X post on Wednesday. If history is anything to go by, BTC price could see its most significant gains of the current bull cycle over the next three months.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, he plans for his company – Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) – to stack up $1T of the world's largest crypto asset. As more $BTC is scooped up, projects building on Bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Hyper, are likely to see their utility and demand accelerate. In 2020, Strategy boldly pivoted from business software to a digital asset-focused balance sheet. The total stash was accumulated for roughly $47.35B at an average price of about $73,983. However, with $BTC now trading at $116,5K, Strategy is sitting on over $27B in unrealized gains. Despite the humongous profit, Strategy's large $BTC buys have received some backlash. He slammed the company's valuation by calling it ‘financial gibberish.' Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Capital, also criticizes Strategy. In an X post last week, he called the firm's approach ‘harebrained' and noted that Strategy ($MSTR) is down 45% from its November 2024 peak. Still, ongoing criticism hasn't deterred other firms from betting big on the crypto king. CoinMarketCap data shows that 108 public companies now hold 1,029,413 $BTC worth over $119.5B – 4.90% of the asset's total supply. Meanwhile, XXI is firmly in third place, holding 43,514 $BTC worth roughly $5.05B. These companies, including the likes of Metaplanet (which recently established a US subsidiary to expand its $BTC income business), view the crypto leader as a long-term investment with high profit potential. Once launched this quarter, its L2 chain will leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the Bitcoin network faster, cheaper, and more scalable. In doing so, $BTC can be used across DeFi, dApps, NFTs, and other Web3 ecosystems. This unlocks new use cases previously unseen on Bitcoin, which will also boost liquidity. All while preserving the inherent security of Bitcoin's base layer. The presale tokenomics show that a hefty 30% of its total token supply is earmarked to fund ongoing development, while an extra 25% is reserved for the ecosystem treasury. Supporting the project and buying $HYPER on presale – currently available for just $0.013005 – comes with several additional perks. If you're interested in staking for gains, there's no better time to do precisely that; the APY will drop as more investors catch on. Experts predict $HYPER could reach $0.32 after it's listed on some of the best crypto exchanges. This alone could generate over 24x returns, and that's without factoring in any staking income. Weighing all these points together, it's no surprise $HYPER has raised over $19.5M already, with recent whale buys as big as $113.8K, $109.9K, and $105.4K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) announcement of a comprehensive crypto regulatory overhaul signals the biggest change in US financial policy in years. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins' commitment to integrate digital assets into Wall Street's trading infrastructure—by clarifying broker-dealer rules, allowing national exchanges to handle crypto, and removing long-standing compliance hurdles—represents a much-needed shift. After years of enforcement driven by litigation under the Biden administration, which stifled innovation and marginalized US exchanges, Washington is finally indicating that digital assets belong within the mainstream of American capital markets. Even as the SEC's agenda promises many new exchange-traded products, analysts caution against mistaking regulatory progress for guaranteed market acceptance. History shows that once standard listing criteria are established, issuers will rush to introduce products linked to a variety of digital assets. But as Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan points out, “the mere existence of a crypto ETP does not guarantee significant inflows.” Investor interest relies on confidence in the underlying asset, not just easier access. Around the world, new financial architecture is being built at speeds that should worry US regulatory bodies and banks. China has spent the past decade building new financial foundations, powered by state-backed digital currency and blockchain infrastructure, to explicitly reduce reliance on the dollar. When paired with the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), China now possesses an alternative financial channel to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) that is increasingly attractive to states wary of US sanctions. Russia has launched its own System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), linking it with CIPS. Moscow's SPFS and the BRICS Pay initiative are designed to process real payments outside US oversight. Unlike in the US—where blockchain remains mostly linked to speculative assets—BRICS countries are developing state-led infrastructures. For sanctioned actors, privacy coins like Monero, along with central bank digital currencies designed to bypass SWIFT, establish sanction-resistant channels that directly challenge American economic pressure. US sanctions rely on the centrality of the dollar and America's dominance over clearing systems like SWIFT and Clearing House Interbank Payments System. De-dollarization is accelerating as competitors explore yuan-denominated commodities, gold-backed reserves, and blockchain systems that bypass US networks. However, these strengths won't last on their own. The global monetary system is falling apart, and efforts to shape its future are already underway. Standards such as ERC-3643 determine which compliance features are embedded into the next generation of finance. The SEC's reforms, then, must be seen in this broader context. Integrating crypto into Wall Street is about unlocking new asset classes for American investors, just as it is about preserving US financial leadership in a world where rivals are building sanction-proof infrastructures. If US regulators set transparent standards that achieve global buy-in, American influence extends; if not, American firms will find themselves following rules written in Beijing, Brussels, or Brazil.

ABeam Consulting offers knowledge and advice to support corporate transformation, based on extensive experience that captures ongoing changes in industry and society. Stablecoins and tokenized deposits, digital currencies that make use of blockchain technology, have already entered into use in business, and are coming into the application phase. These digital currencies have characteristics not possessed by other payment methods, such as the potential to facilitate instant settlements, programmability and transparency. They thus have the potential to revolutionize previous payment methods. Delays, high fees and annoying verification work in B2B transactions and international remittances… digital currencies utilizing blockchain technology have entered the implementation stage as a new means of payment to address these issues. The total issue value of stablecoins such as USDT and USDC have achieved tremendous growth, reaching 230 billion dollars (approximately 34 trillion yen) as of March, 2025. *1  The technology has also garnered significant attention as a new means of payment that complements existing payment methods even in international remittances between businesses and trade settlement. “JPM Coin,” one tokenized deposit issued by JPMorgan Chase, has transformed cash management at global companies. Transactions using JPM Coin are believed to rise to 1 billion dollars per day,*2  and have streamlined capital management at multinational companies. Tokenized deposits also include stablecoins in the broad sense, but, in this Insight, we will make a distinction between the two to achieve greater clarity and better examine them. We will thus proceed by defining stablecoins as tokens that are defined as an electronic payment method under the Payment Services Act, that are generally backed by assets in the form of legal tender, and that can circulate among an indeterminate number of parties, while defining tokenized deposits as tokens that represent bank deposits on the blockchain, or, in other words, tokens that are backed by faith in banks, and that are expected to circulate among bank account holders. These characteristics have the potential to transform traditional finance systems. Let's begin by looking at “(1) allowing instant transfer of value.” Bank transfers, the typical traditional payment method, are, in principle, limited in that they only allow users to send money during bank operating hours. This is also the case for some types of electronic money. In contrast to this, payments can be made 365-days-per-year, 24-hours-per-day using digital currency. It is also believed that the fees associated with transferring funds can be cheaper compared to, for example, bank remittances. With bank transfers, even for bank transactions, real-time money sending hours have been extended between some banks, and it has become possible to send money 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year, excluding system maintenance times. Furthermore, with the rise of money remittance services that do not charge fees if the amount involved is small such as COTRA, there are now adequate existing payment services in place, so we expect that this point alone would be unlikely to be a decisive factor in motivating institutions to switch from existing services. However, as stated above, credit cards and payments using electronic money still have their issues. Problems remain, such as high fees and long transaction times in international remittances, so digital currencies have a lot of potential as means of solving these problems. Next, let us look at “(2) programmability.” Using digital currencies, we can encode information into money transactions, and use reconciliation or product shipping as, for example, triggers. Furthermore, automatic transactions using programs called smart contracts are also possible. For example, at a company that manages multiple bank accounts, it would be possible to automatically perform an operation in which is automatically moved from an oversight account if a shortage of funds occurs at some specific account due to a payment. Such programmability has a great deal of potential for automating and streamlining financial transactions. This is the domain generally termed distributed finance (De-Fi), and it has garnered attention as a new way of providing financial services without the intervention of a traditional financial institution. Going forward, it is expected that a variety of use cases and functions will be developed using this technology. Finally, let us look at “(3) traceability.” When using digital currencies, all money transactions are recorded, and as the information is largely impossible to falsify, it serves as powerful evidence in audits or for proving things. *3 Delivery versus Payment (DvP): A framework for simultaneously settling securities and funds. This represents a form of transaction that eliminates settlement risk by conditionally and simultaneously performing the transfer of securities and the payment of the price *4 Payment versus Payment (PvP): A framework for simultaneous settlements between different currencies. This represents a form of transaction that eliminates settlement risk in foreign currency transactions by conditionally and simultaneously performing the payment of one currency and the payment of the other currency *5 Permissionless blockchain: An open blockchain that anyone can participate in and verify transactions on, without any specific permissions. Such blockchains have no central administrator, and implement a distributed network. Compared to permissionless blockchains, they are characterized by faster processing speeds and easier security management. In this section, we will clarify the stage of development of each currency and their characteristics in their fields of application by looking at major case studies in Japan and abroad (see Figure 2). “JPYC” was planned to be issued as a Type 1 Electronic Payment Method (EPM) , envisaging usage for over-the-counter payments in convenience stores and supermarkets, or convenience store payment. A group centered on Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking issued “Progmat Coin” as a Type 3 EPM, with participation from companies covering all the major domestic financial institutions/the entire financial ecosystem. The coin is set to be used not only in inter-firm transactions, but also in settlements for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) such as security tokens and carbon credits for things like bonds or real estate. The group is pioneering applications such as legal organizations and other use case generation. The project envisages a broad array of applications such as international remittances, supply chain settlements, security token sales and purchases, settlements for travelers visiting Japan. Elsewhere, Nomura Holdings, Sony Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and others are working on trials, and a variety of initiatives are under development. It is characterized by the fact that its reserve fund contains not only cash and short-term government bonds, but also riskier assets such as partially collateralized loans, bitcoin and gold. “USDC” is issued by Circle and has been in operation since September 2018. It places a major focus on stability and transparency, having 100% of its reserve fund composed of cash and short-term government bonds and publishing a monthly breakdown thereof, in line with the attestation standards set out by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. SBI VC Trade then began circulation, and it is expected that this will lead to international stablecoins seeing use in the Japanese market. Businesses can easily use it to implement smart contracts in line with their own rules and requirements, enabling DCJPY to flexibly handle a variety of use cases. In its first project, it was used for transactions settling the “environmental value” of non-fossil fuel certificates. “Tochika,” a tokenized deposit*6  issued by Hokkoku Bank, has been in operation since April 2024. One of the key characteristics of this project is that it can be used in combination with “Tochipo,” which are points issued by local governments on the bank's digital regional currency platform. It also promotes coordination with digital ID by implementing identity verification tied to My Number Cards, and is thus expected to play a role as a platform for revitalizing regional economies. In trade finance, the token replaces collateral certificates and letters of credit with smart contracts, making these transactions real time. DBS Bank's “DBS Treasury Tokens” help realize instantaneous multi-currency financial transfers and liquidity management within corporate groups that span multiple countries or regions. It has achieved practical outcomes such as shortening the settlement of transactions within Ant International Group from multiple days to a matter of seconds. What sorts of use cases are the two envisaged for? indicated that its position was that, for the time being, it was appropriate to consider matters while keeping an eye on developments in Japan and abroad from a medium to long-term perspective, so, at present, our understanding is that the issue of such stablecoins will not be possible. For issuers, licensing as a bank is necessary to issue “deposit type” stablecoins, as a funds transfer service provider to issue “funds transfer type” stablecoins, and as a trust bank or specified trust company to issue “trust type” stablecoins. For business companies considering the use of such stablecoins, they will need to partner with a company holding such a license. In terms of settlement limits, no such limits apply to “trust type” stablecoins, while “funds transfer type” stablecoins are limited to 1 million yen per transaction. There is also a lot of potential in the fact that they can be distributed on permissionless blockchains like Ethereum. At present, senders and recipients of funds are often limited to cases where both parties hold accounts at the same bank, but efforts are underway to overcome these restrictions through cooperation between financial institutions. Since April 2025, Tochika, which we touched on earlier, may be used even without having an account with Hokkoku Bank, the issuer, if the user of the tokenized deposit holds an account with a partner regional financial institution. There are also efforts underway aimed at facilitating cross-border settlements through a variety of frameworks being trialed such as the “Partior” settlements platform that has begun commercial use led by commercial banks such as JPMorgan Chase and DBS Bank, or “Project Agora,” which is being led by the Bank for International Settlements. Use of the technology within a broader scope is thus expected. Additionally, because stablecoins can result in transactions between indeterminate users, financial institutions and intermediaries need to be aware that they will need to put in place anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures. When it comes to distribution on permissionless blockchains in particular, though the technology has significant potential, it also carried a high risk of being used to transfer criminal proceeds. Additionally, what actions specifically will be expected of electronic payment services operators that serve as intermediaries for such transactions is, at present, not yet clear, so we await future arrangements. In terms of flexibility of supply, stablecoins may be issued after the assets backing them have been deposited in a trust, or preserved via some other similar procedure, or placed in a monetary trust. For monetary trusts, at present, only operation through on-demand deposits such as ordinary deposit or cash in bank accounts are permitted. Furthermore, under current Japanese regulations, the assets backing stablecoins such as USDC, which is issued overseas and distributed on a permissionless blockchain, are operated using things like short-term government bonds, and that revenue is regulated more strictly and with a greater focus on investor protections compared to what would be the case if it were the issuing company's revenue base. Stablecoins issued domestically in Japan also end up competing under unfavorable terms under present regulations, when you consider that they may be used across the globe. Amidst this context, a January 2025 report to the FSA's Working Group on Payment Services System, etc. made a proposal to allow operation of the assets backing stablecoins to be not only ordinary deposit and cash in bank accounts, but also term deposits and short-term government bonds, for up to 50% of the overall value. As an example, in international remittances, if we take a case where a deposit is temporarily transferred to a tokenized deposit then remitted, we expect that the fact that the issuing and repayment procedures could be executed instantly would mean that the service could be used more smoothly. Having understood these characteristics, we would now like to touch on what sorts of use cases we envisage stablecoins and tokenized deposits being used for. We envisage “funds transfer type” stablecoins being used mainly in B2C applications such as online or in-store payments, and the sale/purchase of digital content such as NFTs, due to their settlement amount limits. “Trust type” stablecoins are not restricted in terms of settlement amount or scope of distribution, so, in addition to the aforementioned B2C applications, we envisage them having broader use cases, including B2B applications such as international remittances, trade finance and supply chain settlements and finance. While we also envisage a similarly broad range of use cases for tokenized deposits, given that their scope of distribution is limited to bank account holders, we believe that they are best suited to being used as, for example, CMS*7  that streamlines inter-business settlements or fund management among group companies. When looking at implementing stablecoins or tokenized deposits, companies need to consider such projects having not only looked at the differences between the two, but also having taking into account the form of their own business. For both banks and other business companies, the option does exist to introduce both stablecoins and tokenized deposits for their services. The concerns and points to consider for each when introducing them do, however, differ. In this section, we will organize the points to consider for banks and other businesses when incorporating stablecoins or tokenized deposits into their own services. We will also be thinking in terms of “trust type” stablecoins as the representative example, as these have a broad range of use cases. Whether the bank can accept this capital outflow from the balance sheet or reduction in capital efficiency is a point to consider. Because the issue amount is treated as a deposit and is hence incorporated into the balance sheet, prudential standards ordinarily required of a bank are applied, but special operational limitations that arise from the isolation of funds as with a trust type stablecoin are not applied. When considering implementing stablecoins at non-bank business companies, still different points of consideration arise. On the other hand, businesses also have flexibility in how they provide their customer experience, being able to, for example, take the option of only receiving payments using tokens, without taking on the burden of exchange work. In contrast to this, when opting for tokenized deposits, because exchanging tokens and cash is something that cannot be done internally, charges and redemptions are performed externally to the company's service as services from the token-issuing bank. Recent years have also seen increasing cases of banking services being incorporated into other companies' services as so-called embedded finance or Banking as a Service (BaaS), so, when introducing such frameworks, these can prove useful for maintaining consistency in the customer experience. In the preceding section, we organized specific key points to consider for both banks and business companies in their respective situations when introducing stablecoins or tokenized deposits. So, given the present issues in implementing stablecoins and tokenized deposits and their characteristics, what could be the medium to long-term direction of travel for these technologies? Or will they evolve into separate niches in different domains? Ultimately, we believe that the technologies will coexist as they suit different promoters and use cases. We can envisage scenarios where the technology develops such that, due to differences in what suits different promoters, stablecoins develop under the direction of business companies, while tokenized deposits develop under the direction of banks, or scenarios where we discover different priorities for technologies depending on use case as implementation evolves going forward, resulting in them evolving into complementary niches (see Figure 6). We could also envisage a variety of other potential scenarios. We could see a scenario where tokenized deposits develop under the direction of banks in an era of higher interest rates. Or we could see a scenario where a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is implemented covering everything up to and including retail payments, and both technologies thus fail to develop. With that said, considering the differing characteristics of stablecoins and tokenized deposits respectively and the present attitudes of authorities, it seems unlikely that such extreme scenarios will come to pass. As we have described, digital currencies in the form of stablecoins and tokenized deposits have the potential to streamline settlements operations at financial institutions and business companies, reduce social costs, and even help generate new value. ABeam Consulting offers end-to-end support for everything from visioning, the formulation of business concepts and the drawing up of business plans related to the use of digital currencies, through to project management to realize those ideas, based on our extensive insights and strong track record in payments and digital technology.
