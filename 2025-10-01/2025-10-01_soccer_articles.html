                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One more English club is set to be added in FIFA's next Club World Cup as the restrictions on the maximum of teams per country is expected to be loosened, it has been claimed. Pep Guardiola's City reached the last 16 before losing to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal, while Chelsea went on and won the tournament after earning a 3-0 win against Paris Saint-Germain. According to The Times, UEFA would not appose a move by FIFA to increase the cap from two clubs per nation to three but would have issue if the tournament is staged every other year or expand it from 32 teams. Allowing three clubs per country would reduce the chances of that happening again in four years time. The future of the Club World Cup is set to be raised at a FIFA council meeting on Thursday, though there is not expected to be a final decision regarding number of clubs included per country yet. FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani felt the tournament had been a big success. When asked if he was in favour of increasing the number of clubs at the Club World Cup, he told the Leaders sports business conference in London: "After the first one, like running any business, after your first month you ask do you have enough people? Do we need to have more clubs or do we have a different variety of clubs in terms of how they qualify?" If three English clubs were allowed in the 2025 Club World Cup, Liverpool would have been included as part of the tournament. Increasing the number of teams - and therefore matches - would not go down well with some. Among those that might be against that is City midfielder Rodri, who admitted players could go on strike if the schedule increases. "I think we are close to that," said Rodri when asked whether players will strike. Make sure you don't miss out on the latest City news by joining our free WhatsApp group.

The Blues won the competition after claiming a 3-0 victory over reigning Champions League winners and Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey. Next time the Club World Cup is held in 2029, there could be more English teams competing. However, UEFA would have objections to this change if it meant that there would also be an overall increase in the total number of teams from 32 up to 48. The changes are reportedly being considered after FIFA bosses were concerned that three reigning champions - Liverpool, Barcelona and Napoli - were not involved in the competition. Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur will all have goals of competing at the next instalment of the Club World Cup, which would see each club receive significant financial rewards. All three clubs are competing in this year's Champions League, which automatically gives them a chance of qualifying for the next Club World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump was reminded Wednesday that FIFA, not any government, ultimately decides which cities will host 2026 World Cup games. Trump suggested last week he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament next summer and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The 11 U.S. host cities, plus three in Mexico and two in Canada, are contracted with FIFA which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff. The Canadian president of North American regional soccer body CONCACAF said the sport is “bigger” than any current political debate. “That's the beauty of our game, is that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.” Trump's comments last week were in response to a question about World Cup cities that oppose his immigration and crime crackdowns. Any city that “is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup,” Trump said, also referring to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, “we'll move it around a little bit. Trump has a close working relationship with FIFA president Gianni Infantino who is a regular visitor to the White House. Infantino has not publicly commented on the issue of cities being judged too dangerous to host games at the 48-team tournament that runs through July 19.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool could be about to be handed a boost in their hopes of competing at the next FIFA Club World Cup. The Premier League had two representatives in the competition, with Chelsea and Manchester City both in taking part. It has been reported that rules limiting the number of clubs competing at the Club World Cup are expected to be eased ahead of the next tournament in 2029. FIFA bosses were said to be "frustrated" that the likes of Liverpool were not in the tournament this summer. Likewise, Barcelona and Napoli did not take part in the competition despite being reigning league champions in their country - causing concerns over whether the competition truly represented the top clubs in the world. If Liverpool were to qualify for the Club World Cup, it would lead to significant financial rewards, particularly if they were to reach the final of the competition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any decision to move matches from World Cup cities for 2026 must be taken by Fifa, not Donald Trump, a vice-­president of the organisation has said. He said San Francisco and Seattle were “run by radical left lunatics who don't know what they're doing”. On the subject of Israel's continued involvement in international football, which has been the subject of much debate in the past week, Montagliani said it was Uefa's responsibility to take a decision. “I respect that it's a decision by Uefa. It's their member, they have to deal with it and I respect not only the appropriate process, but whatever decision they make. No different than when I have to deal with a member of my region for whatever reason.” On the contentious topic of Fifa competitions and their expanding reach, Montagliani said he was in favour of a bigger Club World Cup but against a 64-team World Cup for the centennial anniversary in 2030. “I don't see the argument for 64 teams,” he said. “It's not just us but Uefa and Asia who are opposed to that. But the Club World Cup was a massive success.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FC Barcelona midfielder Gavi was dealt a major setback last month as it was confirmed that he would be sidelined for a lengthy period after undergoing arthroscopic surgery. The 21-year-old fan favourite had been out sidelined since late August due to a meniscus issue. Initially, it was estimated that Gavi would be out for about five weeks post-surgery, but it turned out that the condition was much worse than anticipated, and as such, he is now staring at five months out. Now, as reported by Mundo Deportivo, Gavi has already begun his rehabilitation work at Barcelona's training facilities as he gets started on his long road to recovery. The midfielder was naturally dejected after learning about the situation, but has now accepted it and is focused on what lies ahead of him. The road to recovery begins for Gavi. The La Masia graduate already knows what it is like to go through this situation after suffering a long-term injury with a torn ACL in the same knee back in November 2023, which kept him out for nearly a year. As such, Gavi has now begun training with physiotherapists at the Ciutat Esportiva, taking the first steps on his road to recovery. The midfielder will not rush things, but is not too keen on wasting time either, as he wishes to help Barcelona achieve their goals while also not losing sight of the fact that it is a World Cup season. Gavi, thus, wants to work hard to achieve his objectives and has already started working on his rehabilitation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European fans hoping to watch next summer's World Cup action from their armchairs or favourite pubs have been warned to expect some very late nights, as the organisers try to juggle demands for player-friendly temperatures with broadcasters' requests for primetime kick-off slots. Following complaints from global players' union FIFPro, FIFA has said it will try to make sure that only stadiums in less humid locations, like Seattle or Vancouver, or the five venues with roofs will host the afternoon kick-offs most attractive to European broadcasters. With 104 fixtures to play, it will be impossible to stage every game involving a European team in only seven of the 16 host cities. Speaking at the Leaders sports business conference in London on Wednesday, FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani said “lessons were learned” at the Club World Cup but heat and humidity are not new issues for athletes, fans and sports administrators in North America, so there is a lot of local expertise on how to mitigate against climate-related issues. But when asked if it is possible to guarantee that every game involving a European team will take place in lunchtime slot on the West Coast or afternoon slot on the East Coast, without exposing the players to high temperatures or humidity, the CONCACAF president admitted there may be some disappointment. “We're in those conversations daily, our media guys with European and other world media in terms of what's best, what are the stadiums that you can play at 3pm (Eastern Time), like Atlanta, for instance,” said Montagliani. I don't know because there's a lot of games.” Montagliani, who helped Canada, Mexico and the U.S. win the bid for 2026 tournament in his former role as president of the Canadian Soccer Association, was more confident when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's recent remarks about possibly moving World Cup games from cities that he deems to be unsafe. “He is the president, fair enough, and words are a little heavier when it's the president of a country, but, from an operational perspective, it really wasn't taken into consideration,” he said. If FIFA wanted to move a knockout game or have less games in that city, more in this city, it's ultimately FIFA's decision.” Based in North West England, Matt Slater is a senior football news reporter for The Athletic UK.</p>

The president of Concacaf on Wednesday insisted that President Trump's suggestion he might strip World Cup games from host cities he does not like has not been taken into consideration by FIFA. Speaking in the Oval Office last week, Trump responded to a question about "immigration, crime and the World Cup" in lengthy fashion, addressing cities such as San Francisco and Seattle that will host games as well as Chicago and Memphis which the tournament will not visit. He concluded by warning "if I think [a host city] isn't safe, we'll move it into a different city, absolutely." As such Victor Montagliani, president of North American soccer's governing body and a FIFA vice president, dismissed the possibility of FIFA responding to Trump's threat. "If I have to react every time a politician makes a statement, whether it's a president, a senator, a congressman or even in my country and Mexico, then I wouldn't be doing my job," he said at The Summit, part of Leaders Week London 2025. "We're focused on the 16 venues and making sure they're ready to go. "He is the president, fair enough, and words are a little heavier when it's a president, but from an operational perspective it wasn't really taken into consideration. If FIFA wanted to, for whatever reason, move a knockout game, it is ultimately their jurisdiction." Next summer's tournament will be the biggest World Cup ever, expanded to 48 teams playing across 16 venues in the USA, Canada and Mexico. Montagliani revealed that hospitality sales for the stadium are "through the roof" but there will be further questions for host cities to address before the tournament kicks off at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11. Many of these became apparent at last summer's Club World Cup, which shared five venues with the World Cup proper. Visiting fans could face issues getting to venues such as Miami's Hard Rock Stadium and AT&T Stadium in Arlington, where public transport facilities are limited. There's a bigger public transportation component to a World Cup [compared to the Club World Cup]. I know there's plans in place for all that." At the Club World Cup Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique compared Seattle's Lumen Field, which will host six games including at least one involving the USMNT, to "an NBA court full of holes". A year earlier at the Copa America Emiliano Martinez labelled Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium as "a disaster". Montagliani said: "Pitches, I gotta be honest here, this is the first time I've heard of there was any issues with pitches, I thought they were actually quite good, maybe not perfect, They withstood more than … even, for instance, New York [which will host the World Cup final], because they had quite a few matches there."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Gianni Infantino speaks at the Global Citizen Awards ceremony, Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025, in New York. President of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Gianni Infantino arrives at the Global Citizen Awards, Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025, in New York. The schedule of matches won't be finalized until December. Tickets to next year's FIFA World Cup officially go on sale Wednesday. The buyers will be those who were selected, out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month, to have the first formal chance to purchase tickets over the next few days. FIFA said lottery winners have been, or will soon be, informed by email. There are also more traditional concerns such as who, when and where — and none of those will be answered until the draw on Dec. 5. FIFA knows many fans won't fret about those answers; they just want tickets now and will figure out the rest later. “These are not only outstanding figures, but also a strong statement,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on social media, reacting to the 4.5 million applicants for a spot in the purchase window that opened Wednesday. From Canada, Mexico and the United States, to countries big and small across every continent, fans are proving once again passion for football truly unites.” Here are some things to know as tickets go on sale. Fans can purchase seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket prices will range initially from $60 for group-stage matches to $6,730 for the final but could — and almost certainly will — change as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time. The telecommunications giant is a World Cup sponsor and will simply start dropping free ticket chances to its customers through its app. “For me, there are few things as exciting as experiencing football live, whether that's on or oﬀ the pitch, and so I am proud to partner with Verizon to celebrate their plans to give fans unprecedented access to the tournament,” said soccer icon David Beckham, part of Verizon's promotion for the World Cup. The U.S., Mexico and Canada all automatically qualified as host nations. Also in so far: defending champion Argentina, Japan, New Zealand, Iran, Uzbekistan, Jordan, South Korea, Brazil, Australia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Tunisia, Colombia, Paraguay and Morocco. FIFA said fans from 216 countries and territories applied to be part of the first ticket lottery. The rest of the top 10, also in order of application totals: Germany, England, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Spain and Italy. Nobody has said how many tickets FIFA plans to sell in this first window. Availability won't be depleted; based on the listed stadium attendance figures, there are roughly 7.1 million seats to fill for the 104 matches around 16 North American venues, though it's unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public. Adding to some of the uncertainty, President Donald Trump, who has a close relationship with Infantino, has suggested that the host cities could be changed if he wants to move some events away from places his administration considers unsafe. The U.S. cities that are scheduled to host are East Rutherford, New Jersey; Inglewood, California; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Houston; Arlington, Texas; Atlanta; Seattle; Santa Clara, California; Philadelphia; Kansas City, Missouri; and Miami Gardens, Florida. “If any city we think is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup … we won't allow it to go there,” Trump said last week. But I hope that's not going to happen.” It also suggests that travelers who need a visa should start applying now, and officials have said the U.S. is trying “to ensure an efficient, smooth, and effective visa process.” A second phase, called an early ticket draw, likely will run from Oct. 27-31, with purchase time slots from mid-November to early December. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. Tickets also will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” FIFA also said it will start an official resale platform. “The world will come together in North America,” Infantino promised, “like never before.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EMMA HAYES was at home in the fall of 2023 when the text came from her agent, telling her that her dream job—head coach of soccer's U.S. Women's National Team—was hers if she wanted it. She'd been dreaming about this moment since 1999, when her career as a soccer coach was just starting at Liverpool Hope University in England. That year, her father, Sid Hayes, returned from the FIFA Women's World Cup Final, where the U.S. delivered a breathtaking win after a penalty shootout against China. Emma was awed by his reports on the respect for—and treatment of—the women's team. “I always thought that it would go to an American; I didn't want to build my hopes up.” Yet for 26 years, Emma has worked diligently and methodically to become the kind of coach who can not only helm the world's most successful women's soccer team but breathe new life into it. Just shy of nine months after being named USWNT head coach, in November of 2023, she led the team to gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics in a decisive 1-0 victory over Brazil (this coming quickly after a brutal 2023 season that saw the departure of head coach Vlatko Andonovski following a tough first-time elimination from the World Cup in the round of 16). And so far, the 2025 season is already off to a blazing start. This summer, as other global powerhouse teams competed in the Euros, Emma kept a close eye on the competition to see how her team was measuring up. “I just watched England, Spain, they're comparable with us, as are Germany. What's going to be the thing that sets us apart?” Thanks to a father who played an instrumental role in starting the youth teams at Arsenal, the storied English club, Emma can't remember a time she wasn't playing soccer (“I couldn't escape it!” she says). Their block of flats surrounded a soccer pitch, where neighborhood kids would play. A rising young soccer star at Arsenal Academy, Emma suffered a skiing injury at 17 that left her effectively without cartilage in her ankle. Under her leadership, Chelsea won seven Women's Super League titles and 16 trophies. (On September 30, Emma was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame in Manchester, England, thanks to the massive contributions she has made to women's soccer in the UK and abroad.) Suffice to say that by 2023, Emma was ready for a change, especially after watching from afar as the USWNT took a beating at the World Cup, and starting to think again about that long-hoped-for holy grail. Emma has created her own special coaching style over the years, infusing her energetic spirit and her lived experience in the male-dominated soccer world with infallible maxims gleaned from coaching greats. Indeed, it's these little things—like eschewing daily weigh-ins to avoid fueling disordered eating and body dysmorphia, and advocating for pelvic floor coaches—that laid the foundation for a winning ecosystem with a “female lens.” A patchwork of experiences showed Emma how badly women's sports needed something radically different: zero references to the women's game during her coaching education courses; the sexism and misogyny she's faced in her career; and finally, the myriad U.S. role models who gave her the courage to try something new. Emma became determined to cultivate an environment “not just for our players, but beyond,” she says. It's a simple formula that shouldn't be revolutionary but somehow still is: If her players are healthy and happy, they play well. This is captured in four little words: joy, trust, togetherness, and belief. It's one of the reasons she agreed to collaborate on the new Bend It Like Beckham sequel with director Gurinder Chadha. “I know I'm going to be able to drip-feed all of these subliminal messages globally, because I think there is so much education to be done for girls and women.” As an outspoken women's health advocate, Emma doesn't shy away from the hard stuff. “It's not weak to be vulnerable,” she says. In 2021, she opened up about her agonizing battle with endometriosis—from her laparoscopy to an IUD insertion and subsequent removal after a rare cervix perforation—all while coaching Chelsea through a victorious 2015 season. Later, in 2022, Emma underwent an emergency hysterectomy to manage her painful endometriosis symptoms. But Emma doesn't care who knows about her health struggles. Now 49, Emma talks frankly about how menopause affects her during our interview. At one point, she pauses, searching for a word. It's the same tactic she takes with her players. And I made that decision a long time ago,” Emma says. But what I have is an extraordinary team on and off the field because of that [transparency].” “This is a game that I love, and I want them to feel like they can be their best selves while they're doing it.” Emma constantly aims to strike the delicate balance between fierce coach and vulnerable, canny leader.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa's Club World Cup could expand from 32 teams for future editions despite concerns about the toll on player welfare. But Fifa will examine increasing the number of clubs for the 2029 Club World Cup and beyond, said vice-president Victor Montagliani. “I think overall it was a massive success in terms of executing,” Montagliani, who is also president of American and Caribbean confederation Concacaf, told the Leaders in Sport conference in London. So you know, [we'll] discuss it with the stakeholders, like the ECA in Europe, others in other jurisdictions. Stay ahead with our three daily briefings delivering all the key market moves, top business and political stories, and incisive analysis straight to your inbox. Do we need to have more clubs or do we have a different variety of clubs in terms of how they qualify? Fifa has also been asked by South American football chiefs to consider expanding the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams, although the proposal appears to lack wider support. “Our friends in South America want it to be studied. And, you know, we're always open minded. But yes, I'm in line with some other counterparts, starting with Alexander [Ceferin, Uefa president] in Europe, who don't think it's a great idea. “I haven't really changed my mind on that, but if there's a study I'm open to reading it. Of course it could happen because it's still six [sic] years away, but you know, we still haven't kicked off on 48 teams, so I think, you know, we should probably temper it.” The Canadian said Fifa had been very encouraged by premium sales in particular, and rubbished concerns of empty seats such as those seen at this year's Club World Cup. You've got to put your head down and do the work but I'm very confident in knowing where we are on the spectrum of our planning, seeing how the requests for tickets has already gone. “The Club World Cup was brand new. There were some learnings that we can transfer over to next year – kick-off times – from a technical perspective, but the product is completely different. I mean, there is nothing like the World Cup.” Follow us for breaking news and latest updates</p>
