Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) had a favorable safety profile in patients with severe allergic asthma, with significant improvements in lung function and reduced emergency department visits.

"This study reinforces the favorable safety profile of AIT in patients with well-controlled severe allergic asthma when administered in a specialized clinical setting," the authors wrote. "The findings support the use of AIT as a viable therapeutic option in this population — even in those receiving concomitant biological therapy — provided asthma control is maintained," they added.

Ana I. Tabar, MD, PhD, with the University Hospital of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on September 19, 2025, in the Journal of Asthma and Allergy.

This study was limited by its retrospective design and possibly missing data during the COVID ‑ 19 pandemic, a small overall sample — particularly few pediatric patients —precluding reliable subgroup analyses, potential geographic bias because over half of the participants were enrolled in Madrid centers, and the absence of a control group, limiting causal inference and definitive conclusions.

Several authors reported receiving research grants, consultancy fees, speaking honoraria, meeting travel assistance, or payment for manuscript preparation from various pharmaceutical companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Study: Impact of Ozone Exposure on Oral Microbiome: A Controlled, Randomized, Crossover Trial. Ozone is a toxic environmental pollutant with wide-ranging effects on the body. A new study in Environment & Health investigates the impact of ozone on the oral microbiome and lung function. Ozone is formed during the light-induced reactions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Ozone levels are rising worldwide, mainly from vehicle exhaust and industrial processes. Ozone is a poison capable of causing respiratory, nervous, and cardiovascular damage. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies ozone as a contributor to lung damage. In fact, each 10 ppb rise in ozone levels increases the risk of death from respiratory problems by 4% compared to other causes. Changes in the oral microbiome are linked to lung diseases such as pneumonia, COPD, lung cancer and asthma, and even cystic fibrosis. The current study was a randomized controlled trial comparing ozone exposure to filtered air to uncover the effects and relationship of ozone exposure on lung function and the oral microbiome in healthy adults. The study followed a randomized crossover design. In each arm, 29 individuals were randomly exposed to either filtered air or 280 ppb ozone for two hours. This concentration was chosen as it is close to the highest monthly average daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration of 286 ppb in Beijing, China. However, the exposure is much shorter than would occur in real-world conditions. The aim was to achieve a target average minute ventilation during exercise (VE) of 7-11 min/m2 body surface, ensuring uniform exposure for all participants. Various lung function tests were performed after exposure: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Samples were collected at the same time for oral microbiome analysis. After two weeks, the groups were switched. The whole experiment was completed in one month. When exposed to ozone, the measured ozone concentration in filtered air was stable at five parts per billion (ppb), vs 282 ppb. Following acute ozone exposure, lung function parameters declined immediately and observably. Forced vital capacity (FVC), which measures the maximal volume of air forcibly exhaled after full inhalation, fell by 12% (410 mL) on average. The volume forcefully exhaled in one second (forced expiratory volume in one second, FEV1) also decreased by 360 mL, a 12% decline. The peak expiratory flow also dropped by 0.81 L/s (≈14%). Men accounted for the overall decrease, showing 14% to 17% reductions in FEV1, FVC, and PEF. This could be due to sex-specific differences in inflammatory pathways potentially triggered by ozone. Following ozone exposure, the oral microbiome became less diverse. Species richness, abundance, and chao indices fell by 21-22%. Ozone appears to selectively suppress microbial diversity as shown by a marked decrease in species numbers. Many of the affected species are linked to oral diseases, including dental caries, plaque, periodontitis, and squamous cell carcinoma. One, Haemophilus sputorum, is prominent in cases of lung inflammation and is commonly found in people with pus-producing infections of the nasopharynx. The microbiome alterations appear to be driven by ozone-dependent changes in specific metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and metabolism of multiple biomolecules. Importantly, the oral microbiome plays a role in responding to pollutants by breaking down harmful compounds. The study also found substantial changes in other microbes, with increases ranging from 55% to 80% and decreases from 30% to 36%, reflecting ozone's disruptive influence on community structure. Treponema medium was the single species that showed consistent change with ozone exposure in both sexes. It might act as a sensitive marker of ozone-related lung function. These taxa and pathway findings are exploratory, as none survived false discovery rate correction, a statistical method used to reduce false positives when many comparisons are tested at once. According to this analysis, changes in Treponema medium were consistent with a mediating role in the decreased lung function, which appears to be a sensitive indicator of ozone exposure. Men were more sensitive to ozone than females, showing poorer lung function and altered oral microbiome after exposure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers warn that ultraprocessed food has left a lasting imprint on older Americans, especially women, linking addictive eating to poorer physical and mental health. Ultraprocessed foods (UPF) represent a significant part of the American food market and have spread widely worldwide. Often made to be hyper-rewarding, these foods contribute 60% of American adults' energy intake. UPFs are typically industrially manufactured foods high in refined carbohydrates and added fats, with limited nutritional value. They are also designed to be highly rewarding through added flavors, textures, and palatable components, which may contribute to addictive-like intake patterns. These foods may activate brain reward pathways in ways similar to other addictive substances. These UPF consumption patterns fit the recognized criteria for a diagnosis of substance use disorder, or addiction. In previous research, the adult prevalence has been estimated at ~14%, similar to alcohol and smoking. In this study of older adults, the rate was 12%. People who are addicted to UPFs eat unhealthy diets with a lot of UPF but very little fruit and vegetables. They also tend to be obese or overweight, with a higher risk of diet-related conditions. Previous research has also linked UPF addiction with mental health challenges, such as depression, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. Adolescence and early adult life are characterized by impulsive and emotional behavior, driven by an increased urge to experience rewards, setting up an ideal environment for addiction. Early exposure to UPFs may have played a significant part in forming the food habits of these children of the 1960s and 1970s. The effects of lifelong eating habits often become visible in older age. Although tobacco companies have largely sold off their food industry holdings, the impact of decades of UPF marketing still lingers. There is only one prior study on UPF addiction in older adults, based on a large sample of female nurses. No mention was made of social isolation, despite its rising prevalence among older people and its role in addiction and mental disease. Unlike previous studies, which primarily focused on early adulthood and middle age, the current study investigated adults aged 50-80 who were children or young adults during the crucial period when UPFs were being actively introduced and took over the market. It included 2,038 adults, mostly White (about 70%), with a mean age of ~64. The study was conducted via telephone and online surveys in July 2022. The investigators used the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging (NPHA) to assess UPF addiction in adults aged at least 50. Women showed a 17% UPF addiction rate vs 7.5% in men. Women with annual incomes below $30,000 were more likely to have UPF addiction than wealthier women, though this pattern was not seen in men. These figures are higher than those of the earlier study, probably due to a more accurate condition estimation. Social norms ensured that most addiction behaviors were less prevalent among women, but this is changing with the current culture. In contrast to other addictions, UPF marketing not only targets both sexes equally but may even have targeted girls and young women specifically through supposed diet-friendly UPF options like low-fat cookies and microwave meals. The highly refined carbohydrate content in these foods, offered as weight-loss aids, contributed to their addictive potential. UPF addiction among adults aged 50-64 years is several times as prevalent as alcoholism or tobacco addiction in older adults overall (about 1.5% and 4%, respectively). All addictions were less common among adults aged 65-80 years. Conversely, the older subgroup was in their 20s and 30s. Addiction is much less likely when people are first exposed to the substance at 25 years or later. This finding suggests the need to identify critical developmental windows when UPF exposure should be avoided. The 50-64-year cohort is the first American cohort to have lived most of their lives surrounded by a food environment that predominantly offers UPFs. This suggests the alarming possibility that future generations will be at even greater risk of UPF addiction. The investigators examined other predictors for possible association with UPF addiction. They demonstrated a nearly 20-fold increase in UPF addiction among overweight men, and 11-fold among overweight women, similar to prior findings in the nurse study. However, the study only measured self-rated health, and further work is required to uncover which specific medical conditions may be linked. Poor mental health increased the risk of UPF addiction three- to four-fold, with social isolation being another strong predictor. Over one in five women aged 50-64 years met addiction criteria. These individuals may have been targeted by active UPF marketing in their teens and early adulthood. Further research should examine these associations to shape future public health and food policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DENVER — A menstruation education program delivered in schools has the potential to improve students' self-esteem and confidence in preparing to manage menstruation, meeting a “critical health need” in the community, according to a study presented at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2025 National Conference. “Preliminary evidence suggests that this program is well received by educators, parents, and youth,” reported Hannah Chiu, a medical student at the Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans. “Students remain actively engaged and ask questions openly despite initial expectations that they may shy away due to the taboo nature of menstruation.” Hands-on activities included designing a “period pouch,” making DIY heating pads with socks and rice, and practicing tampon insertion with a grapefruit. Although medical student volunteers teach the classroom sessions, parents and teachers can also facilitate workshops on their own using the online curriculum and with training from medical student volunteers. Michelle W. Escovedo, MD, an adolescent health specialist at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children's, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this study, expressed enthusiasm about the program to Medscape Medical News. In Louisiana, where the program was developed, sexual education in schools is not mandated, and only 11% of middle school and 24% of high school students received comprehensive sexual education in 2020, which does not explicitly cover menstruation, Chiu said. Escovedo said that having knowledge and preparation about menstruation can also help youth know when they should speak to a healthcare provider about issues they are experiencing. “I think basic education about what is normal and not normal in terms of period duration, flow, and frequency would help patients know when they should reach out to their doctors,” Escovedo said. According to the abstract presented, the most effective delivery method involved sessions with groups of less than 10 students of a similar age compared to larger groups from across more than four grade levels. The program used anonymous index cards for asking questions, permission slips from guardians, and online workshop material demonstrations. “Notably, pre-menstruators (ages 8-10) showed enthusiasm for more advanced topics, reinforcing the idea that preparedness fosters confidence,” Chiu reported. “This is generally when the first pubertal changes of breast development are occurring and a time when there are probably a lot of questions about what is coming,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An advanced AI tool can detect tiny brain lesions that cause severe epilepsy in children, allowing faster diagnosis, more precise treatment and a potential cure, according to a new study. Developed by a team at Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI) and The Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), the 'AI epilepsy detective' can find lesions (focal cortical dysplasias) the size of a blueberry, in up to 94 per cent of cases with the support of medical imaging. MCRI's Dr. Emma Macdonald-Laurs, a RCH neurologist, who led the team that created the detector, said more accurate diagnosis of cortical dysplasia would lead to faster referrals for epilepsy surgery, fewer seizures and improved long-term developmental outcomes. With more accurate imaging, neurosurgeons can develop a safer surgical roadmap to avoid important blood vessels and brain regions that control speech, thinking and movement and removing healthy brain tissue. Before using the AI detector's keen eye, the study found 80 per cent of patients had their diagnosis missed by human examination of their MRI results. MRI and FDG-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET scans) were used to train the detector, with children separated into training and test cohorts. Using information from both MRI and PET scans, the best result was recorded in the test cohort with a success rate of 94 per cent. Cortical dysplasias, which develop when the baby is still in the womb, are a common cause of drug-resistant seizures. Over time, frequent seizures impact on a child's behaviour, mood and ability to learn. "Epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia can, however, be improved or cured with epilepsy surgery if the abnormal brain tissue can be located and removed." But Dr Macdonald-Laurs said cortical dysplasias were hard to spot on routine MRIs, with less than half being recognised on a child's first scan. "Cortical dysplasias can be impossible for traditional MRI techniques to identify," she said. "Failure to locate the abnormal tissue slows the pathway to a definitive diagnosis and may stop a child being referred for potentially curative epilepsy surgery. "The longer a child continues to have uncontrolled seizures, the more likely they are to develop learning difficulties, including intellectual disability." Royal, 5, successfully underwent surgery after scans, aided by the detector, identified a cortical dysplasia. Mum Gurjinder said he went from having multiple seizures a day to now being seizure free following the procedure. "The worst being 19 seizures within just two hours. Every time Royal's whole body would freeze for at least a minute and as the days went on, he lost his appetite." Gurjinder said after Royal experienced a longer seizure, causing a heavy nosebleed, he was rushed to the local hospital where he was given antiseizure medications. "The whole ordeal took a huge toll on our family and we were struggling mentally," Gurjinder said. "We were so lucky that we quickly picked up that something was wrong because young children can't always explain what they are going through. "Without the assistance of the detector, it would have taken so much longer to achieve a diagnosis and Royal's health would have continued to deteriorate. We are so thankful that Royal is now back to his calm, friendly, patient self."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center have reported encouraging results from a phase 1B clinical trial showing that the immunotherapy drug avelumab, when combined with whole brain radiotherapy, may provide a safe and effective treatment option for patients with leptomeningeal disease, one of the most aggressive and difficult-to-treat complications of advanced cancer. Patients typically survive only a few weeks to months after diagnosis. Few prospective clinical trials have been conducted in this setting and treatment options remain limited. The study enrolled 15 patients with leptomeningeal disease from breast, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and other solid tumors. Patients received avelumab before, during and after whole brain radiotherapy. Survival benefit: 67% of patients were alive three months after treatment, with some surviving more than a year. Immune activity: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed that treatment stimulated an adaptive immune response, reducing levels of regulatory T cells and altering immune checkpoint activity in CD8+ T cells and macrophages. Patients with leptomeningeal disease face some of the poorest outcomes in oncology. Our trial shows that combining immunotherapy with radiation is safe and has signs of clinical benefit. These results set the stage for larger studies that could ultimately change the treatment landscape for this patient population." Yolanda Piña, M.D., neuro-oncologist at Moffitt and the study's lead author "By analyzing cerebrospinal fluid before and after treatment, we gained valuable insight into how the immune system responds," Forsyth said. The researchers note that while the study was small and designed primarily to assess safety, the survival outcomes and immune findings support moving forward with a phase 2 trial. This study was supported by Pfizer and was previously conducted under an alliance between the health care business of Merck KGaA and Pfizer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Science and artificial intelligence combined at the Medical University of South Carolina in a study that could lead to personalized repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS, for smokers who want to quit. He's an associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences who has done extensive research on TMS. His team published its findings in the journal Brain Connectivity. TMS uses electromagnetic pulses to affect brain activity and may be best known for its role in treating depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Side effects include discomfort at the stimulation site and headaches. TMS has also been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for smoking. Research has shown that multiple sessions of rTMS, specifically over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the brain, can cut cravings and cigarette consumption. The new MUSC study gets even more targeted than that, using a form of AI called machine learning to analyze images from the brain's neural networks to see if it's possible to predict which smokers are likely to benefit from multiple sessions of rTMS, also known as repetitive TMS. They looked at neural networks when participants were in a resting state, relaxed with their eyes closed, and when they were exposed to smoking photos. "The study gives us a roadmap to extend personalized rTMS and build an fMRI and multimodal biomarker pipeline. The methods can be used for other substance use disorders as well," Li said. "We were surprised to find that the salience network plays such a crucial role in smoking behavior. This makes the salience network a mechanistic bridge between rTMS neuromodulation and successful smoking cessation." They found that bridge with the help of machine learning. In machine learning, computers analyze and learn from data without being programmed to do so. They use algorithms that can spot statistical patterns and adapt to them. Here's how that earlier study was set up. The researchers recruited 42 people who wanted to quit smoking. The other got sham TMS that felt real. They all spent a minute-and-a-half before each TMS session interacting with things like cigarettes and ashtrays, then during the TMS, real or sham, watched videos of people smoking. There were 10 sessions per person over a two-week period. Li said thanks to the fMRI scans that were also part of that work, the newer study was able to build on its findings. The authors didn't report any conflicts of interest. The research team includes Kevin Caulfield, Ph.D.; Andrew Chen, Ph.D.; Christopher McMahan, Ph.D.; Karen Hartwell, M.D. Li said their relatively small study lays the groundwork for larger studies to further explore targeted TMS for smokers. "This demonstrates that MUSC researchers can use novel and high-impact technology to move beyond fixed-target stimulation into precision neuromodulation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, University of Chicago, and Harvard Medical School analyzed pre- and post-acquisition data for patient outcomes at hospitals bought by PE firms and compared that with similar data for hospitals that had not been acquired by such firms. Their report was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. They found that in-hospital mortality in the ED increased by 13.4% at PE hospitals but decreased during the same period at control hospitals. Senior author Zirui Song, MD, PhD, associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School, Boston, said that the increased deaths in the ED was a surprise. Transfers generally are reserved for the sickest patients, Song told Medscape Medical News. It was “striking,” said Song, that “mortality among the remaining patients actually went up, not down.” He also noted that mortality in the ICU did not decline, despite also having an on-average healthier population after the transfers. He and his co-authors believe the most likely explanation for the rise in in-hospital deaths for ED patients and an elevated transfer rate was a 16%-18% reduction in ED and ICU salary expenditures. The researchers also documented such reductions hospital-wide, with a 12% decrease in full-time equivalent employees and a 17% decrease in salary expenditures overall post-acquisition. The effects were more likely to be felt in the ED and ICU because those departments “are notably staffing-sensitive areas of patient care,” said Song. The authors found that PE-owned hospitals weren't responding to market forces when they made cuts. They were moving in the opposite direction of non-PE peer facilities. For instance, PE hospitals reduced ED and ICU salary expenditures after acquisition by 18% and 16%, respectively, while control hospitals increased spending. PE hospitals also reduced the number of average full-time employees per inpatient bed days. They analyzed 1 million ED visits at 47 PE-owned hospitals, compared to 6.1 million ED visits at 270 matched control hospitals. For instance, some 40% of intubated patients who were transferred were transferred within 1 day of intubation, said Song. PE hospitals had a 10.6% increase in ICU transfers when compared with controls. The authors had a lengthy list of limitations, chief among them was the fact that not every PE acquisition is alike. “Our sample of acquired hospitals may not represent other acquisitions,” they wrote. Still, the 270 hospitals studied are a big segment of PE-owned facilities. The Private Equity Stakeholders Project estimates that there are currently 488 PE-owned hospitals in the US, accounting for about 23% of all proprietary for-profit hospitals. “Hospital care in the US, especially in the EDs and ICUs, remains a labor-intensive, face-to-face endeavor where often you need all hands-on deck to take care of a critically ill patient,” said Song. “Staffing levels matter for patient safety and outcomes,” he said. Song disclosed that he has received consulting fees for serving as an expert witness in legal cases and on a physician panel advising the Research Triangle Institute on risk adjustment in the Medicare program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In experiments with mouse models of breast, pancreatic, and muscle cancers, researchers at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital report new evidence that a novel means of boosting the natural immune system prevents cancer recurrence and improves survival. Malignant tumors are often described as immune-suppressive or "immune cold," meaning the patient's immune system does not recognize or attack the tumors. Patients with these tumors typically respond poorly to conventional therapies and face worse prognoses. Building on their earlier research in breast cancer, the research team hypothesized that "spicing up" the tumor environment with immune activating agents improves the "fitness" of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and dramatically enhances immune responses to target tumors. These structures are critical in helping the immune system fight cancer, and their presence strongly correlates with improved treatment responses and patient survival. They then applied these stimuli to TLS-free tumors growing in mice, administering two immune-activating substances (agonists) that stimulate the protein STING and the lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR). Dual activation of STING and LTβR triggered a rapid response from killer T cells (CD8⁺ T cells), leading to strong tumor growth inhibition. These blood vessels functioned like dedicated gateways, enabling large numbers of T and B cells to enter the tumors and assemble into TLSs. Tumor‑specific IgG antibodies were detected, and plasma cells persisted in the bone marrow-evidence of durable, systemic immunity that can help protect against relapse. Together, the researchers say, the findings suggest early and combined efforts to boost T‑cell activity not only kill tumor cells directly but also induce TLS maturation that sustains and amplifies anti-tumor responses. Our findings show that we can therapeutically induce functional TLS in otherwise immune‑cold tumors. By building the right immune infrastructure inside tumors, we can potentiate the patient's own defenses-both T cell and B cell arms-against cancer growth, relapse, and metastasis." Masanobu Komatsu, Ph.D., principal investigator of the study and senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins All Children's Cancer & Blood Disorders Institute Komatsu's team is further investigating the mechanism of action of TLS therapy and preparing for its clinical application in adult and pediatric cancer patients. This research was supported by the National Cancer Institute/NIH R01 grants, the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Cancer Research Program, and the Florida Department of Health Bankhead Coley Cancer Research Program. Simultaneous STING and lymphotoxin-β receptor activation induces B cell responses in tertiary lymphoid structures to potentiate antitumor immunity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Within the first year of receiving a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) diagnosis, patients who took sotatercept in addition to standard-of-care therapy reduced the risk experiencing deterioration in health - such as less ability to exercise, worsening symptoms and unplanned hospitalizations - by 76%. Results were presented at the 2025 European Respiratory Society Congress in Amsterdam. These results are incredibly promising for patients early in their journey with pulmonary arterial hypertension, which still has limited treatment options." The clinical trial concluded early due to loss of clinical equipoise, meaning researchers felt they could not ethically continue the study due to overwhelmingly positive results for patients on sotatercept compared to placebo in recent sotatercept randomized, controlled trials. "PAH is a chronic, progressive condition with high morbidity and mortality, and many patients present at advanced stages of disease," McLaughlin said. "Our findings suggest early treatment with sotatercept may help patients to achieve and maintain a lower risk status and improve outcomes." Sotatercept is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, and is offered in concert with standard-of-care therapies. The medication offers a novel approach by targeting proteins called activins. Past studies of sotatercept showed benefits for patients with high-risk as well as those with longstanding pulmonary arterial hypertension. The ZENITH trial demonstrated a decreased risk of death, hospitalization and lung transplantation in those at high risk of death. HYPERION extends the evidence base to patients diagnosed within one year. Fewer than 2% of participants taking sotatercept in the HYPERION trial were hospitalized for worsening PAH symptoms, compared to 8.8% of the placebo group. The most common adverse events reported with sotatercept were nosebleeds and spider veins. "The positive effects of adding sotatercept to standard therapy in patients with PAH are remarkable," said Victor M. Moles, M.D., HYPERION investigator and clinical associate professor of internal medicine-cardiology at U-M Medical School Sotatercept for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension within the First Year after Diagnosis.
