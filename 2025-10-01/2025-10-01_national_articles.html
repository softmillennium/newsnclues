EXCLUSIVE - FBI Director Kash Patel is cutting ties with the Anti-Defamation League that the bureau forged under its former boss James Comey. "James Comey disgraced the FBI by writing ‘love letters' to the ADL and embedding agents with an extreme group functioning like a terrorist organization and the disgraceful operation they ran spying on Americans. That was not law enforcement, it was activism dressed up as counterterrorism, and it put Americans in danger," Patel told Fox News Digital. This FBI formally rejects Comey's policies and any partnership with the ADL," he added. He began by referencing a 2014 speech which he called a "love letter to the ADL," adding, "Three years later I can say, from the perspective of the FBI, we're still in love with you." "We are not only educating ourselves, we are working with the ADL to build bridges in the communities we serve," Comey said in his 2017 speech. As a law enforcement and national security agency, yes. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on September 17, 2025 in Washington, DC. Patel is facing questions from lawmakers for the second straight day following a contentious hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee where he was criticized for his handling of investigations into the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk and the case related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The ADL has recently faced backlash from Elon Musk and Republican lawmakers for listing Turning Point USA (TPUSA), Charlie Kirk's organization, as an extremist group. As a result, the group removed its entire "Glossary of Extremism and Hate" on Tuesday. "With over 1,000 entries written over many years, the ADL Glossary of Extremism has served as a source of high-level information on a wide range of topics for years. "We also saw a number of entries intentionally misrepresented and misused." The organization also said that retiring the glossary would allow it "to explore new strategies and creative approaches to deliver our data and present our research more effectively." "It will keep us focused on ensuring we do what we do best: fighting antisemitism and hate in the most impactful ways possible." The outrage comes nearly three weeks after Kirk was assassinated during an event at Utah Valley University. "The FBI was taking their ‘hate group' definitions from ADL, which is why FBI was investigating Charlie Kirk [and] Turning Point, instead of his murderers," Musk wrote in a post on X. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said the organization needed to explain its categorization of TPUSA. "Seems to me like if they don't agree with you, they will label you a ‘hate group,'" Luna wrote on X. A liberal college professor wrote a New York Times essay about the importance of him sponsoring a Turning Point USA group on campus, when other faculty refused. TPUSA's backgrounder page on the ADL website falls under the "Center of Extremism" tag and describes the conservative group as having ties to "a range of right-wing extremists and has generated support from anti-Muslim bigots, alt-lite activists and some corners of the white supremacist alt-right." Fox News Digital contacted the ADL for comment but did not immediately receive a response. Fox News Digital's Elizabeth Pritchett contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jane Goodall, the conservationist renowned for her groundbreaking chimpanzee field research and globe-spanning environmental advocacy, has died. According to the institute, Goodall died of natural causes while in California on a U.S. speaking tour. Her discoveries “revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” the Institute said. While living among chimpanzees in Africa decades ago, Goodall documented the animals using tools and doing other activities previously believed to be exclusive to humans, and also noted their distinct personalities. “Out there in nature by myself, when you're alone, you can become part of nature and your humanity doesn't get in the way,” she told The Associated Press in 2021. Jane Goodall plays with Bahati, a 3-year-old female chimpanzee, at the Sweetwaters Chimpanzee Sanctuary near Nanyuki, north of Nairobi, on Dec. 6, 1997. In her later years, Goodall devoted decades to education and advocacy on humanitarian causes and protecting the natural world. From her base in the British coastal town of Bournemouth, she traveled nearly 300 days a year, even after she turned 90, to speak to packed auditoriums around the world. Between more serious messages, her speeches often featured her whooping like a chimpanzee or lamenting that Tarzan chose the wrong Jane. She didn't simply observe them from afar but immersed herself in every aspect of their lives. She fed them and gave them names instead of numbers, something for which she received pushback from some scientists. Her findings were circulated to millions when she first appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1963 and soon after in a popular documentary. One iconic image showed her crouching across from the infant chimpanzee named Flint. Each has arms outstretched, reaching for the other. Flint died about three weeks later after showing signs of grief, eating little and losing weight. Goodall has earned top civilian honors from a number of countries including Britain, France, Japan and Tanzania. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025 by then-U.S. President Joe Biden and won the prestigious Templeton Prize in 2021. “Her groundbreaking discoveries have changed humanity's understanding of its role in an interconnected world, and her advocacy has pointed to a greater purpose for our species in caring for life on this planet,” said the citation for the Templeton Prize, which honors individuals whose life's work embodies a fusion of science and spirituality. Goodall was also named a United Nations Messenger of Peace and published numerous books, including the bestselling autobiography “Reason for Hope.” She bought her first book — Edgar Rice Burroughs' “Tarzan of the Apes” — when she was 10 and soon made up her mind about her future: Live with wild animals in Africa. That plan stayed with her through a secretarial course when she was 18 and two different jobs. And by 1957, she accepted an invitation to travel to a farm in Kenya owned by a friend's parents. It was there that she met the famed anthropologist and paleontologist Louis Leakey at a natural history museum in Nairobi, and he gave her a job as an assistant secretary. Three years later, despite Goodall not having a college degree, Leakey asked if she would be interested in studying chimpanzees in what is now Tanzania. English primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall poses for a photograph at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 19, 2024. The chimps fled if she got within 500 yards (460 meters) of them. But she was eventually able to gain the animals' trust. By the fall of 1960 she observed the chimpanzee named David Greybeard make a tool from twigs and use it to fish termites from a nest. It was previously believed that only humans made and used tools. In other words, she found that there was no sharp line between humans and the animal kingdom. In later years, she discovered chimpanzees engage in a type of warfare, and in 1987 she and her staff observed a chimp “adopt” a 3-year-old orphan that wasn't closely related. Goodall received dozens of grants from the National Geographic Society during her field research tenure, starting in 1961. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, from left, primatologist Jane Goodall, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon participate in the People's Climate March in New York, Sept. 21, 2014. Her work moved into more global advocacy after she watched a disturbing film of experiments on laboratory animals at a conference in 1986. ″I knew I had to do something,″ she told the AP in 1997. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 and halted her in-person events, she began podcasting from her childhood home in England. Through dozens of “Jane Goodall Hopecast” episodes, she broadcast her discussions with guests including U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, author Margaret Atwood and marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. In later years, she pushed back on more aggressive tactics by climate activists, saying they could backfire, and criticized “gloom and doom” messaging for causing young people to lose hope. She also built a strong social media presence, posting to millions of followers about the need to end factory farming or offering tips on avoiding being paralyzed by the climate crisis. Her advice: “Focus on the present and make choices today whose impact will build over time.” The Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

A Missouri man is behind bars after authorities say he allegedly beat his mother to death with a gardening tool after demanding his inheritance. Derrick Alling, 39, is facing first-degree murder and armed criminal action charges, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Christian County deputies were called to the home of Carolyn Alling, 65, at around 9:30 p.m. on Sept. 25, after her husband, who is Derrick Alling's stepfather, requested a welfare check because she was not answering her phone, FOX 8 reported. Derrick Alling is facing alleged first-degree murder and armed criminal action charges in connection with the death of his mother, Carolyn Alling, according to court documents. When deputies arrived at the Ozark home, they were met by Derrick Alling and began asking him questions about his mother's whereabouts. Based on his answers, authorities quickly became suspicious of the victim's son. "They just had a gut feeling that something wasn't quite right, and they acted upon that," Sheriff Brad Cole told the outlet. Deputies reportedly asked Derrick Alling where his mother was, to which he responded she was in a guest house on the family's property and failed to answer when authorities asked about her condition. Carolyn Alling was allegedly beaten to death with a gardening tool by her son over an inheritance dispute in Ozark, Missouri, according to police. When deputies asked Derrick Alling if his mother was alive, he reportedly told him that "he didn't think so." "With the interaction, that's when they detained him, and then, they began investigating further and found the victim," Cole said. Authorities discovered Carolyn Alling's body in the family's guest house, where she appeared to have been brutally beaten with a gardening or scraping tool, according to FOX 8. Derrick Alling is currently being held without bond after pleading not guilty to allegedly killing his mother over an inheritance dispute, according to Christian County authorities. Fox News Digital was unable to immediately locate an attorney representing Derrick Alling. Prior to the alleged killing, the victim's husband reported that Derrick Alling made repeated threats toward his mother and demanded his inheritance from her, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. "The victim had been recording the defendant acting aggressively and violently towards her within weeks of her murder," authorities said. Prosecutors also revealed the stepfather also told police that he and his wife chose to "keep their marriage secret for fear of the defendant acting violently toward them if he found out." Carolyn Alling worked as a licensed dental hygienist, and previously lived in California with her late husband and two children before moving back to Missouri, according to her obituary. The Christian County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? As of 12:01 am ET, the US federal government has been shut down. Workers deemed “nonessential” are staying at home, meaning that many government functions (like national parks) will be closed because of a lack of staff. “Essential” workers, ranging from soldiers to air traffic controllers, will be working even after money for their paychecks runs out. This is happening, in large part, because the Democratic Party wants a fight. The shutdown could have been avoided if Democrats had agreed to allow a vote on a “continuing resolution” to fund the government, as they did in March. But this time around, Senate Democrats decided to filibuster the CR and indefinitely block government funding that Republicans have the votes to approve. The plan is to make this fight about health care. Obamacare subsidies for millions of Americans are set to expire at the end of the year, and Republicans have no interest in reauthorizing them. You can see the logic: Democrats poll well ahead of Republicans on health care; if they can refocus attention on the issue, they can drive Trump's already-dismal numbers down further and maybe even extract concessions on health policy. Last month, I argued that there were basically two strategic perspectives on how Democrats should fight Trump's authoritarianism: Team Normal and Team Abnormal. Team Normal thinks the best way to fight Trump is by treating him like a regular president — that if you can make public debate about “cost of living” issues where he polls worst, you'll be set up to win big in the next election and then wield the power of congressional majorities to frustrate his designs. Team Abnormal, by contrast, argues that acting like a regular opposition will cede too much ground to an authoritarian president — that you need to fight, frequently and perhaps in unprecedented ways, to prevent him from accruing too much power before it's too late. The idea is to use an extraordinary tactic of the sort favored by Team Abnormal toward a Team Normal end — refocusing public attention on an issue where Trump's numbers are especially bad. Except that this compromise ends up failing by either side's lights. A recent article by Matt Glassman, a professor at Georgetown who studies Congress, shows that all four recent shutdowns have failed to achieve their goals. Public opinion turns against those trying to leverage the shutdown, and they eventually cut a face-saving deal,” he explains. “Every party seems to think they can win the public opinion battle. To them, Trump's abuses of power are so uniquely dangerous that you can't just hand him a clean funding bill and hope for the best. But Democrats aren't acting like this government is different! They're making a demand that is purely the stuff of normal politics. There is no reason to believe that a shutdown tied to such a quotidian message can escape the problems that have doomed the past four failed attempts. For all these reasons, I think Democrats can't stay the course on their current strategy. The Team Normal solution is to cave as quickly as possible: come up with some kind of face-saving minor concession that allows them to end the shutdown and hope voters forget about all of this by next November. Such a climbdown would be highly embarrassing, and could well precipitate a revolt from the Democratic grassroots — among which disapproval of the party is at historic levels, largely due to a sense that leadership isn't doing enough to stop Trump. Alternatively, the party could pivot to a Team Abnormal posture: that Democrats will only be satisfied with a funding bill that addresses this underlying issue of lawlessness. Trump isn't negotiating on health care in good faith, because he has claimed various powers to cancel lawfully appropriated spending as he pleases. Democrats should insist on some specific provisions, like those in the proposed Congressional Power of the Purse Act, that would curtail Trump's ability to usurp Congress's constitutional powers. Matt Yglesias, who co-founded Vox and whom I normally think of as one of Team Normal's sharpest thinkers, suggested this morning that Democrats should begin more openly arguing along these lines. His view is that “I can't agree to a deal the other side won't honor” is an ironclad position for Democrats to defend in public appearances, one they can defend until Republicans become willing to end the shutdown by nuking the filibuster. But I think the real reason to do this is deeper than just short-term politics, or even policy — as Democrats almost assuredly won't be able to strongarm Republicans into reining in Trump via statute. In their recent book on how social change happens, philosophers Michael Brownstein, Alex Madva, and Daniel Kelly argue that people don't necessarily join causes because they think they're going to win in the short term. In fact, they find, people who join social movements can be downright pessimistic about their short-term prospects for victory. While these Democrats obviously couldn't hold out forever, their stand helped inspire Democrats in other states — like California and Texas — to push counter-gerrymanders in response to the Texas move. I recently spoke to Brownstein and Madva about the deeper roots of this theory. During our conversation, they cited a fascinating paper on what motivated anti-authoritarian protesters in Russia, Ukraine, Hong Kong, and Turkey. It found that these protesters did not, most of the time, believe that their demonstrations were going to bring down the government (though they did in Ukraine). Losing loudly helps build up this sense of shared identity. Even if the battle is doomed, the fact that you're willing to fight it builds up a broader sense that resistance is something we can be doing together, which is what you need to win the political war more broadly. Too often, Democrats look at poll numbers that show voters caring more about cost-of-living than authoritarianism and conclude that they have to focus on the former — ignoring the fact that political actors can shape what voters care about. If Democrats are seen refusing to fund the government because the government no longer operates according to laws, they can show the public that this crisis is serious — and that their rhetoric about a teetering democracy isn't just cynical partisan slop used to make normal political disputes over health care seem like something bigger. Unless and until Democratic leadership recognizes this bigger picture, and adjusts their tactics accordingly, their shutdown strategy will almost certainly be doomed to failure. No beards, a warrior ethos — and loyalty to the president. How do you negotiate with a man who can break his promises at any time? Trump is threatening to fire federal workers if the government shuts down. Many used to worry about China's power over the app — but American control is troubling, too.</p>

With a government shutdown in effect, both sides of the aisle are looking to place blame on the other. House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that while Democrats expressed outrage over the proposed legislation, it is similar to several continuing resolutions that passed under the Biden administration. "The nonpartisan clean CR only appears ‘partisan' because 212 House Democrats and 46 Senate Democrats chose to make it that way. This CR is the same short-term funding extension that virtually all Democrats voted to pass 13 times during the Biden Administration. Despite this voting history, nearly every Democrat has refused to support the current clean, nonpartisan funding extension to keep the government open and operational," Johnson said in a statement. During the Biden administration, there were 13 instances in which Congress enacted short-term funding measures, also known as continuing resolutions. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks as U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) looks on during a press conference on the first day of a partial government shutdown, at the U.S. Capitol, in Washington, D.C., Oct. 1, 2025. 5305, also known as the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act. This legislation gave the government nine weeks of funding and averted a shutdown. The act not only extended funding levels, but also added allocations for natural disaster relief and the influx of evacuees from Afghanistan following the Biden administration's botched withdrawal. Additionally, it extended programs and authorities such as the National Flood Insurance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity and the United States Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy, among others. Following the previous short-term funding measure, on Dec. 2, 2021, Congress enacted H.R. 6119, the Further Extending Government Funding Act, providing FY2022 appropriations through Feb. 18, 2022. Like the act before it, this legislation also provided appropriations for several federal agencies for activities related to Afghanistan evacuees. There was also an extension of the pay freeze for certain senior officials and political appointees in the executive branch. The Further Additional Extending Government Funding Act, H.R. 6617, went into effect on Feb. 18, 2022, as its predecessor expired. The legislation continued to fund most programs at FY2021 levels with some exceptions that provided what Congress referred to as "funding flexibility." The continuing resolution also included provisions on then-President Joe Biden's authority "draw down defense articles and services to respond to unforeseen emergencies" and the Department of the Interior's implementation of cybersecurity safeguards. Unlike previous continuing resolutions that gave the government weeks to avert a shutdown, the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2022, also known as H.J.Res. Just before this legislation was set to expire on March 15, 2022, Biden signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, which served as the omnibus appropriations package for FY2022.

(Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) It also provided supplemental appropriations that allowed the U.S. to help Ukraine and established a compensation program for victims of the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon fire in New Mexico. The Further Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2023, H.R. 1437, provided several extensions, though most of them were set to expire on Dec. 23, 2022. The Further Additional Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2023, H.R. 4373, extended FY2023 appropriations to several federal agencies through Dec. 30, 2022. Additionally, it extended expiring programs and authorities. On Dec. 29, 2022, an omnibus bill known as the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law. A closed sign stands in front of the National Archives on the first day of a government shutdown, Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025, in Washington. 5860, also known as the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2024 and Other Extensions Act, provided extensions of FY2024 appropriations for federal agencies through Nov. 17, 2023 and provided emergency funding for disaster relief. The Further Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024, H.R. The legislation was laddered, meaning it contained various expiration dates for different provisions. Some of the funding was set to be provided through Jan. 19, 2024, while other parts expired on Feb. 2, 2024. Additionally, it provided for a payment to the family of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who died in office. The Further Additional Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024, P.L. The legislation itself gave Congress more time to negotiate by making technical adjustments rather than sweeping policy changes. This acted as a continuation of the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act, 2024, and moved the March 1, 2024, expiration date to March 8. It included several appropriations bills, such as the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024; the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024; andthe Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024, among others.

Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, also known as H.R. 9747, which provided continuing FY2025 appropriations to federal agencies through Dec. 20, 2024. 10545, the American Relief Act, 2025, provided continuing FY2025 appropriations to federal agencies through March 14, 2025. It also provided supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and assistance related to hurricanes, wildfires, severe storms, flooding, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The legislation also included public health funding extensions through March 31, 2025.

Hamas still needs to agree to the plan that Netanyahu accepted on Monday, which would ultimately end Israel's military operation, disarm Hamas and pave the way for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip under a Palestinian governing body overseen by an international coalition headed by Trump. Trump said this could be the Israeli prime minister's "crowning achievement," but Netanyahu's acceptance of the plan could ultimately determine whether his government collapses or finds renewed support.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) In June, Netanyahu's right-wing coalition narrowly survived a push for early elections, which could have led to the dissolution of his government and advanced an election set for October 2026. But by July, his government lost the majority in the Israeli parliament after two of its parties withdrew from his coalition and left him in control of just 50 of the 120 seats, which could pose a significant threat should a push for early elections be attempted again. Netanyahu's party has continued to grow increasingly fractious, with hard-right members of his party threatening to bring down his government over any concessions made in the war against Hamas. "They thought they were headed toward ‘total victory' on the battlefield, a full-blown Israeli military occupation, the displacement of millions of Palestinians to the far reaches of the globe, and eventual Israeli resettlement and annexation of Gaza," security expert and Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America, John Hannah, told Fox News Digital. "This new Trump plan runs contrary to all their end-game objectives — even if, at least on paper, it does promise to meet a lot of Israel's core war aims in terms of returning all the hostages, disarming Hamas and ending its rule, and thoroughly demilitarizing and deradicalizing Gaza," he added. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir — who resigned in early 2025 over his opposition to the ceasefire and hostage deal that saw the release of 33 hostages before he was reinstated in March — has made clear his desire to see the annexation of Gaza with Israeli settlements moving in, and the complete elimination of Hamas. Trump's proposal, though it does not specifically pave a path for Palestinian statehood, does block Israeli annexation plans and would grant Hamas "amnesty" and a path out of Gaza if they disarm. On Tuesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich condemned Trump's plan as a "resounding diplomatic failure" and said it amounted to "a closing of eyes and turning our backs on all the lessons of October 7th." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with IDF commanders in the Netzarim Corridor in Gaza to discuss Hamas activity on Nov. 19, 2024. While Netanyahu faces immense pressure within his own party among those who believe he has conceded security demands, he also faces immense opposition among the public. His inability to secure a hostage deal and his continued aggressive military operations in Gaza have prompted many Israelis to question whether Netanyahu has prioritized military operations, and perhaps his political ambitions, over the return of the hostages who have been held for 725 days. Hannah pointed out that it would have been "disastrous" for Netanyahu not to accept Trump's plan, given Israel's growing isolationism on the global stage, but also amid rocky politics at home. "It's absolutely imperative for Israel's long-term security and, frankly, for Netanyahu's political future to keep the U.S. and Trump on side," he said, noting that Trump enjoys more popularity among Israelis than Netanyahu does. Approval ratings have repeatedly shown Netanyahu would be unlikely to survive an election were it to happen in the immediate term. "If you think predicting American elections is hard, you can't even imagine predicting Israeli elections given its multi-party parliamentary system," Richard Goldberg, senior advisor with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told Fox News Digital. "In the end, President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu appear more focused on substance than politics, with a deal that would get all the hostages out, force Hamas to surrender and protect Israel's long-term security." It is unclear how public opinion of Netanyahu could be reshaped by his acceptance of Trump's plan, particularly if Hamas also agrees to it and the hostages could be returned within 72-hours, as is stipulated under the proposal following a joint agreement. Protesters hold photos of hostages as they march during a rally calling for the Israeli government to sign a deal to release hostages held in the Gaza Strip on Aug. 26, 2025, in Tel Aviv, Israel. "Netanyahu is a seasoned and exhausting expert in ‘yes, but.' Other opposition leaders backed Netanyahu's agreement to the plan, including leader of the Blue and White Party, Benny Gantz, who said his party "would not allow petty politics to sabotage the plan." While it is unclear how Israel will respond to Netanyahu should a deal be reached, Goldberg argued that ultimately the deal is a win for Israel. "The devil is always in the details, and we are short on details, but from a principles perspective, this would be a clear Israeli victory," Goldberg said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump, from right, pumps his fist as he and first lady Melania Trump look to the crowd while attending the Club World Cup final soccer match, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., July 13, 2025. LONDON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump was reminded Wednesday that FIFA, not any government, ultimately decides which cities will host 2026 World Cup games. Trump suggested last week he could declare cities “not safe” for the 104-game soccer tournament next summer and alter a detailed hosting plan that FIFA confirmed in 2022. It includes NFL stadiums near New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The 11 U.S. host cities, plus three in Mexico and two in Canada, are contracted with FIFA which would face significant logistical and legal issues to make changes in the eight months before the June 11 kickoff. The Canadian president of North American regional soccer body CONCACAF said the sport is “bigger” than any current political debate. “With all due respect to current world leaders, football is bigger than them and football will survive their regime and their government and their slogans,” Montagliani said in an on-stage interview. “That's the beauty of our game, is that it is bigger than any individual and bigger than any country.” Trump's comments last week were in response to a question about World Cup cities that oppose his immigration and crime crackdowns. Any city that “is going to be even a little bit dangerous for the World Cup,” Trump said, also referring to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, “we'll move it around a little bit. But I hope that's not going to happen.” Trump has a close working relationship with FIFA president Gianni Infantino who is a regular visitor to the White House. Infantino has not publicly commented on the issue of cities being judged too dangerous to host games at the 48-team tournament that runs through July 19.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Top American military brass looked on in silence Tuesday as they sat for an extensive lecture from US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who wants to be known as the Secretary of War, and their commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump. But his demand that the military clean up and get more fit was less important than the new mission generals and admirals got from their commander-in-chief, who sees an invasion from within: American inner cities are “a big part of war now,” Trump said. If the brass didn't like it, they should leave the room, Trump said, apparently joking before issuing the warning: “Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future,” he said. “If the words I'm speaking today are making your hearts sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” he said. There will be new grooming standards – no more beards – and a new “highest male standard” physical fitness requirements for combat roles. “Climate change worship,” and “dudes in dresses,” are out, he said. The military should be thinking like it's 1990, Hegseth said, and axing any changes since the pre-Internet era that weren't “based on the evolving landscape of combat” but rather part of “a softening, weakening, or gender-based pursuit of other priorities.” As part of this, Hegseth said everyone in the military will have to pass a fitness test twice a year, including generals and admirals – a requirement not previously enforced. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority of warfighters,” he said, expressing that all he ever wanted as a young platoon leader was to have his hands untied. Retired Major Gen. Marilyn Quagliotti told CNN's Erin Burnett that she does not necessarily have a problem with the concept of raising standards, but she was very worried about the idea of rejecting rules of engagement. “Once you lose all discipline with an army, what you end up with is what we saw in Russia,” she said. “The American people do not want to see their army or their military act like that.” Russian forces have been accused of committing numerous atrocities, including in the ongoing war in Ukraine. Hegseth has long been skeptical of placing women in combat roles and he expects that adding a physical fitness test will be a barrier to them. He's also keen to weed out “weak men.” It was “an unfortunate focus on a culture war when we should be focused on military readiness,” said Kyleanne Hunter, a retired Major and former Marine combat pilot who is now CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans for America. The military had already been working to better prepare recruits, including with a pre-basic training camp for those who need help losing weight or meeting academic requirements, something that started before Trump took office and has been credited with helping the military meet recruitment goals. Both Hegseth and Trump said that they would bring back a “meritocracy,” which they argued has been jeopardized by diversity in the service. Hegseth is a combat veteran who served in the Minnesota National Guard and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. But his job before confirmation as Secretary of Defense was as weekend morning show host on Fox News. We're not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons because they are politically correct and you're not,” he said. He did not mention that his efforts to cull the federal civilian bureaucracy have been conducted with an eye to replace a meritocracy with more people who agree with his politics. But Trump's most important comments had to do with his defense of using US troops on American streets – something that could violate various US laws and turn the country against itself. Trump has already called National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Portland. The Department of Homeland Security requested 100 National Guard members for support in Chicago despite the opposition of local officials. Today, “America is under invasion from within,” he argued. “No different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways because they don't wear uniforms.” He is hoping to dispatch US troops to cities run by “radical left Democrats” around the country which he said would involve generals in the room. It's a war from within,” Trump said, and cities are going to be “training grounds for our military,” although he qualified it would be the National Guard deploying. On this front, he has already been testing US laws and traditions, which shy away from using the military inside the country. A federal judge ruled that his deployment of troops in Los Angeles around anti-ICE protests violated federal law. He's on firmer ground to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC, which is a federal city. But Trump wants troops in multiple other cities, regardless of what local officials say, to deal with either crime or anti-ICE protests. Such a move – using the military in multiple cities nationwide to deal with law enforcement that falls well short of rioting – is unprecedented in US history. What kind of generals do Trump and Hegseth want? Out with leaders like Gen. Mark Milley, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs during Trump's first term and drew the president's ire in part because he opposed deploying American troops inside the US. In with generals like World War II hero Gen. George Patton. Patton is long gone, but many in the audience have served with Milley. It may well have sounded like a warning about what happens when you cross Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BERLIN (AP) — Three alleged members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of plotting attacks on Israeli or Jewish institutions in Germany, officials said. The suspects are set to appear in court Thursday. Germany's federal prosecutor said they have been involved in procuring firearms since earlier this summer. Various weapons, including an AK-47 rifle, and ammunition were found during a raid. They were only named as Abed Al G., Wael F. M., and Ahmad I., in line with German privacy rules. Hamas has carried out hundreds of attacks against Israeli civilians over the years but has rarely operated outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. Questions will likely be raised over whether the suspects were acting on orders from Hamas' leadership or if they were merely sympathizers with Hamas or the Palestinian cause. The arrests took place as Hamas said it would study U.S. President Donald Trump's peace proposal to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza. A Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly two years ago killed some 1,200 people and 251 others were abducted. Most of the hostages have been freed under previous ceasefire deals, but 48 are still held in Gaza — around 20 believed by Israel to be alive. Israel's subsequent campaign in Gaza has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 170,000 others, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its toll, but has said women and children make up around half of the dead. Police in many European countries have been on heightened alert since the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Some forces have boosted security and patrols against possible attacks against Jewish or Israeli sites in recent months amid a spike of antisemitic violence on the continent and beyond.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Lisa Cook to remain as a Federal Reserve governor for now, declining to act on the Trump administration's effort to immediately remove her from the central bank. In a brief unsigned order, the high court said it would hear arguments in January over Republican President Donald Trump's effort to force Cook off the Fed board. The court will consider whether to block a lower-court ruling in Cook's favor while her challenge to her firing by Trump continues. The high-court order was a rare instance of Trump not quickly getting everything he wants from the justices in an emergency appeal.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Separately, the justices are hearing arguments in December in a separate but related legal fight over Trump's actions to fire members of the boards that oversee other independent federal agencies. The case concerns whether Trump can fire those officials at will. But a second issue in the case could bear directly on Cook's fate: whether federal judges have the authority to prevent the firings or instead may only order back pay for officials who were wrongly dismissed. “President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said. The court already has suggested that it will view the Fed differently from other independent agencies and Wednesday's order is another demonstration of that distinction, said Lev Menand, a professor at Columbia Law School and author of a book on the Fed. “The court seems to be steering a different course here,” Menand said. Cook, who was appointed to the Fed board by Democratic President Joe Biden, has said she will not leave her job and won't be “bullied” by Trump. One of her lawyers, Abbe Lowell, has said she “will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.” Separately, Senate Republicans recently confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to an open spot on the Fed's board. Both Cook and Miran took part in last month's meeting. Miran was the sole dissenting vote, preferring a larger cut. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as “primary residences” in June and July 2021, before she joined the Fed board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home. “Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself — and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his Supreme Court filing. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook specified that her Atlanta condo would be a “vacation home,” according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired “for cause,” which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed. Trump's lawyers have argued that even if the conduct occurred before her time as governor, her alleged action “indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy.” AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That move came despite Trump's request for Cook to be removed immediately. In that sense, the order was a win for Cook – and a rare instance in which the court has decided against quickly jettisoning federal officials Trump has fired. The high court's brief and unsigned order came months after a majority of justices appeared to draw a line of protection around the Fed, calling the rate-setting agency a “uniquely structured” entity with a “distinct historical tradition” shielding it from presidential politics – even as the court has permitted Trump to fire leaders at other agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission. Trump fired Cook in late August after a member of his administration alleged that she had committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence – a practice that can yield better loan terms. Other documents have subsequently revealed that Cook sometimes declared the second property as a “vacation home.” Cook has called those charges “manufactured” and argued that no court has reviewed them. “The Court's decision rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order,” Cook's legal team, which includes Abbe Lowell, said in a statement to CNN. Meanwhile, White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CNN in a statement: “President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.” If Trump is ultimately successful in dismissing Cook, it would mark the first time a Fed governor was fired by a president in the central bank's 111-year history. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority has allowed Trump to fire leaders at several agencies that, while they exist within the executive branch, Congress set up to have a degree of independence from the president. Lawmakers attempted to create that independence by requiring a president to show cause – such as malfeasance – before firing its leadership, a practice the Supreme Court upheld in a key 1935 decision. But Trump attempted to fire Cook under different circumstances. A federal court on September 10 blocked the move, finding that Trump had not “identified anything related to Cook's conduct or job performance as a board member that would indicate that she is harming the board or the public interest.” A federal appeals court declined to put that order on hold, and Trump quickly filed the emergency appeal at the Supreme Court. Perhaps sensing that some justices might be uneasy with letting a president meddle with the central bank, Cook argued that siding with Trump would “eviscerate the independence” of the Fed and she warned that it could lead to “chaos and disruption” for US markets. ‘Full-throated assault on the First Amendment': Judge rips into Trump over attempts to deport pro-Palestinian academics Trump has been sharply critical of the Fed, especially Chair Jerome Powell, for keeping rates high, and critics say the administration's real goal in targeting Cook has been to pressure the agency. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate earlier this month for the first time since December and signaled more cuts are likely this year. The Supreme Court already agreed this term to hear arguments about the power of a president to fire leaders of independent agencies. Humphrey's, which also dealt with the FTC, allowed Congress to require presidents to show cause before dismissing board members overseeing independent agencies.

I've decided to run for Congress again,” he told Fox News. “There's so many people that take advantage of freshman [members],” he added. During his single term, Cawthorn was mired in various controversies within weeks of one another. Most of the other charges were related to various traffic violations. After losing reelection in November 2022, he moved to Cape Coral, Florida. Years later, Cawthorn is hoping to make a political comeback. “I know what it means to be underestimated, and I know what it takes to fight back,” he said in his announcement video. Cawthorn will be facing off against five Republican candidates in the Florida House race, while Donalds is looking to succeed Gov.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early voting is already underway in the race between Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Republican Lt. Gov. Along with the New Jersey governor's race, it represents a critical gauge of the nation's political mood one year into Donald Trump's presidency. That reality means anxiety over government shutdowns and their economic fallout runs especially deep in northern Virginia's densely populated suburbs outside Washington, DC. Mike Magee, a 72-year-old retired former defense contractor from Aldie, said he was thinking about the threat of a shutdown Tuesday as he cast his early ballot for Spanberger. He said he believes Spanberger is an impressive candidate but also wanted to “send a message to our country that we need a change in direction.” Robert, a 71-year-old Navy veteran in Leesburg who asked to only be identified by his first name, said a shutdown was “one of the things on my mind” as he voted Tuesday. “If the government does get shut down, you can blame it on (Sen. Chuck) Schumer,” he said. “He wants everything to go back to the way it was under Joe Biden, and that's not the direction this country should be going in.” Races for governor in Virginia are often seen as barometers of the national mood: The state limits governors to one term, so it's always an open-seat race. Once a Republican-leaning state, Virginia now favors Democrats in presidential elections but remains competitive, as Republican Gov. Already, Trump's administration has slashed many federal jobs through Department of Government Efficiency-led firings and buyouts. The threat of further cuts looms after a memo issued last week by the White House's budget office said a shutdown would serve as a legal justification for sweeping new layoffs. Earle-Sears was among 14 Republican lieutenant governors who signed a letter dated Monday to Senate leaders in both parties, calling for Democrats to support a “clean” continuing resolution to keep the government funded into November — the approach favored by congressional Republicans. “It's the Democrats who are holding this up when all we want is a clean continuing resolution so that we can continue to negotiate,” she told CNN at a campaign event last week. The threat of a shutdown could force the two gubernatorial campaigns to focus on the same issue — a rarity in a race that has seen Spanberger seek to drive an economics and affordability-focused message, tying Earle-Sears to Trump's policies, while Earle-Sears has hammered her Democratic rival on cultural issues, notably trans participation in youth sports. Still, CNN's conversations with early voters made clear that a shutdown, and the ensuing battle over who is to blame, is far from the only factor being considered by voters — many of whom made up their minds long ago. Peter Gustafson, a 72-year-old retired graphic designer who lives near Leesburg, said “of course” he was thinking about the shutdown when he cast his vote for Spanberger on Tuesday. David Mohr, a 68-year-old information technology professional in Leesburg, said Earle-Sears was his choice because “her values, in terms of moving Virginia forward, keeping our kids safe in school — those are important for me.” “It's just, like, par for the course,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? No beards, a warrior ethos — and loyalty to the president. After the meeting, it's still not entirely clear what the expense and risk involved in bringing so many generals and admirals together was all for. Hegseth and President Donald Trump gave relatively short speeches that didn't break any news and were heavy on both men's familiar talking points. If there was a takeaway message, it was that any commanders who don't like Hegseth and Trump's recently rebranded “Department of War” are free to leave. Hegseth gave a progress report on his campaign to restore a “warrior ethos” to a military and Pentagon that he believes has gone “woke”: restoring “gender-neutral” performance standards, allowing drill sergeants to once again instill “healthy fear” in recruits, and rooting out “dudes in dresses,” “beardos,” and “fat generals.” He also vowed that the US military would no longer fight under “stupid rules of engagement.” The secretary, who is currently under internal investigation for handling of classified information ahead of US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, also teased changes to the Pentagon's inspector general process and the retention of “adverse information” on personnel records. Trump gave a discursive speech that included numerous references to his poll numbers, a fond reminiscence of the 1950s documentary Victory at Sea, and a reference to nuclear submarines as “the n-word,” but also included some chilling language implying that the military would increasingly be employed against the American people. Referring to the recent deployments of National Guard forces to American cities like Los Angeles and Washington, DC, as well as potential operations in Chicago and Portland, Trump described the US as “under invasion from within” and suggested to Hegseth that the military “should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds.” He also described Washington as more dangerous than Afghanistan to a crowd that included many officers who served in Afghanistan. Trump has given highly partisan speeches in front of military audiences before, but the president still seemed perturbed by the lack of crowd reaction, saying he had never walked into such a quiet room and telling the audience of generals that they could loosen up. This was in contrast to the raucous reception he got from soldiers during a speech at Fort Bragg last summer, who were reportedly vetted ahead of time for their political loyalty. “If the words I'm speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign. We would thank you for your service,” Hegseth said. It's been reported that many senior military commanders, including Gen. Dan Caine, the Trump-appointed chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have expressed misgivings about the Pentagon's new national security strategy, which emphasizes threats to the homeland over superpower competition with countries like China and Russia or maintaining military alliances abroad. Hegseth and Trump have already fired high-ranking officers, including former Joint Chiefs chair Gen. C.Q. Brown and chief of naval operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti. Both had been criticized by Hegseth as “DEI” hires. The gathering was “an informal loyalty test,” as defense analyst and Army veteran Sean McFate put it. The “program,” Trump and Hegseth appear to envisage, is a military that can be used on domestic “enemies” as often as foreign ones, is aligned with the administration on culture war issues, and is personally loyal to the president, not just as commander in chief but as a political figure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is charging forward with a wave of drug pricing initiatives as Republicans seek to dismantle Democrats' justification for shutting down the government over healthcare demands. As Democrats have dug their heels in over an extension of Obamacare insurance premium tax credits to give their support for a government funding patch, with funding lapsing at midnight on Sept. 30, Trump has moved forward with several health policy announcements, including his pharmaceutical tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical conglomerate Pfizer Inc. to decrease drug prices. This is part of his Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing plan, which he proposed in a May executive order, before he increased pressure on drug companies with a July letter demanding action. On Tuesday, Trump also announced a “TrumpRx” direct-to-consumer website through which the public can purchase Pfizer drugs at reduced prices, helping uninsured consumers. “It's going to have a huge impact on bringing Medicaid prices down.” With polling suggesting that Republicans do not prioritize healthcare compared to Democrats, Trump's Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing has also been pitched as an economic issue amid poor approval ratings for his economic management. Trump's Pfizer announcement — and a separate executive order signing on Tuesday regarding his plan to accelerate pediatric cancer research, including through artificial intelligence — comes a day before the introduction of his 100% tariff on brand-name or patented pharmaceutical products, which start on Wednesday. Drug companies can be exempted from the duties if they manufacture their products in the United States or have broken ground on a domestic manufacturing plant. The biggest loser will be Americans themselves, needlessly forced to pay higher prices for medicine.” However, the White House has downplayed those and other price increase-related concerns since Trump previewed his tariff and broader trade policy during the transition. “American workers, manufacturers, and communities have been dealing with the consequences of foreign cheating and lopsided ‘free' trade deals for decades,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday. Simultaneously, Trump and Republicans have been contending that Democrats hope to repeal One Big Beautiful Bill reforms restricting illegal immigrant access to public services, arguing that policies can be discussed without the deadline of a government shutdown. Complementing its protection of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the One Big Beautiful Bill cuts spending on entitlement programs, including Medicaid and food stamps, though its Medicaid work requirements will be implemented after the midterm elections. “The federal government by law that we passed does not fund health insurance for undocumented immigrants in Medicaid, period. “Undocumented immigrants do not get federal health insurance premiums, period. Regardless, Trump on Tuesday repeated that he does not want a government shutdown and reiterated his illegal immigrant claims before underscoring previous threats to fire more federal employees beyond the traditional furlough process. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, bad for them, and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,” he said. Democratic strategist Christopher Hahn defended Democrats for being “focused on restoring the disastrous cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and [Obamacare] that will cause millions of Americans to lose their health coverage and cause significant increases in premiums for tens of millions more.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As federal authorities rack up arrests in Tennessee's second-most populous city, local leaders in Oregon are pushing back on a White House effort to federalize 200 members of that state's National Guard over the president's claims of rampant crime in Portland. The moves mark the latest bid by President Donald Trump to surge federal officers or troops to Democratic-run cities, which he suggested this week could be used as a “training ground” for the nation's military. The list already includes Washington, DC, Los Angeles and Chicago. In Memphis, “219 officers were special deputized and our Joint Operations Center is up and running,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Tuesday. By the next morning, the “Memphis Safe Task Force ha(d) made 53 arrests and seized 20 illegal firearms,” said Bondi, who with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will visit the city this week, she told Fox News. Outside a county jail east of central Memphis, federal and state law enforcement – some in FBI vests – organized around sunrise Wednesday. In Oregon, meanwhile, local leaders are resisting, arguing this week in a federal lawsuit and a text exchange between the Democratic governor and a Trump aide that the GOP president's urge to quell “anarchy” in Portland is based on old and faulty intel – and boots are on the ground simply are not needed. In Memphis, Trump wants the federal task force to model what he has cast as the success of 2,000 National Guard troops in Washington. The operation, he said, calls for “large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel” and “strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.” While Memphis has seen high numbers of violent crimes such as homicides and carjackings in recent years, Democratic and Republican officials have noted decreases this year in some crime categories. Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, met Monday with federal agency officials, and talks continue about how the feds can support Memphis police, he said. “We've seen historic reductions in crime over the past 20 or so months, and we want to continue to build upon that. We do have every reason to believe that they are going to be collaborative and work with our police department throughout this process,” Young told CNN affiliate WHBQ at a Tuesday town hall, noting there wouldn't be an uptick in checkpoints, like in DC. Bill Lee would not expect more than 150 National Guard members sent to Memphis or for tanks to roll there, he has said, adding troops would not make arrests or be armed unless local authorities requested it. Opponents of a troop deployment in Memphis who gathered Saturday at City Hall argued federal resources instead should go to education, crime prevention, youth services and hospitals. But while at least some in Tennessee welcome federal support, Oregon's top leaders do not. A Sunday text message exchange between Kotek, a Democrat, and Trump assistant Natalie Harp further reflects the friction – and also raises more questions about whether footage of years-old unrest in Portland is spurring the latest federal action. “Governor: The ICE facility in Portland was attacked again last night,” reads a text Harp wrote was “from the President” and Kotek's office later shared via a public records request. “In fact, it, and other Federal Buildings, are being attacked on a nightly basis. Later Sunday, Kotek sent another message: “I just received your notice to mobilize the Oregon National guard outside of my control. You broke your promise to speak with me before taking further action against Portland. Within hours, Oregon and Portland officials sued the Trump administration, alleging the president's move to federalize state National Guard personnel is “unlawful” and “baseless” and claiming the White House is using protests as long ago as 2020 in and around Portland to justify the action. Trump sent federal law enforcement to Portland in 2020, when more than 700 officers were deployed to protect federal facilities downtown after some protests turned violent following the murder of Black father George Floyd in Minneapolis by a White police officer. An ICE facility some 2 miles south of downtown Portland has been at the center of near-constant protests this summer, including in June when a demonstration tied to the national “No Kings” movement turned violent. Police declared a riot outside the building and made three arrests. “The protests contained to a small area near Portland's ICE facility have been successfully managed by local law enforcement and do not in any way constitute a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,” Oregon officials' suit says. “This action was motivated by his desire to normalize the use of military troops for ordinary domestic law enforcement activity while also punishing politically disfavored jurisdictions like Portland, Oregon,” the suit continues. Still, in Trump's telling, Portland has been taken over by radical terrorists: “The Radical Left's reign of terror in Portland ends now,” the White House said Tuesday in a news release announcing the National Guard deployment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump posted a photo of his congressional leadership meeting featuring “Trump 2028” caps resting on his desk. Trump posted the photo to his Truth Social on Tuesday evening as the government is set to shut down at midnight. Punchbowl News reported that Trump offered Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) the hats, but they declined. Jeffries asked Vice President JD Vance how he felt about the hats, and he said, “No comment.” The room then erupted in laughter. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) also attended the meeting. The meeting, which proved unsuccessful in fending off a shutdown, was held on Monday. In this case, it's Senate Democrats who voted against the clean CR that passed the House of Representatives. The Democrat Shutdown,” he posted on X. The president has toyed with running for a third term in the past but said in August that he would “probably not” do so. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) suggested he wanted Trump to run for a third term in an interview with Fox News last week. I hope this never ends,” he said. Trump's latest reference to another term in office could be an attempt to provoke the Democrats who were in his office.</p>
