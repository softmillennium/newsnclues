                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: The Chi is coming to an end. The upcoming eighth season of the Chicago-set drama series created by Lena Waithe will be its last on Paramount+ with Showtime. “When I created The Chi, it wasn't just about making a TV show — it was about owning our narratives and telling our stories with truth, care, nuance and complexity. I am committed to delivering a final season that our Chi Family deserves.” Last month they commissioned a writers room for Dexter: Resurrection starring Michael C. Hall while canceling prequel series Dexter: Original Sin after one season. With its 8 seasons, The Chi has tied Dexter, Homeland and Weeds for the second-longest running series in Showtime's history, only behind Shameless and its 11 seasons. It also is the longest running Black drama on premium cable/streaming. “To helm the longest-running Black drama on television is a huge honor and it's something I don't take lightly.” From 20th Television, The Chi is a timely coming-of-age story centering on a group of residents on the South Side of Chicago who become linked by coincidence but bonded by the need for connection and redemption. Its ensemble cast included Jacob Latimore, Lynn Whitfield, Yolonda Ross, Shamon Brown Jr., Michael V. Epps, Birgundi Baker and Luke James. Kadeem Hardison, Chris Lee, Brett Gray, Rotimi, Jackie Long, Charmin Lee, Jill Marie Jones and Daniel J. Watts returned to guest star, alongside Hannaha Hall, Jason Weaver, La La Anthony, Vic Mensa, Kandi Burruss, Tai Davis, Rolando Boyce, Ahmad Ferguson, Cortez Smith, Genesis Denise Hale, Joel Steingold, Judae'a Brown, Zaria Imani Primer, L'lerrét Jazelle and Brian Keys. Emmy winner Waithe executive produces The Chi under her Hillman Grad banner alongside co-showrunners Justin Hillian of Hillianaire Productions and Jewel Coronel via Uncut Gems as well as Common, Aaron Kaplan of Kapital Entertainment, Rick Famuyiwa, Resheida Brady-Anderson, Derek Dudley and Shelby Stone of ID8 Multimedia, along with Naomi Funabashi and Rishi Rajani. “I'm deeply grateful to every single person who helped build this world — our writers, actors and crew who give so much of themselves to make this show what it is,” Waithe said. “As for what the future holds, I still plan on telling stories, continuing to build community, and making space for us all to be seen.” According to sources, conversations are underway with Waithe about extending her relationship with Paramount to future projects across the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. I didn't go for a starry premiere of the latest awards contender or to gawk at celebrities on the red carpet, but because a fellow journalist — then Roger Ebert‘s print editor at the Chicago Sun Times — was gracious enough to invite an aspiring film writer to meet other people and spend the weekend with a film-loving community. Though I've never been able to return since, Ebertfest has always held a special place in my heart. The connections I made at Ebertfest indirectly contributed to me one day arriving in Los Angeles and getting accepted into grad school at USC. Related Stories ‘V/H/S/Halloween' Review: Alex Ross Perry's Evil Short About a Cursed Video Store Highlights an Uneven Volume of the Annual Horror Anthology James Cameron Wants to Share His ‘Avatar' Tech, but ‘Directors Are Lone Wolves,' He Tells Us Last week, Roger Ebert's widow and the publisher of RogerEbert.com Chaz Ebert announced that, after 26 years, Ebertfest's run at the Virginia Theater in Champaign-Urbana at the University of Illinois would be coming to an end. “Roger said that ‘movies are a machine that generates empathy and allows us to understand the lives of a person of a different age, race, gender, religion, or socio-economic class for two hours at a time' and that kind of empathy remains much needed in our society to help us realize that we are all in this together,” Chaz Ebert wrote in her announcement. For now, the festival is on “hiatus,” not gone. It's hard to imagine how the festival might continue in a similar form if it winds up detached from Roger Ebert's hometown and alma mater at U of I. Ebert said that the festival has already been approached by concerned locals who are trying to figure out funding, and relocating elsewhere is still a possibility. But Ebertfest's homebase is at the Virginia Theater, a 1920s movie palace Ebertfest helped restore for this very occasion each year, so moving outside of Champaign-Urbana could be a tough sell. Ebert said that they're still processing what happened and are in an “incubator” before making any concrete decisions about what's next. If you haven't heard of Ebertfest during its 26-year history, that might because the festival has made no bones about trying to become the next Sundance or competing with even festivals to its north in Chicago. But Ebertfest has been around since 1999, first called the Overlooked Film Festival. He eventually changed the name to just “Ebertfest” when filmmakers said they didn't want their films to be considered “overlooked.” But those aren't the only hallmarks that make Ebertfest unique among film festivals. Annually situated in late April way away from the hectic awards season, Ebertfest does not accept submissions, it screens a mix of indies, international films, unheralded blockbusters, and repertory screenings. Champaign-Urbana is also at least a good 2.5 hours south of the major O'Hare Airport, so the people who turn up are typically college students who attend the university, locals, and a lot of Midwestern film critics, writers, and Ebert acolytes. Ebert, once upon a time, would take the Ebertfest crowd to hang out post-screenings at the local Steak ‘n' Shake, Ebert's favorite burger joint restaurant (think the Midwest's version of In ‘n' Out) that he literally owned stock in. Over the years, Chaz Ebert has been able to invite filmmakers from all over the world to attend, and she's even more honored that people are still showing up regularly and buying festival passes even before knowing what any of the films are going to be screened. All that was certainly true when I went in 2009, shortly after Ebert lost his ability to speak. I attended a panel of critics that featured folks like the Sun Times' Richard Roeper, the Chicago Tribune's recently-bought out Michael Phillips, and WGN broadcaster Dean Richards, and I asked about how I can one day break into the industry as a critic. Moderator David Bordwell, the film historian and academic, would later blog about the panel and mentioned how he was encouraged that this group of seasoned, jaded newspaper and TV men actually encouraged me to become a journalist as opposed to finding a more lucrative career as a coal miner or something. This year, Francis Ford Coppola Zoomed in to present “Megalopolis,” but that's about as big of a cameo as you'll get, and Ebertfest still screened it at 9 a.m. on a Thursday. Since Ebert's death in 2013 (coincidentally, in April, just weeks before the year's Ebertfest), Kohn said the festival has sold about 500 festival passes annually and also sells a number of individual tickets to locals every year. Before Ebert's death, the festival was pulling in twice those number of passes, but Chaz Ebert and Kohn have soldiered on in honor of Roger's legacy. While a number of options have been floated, Kohn is skeptical they can get anything achieved by next April in time for the '26 festival as it would have been. It's possible Ebertfest returns as a one-day event rather than a four-day festival, or it could return in some other form. Whatever happens, he calls it a “tremendous loss” for the local community. “Every year with Chaz, the day or two after the festival, we say, ‘We've got to do another,'” Kohn said.

Emily Blunt and Benny Safdie don't share a ton of screen time in Christopher Nolan's “Oppenheimer,” where Oscar nominee Blunt played rabblerouser-turned-steely-wife Kitty Oppenheimer, and Safdie appeared as “father of the hydrogen bomb” Edward Teller. More specifically, talking about what would become, three years later, Safdie's lauded solo directorial debut “The Smashing Machine.” A sports biopic of an entirely different stripe, “The Smashing Machine” stars Dwayne Johnson as iconic MMA fighter Mark Kerr (aka The Smashing Machine), with Blunt portraying his long-time partner Dawn Staples. The film follows Mark and Dawn through horrifically fraught times, as Mark battles an opioid addiction and Dawn struggles to support her mercurial man through personal and professional upheavals. The film was a smash at Venice, where our own Ryan Lattanzio called it “nimbly executed” with “sensational” performances that mark it for awards love, with Safdie walking away with Best Director. Related Stories Francis Ford Coppola Will Also Be Seeing ‘One Battle After Another' Multiple Times ‘Mishima' Was Unofficially Banned in Japan, but the Tokyo Film Festival Will Premiere It There This Fall Back in 2022, it was just a years-old idea that Safdie couldn't let go of, even when deep into work on Nolan's historical epic. One day in the makeup trailer, as Blunt told IndieWire during a recent interview, Safdie approached her with a strange ask. “He said, ‘You're friends with Dwayne Johnson, right?' And I was like, ‘What are you talking about? Fortunately, Safdie had a little bit of leeway with Blunt, who had long admired his work and was more tickled than confused by the question. “Benny Safdie, just his name is exciting because of what he's able to do and craft,” she said. “He had jet-fueled independent cinema for me in a way that was just so exciting.” Safdie was quick to share the broad strokes with his “Oppenheimer” castmate. “They were talking about ‘The Smashing Machine' in 2019, Dwayne had brought it to him, and then COVID happened, and it all kind of slipped through everyone's fingers,” Blunt said. Benny [explained that he] had sent DJ this yellow sweater that Mark Kerr wore with a really creepy note. Not creepy in its meaning, but Benny's handwriting looks like that of a serial killer. So I think some security guard was like, ‘This will be thrown out in the trash. So, no, Johnson had not gotten the sweater. But Blunt suddenly saw the potential for something big. “I had felt for years that DJ had this sort of untapped well of ability and life experience from the struggle he's been through to everything he's witnessed,” she said. In conversation, Blunt's admiration for Johnson is clear, and so is her interest in making sure other people recognize his talents and capabilities. “He's a true gent and so sweet and the most polite man I have ever met, ever,” she said. “I saw all of those qualities [before the film], but then when we started working together, we really made each other laugh, and we really gave each other a lot of shit. Suddenly, we had this relationship that was really fun, and as well as one in which I felt that he's someone you can really talk to. He's an amazing listener, and everyone feels this way about him. At the Venice press conference for “The Smashing Machine,” he called her his “best friend.” “We just knew we would become fast friends, and there was just a lot of trust,” Blunt said. What Blunt said she most admired about Johnson was his range. “I thought maybe he was quite like The Rock, and even though I know he's very proud of the name, now when I hear people calling out to him, ‘Hey, Rock,' I find it limits him or dehumanizes him in some ways. [The Rock] is an incredible character that he created, and so I started to wonder how many more bonkers people [he had] lurking inside his enormous infrastructure. He [turned out] to be one of our great character actors.” After Blunt reconnected Safdie and Johnson, Safdie sent her John Hyams' 2002 documentary about Kerr (also titled “The Smashing Machine”) to watch while they were still shooting “Oppenheimer.” If Blunt had initially been excited about the possibilities for Johnson and Safdie, the documentary introduced her to an entirely new obsession: Dawn Staples. “Immediately, I'm very interested in seeing her side of things, because I feel the documentary was made more under the male gaze and there was an enamored sense of how they perceive Mark,” she said. Even within the confines of Hyams' documentary, Blunt could see a very different Dawn, one she wanted to know. “I thought, there must be a whole different side to the story of someone who's living with an addict. Not only an addict, but someone whose life is on the line constantly, whether he's in the ring or he's down his own rabbit hole of addiction, someone whose entire identity collapses around him when he loses for the first time,” Blunt said. After Safdie, Johnson, and Blunt all officially boarded the film in late 2023, Blunt said she spoke to Staples three times in the lead-up to physical production. “People don't behave as you'd like them to. In movies, we often see people behave as we quite like, it makes us feel good, it makes us feel we've got something to live up to,” Blunt said. “I liked that she didn't have to be likable, my least favorite word to describe a female character on Earth.” “It was important to show those moments of deep connection and passion that they had for each other, and the joy, like a complete euphoric addiction to each other, which is why they couldn't quit each other. Blunt spoke to other fighters and their partners as well, and noticed “a very similar pattern” in their stories. “The wives talked about the two weeks leading up to a fight, [and they were] just the most eruptive, hazardous time to live with a fighter,” she said. “There would be holes in the walls all over the house, the relationship would erupt, they would split up, and then win or lose afterwards, then you need that soft place to land. Dawn would have to come back, and she said, ‘We were the perfect recipe because he was controlling and I was codependent. I was very scared, but we all flew into New York to be there when she watched it,” she said. “I think I would find it very frightening to see my whole life, especially my love life, especially things I'm not proud of, played out for everyone to see. And it would be someone else's interpretation of me. Thank Staples' uncanny self-awareness for what happened next. “She understood that we were making a movie, and this was going to be my version of her,” Blunt said. But after watching Safdie's film, Blunt shared, Staples told her, simply, “I feel very vindicated.” “At Toronto, they were both there, and they were so sweet and giving each other hugs and cheering each other on, even though they're not together anymore. I said to Mark backstage, ‘When I spoke to you and Dawn in the beginning, your story's completely aligned, completely.' Late in the film, Safdie stages one final battle between Mark and Dawn, an epic eight-and-a-half-minute sequence that plays out in real time, set to Bruce Springsteen's heartbreaker “Jungleland.” The pair's fight is fueled by the mundane (a busted dinner party) and the profound (Mark's addiction, Dawn's codependence, the constant pressure of professional fighting). This one, especially, I knew was going to be a monster, and I knew that the loving environment that Benny creates on set was going to really see us through. “She's putting down the crudités thinking, ‘I should probably just drop it. And then you see him going, ‘Have I got away with it? I think she knew with Mark where it was going to lead.” Blunt clarifies: she doesn't think Staples knew exactly where it was going to lead (and no spoilers here), but there was a momentum to the fight that clearly got away from both of them. “When speaking to Dawn and Mark about that night, it did hit a boiling point that neither of them had experienced in that way, where a gun is pulled, police are called, and the histrionics are out of control,” Blunt said. “We felt compelled then to really show the full wattage of what they could be like together in a fight.” In her recollection now, Blunt doesn't remember seeing a single light or a camera, as Safdie and the crew so carefully hid them. “I feel, as Dwayne has said, part of our souls were left on that bathroom floor, and I kind of think he's right. The fingerprints of that day are going to be on me for a very long time. We all sat on the bathroom floor, shell-shocked for an hour and a half after it. “It was sponsored by Dwayne's tequila company, I think.” At Venice, she recalled asking Safdie what he thought would happen when the film premiered. As Blunt, Johnson, Safdie, and the rest of the “Smashing” family are ready for whatever awards season might hold for them, Blunt is torn between her joy over the entire experience and her fear about putting it out into the world. It sure seems like she was meant for this one. There was no strategy or agenda other than to bring something really artistic and challenging onto the screen and tell it in such a unique way,” she said. It's a bit easier when you're in a movie where you're like, ‘I like this movie.' A24 releases “The Smashing Machine” in theaters on Friday, October 3.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Wednesday (Sept. 30), the streaming service opened up its immersive experience — which features themed decor, album visuals, video messages from Swift and, most importantly, Easter eggs — in honor of The Life of a Showgirl. Fans who visited the pop-up quickly uncovered phrases that turned out to be lyrics from songs on the album, which drops Friday (Oct. 3). One of them was scrawled in orange lettering across a mirror. After their respective reveals at the pop-up, each lyric was projected across Spotify billboards in different cities. The first one reached passersby in New York City, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, while the second went up on a billboard in São Paulo. Swift has also been dropping what appear to be more lines from the unreleased songs via not-so-randomly capitalized letters in her lyrics on Apple Music, including the phrase, “They don't make loyalty like they used to.” The lyrics are just a few pieces of the Showgirl puzzle that have been falling into place leading up to its release. Beyond the Spotify pop-up, Swift has several other exciting events planned for release week. On Friday, her The Release Party of a Showgirl film event will hit theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now in his 30s, Spencer Elden claimed the photo – one of the most iconic album covers in rock history – violated federal child pornography laws by displaying a sexualized image of a minor. But a federal judge ruled plainly on Tuesday that it was “not child pornography” – saying the famed image did not even come close to meeting the definition of such illegal content under federal law. Sylvan Esso Is Pulling Its Catalog From Spotify “Neither the pose, focal point, setting, nor overall context suggest the album cover features sexually explicit conduct,” Judge Fernando M. Olguin wrote in a ruling obtained and first reported by Billboard. In statement to Billboard, Nirvana's attorney Bert H. Deixler said: “We are delighted that the court has ended this meritless case and freed our creative clients of the stigma of false allegations.” An attorney for Elden did not immediately return a request for comment on the ruling. But in a 2021 civil lawsuit, Elden claimed it was something else entirely: the kind of “lascivious” display of a minor's genitals that's prohibited under federal child pornography statutes. “Spencer's true identity and legal name are forever tied to the commercial sexual exploitation he experienced as a minor,” his lawyers wrote at the time. Legal experts expressed doubts about the case when it was first filed, saying the image likely didn't meet the specific definition of child porn – and that Elden had seemed to repeatedly embrace the photo and his role in rock history before he decided to file a lawsuit. In 2022, Judge Olguin dismissed the case for a simpler reason: That Elden had waited far too long to file it in court, violating the statute of limitations. But an appeals court overturned that ruling a year later, reviving the lawsuit and sending it back to a trial judge for more litigation. “Nudity must be coupled with other circumstances that make the visual depiction lascivious or sexually provocative,” Judge Olguin wrote, quoting from an earlier ruling. “[His] actions relating to the album over time are difficult to square with his contentions that the album cover constitutes child pornography and that he sustained serious damages as a result.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Billboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Williams considered calling off her own performance in protest, she decided to go ahead with it in solidarity with the Kennedy Center staff and their union. At the end of her note at the time, Williams included a good-natured dig at Grenell, saying he could “come too… only if you can stomach sitting next to people who may not look like you or have your same politics… and if you can handle a polite verbal jab (or two) from me.” The D.C. chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans was already scheduled to hold its monthly meeting that night on the Kennedy Center terrace, but a widely-circulated email to members “encouraged” them to arrive early for Williams' concert. The email described Williams as “liberal,” adding, “She is apparently vocal [sic] opponent of President Trump and The Kennedy Center's decision to hold a vigil for Charlie Kirk. Let's make sure the audience is filled with patriots!” In a video of the performance, which is still up on YouTube, a loud bunch of boos can be heard after Williams said, “I don't support anyone affiliated with the Trump administration at all, especially you, Ric Grenell.” At one point, someone in the crowd allegedly told Williams that she should mention Kirk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amanda Knox is well aware that's a question people might have when they watch an episode of The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox. Eighteen years since the subsequent police investigation and trial transformed Knox from your average foreign-exchange student into an internationally known figure accused of murder and vilified in the press. Throughout the course of her Italian trials, where she was convicted of murder twice before finally being acquitted, her private diaries were dissected by journalists, old social-media posts were splashed across tabloids, and Knox herself was described on television and in court as a sex-crazed murderer nicknamed “Foxy Knoxy.” It was a uniquely traumatizing experience, one that followed her even after she flew home to America, got married, and became a mother. “At that time, I felt like no one would ever listen to me and no one would ever believe me,” Knox explains to Rolling Stone over Zoom from her Seattle home. The Hulu miniseries, which premiered Aug. 20 and is co-produced by Knox and Monica Lewinsky, takes a dramatized look at the true crime nightmare that saw Knox falsely imprisoned for years for a murder she says she absolutely did not commit. As viewers, we follow Knox (Grace Van Patten) though her trip to Italy, her friendship with Meredith (Rhianna Bareto), her romance with boyfriend Raffale Sollecito (Giuseppe De Domenico) and the ruthless investigation and eventual trial led by Italian prosecutor Giuliano Mignini (Francesco Aquaroli). For Knox, that human element was integral into why she decided now was the right time to see her story brought to life on screen. “When Monica reached out to me to work on this project, it was really important from the get go that this wasn't going to be what people typically think of when they think of a true crime story. We really wanted to convey that there are real human beings at the center of the story who are grappling with grief and loss and crisis. Knox broke down several key scenes from the final episode of The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, which she wrote with KJ Steinberg. As a true crime show, some might expect the final episode of The Twisted Tale to end with Knox's acquittal by an Italian court, exonerating her and her boyfriend Sollecito from Kercher's murder entirely. The episode shows viewers how Knox struck up a pen pal-esque relationship with her former prosecutor, Mignini — eventually corresponding regularly until she convinced him to meet her in Italy to talk. KJ Steinberg, executive producer, showrunner, and creator of the show, says that Knox's relationship with Mignini was the “most surprising” aspect of Knox's story for her — calling it “utterly fascinating” and akin to an epic tale. “Here are two of the most unlikely people to ever become inextricably linked by something,” Steinberg tells Rolling Stone.

Between sentences of Italian, the two falter, Knox in tears, Mignini unwilling to bend, and try to work their way through the case and their motivations. Knox says that portrayal was almost exactly how it happened. She corresponded with Mignini regularly, always avoiding talking about the trial, instead sticking to subjects like films and books. After months of letters, the two finally made plans to meet. Mignini has his own solo episode in the series, which portrays the prosecutor as a devout man desperate to root out evil in his city, but so dogged in his mission that he wrongfully saw Knox as a villain. It would have been easy for Knox to write off Mignini as a one-dimensional character, someone with no background and no reasoning for hurting her. But she says depicting Mignini as human was especially important to her. “With these true crime stories, we tend to freeze everyone in amber, and we define them by a moment in their life. And we don't recognize that all people are a process,” Knox says. I got a text message from him this morning. Knox's family members, her mother Edda Mellas (Sharon Horgan), father Curt Knox (John Hoogenakker) stepfather Chris Mellas (Joe Lanza), and sister Deanna (Anna Van Patten), are all featured in The Twisted Tale as a steadfast support system for Knox. When her family disagrees, Knox tearfully explains that she believes this is the only way to get closure. While Knox's friends and family acknowledge that it took a lot of courage to return to Italy, the series still shows the trip as a source of tension for everyone involved. In the show, Knox and her family to meet Mignini but are stopped by a car crash ahead of them in the road. As they pass it, an Italian police officer approaches their car. Knox's first trip to Italy was actually a conference for people wrongly convicted of crimes, a public visit where she was swarmed by paparazzi and “stalked constantly.” But Knox says those descriptions of nervous energy were taken almost verbatim from the discussions she and her family had prior to her second trip to meet up with Mignini. “My mom actually heard sirens when I was in the meeting with Giuliano, and she was deathly afraid that people were on their way to come arrest me,” Knox says. “And while that scene where we're driving by a car crash and a police officer comes by didn't happen in real life, driving into Italy was filled with dread. I didn't do anything wrong last time, and they threw me in prison. Much of the Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox is in Italian, from Amanda's first summer in Perugia to her contentious and highly publicized murder trial. “So much of what befell Amanda was at the hands of misinterpretation of language, and to me, there was no way but to embrace the confusion, and also to give an immersive experience into the culture,” Steinberg says. After her return to America, the Italian language still follows Amanda. When she is first home, she often switches to Italian accidentally in family settings, like when asking someone to pass the butter. Knox loves that hint of romance, because it's a loss she says many people don't recognize when they consider her story. Instead, it leaves viewers with a scene open to interpretation. Priest Don Saulo Scarabattoli (Alfredo Pea) worked at the prison and developed a deep and personal relationship with Amanda during her stay, even helping her to connect with Mignini after she returned to America. In the series' final scene, viewers see Scarabattoli enter a confession booth, a waiting parishioner ready to confess in the shaded space next to him. But when Scarabattoli turns, he is surprised — clearly recognizing the person sitting next to him. We hear a gasp and the series end, all without ever revealing who in Knox's story had finally come to ask for forgiveness. Bad Bunny's Super Bowl Performance Is Historic — And Controversial. Dem Says Mike Johnson Is Delaying Her Swearing-In to Prevent Epstein Vote Then He Wrote One of Music's Most Unusual Hit Singles It's something the media didn't let Knox do, so now it's a peace the writer and creator feels like she has to take for herself. We are all coming to terms with our pasts and making sense of them and trying to make peace with them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Let's just say, Nicole doesn't dispute that, but she's still shocked over it.”Both Kidman and Urban have yet to officially address these claims. Meanwhile, fans continue to rally behind Kidman as she navigates her divorce from Urban and speculation about him moving on. One fan noted, “While I believe that no one is perfect, I do believe that where there's smoke, there's fire. Even if Nicole wanted to fight for the marriage, she couldn't do it alone.” Another commented, “I pray the Lord bless her with a good man who wants to be married forever. Heartbreak is no joke, especially at this stage in life.” Their whirlwind romance led to an engagement in May 2006, followed by a romantic wedding the next month. However, their early years together were not without challenges. Through it all, Kidman remained supportive of her husband. In a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Urban said he was “very, very blessed” that Kidman took the necessary steps to help him. By November 2007, the couple had settled in Nashville, embracing family life. They went on to welcome two daughters — their first, Sunday Rose, in July 2008, and their second, Faith Margaret, in December 2010.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There have been plenty of sex-forward romantic comedies and relationship dramas in recent years: Babygirl, Challengers, Queer, and Fire Island all come to mind. The trailer alone sees Alexander Skarsgard and Harry Melling—ass out—wrestling in spandex singlets before Skarsgard's Colin tells Melling's Ray to go buy a butt plug, for he is too tight. The logline for Pillion simply reads: “A timid man is swept off his feet when an enigmatic, impossibly handsome biker takes him on as his submissive.” Having seen the film recently at the New York Film Festival, this writer can confirm that much is true, but that Pillion is far sexier, more hilarious, and more moving than such a logline might suggest. Based on the novel Box Hill by Adam Mars-Jones, Pillion premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival before debuting in North America at Telluride and then NYFF last month. Whether the version of Pillion that screened at these festivals is the version that makes it to its U.S. wide release still seems somewhat up in the air; Skarsgard and Lighton admitted to Variety in May that they had to make some cuts before debuting the picture at Cannes, and that there may be some more before it opens wide (or at least wider) in the U.S. According to Skarsgard after the premiere, “There's definitely a raunchier version of this movie… what you've seen is the family friendly version.” While we might not recommend taking your whole family with you, you can see Pillion for yourself in early 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Altschuler, at Iberseries & Platino Industria in Madrid, also said he is developing a series based on the book 'The Gangster's Guide to Sobriety: My Life in 12 Steps,' which he co-wrote. But what they know in Hollywood is that without a script, you have nothing.” “That is the biggest disconnect between America and Europe,” Altschuler concluded. Bringing together the successful, proven production processes of Hollywood and Europe's appreciation for art can create something new that combines the best of both worlds, he suggested. Tokyo Fest Unveils Lineup: Fan Bingbing, Tadanobu Asano, Rithy Panh and Palestine Epic Among Competition Highlights About his experience working on King of the Hill, he said: “I worked with Brad Pitt, Ben Stiller, Jennifer Aniston,” Altschuler said, highlighting that everyone wanted to be on that show back in the day. Altschuler also recalled coming up with the idea for Silicon Valley to put a comedic spotlight on the technology sector and culture, which he said wasn't shown in film or TV before. “The closest was The Big Bang Theory, a sitcom that was about geniuses, and it didn't get it right,” he argued, adding that, “I like big targets.” That is why season 1 of Silicon Valley, parodying them, keeps showing characters who say, “We don't want to make money, we just want to make the world a better place,” Altschuler explained, adding: “Now these really are some of the most horrible people. In terms of big picture commentary, Altschuler told the Iberseries audience that “IP, intellectual property, is everything.” And he shared that he is developing, as an Irish-U.K. co-production, a series based on The Gangster's Guide to Sobriety: My Life in 12 Steps, a book he co-wrote with Dave Krinsky and Richie Stephens.The first day of Iberseries had included appearances by executives from the likes of Disney+ Spain, the studio Gaumont, independent production powerhouse Banijay, and Telemundo Studios, with a late session starring Argentinian actress-turned-producer Luisana Lopilato, which was attended by her husband Michael Bublé.
