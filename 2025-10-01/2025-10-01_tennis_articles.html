                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That seems to be the motto of Terence Atmane, the explosive, fast-rising Frenchman known for his love of Pok√©mon and magic tricks. Having tasted the big-match atmosphere of playing then-World No. The 23-year-old left-hander didn't need to wait long. ‚ÄúHonestly, I was thinking about it all the time when I was practising in Dubai before coming to Asia, thinking about what I have to do on court to get closer to him every single day,‚Äù Atmane told ATPTour.com in Shanghai. ‚ÄúAnd the match [in Beijing] showed me that I can win a set, but at the same time, I'm not ready at all to be able to beat him in three. ‚ÄúIt showed me I'm doing the right things because I've done a better result than the last time [a 7-6(4), 6-2 loss in Cincinnati]. Life has changed a lot in the past two months for Atmane, who spent the majority of 2025 playing qualifying and ATP Challenger Tour events. His breakthrough in Cincinnati ‚Äì where he defeated Top 10 duo Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune and Next Gen ATP Finals champion Joao Fonseca en route to the quarter-finals - slashed his PIF ATP Ranking from 136 to 69 and the $332,000 cheque doubled his 2025 earnings. Disappointed to miss the US Open with a foot injury, Atmane was happy to make his comeback in Asia, where he enjoyed success earlier in the year, winning Challenger titles in Busan, South Korea, and Guangzhou, China. With a ‚Äògo-big-or-go-home' mentality, it's big matches with the likes of Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz [whom he has not yet played] that get his juices flowing. ‚ÄúIt's important to raise the bar, super high,‚Äù he said. All I want to do is become a better player and a better person every single day. Jannik, he's better than me, but for now, I cannot beat him. And this is exactly why I was so motivated to play him again. Now the next stage is going to be winning two sets, but it will take time, of course. ‚ÄúBut I keep giving it my best, because it's definitely my objective one day to beat players like Jannik and Carlos.
