                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Longtime investor Leon Cooperman believes we are in the late innings of a bull market where bubbles can form and risks rise, a stage of the cycle that Warren Buffett had warned about. The chair and CEO of the Omega Family Office read a quote from the "Oracle of Omaha" on CNBC's "Money Movers" Wednesday, which he said fits neatly with what he's seeing right now. "Once a bull market gets under way, and once you reach the point where everybody has made money no matter what system he or she followed, a crowd is attracted into the game that is responding not to interest rates and profits but simply to the fact that it seems a mistake to be out of stocks," Buffett said in 1999, according to a Fortune Magazine article. Buffett believes bull markets often end not only when valuations are stretched, but also when there is irrational exuberance and when the rally is fueled by momentum. "It's what's going on now," Cooperman said, adding that investors' mood is very similar and valuation on artificial intelligence companies is "ridiculously high." The S&P 500 has surged almost 40% since its April lows, returning to all-time highs. The rally has been led by mega-cap tech giants, which have invested billions in artificial intelligence and are being valued richly on the potential of this emerging era. The famous Buffett Indicator — the ratio of total U.S. stock market value to GDP — is also flashing one of the clearest signs of market exuberance. At 217%, it's also beyond the level Buffett once said is "playing with fire." While Cooperman thinks stocks could be risky with the late-cycle crowd behavior, he dislikes government bonds even more due to elevated inflation. Bonds pay fixed nominal interest, so higher inflation erodes their real returns. "Stocks are less risky than bonds at these levels," he said.

Microsoft employees are worried customers can't keep all of its Copilot products straight, but the company has a plan to address the confusion, according to audio from an internal meeting reviewed by Business Insider. In a recent all-employee town hall, a Microsoft employee asked how the company plans to make the fact that it has multiple Copilot apps less confusing to users. Microsoft has two different Copilot apps in mobile app stores. One consumer version built by Microsoft AI and another that's a rebranded Microsoft Office app called Copilot. They both open to a similar-looking chat experience, the employee said, and the average user likely wouldn't be able to tell that one has Word, Excel, and PowerPoint built into it. "The one way to make it less confusing is to have a billion users of each," Nadella said, drawing laughter from the crowd of employees. "No one is confused about the context of GitHub Copilot." Customers have learned to do profile switching between personal Microsoft accounts, or MSA, and a separate work or school account, internally called an Entra ID, he said. Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's consumer chief marketing officer, said 100 million monthly active users already use the combination of the two Copilots. Microsoft is also being more deliberate about how each Copilot gets promoted, Mehdi said. Mehdi is working with Mustafa Suleyman, who leads the consumer Copilot, and Rajesh Jha, who oversees the Microsoft 365 version, to decide which version Microsoft spotlights in different contexts. An advertising watchdog recently called out Microsoft's "universal use of the product description as 'Copilot'" and said "consumers would not necessarily understand the difference."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorneys general from five states sued Zillow and Redfin on Wednesday, alleging the companies schemed to stop competition in the online housing rental market. Officials from New York, Arizona, Connecticut, Washington and Virginia jointly filed the lawsuit Wednesday, citing a February deal between the two companies in which Zillow "paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its apartment rental advertising business and transfer its clients to Zillow," New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said in a news release. "This agreement is nothing more than an end run around competition that insulates Zillow from head-to-head competition on the merits with Redfin for customers advertising multifamily buildings," the lawsuit reads. It also claims that Redfin fired hundreds of employees and then worked with Zillow to rehire some of them. "Millions of New Yorkers rely on online apartment listings to find an affordable and safe place to live," James said in a statement. "Zillow's attempt to shut down its competition could drive up costs for advertisers and leave renters with fewer options when searching for a new apartment." Zillow, Redfin and CoStar, which owns Apartments.com, are the three largest players in the market and account for 85% of all market revenue, according to James' office. The AGs are seeking an injunction to bar the two companies from allegedly scheming and proposes a possible restructuring of the businesses to maintain competition. "Redfin strongly disagrees with the allegations and is confident we will be vindicated by a court of law," a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. "Our partnership with Zillow has given Redfin.com visitors access to more rental listings and our advertising customers access to more renters. By the end of 2024, it was clear that the existing number of Redfin advertising customers couldn't justify the cost of maintaining our rentals sales force. Partnering with Zillow cut those costs and enabled us to invest more in rental-search innovations on Redfin.com, directly benefiting apartment seekers." A Zillow spokesperson said the company maintains that its partnership with Redfin is "pro-competitive and pro-consumer by connecting property managers to more high-intent renters so they can fill their vacancies and more renters can get home." Shares of Zillow and Redfin's parent company Rocket Companies initially traded lower following the announcement, after each losing ground on Tuesday following the FTC's lawsuit. Zillow and Redfin both disagreed with those allegations and said they remained confident in their partnership. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Microsoft is promoting longtime sales chief Judson Althoff to an expanded role as CEO of the company's commercial business, CEO Satya Nadella announced Wednesday. Althoff's promotion and resulting reorganization will align sales, marketing, and operations at Microsoft as the company competes to win AI customers. "Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate," Nadella wrote in an email to employees and shared on Microsoft's blog. Althoff's new organization will combine sales, marketing, and operations into one unit for all of Microsoft's commercial products, including Microsoft's line of AI Copilots. He will also lead a new commercial leadership team that includes leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance. Microsoft Chief Marketing Officer Takeshi Numoto and his team will join the new organization and report directly to Althoff, except for companywide matters like corporate brand and communications, for which he will continue reporting to Nadella. We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both. History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise. Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the "number one seed" in the industry and our company's most important growth engine. Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration has frozen about $18 billion for two major infrastructure projects in New York City to ensure that funding is not "flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles," a top official said Wednesday. The funding is earmarked for the Hudson River Tunnel Project and the Second Avenue Subway project, said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. "Roughly $18 billion in New York City infrastructure projects have been put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles," Vought wrote. DEI refers to diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which have become a target for the Trump administration. It was not immediately clear what triggered the freeze on that basis. But the Department of Transportation later said that Secretary Sean Duffy's "position on the DBE program is clear – subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources." The DOT in a statement, said it had issued "an interim final rule (IFR) barring race- and sex-based contracting requirements from federal grants," and that it had sent "letters to New York to inform them that their two mega projects – the 2nd Avenue Subway and Hudson Tunnel – are under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring." "Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway. The remaining federal funding for these projects totals nearly $18 billion. Vought's announcement came on the first day of the shutdown of the U.S. government after Congress failed to pass stopgap funding bills that would have kept federal agencies and services operating at normal capacity for at least another seven weeks. "Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time," the DOT said, referring to the Senate's minority leader and and House minority leader, who are both Democrats from New York City. "Without a budget, the Department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review. "This is another unfortunate casualty of radical Democrats' reckless decision to hold the federal government hostage to give illegal immigrants benefits," the DOT said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft would like to mainly use its own chips in its data centers in the future, the tech giant's chief technology officer said on Wednesday, in a move which could reduce its reliance on major players like Nvidia and AMD. Semiconductors and the servers that sit inside data centers have underpinned the development of artificial intelligence models and applications. Tech giant Nvidia has dominated the space so far with its graphics processing unit (GPUs), while rival AMD has a smaller slice of the pie. Kevin Scott, chief technology officer at Microsoft, laid out the company's strategy around chips for AI during a fireside chat at Italian Tech Week that was moderated by CNBC. Microsoft primarily uses chips from Nvidia and AMD in its own data centers. "We're not religious about what the chips are. And ... that has meant the best price performance solution has been Nvidia for years and years now," Scott said. At the same time, Microsoft has been using some of its own chips. In 2023, Microsoft launched the Azure Maia AI Accelerator which is designed for AI workloads, as well as the Cobalt CPU. In addition, the firm is reportedly working on its next-generation of semiconductor products. When asked if the longer term plan is to have mainly Microsoft chips in the firm's own data centers, Scott said: "Absolutely," adding that the company is using "lots of Microsoft" silicon right now. The focus on chips is part of a strategy to eventually design an entire system that goes into the data center, Scott said. Microsoft and its rivals Google and Amazon are designing their own chips to not only reduce reliance on Nvidia and AMD, but also to make their products more efficient for their specific requirements. Tech giants including Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet and Microsoft have committed to more than $300 billion of capital expenditures this year, with much of that focused on AI investments as they look to satisfy booming demand for AI. Scott flagged that there is still a shortage of computing capacity. "[A] massive crunch [in compute] is probably an understatement," Scott said. "I think we have been in a mode where it's been almost impossible to build capacity fast enough since ChatGPT ... Microsoft has been building capacity through data centers but it's still not enough to meet demand, the CTO warned. "Even our most ambitious forecasts are just turning out to be insufficient on a regular basis. And so ... we deployed an incredible amount of capacity over the past year and it will be even more over the coming handful of years," Scott said.

The government is shut down, but it doesn't mean student-loan payments are. The government ran out of money to pay its bills on October 1 after Democratic and Republican lawmakers failed to reach a funding agreement. This means that each federal agency's shutdown contingency plans, which include furloughing thousands of federal employees, closing national parks, and delaying grant disbursements, are now being rolled out. According to the department's contingency plan, it will furlough 1,485 of its 1,700 employees, excluding the Federal Student Aid office. FSA will be staffed by just 115 employees during the shutdown. Even with the minimal FSA staff, the department said it will continue to disburse student aid like federal student loans and Pell Grants, and student-loan borrowers are still required to make their payments during the shutdown. Since funds for student aid programs are provided through mandatory appropriations, the department said, those programs will continue for the 9.9 million students who depend on student aid. FSA employees who are working in areas not directly related to student aid disbursement will be furloughed. How is the government shutdown affecting you? The government shut down in the middle of a week of negotiations on President Donald Trump's plan to overhaul student-loan repayment. "Failure to actively continue work towards promulgating these regulatory changes would substantially impair otherwise funded programs, like Pell Grants and direct loans, from implementing new statutory requirements by the statutory deadlines under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act," Andrade said. He's referring to the tight timeline the department has to implement a major overhaul of student-loan repayment. Specifically, the "big beautiful" spending legislation called for eliminating existing income-driven repayment plans and replacing them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan. The Office of Management and Budget said in a memo to federal agencies last week that they should "consider" terminating employees working in programs that are inconsistent with Trump's priorities.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon on Wednesday expanded its private-label grocery lineup with the launch of a new brand aimed at "price-conscious" shoppers, with most products priced under $5. The brand is called Amazon Grocery and includes more than 1,000 items, ranging from dairy, fresh produce, meat and seafood to snacks and baking essentials, the company said in a release. "During a time when consumers are particularly price-conscious, Amazon Grocery delivers more than 1,000 quality grocery items across all categories that don't compromise on quality or taste – from fresh food items to crave-worthy snacks and pantry essentials – all at low, competitive prices that help customers stretch their grocery budgets further," Jason Buechel, Amazon's vice president of worldwide grocery, said in a statement. Grocers and retail stocks slumped following Amazon's announcement. Albertsons dropped more than 2%, while Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Target all fell about 1%. It's not the first time Amazon has experimented with a budget-friendly grocery brand. It launched a similar offering last September, called Amazon Saver, that was "focused on value." The move comes as Amazon's grocery business has been in flux. The company has continued to streamline its chain of Go cashierless convenience stores and Fresh supermarkets, announcing last week that it will close all of its locations in the U.K. At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of "everyday essentials" within its online grocery business, which refers to items such as canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The dollar was little changed Wednesday, recovering from earlier declines, as traders weighed the potential fallout from a U.S. government shutdown. Earlier in the day, it fell more than 0.2%, putting it on pace for its worst annual decline in 22 years. The U.S. government shut down  after the Senate failed to pass a short-term funding bill, and Democrats led by Senate minority leader Sen. Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries push for a measure to extend enhanced Obamacare tax credits. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, threatened benefit cuts for "large numbers of people" if an agreement wasn't reached. "Historically, shutdowns have corresponded with a weaker USD, though primarily against safe haven currencies" such as the yen, Swiss franc and euro, wrote FX analyst Daniel Tobon of Citigroup. "Given persistent [U.S. dollar] pessimism in the current market narrative, further increased U.S. political uncertainty should also pressure the USD lower. However, a quick resolution to the shutdown could lead to limited follow-through, keeping us in similar ranges to recent months." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US stocks are poised to open lower after the US government shut down on Wednesday. Here's where US stock futures stand at 9:15 a.m. Haven asset gold hit a fresh record high before retreating, and the US Dollar Index was slightly lower. History shows that markets generally take US government shutdowns in their stride. On Tuesday, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all closed in positive territory. However, the shutdown could create practical concerns for market participants, as the US nonfarm payrolls are scheduled for release on Friday, wrote Deutsche Bank analysts on Wednesday. "So as it stands, we won't get a jobs report on Friday, as the BLS aren't releasing new data," they wrote. Should the shutdown go on, other data sets, including inflation numbers — used to gauge the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions — could also be delayed. "This could spell significant, even if only temporary, economic disruptions," wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research for Asia excluding Japan, in a Tuesday note. "A shutdown may inadvertently amplify risks of policy missteps due to data obfuscations amid interrupted fits and starts to economic momentum," Varathan added.</p>

A new report from wealth intelligence firm Altrata released on Tuesday shows that Florida, Texas, and Utah are set to experience the fastest growth in ultra-high-net-worth individuals — those worth more than $30 million — over the next five years. Utah, buoyed by Salt Lake City's expanding business services sector and status as a luxury winter sports hub, is close behind with 8.1% growth. Texas, powered by Austin's booming tech industry and Houston's energy wealth, rounds up the top three with 7.9% growth. The findings highlight a broad shift underway in America's wealth map. The Sunshine State has emerged as a magnet for hedge fund managers and crypto investors alike, while Miami has established itself as a luxury real estate powerhouse. Texas has also attracted high-profile names: Elon Musk moved Tesla's headquarters from California to Austin in 2021, followed by other executives eager to escape the West Coast's higher costs. Utah, though smaller in scale, is now gaining attention as a desirable combination of lifestyle and business hub, with Salt Lake City drawing in both entrepreneurs and established fortunes. The Altrata report — which bases its estimates on national economic data and a proprietary database of millions of wealthy individuals — suggests that while California is still projected to see "firm" growth in ultrawealthy numbers to 2030 and remain the US state with the biggest population of multimillionaires by far, Florida, Utah, and Texas are set to expand faster. Florida, in particular, is growing at the fastest clip, while California's growth lags, even as it continues to hold onto its lead. For the country's wealthiest individuals, Miami condos, Austin tech campuses, and ski chalets in Utah's Wasatch Mountains are increasingly competing with Manhattan penthouses and Silicon Valley estates as the symbols of America's new elite.</p>

Karishma Mandal wanted to be at the center of the tech world — working in AI at a big-name company in San Francisco. So she moved across the country — and tapped every job search strategy in her toolbox, hoping to land an offer. Mandal's career journey — which would include interviews at Uber, Meta, Amazon, and Salesforce — began when she moved to the US from India in 2021 to pursue a master's in engineering management at Northwestern University. In her first few months on the job, Mandal said she missed working with people in person — and the time zone differences made it even harder to connect with colleagues. At the same time, she kept hearing about tech meetups and professional events happening regularly in San Francisco — opportunities she said were harder to find in Chicago. So she started planning a move, with the goal of eventually landing an AI-focused role at a large tech company. While layoffs across the US economy remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been hit particularly hard. Since the start of 2025, global tech companies — including Microsoft, Google, and Amazon — have collectively laid off more than 80,000 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi. These cuts have coincided with a broader slowdown in white-collar hiring. Amid tariff uncertainty and the early effects of AI adoption, US companies are now hiring at nearly the slowest pace since 2014. Still, some job seekers have found ways to break through.

Rather than simply applying to job listings, she looked for people who were actively posting about open product manager roles on LinkedIn. One trick she used was searching "product manager + hiring" — a combination that filtered for posts containing both terms. Then she'd apply LinkedIn's "past 24 hours" filter to surface the newest listings. Based on conversations with recruiters and her network, she said she thinks it's crucial to be among the first 20 or 30 applicants for a role. Career experts previously told Business Insider that being among the first applicants could give candidates an edge. Mandal was also strategic about how she submitted applications. She said an HR professional at one company told her they prioritized applications submitted directly through their website over those sourced via LinkedIn — even if the candidate was redirected there from a LinkedIn post. Mandal figured following that advice couldn't hurt her chances. To get an extra edge, Mandal said she used the referral platform Refer.me to secure referrals for roles at McKinsey and Best Buy. Over time, Mandal's job search strategies began to pay off. She said reaching out to an Amazon recruiter and an Uber hiring manager on LinkedIn — after seeing their posts about open roles — helped her secure interviews at both companies. Business Insider has verified her interview offers by reviewing emails she received from the respective companies. Mandal said her Uber interview included a case study involving AI tools built around user communication data, while Meta's featured questions about measuring the performance of AI features on Instagram. These interviews didn't ultimately lead to offers. But in late 2024, Mandal messaged a Salesforce recruiter on LinkedIn who had posted about an AI-related product manager role — and eventually heard back to schedule an interview. Over the next several weeks, Mandal said she went through a seven-round interview process that included a design exercise where she was asked to create an AI-powered lawn mower; conversations with the engineering, product, and AI teams; and a final interview with a senior leader. "They're not limited to behavioral questions," she said of Salesforce interviews. Mandal said she received an offer from Salesforce around the end of the year, which included a six-figure salary about 40% higher than what she earned in her previous role. While San Francisco's high cost of living has been frustrating at times, she said the career benefits have made relocating from Chicago worthwhile. "If you are trying to make a big career move in tech, I'd recommend living in San Francisco and seeing how you can leverage your network," she said.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 18-year-old Arlan Rakhmetzhanov, the founder of AI coding agents startup Nozomio, who just completed Y Combinator and raised $6.2 million in funding. The following has been edited for length and clarity. When I was around 11 years old, my dad told me about Y Combinator for the first time. We were on a walk by the river in my hometown of Almaty, Kazakhstan, and I didn't really understand the concept of a school for founders — but it captured my imagination. Both of my parents are entrepreneurs, and my own journey started young, helping sell clothes at my grandmother's store after school, where she gave me a small cut of each sale I helped make. In the years that followed, I started reading more about Silicon Valley and figures like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. They were self-taught engineers who didn't just manage people, but knew how to build things. I took my first computer science course as a freshman and taught myself coding at my American high school in Kazakhstan. I started building my first company at 15, when ChatGPT came out. By junior year, I'd been ready to leave school for a while. In December, I launched my current company, the product lab Nozomio, after becoming interested in code generation and experimenting with Cursor Composer and GitHub Copilot. I got kicked out of my math class for taking the investor call, which ultimately led to my pre-seed, but luckily, the principal let me take it in her office. In March, I finally had a reason to leave school: to attend the Entrepreneurs First talent investor in London. But the investment wasn't a great deal, and I'd closed my pre-seed shortly after touching down, so I ended up dropping out. In the back of my mind, it was still a childhood dream to get into Y Combinator. I'd applied twice unsuccessfully — and my dad's application had also been rejected for his own AI startup, which fueled my resolve even more. She was pissed for a solid week, worried I wouldn't have a backup plan if things didn't work out. And being young gives you a head start. There's still time if you fail, which is why young people try crazy things. The seed was led by CRV, BoxGroup, LocalGlobe, and Y Combinator, with participation from angels including Paul Graham and the CTO of Spotify. I plan to use the funds to make my first hire once I can't handle all of Nozomio's customers singlehandedly.</p>
