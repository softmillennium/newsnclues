With a brutal heatwave blanketing swathes of the eastern United States, adapting to the weather has become a key focus for coaches and players. Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca meanwhile cut short his team's training session in Philadelphia on June 23 as the City of Brotherly Love baked in temperatures of 37.2 C. They will probably win this tournament,” Kovac said. While cooling breaks midway through each half have become standard during the tournament, Dortmund, like other teams, are taking extra steps to mitigate the heat and humidity. A recent study published by the International Journal of Biometeorology warned of the risk posed by extreme heat at the tournament for players and spectators, citing climate change as a cause of “extreme heat” events that were “more frequent and intense.” The study argued for games to be scheduled outside of the afternoon windows when conditions were typically at their most fierce. On June 24, Boca Juniors' game against Auckland City became the fifth match of the tournament to experience a lengthy delay due to public safety regulations used in the United States that mandate play is halted whenever lightning is within 16.1 kilometers of a stadium. “Most of the eastern United States is breaking records, and then that happens almost every summer. To expect something similar next year as a possibility is something that people should prepare for if you're going to come and enjoy the games.” While heat was an issue when the United States last hosted the World Cup finals in 1994, no games at that tournament were halted by storm warnings. That is due to increasingly sophisticated forecasting technology, Schott said. “We're at a point now where we can start to see things almost a week in advance and predict them pretty accurately, as compared to 15-20 years ago,” Schott said. Schott said thunder and lightning were “par for the course” in several regions of North America. “We get a lot of moisture that pumps in from the Gulf of Mexico, and they get the afternoon thunderstorms [to] pop up. “So as we move towards World Cup 2026, things that we're seeing right now would be quite typical to be seen again.” FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by AFP.

Detainees at the “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp in the Florida Everglades say they are enduring inhumane conditions, including inadequate and maggot-infested food, inability to bathe, flooding, and denial of religious practice, CBS News Miami reported Tuesday. Officially known as Krome Detention Center, the 5,000-bed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration detention facility located on the grounds of a rarely used municipal airport approximately 20 miles west of Miami last week began receiving people arrested during the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. “They're not respecting our human rights,” one detainee told CBS News Miami during a phone interview. “I don't know their motive for doing this, if it's a form of torture,” he added. “They never take off the lights for 24 hours,” he claimed. “The mosquitoes are as big as elephants,” and “there's no water to take a bath, it's been four days since I've taken a bath.” A Colombian detainee said his mental health is breaking down. I've gone three days without taking my medicine,” he said. “It's impossible to sleep with this white light that's on all day.” On Monday, Florida state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-17) confirmed that “several immigrants who aren't facing any criminal charges” were nevertheless sent from the Orange County Jail in Orlando to Alligator Alcatraz. This, after Democratic state lawmakers were denied entry to the facility last week. Meanwhile, Alligator Alcatraz merchandise offered at the Florida Republican Party's online store has been “selling like hotcakes,” according to Evan Power, the state GOP chair. “Selling hats and merchandise for a place that is about to become a hell on Earth for thousands of people who are going to be subjected to some of the worst conditions and human rights abuses you could think of is disgusting,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a fleeting moment, Ukraine's conflict may have come full circle. In the past 48 hours, US President Donald Trump has perhaps said his most forcefully direct words yet on arming Ukraine. Let us start with Trump's comments on arming Ukraine, a reversion to a basic bedrock of US foreign policy for decades – opposing Russian aggression. “We're going to send some more weapons,” the president said Monday of Ukraine. Behind him, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth nodded, despite this contradiction of the administration's announcement days earlier of military shipments being stopped. A Pentagon spokesman later said that “at President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.” Related article Trump aides to discuss Ukraine weapons Tuesday after president says shipments will resume Zelensky urgently needs more Patriot interceptor missiles, which are the only way of taking down Russian ballistic missiles, and which only the US can authorize trade in. Enough is afoot to have led Zelensky to declare on Saturday his Trump call was “the best conversation we have had during this whole time, the most productive.” Trump's failure to provide details may be strategic, or a by-product of his occasional disdain for them. But while he may sound briefly a little more like his predecessor, Joe Biden, in terms of arming Ukraine, herein lies one stark difference. Biden publicly announced in agonizing detail every capability he gave Kyiv, perhaps hoping the transparency would avoid a sudden unexpected escalation with Moscow. Trump perhaps seeks to avoid that by saying less. But after barely six months in office, Trump finds himself back where Biden always was, after trying almost everything else – cosying up to then criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, falling out and making up with Zelensky, and spurning before eventually backing Europe. The most recent, record Russian use of drones to attack Kyiv exposed possibly critical shortcomings in the capital's air defenses. They would only have worsened without being resupplied, at a time when Ukraine has reported 160,000 Russian troops are massing to the north and east of the frontlines. The months ahead will be unpredictable and critical for Kyiv, even with renewed US military support. Trump's reversal may have stopped panic edging towards the risk of collapse. Patient diplomacy, gentle words, and even last week's brief pause in military aid – a Kremlin demand for a deal – still did nothing to change Putin's position. And so Trump has learned slowly, rejecting the travails of recent history, that Russia is an opponent. The end of the US' longest war in Afghanistan, in which Biden withdrew fast in the wake of a hasty deal signed by Trump with the Taliban, led to scenes that haunted Trump's predecessor and remain a potent stick with which Republicans beat Democrats. The repetition of a similar rout of American allies in Ukraine, or Eastern Europe, would be an indelible stain on the Republican or MAGA record. Meanwhile, after six months of toying with the ideas of diplomacy, the Kremlin is back where it started too: willing to accept a peace only if it is surrender by another name. Its recent goal has been achieved: it has flattered the White House's belief that it could talk out an end to the war, and taken enough time in talks that Russia's summer offensive is now adequately manned, and the ground below these troops hard. Related article Russia launches record number of drones at Ukraine after latest Trump-Putin phone call Sergey Lavrov told a Hungarian newspaper that the “underlying causes” of the war must be eliminated, and gave a long, expansive list of impossibles, including the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, lifting sanctions on Russia, rescinding all lawsuits against Russia, and returning the illegally seized Western-based assets.” It is a binary moment in Russian history, his narrative insists. To entertain a short, albeit deceptive ceasefire on American terms would contradict the urgency of that false story, and risk undermining the skimpy morale of his troops, whose lives his commanders often fritter away in brutal, frontal assaults. Putin can mollify Trump with talk of his desire for peace. His retreat back to type has been shorter and easier than Trump's. But still the Kremlin sees the enemy where it always has been, and where it always needs to be, for its war of choice to continue ending the lives of so many Russian men early. Moscow has tens of thousands more troops reportedly amassed to invade Ukraine yet again. Washington needs to help defend Ukraine or risk global embarrassment – the demise of its military hegemony. And Ukraine is still there, in the middle, watching both powers on either side vacillate and spin, yet holding on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The International Criminal Court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan. Haibatullah Akhundzada, supreme leader of the Taliban, and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, chief justice of the hardline Islamist group, are “criminally responsible” for carrying out persecution on gender-based grounds since “at least” August 15 2021, the ICC's chief prosecutor said back in January. Since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the group has implemented a string of oppressive measures against women and girls, even cracking down on the sound of women's voices in public. Girls have been barred from education after sixth grade. Women must veil their bodies and wear a face covering at all times in public, and have also been forbidden to look at men they are not related to. Related article Taliban raids and suspends Afghanistan's only nationwide women's radio station “While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday. Other people, including “allies of girls and women” and those with sexualities or gender identities viewed as “inconsistent with the Taliban's policy on gender,” were also targeted by the Taliban, the ICC said. The Taliban said in its Tuesday statement that the court demonstrated “enmity and hatred for the pure religion of Islam” by labelling its interpretation of Sharia law a crime against humanity. Lisa Davis, the ICC's Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said in a post on social media that this is “the first time in history” that an international tribunal has confirmed LGBTQ people to be “victims of crimes against humanity, namely gender persecution.” Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch, said that the arrest warrants could “provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.”</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this week in Washington, D.C. Trump and Netanyahu are discussing Israel's war in Gaza, with Netanyahu suggesting that new plans for the forced relocation of refugees to other countries would give Palestinians the “freedom” to choose. But what Palestinians actually want is “the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled,” says Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents and the author of Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is in Washington this week. On Monday, he met with President Trump and other officials at the White House for their third face-to-face meeting since Trump's new term. Ahead of dinner, Prime Minister Netanyahu told a reporter Israel and the U.S. are speaking to third countries about relocating Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu said it would give Palestinians free choice. PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I think President Trump had a brilliant vision. It shouldn't be a, you know, prison, should be an open place and give people free choice. We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realize what they always say, that they want to give the Palestinians a better future. And I think this will give, again, the freedom to choose. And I hope that we can secure it. Netanyahu also took the opportunity to announce he has nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and presented him with a nominating letter. The audio is a little bit hard to hear, so listen carefully. It's nominating you for the peace prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. Hopes around the world are high a ceasefire in Gaza could come out of this week's talks. Get this war criminal out of our streets! Get this war criminal out of our streets! MEGAN DIDAVI: I can't stand the fact that people are suffering and being killed the way they are. AMY GOODMAN: To discuss U.S.-Israel relations and more, we're joined by Peter Beinart. He is an editor-at-large at Jewish Currents. His most recent book, Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. He's also a professor at the Newmark School of Journalism at the City University of New York. His new opinion piece for The New York Times is headlined “Democrats Need to Understand That Opinions on Israel Are Changing Fast.” He joins us here in our New York studio. So, first, Peter, if you can start off by responding to this third little summit in Washington between Trump and Netanyahu, where Trump is saying that with the negotiators in Doha, Hamas and Israel, and his meetings with Netanyahu, that they are close to a 60-day ceasefire, what this means, and Netanyahu talking about finding the third country where they will relocate Palestinians to, and assuring people that they have freedom to choose? First of all, what kind of freedom is it when you have a territory where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth? And now you're talking about people's freedom to choose? The deeper irony is that Palestinians have actually been — in Gaza and beyond, have been asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose, since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza. They were expelled from their homes in what's now Israel. So, they do want the freedom to choose. But that's, of course, not the freedom they're being offered. The freedom they're being offered is to be made refugees again, because Gaza has been utterly destroyed, to go to some other place around the world so Israel can continue this process of ethnic cleansing. So, here you have Benjamin Netanyahu having been indicted by the International Criminal Court. Even some of America's partners in Europe have said that because they believe in international law, they would carry out that arrest warrant. In the United States, instead, Netanyahu is celebrated in a largely bipartisan way, including by Democrats, even though the man has been indicted as a war criminal by the International Criminal Court. What does it say about the Democratic Party's stated belief in the rules-based international order and human rights, that they would do such a thing? JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the growing opposition to Netanyahu's government within Israel, and many believing that he's continuing these armed conflicts precisely to prevent his day of reckoning in the Israeli courts and among the Israeli people? PETER BEINART: Well, I think something may have changed here now. I think it is widely believed in Israel that he was continuing this assault on Gaza, because if it ended, it would be clear that Israel had not achieved its goal, it had not destroyed Hamas, and then his government would fall apart, and he would go to elections, which many thought he would lose. I think what has shifted is, since Israel's bombing of Lebanon and Syria and Iran, Netanyahu's popularity has increased. He may now believe that he can agree to a ceasefire, even though it will be clear that the war has failed, that Hamas is not actually destroyed and defeated, but because of his — because what he did in Iran and Lebanon and Syria is popular, that he may be able to go to an election and think he can win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Court orders closure of 10 rentals that it found had inflicted psychological damage on family living in block A judge in Madrid has ordered the closure of 10 tourist flats in a single building in the city centre after a landmark ruling that said “the illicit and unsanitary activities” taking place in them had inflicted psychological damage on a neighbouring family and violated their fundamental right to privacy. The family, who have two children and who have not been named, said they had suffered stress, anxiety and sleep deprivation because of the loud, drunken, destructive and lewd behaviour of guests, which included vandalism, vomiting and having sex in the block's communal areas. The family live in a block of 60 flats near the Spanish capital's Plaza Mayor, 75% of which are run as tourist rentals. “The family have one tourist flat above them, another below them, and more tourist flats near their bedrooms,” said their lawyer, Miguel Ángel Rubio. But the problem is that [the companies that own these flats and others] can make more than €150,000 in rents in a single weekend, so a €16,000 fine is ​n​othing for them. So I had to bring a case on the grounds that the family's fundamental rights were being violated – and it succeeded.” Also proven were “guests using the common areas for sexual relations”, multiple police visits, “vomiting in the courtyards” and broken mailboxes and lift fittings. At one point, the judge said, things had got so bad that a security guard​ was hired. In recent years, increasing overtourism has exposed the scale of Spain's housing crisis and prompted nationwide protests. Last year, the mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, said he would end apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 by scrapping the licences of the 10,101 flats currently approved as short-term rentals. Although the Spanish government recently ordered Airbnb to take down more than 65,000 illegal adverts, a recent study by the consumer and social rights ministry found that more than 15,200 tourist flats in Madrid are operating without the necessary licences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies accused of supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine. The decree follows a statement by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which said it recovered Chinese-made parts from downed drones during a July 4 air assault on Kyiv. Russia's domestically produced drones based on Iran's Shahed-136 is a loitering munition extensively used by Russia to target Ukrainian cities, and is assembled with components sourced from around the world. China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, told journalists on July 7 that Russia's growing ability to sustain weapons production is being driven by a flow of Chinese components and materials. Ukraine has already sanctioned several Chinese companies tied to Russia's war effort. As Russian-Chinese relations deepen, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China in September, where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers rejected a nominee to lead the economic crimes agency, drawing swift criticism from lawmakers and businesses over alleged interference in the selection process. Seaborne crude flows averaged 3.12 million barrels a day over the four weeks to July 6, a 3% decline from the previous period ending June 29, according to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringleader, Dylan Earl, 21, had already pleaded guilty to aggravated arson over the 2024 blaze targeting companies that were supplying Elon Musk's Starlink satellite equipment to Ukraine. During the call with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed that Germany sell one of its own Patriot batteries to Ukraine. The decree follows a publication by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which said it recovered Chinese-made parts from downed Shahed drones during a July 4 air assault on Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin's partial mobilization decree from Sept. 21, 2022, remains in force and has never been formally rescinded. Rotterdam has previously handled weapons shipments, but this marks the first time that it will designate a special berth for military use.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's war for survival has created one of the world's most urgent — and uniquely demanding — defense markets. For foreign companies, the door is open, but only part way. The need is vast: drones, weapons, protective gear and battlefield technology are in constant demand. Success depends not only on quality products, but also on navigating complex logistics, passing strict vetting, and aligning with Ukraine's wartime priorities. The opportunity is real — but it rewards only those who are serious, transparent, and committed. While Ukraine's defense procurement follows official requirements, foreign firms can still generate demand from the ground up. In Ukraine's fast-moving combat environment, soldiers quickly identify what works. If a new drone, sensor, or vehicle proves its worth, field commanders often advocate for its inclusion in the official procurement catalog. While donations involve upfront costs, consider them marketing in the world's most demanding testing ground. Just be sure to coordinate with the military and collect user feedback. If there's interest from the military, a company must navigate Ukraine's bureaucratic eligibility requirements. Procurement has rapidly professionalized since 2022, with a shift toward NATO-oriented standards. One key step is codification: any weapon or equipment must have a NATO Stock Number (NSN) or equivalent national code to be officially procured. Securing an NSN or Ukrainian registration code ensures your item can be referenced in contracts and tracked through supply chains. Even abroad, Ukrainian codification can serve as a quality marker. Before winning a contract, foreign companies must be verified as eligible suppliers to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The DPA operates a single-window application process that requires all prospective suppliers to complete a detailed questionnaire and submit supporting documents. A background check follows, including review by the DPA's internal security unit. Full ownership transparency is mandatory, including disclosure of beneficial owners and affiliated investors. To strengthen your application, highlight international certifications such as ISO 9001 or AQAP (Allied Quality Assurance Publication). These indicate quality, traceability, and operational discipline — essential in combat conditions. Companies with histories of fraud, corruption, or contract breaches are unlikely to be approved. Assemble incorporation documents, financial records, compliance certifications, and references from previous government contracts. Once approved and added to the verified suppliers list, your company will receive direct Requests for Proposals when relevant needs arise. In February 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and praised the company's decision to localize production in Ukraine. Zelensky has repeated his vision of Ukraine as a “major military hub” built in partnership with Western defense firms. For foreign companies, long-term success increasingly depends on establishing a local presence. Joint ventures, assembly lines, R&D centers, or even maintenance and repair facilities can signal intent. Ukraine needs secure wartime supply lines and seeks technology transfer to build a resilient defense industry. Officials have made it clear: companies looking only to “export and forget” will be replaced by those that commit locally. Foreign manufacturers should therefore explore options to localize parts of their supply chain. This might include producing components in Ukraine, licensing local factories, or training Ukrainian staff. These steps not only strengthen ties with Kyiv but may also unlock incentives such as special tax conditions or co-financing. At a recent defense industry forum, Zelensky reiterated his goal that every advanced system used by the Armed Forces should eventually include Ukrainian-made components or support. To succeed in this market, foreign firms must align with that vision. In conclusion, Ukraine's defense market is not just a place to sell. It welcomes foreign cooperation — but on its own terms: transparency, localization, wartime readiness and shared strategic vision. Companies that meet these expectations will not only gain access to major procurement opportunities but will also contribute to one of the most consequential defense efforts of our time. For those who are serious — the door is open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most residents of Kerr County, Texas, would have been asleep when flood alerts flashed up on their phones in the early hours of Friday. A few hours later, many of them were woken by neighbours hammering on their door or their dogs frantically barking. Others would not have woken up until flood water engulfed their beds. The story leading up to this tragedy is one of grave mistakes. It is not about what happened when the Guadalupe burst its banks, or the immediate aftermath, where rescuers frantically tried to save lives. It is about how officials – in a Texan disaster hotspot known as Flash Flood Alley – failed to act years before. The disaster is one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of more than 100 and climbing - including 28 children. Dozens are still missing, with ten girls among them. Authorities vowed that one of the next steps would be investigating whether enough warnings were issued and why some camps did not evacuate or move to higher ground. Much of the camp, including a number of the cabins where the girls had been sleeping, is located in a zone with a one per cent annual chance of flooding. In such zones, residential construction tends to be heavily restricted or banned. Meanwhile, senior campers were staying in nine cabins further from the river in a section known as ‘Senior Hill'. Speaking on Monday afternoon, officers said questions would be answered “once we can get the search and rescue complete”. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, was quick to admit that “something went wrong”. “The fact that you have girls asleep in their cabins when the flood waters are rising — something went wrong there. We've got to fix that and have a better system of warning to get kids out of harm's way,” he told Fox News on Monday. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,” Judge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in the county, said on Friday. County officials had previously suggested flood sirens would be too “extravagant” and taxpayers would refuse to stump up for them. A further 10 girls, and one counsellor, are still unaccounted for. Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, pushed to create a warning system in 2016, but said it never materialised over budget concerns. Another commissioner reportedly voted against approving a $50,000 (£37,000) study grant for the sirens and water gauges that would have been installed along the Guadalupe. “I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such,” he said, according to local media. “Taking these funds out of special projects from the road and bridge department ticks me off a little bit.” Then in 2017, the county applied to Fema for a $1 million grant for a warning system, which ended up being rejected by the government. According to Kerr County minutes, most of the funding was sent to help communities that had been shattered by Hurricane Harvey instead. At the time, Mr Moser called it “bad news”. Just how bad is only now becoming clear. Critics have also taken aim at Donald Trump, claiming the cuts overseen by his former ally Elon Musk as government efficiency tsar left critical positions unfilled in the National Weather Service. While several positions are vacant in Texas' San Antonio and San Angelo offices, including a warning coordination meteorologist, experts have pushed back on claims that understaffing caused a delayed response. For now, Texas is bracing for yet more flooding, with much of its central counties covered by warnings of varying severity. Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, on Monday called the tragedy a “biblical flood”. But after years of unheeded warnings and red tape, it seems the tragedy could well be the catalyst for a political reckoning.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia should focus on achieving its goals, including those related to the special military operation, instead of paying attention to US President Donald Trump's volatile rhetoric, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said. "The American is once again balancing on his favorite political swing," he wrote on Telegram, referring to Trump's statements on Ukraine and his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. "How are we going to deal with that?" Medvedev went on to say. "The way we have been doing. The way our soldiers do. The way our supreme commander-in-chief does. "We need to continue achieving the goals of the special military operation," he noted, adding: "Retake our land and work for the victory." When commenting on his efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, Trump has made contradictory statements over the past few months, sometimes on the same day. The US leader uses the same approach in terms of assessing Washington's support for Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deaths as Kharkiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia come under attack; Ukraine hits Russian warhead plant. Donald Trump said on Monday that the US would resume shipments of “defensive weapons, primarily” to Ukraine in a reversal of an only days-old decision to withhold their supply. The Pentagon under Pete Hegseth last week halted already funded and promised arms shipments to Ukraine, with the defence secretary and Trump administration officials giving varying reasons – ranging from a seriously questioned claim by Hegseth of low weapons stocks, to the pause being part of a standard review of defence capabilities. Soon after Trump spoke on Monday, the Pentagon released a statement. “At President Trump's direction, the department of defence is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops. Our framework for Potus to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defence priorities.” Britain on Monday placed sanctions on two Russian individuals and one Russian entity for the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. The Joint Stock Company Federal Scientific and Production Centre Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry was sanctioned for supplying the Russian military with RG-Vo riot control grenades whose use in warfare contravenes the international chemical weapons convention. At least one person was killed and 71 were wounded in Russian drone strikes on Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, officials said on Monday. In south-eastern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia city at least 20 people were wounded and dozens of residential buildings and a university building damaged in a morning drone strike, governor Ivan Fedorov said on Monday. One person was killed in Odesa, regional officials said. Ukraine's national security and defence council said Russia was waging an “information campaign” on social media about draft office locations “to destabilise the mobilisation process and sow panic among the population”; however a ground forces spokesperson said recruitment remained on track. Ukraine's military said it struck a chemical plant in Russia's Moscow region that manufactures explosives, ammunition and thermobaric warheads for Shahed attack drones. Ukraine's drones also hit workshops at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, causing a fire and disrupting production, according to a Ukrainian security service source cited in national media. The former deputy chief of the Russian army's general staff was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Monday over a scheme involving theft of money from defence ministry contracts, the Tass news agency of Russia reported. Khalil Arslanov, a colonel general, and others were found guilty of stealing 1.6bn roubles (£14.9m/US$20.3m) from state contracts with Voentelecom, which provides telecommunications services and equipment to the Russian military.</p>

Now we are waiting for a reply from the Ukrainian side," TRT Haber television quoted Turkey's top diplomat as saying following his participation in the BRICS summit in Brazil. According to Fidan, Turkey is also ready to host a leaders' meeting on Ukraine. "There is no problem with organizing a leaders' meeting in Turkey," he said. Both sides are satisfied with the humanitarian aspect of the negotiation process, he added. "The question is how to ensure a permanent or temporary ceasefire and whether that will be done at a summit involving the leaders or during talks. Discussions on this issue are ongoing. The sides have various ideas," he stated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MOHAMMAD AYATOLLAHI TABAAR is a Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, Associate Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University's Bush School of Government and Public Service, and a Fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Israel's June 13 assault on Iran, designed to decapitate Tehran's military and nuclear program, is one of the worst setbacks the Islamic Republic has ever experienced. In less than two weeks, the Israel Defense Forces managed to assassinate dozens of senior Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. The IDF destroyed many of Iran's air defense systems and damaged its nuclear facilities. Israel bombed Iran's energy infrastructure, military bases, and various missile production sites. The Iranian regime mourned its lost officials but swiftly replaced them. To maintain internal stability, the government might even tolerate more social freedoms. But the regime will probably become more repressive, arresting anyone it sees as a traitor. And critically, Iranians may be more willing to accept the state as it is. The country could now have a new social contract, one that prioritizes national security above everything else. The Islamic Republic may be weaker in some ways, but its leaders are proud of having withstood the Israeli and American assaults. And they continue to believe that demonstrating resolve in the face of aggression is the only way to deter their opponents. In the weeks before Israel attacked Iran, it seemed as if Tehran and Washington might peacefully resolve their dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Some analysts believed a new nuclear agreement could be near. But as negotiations progressed, the Trump administration began walking back its initial flexibility, oscillating between demanding zero enrichment and the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Israel, meanwhile, steadily degraded Tehran's position by picking apart Hezbollah (Tehran's most powerful partner), tearing through Hamas, and taking out some of Iran's air defenses. The Islamic Republic grew even weaker in December, when rebels toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another faithful Iranian ally. Eventually, a sense of resignation took hold in Tehran: many officials and analysts alike came to believe that—deal or no deal—Israel, the United States, or both would attack. Iranian officials thus stayed at the negotiating table, hoping to avoid an assault while trying to shore up their domestic backing—for instance, by suspending enforcement of the unpopular law mandating that women fully cover their hair in public and easing other restrictions on freedom of expression. At first, many ordinary Iranians assumed the conflict would be a short confrontation between two governments that was unlikely to affect them. These sentiments swelled after Trump and Israeli officials urged Tehran's residents to evacuate their homes. “I'm no fan of the Islamic Republic, but it's now time to show solidarity for Iran,” one Tehran resident told the Financial Times. “Trump and Netanyahu say ‘evacuate' as if they care about our health. My husband and I are not going to pave the ground for them. As the Islamic Republic weathered Israel's assault and retaliated with ballistic missiles of its own, the regime's response was cheered on by Iranian writers, artists, and singers, many of whom are typically apolitical or in opposition to the government. Even some longtime dissidents and former political prisoners joined in. These actors carefully kept some distance from the regime. But their emphasis on solidarity aligned with the government's message. Less constrained by domestic pressure, it will channel resources into the IRGC and other armed forces and security agencies, especially since many in Tehran expect the fragile cease-fire to collapse at any moment. But it will struggle to prove that it can handle another war, especially given the extent to which its ranks have been penetrated by Israeli intelligence operatives. Critics have accused the regime of prioritizing ideological loyalty over competence, allowing individuals who simply mouthed hard-line slogans to rise through the ranks while concealing their true allegiances. Whether any top official will actually face consequences remains to be seen. But one response already appears certain: Tehran is likely to launch internal purges, expand its surveillance apparatus, and rely on ordinary citizens to participate in monitoring and reporting suspicious activities. Pro-government preachers across the country have suddenly begun blending iconic, pre-revolutionary patriotic songs into Shiite religious rituals—a mix of nationalism and Islamism that the regime historically avoided but now appears eager to embrace. Similarly, state-controlled media and municipal officials are now invoking pre-Islamic Persian mythology in their messaging, linking legendary figures to slain IRGC commanders. This cocktail has drawn mixed reactions, with many skeptical Iranians arguing that the gestures are merely opportunistic. Some Iranians believe that to make sure today's social cohesion lasts into the future, senior officials will take steps to moderate. It might release political prisoners and repair relations with sidelined moderate figures, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, to project national unity. It could also continue to let women go unveiled and allow for more free expression. It has already marginalized some hard-liners, who had pushed for Iran to attack Israel before June 13. (Some of these figures and analysts had argued that the country was already at war and thus needed to strike, even though doing so risked further upsetting an already fractured populace.) But whether the government's promise of moderation signals a genuine opening remains unclear. Many Iranians believe the government will instead double down on its hard-line stance, viewing reconciliation as too risky in wartime and expecting that the wave of nationalist solidarity will allow them to be more repressive while limiting blowback. The state, for example, has been summarily executing those it accuses of collaborating with Israel. It has established checkpoints across major cities to arrest suspected collaborators, as it did during the 1980s—the last time Iran was subjected to similar kinds of attacks. Iranians, after all, are ambivalent about the state's reaction. “It's unsettling, but also somewhat reassuring to see them near my house,” a different Tehran resident told the Financial Times, referring to the IRGC paramilitary volunteers. “I could never imagine seeing Basijis and feeling happy.” Israeli and U.S. officials are, of course, focused more on whether Tehran is a threat to them than whether it is a threat to its people. According to these commentators, Iran's aggressive Middle East strategy has been a failure, given the collapse of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, and Hamas in Gaza—plus the damage to Iran's own military. Its leaders believe the country's forward defense strategy—fighting adversaries by conducting asymmetric warfare near or within their borders rather than on Iranian soil—has been vindicated. This approach successfully deterred Israel and the United States from attacking for years and thus bought Tehran critical time to build up the industrial infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutional resilience it can now use to rapidly rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, even after the devastating bombings. In a sense, they have now been proved correct. Iran had designed its regional posture to create layers of defense in the form of its various partners, believing that this network would force adversaries to penetrate multiple fronts before striking the homeland. That, of course, is exactly what Israel did. This argument is easy to rebut: the layered defense delayed, but did not prevent. Iran is therefore unlikely to behave much differently after this attack, although it will make some adjustments to reflect the realities that have emerged in the past year and a half. The regime could look to reconstitute the axis of resistance by rebuilding Hezbollah as a more agile, small force closer to its original form rather than as the quasi army it had become. (It would still equip the group with advanced missile capabilities.) In Syria, Tehran will try to take advantage of the current power vacuum by empowering grassroots militant groups. Neither of these steps will be easy: Hezbollah is under pressure from Lebanese officials and continues to suffer Israeli bombardment, and the new Syrian government, which is consolidating control over its territory, is hostile to Iran and has begun moving closer to Israel. In fact, Iran's survival and its missile strikes on Israeli territory have also earned it admiration among many Arab populations. Tehran, meanwhile, is more skeptical of diplomacy than ever. The shock of the attacks—which included the assassination of senior IRGC commanders and a failed attempt to kill a key nuclear negotiator, Ali Shamkhani—has drained away whatever credibility American assurances might once have had. In the past, Iran distrusted Washington but saw talks as a potential avenue for sanctions relief and de-escalation. Now, Iranian officials will not only assume that the United States will violate any agreement but also that negotiations are a cover for coercion or military action, given that Israel's attack occurred just two days before scheduled talks between Tehran and Washington. Nevertheless, Iran is likely to remain engaged, combining maximum resistance to the regional order with maximum diplomacy, in order to communicate its redlines and further expose what it views as the West's bad faith. Still, Iran does not appear to be rushing toward the bomb. By crossing the nuclear threshold, Tehran would validate the very accusations it has long denied and risk triggering a larger conflict with U.S. forces. It is a large country that has porous borders with multiple unstable neighbors. It is involved in overlapping territorial disputes about oil fields, water resources, and maritime boundaries. These external challenges are compounded by Iran's internal vulnerabilities, including chronic ethnic tensions along its periphery. Instead of rushing for a bomb, Tehran will likely continue to pursue nuclear ambiguity, suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Doing so will also pressure the IAEA to lobby against future attacks on Iran, since the agency can resume inspections only if Iran's nuclear sites are no longer under threat. Tehran believes this approach, which conceals its enrichment activity, will also provide it with greater flexibility to advance its program without notice. As Tehran pointed out, the agency released a report just a few days before the attack, declaring that Iran's cooperation with IAEA inspectors was “less than satisfactory.” That doesn't mean Iran will eventually build a nuclear weapon.
