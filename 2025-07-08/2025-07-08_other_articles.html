                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent episode of her podcast "Ex-Psychic Saved," former medium Jenn Nizza sounded the alarm on grounding, or “earthing,” calling it a deceptive New Age practice built on pseudoscience and spiritually dangerous ideas. “We're going to dive into this topic of grounding today.” Montenegro began by debunking the notion that grounding is simply walking barefoot outside or enjoying nature. She explained that the practice is tied to New Age energy beliefs, similar to those found in crystal healing and other alternative therapies. “There is some kind of energy theory going on,” Montenegro said. Ober's ideas were then promoted by others, including the late Dr. Stephen Sinatra, a cardiologist who specialized in integrative medicine and called himself a “certified bioenergetic psychotherapist.” “Integrative medicine is just a rebrand of alternative healing,” Montenegro warned. And 'bioenergetic' is one of those New Age buzzwords that signals energy healing. “These are not people I would take my dog to,” she said. “These are not credible sources of truth or healing.” According to Montenegro, grounding is not just ineffective, it's spiritually dangerous. “When you fall for a deception or give it worth, you are helping to make your mind more open to other deceptions,” she said. She warned Christians in particular not to divide their spiritual loyalty. You're giving spiritual weight to something rooted in paganism.” Both women condemned attempts to justify grounding with biblical references. Nizza added, “That's what the enemy does — he'll try to make you think that God is connected to these things so you feel good about them. Montenegro warned that grounding is just one example of a growing trend: the infiltration of New Age beliefs into the Church, often through concepts like energy healing, vibrations and frequencies. “This is the heart of all pagan belief systems,” she said. In the West, we've called it ‘life force' or ‘vitalism.' Satan is trying to bring that into the Church.” The podcast also touched on prominent figures Montenegro sees as responsible for spreading these ideas, including Dr. Laura Sanger, who has spoken on Christian platforms about topics like frequencies and Nephilim-related theories. “This is the kind of nonsense Christians are now being taught as theology.” “We want to pray for the deceived,” she said. “But we also have to expose these things as they come. Ephesians 5:11 says, ‘Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. “My ministry is about warning against New Age and occult deception,” she said. I'm trying to protect people and help the Church remain pure. “There are real dangers in the world,” Montenegro said. Leah M. Klett is a reporter for The Christian Post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Real Housewives of Orange County' cast member had a little help unlocking her pup Archie's deepest desires. Shannon Storms Beador has been enjoying some true dog days of summer after adopting a new furry friend. The Real Housewives of Orange County cast member has given fans an inside look into her first few months with the golden retriever, who she named Troy, by sharing plenty of adorable photos on social media of the dog adjusting to his new life. But fans may be surprised to learn that the decision to adopt her new canine companion came from an unlikely source: her beloved dog, Archie. It turns out the thing that Archie — the main “man” in her life these days as an empty nester — wanted most was a new brother to play with, which she learned after this fateful consultation. Although Shannon admitted that it was the first time she sought life advice from a pet psychic, it seems that Archie may have been onto something. RELATED: Shannon Storms Beador Offers Juicy Intel on Dating: "Not Gonna Lie..." (EXCLUSIVE) “We get the dog and I'm like ‘what does he want his name to be? We are so grateful to Southern California Golden Retriever Rescue for entrusting us with this precious soul!” Shannon Beador visits Bravo Headquarters on September 4, 2024 in New York City. Shannon asked her fans to weigh in with their own name suggestions before she settled on Troy. “We have always been steadfast [University of Southern California] fans so his name completely makes sense!,” she continued. Along with some shots of Troy happily posing on his own, Shannon also shared several images and a video of Troy cozying up and playing with his new brother, Archie.

If you are training for a marathon, or indeed any other race, the bulk of your training miles will be run at an easy pace. Race day might be haunting your dreams from the moment you sign up, but training for a marathon, particularly your first, largely involves running slowly. And finally, you might think about shoes designed to boost your recovery. Right now, you can save up a lot of money on running shoes in the Amazon Prime Day sale. It's important, of course, to choose the right shoes for you. It is always worth having your gait analysed at a running shop to check, even if you buy online. Of course, running isn't just about the shoes. There's a lot of other kit that you can invest in, and we have reviews of everything from the very best Garmin watches to the top treadmills for home training. And don't forget that an important part of training for a running race is to build your strength with resistance training. You can also help your running by cross-training on another piece of cardio equipment Save up to $60 on the Brooks Glycerin 21, a stable and ultra-comfortable neutral running shoe. We gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating and named it the best option for beginners in our guide to the best running shoes. They are not discounted often, so snap them up while this deal still lasts. When it comes to training for any race distance, it a generally accepted and sensible rule of thumb that 80% of your miles should be easy, with 20% (at most) harder. These harder efforts might include interval training or tempo running. So for the majority of your runs, you need a pair of shoes that are best suited to easy-paced miles, and which will offer you enough cushioning to protect your muscles and joints from impact, without feeling heavy or too slow. If you are a neutral runner, then one of the best all-purpose, all-rounder shoes for your everyday training is the New Balance 1080. Now on its 14th version for a good reason, this is a comfortable, well-designed shoe that offers great value for money, and should see you through hundreds of miles of running. It has plenty of cushioning but is still pretty lightweight, so that you never feel the cushioning is weighing you down. Indeed, although this is designed as a “high mileage” everyday running shoe, the 1080 is light and responsive enough that it can also cope with you picking up the pace on a tempo run. With a plush upper that hugs your feet without weighing them down, this is a shoe that feels incredibly comfortable from the moment you first slip it on. It has enough grip to cope with wet pavements and even some light trail (such as gravel paths in a park) and wears extremely well. Since the introduction of carbon plates to running shoes with Nike's Vaporfly 4% in 2016, the world of race shoes has been transformed. But what super shoes once offered only to elite runners is now mainstream at amateur races, too. The point of the carbon plate is to act as a kind of spring, driving you forwards — and evidence certainly suggests that they can benefit amateurs too. Strava data also shows that runners in super shoes tend to complete races 4-5% faster than those in normal shoes, even when adjusted for training and ability. All of which means, for the amateur, that if you really care about that marathon race, and you can afford them (super shoes are more expensive than other running shoes) then it might well be worth paying for a pair. But with every brand claiming theirs is best, which one? In recent years, Puma has revolutionised its running shoe lineup, redesigning everything from everyday shoes like the Deviate Nitros to its latest carbon-plated racer, the Fast-R Deviate Nitro Elite 3. These shoes may look super high-stacked, but they weigh in at a featherlight 147 g/170 g (womens US 7.5 and mens 8). But you won't find a super shoe that does. What you will get is a shoe that seems tailor-made to marathon pace running. That feeling of running on a springboard makes runs just seem easier, and staying on target pace for a marathon more achievable. Like all race shoes, the main drawback is potentially two-fold. Firstly, some runners do find that the very different mechanics that super shoes encourage may lead to different types of aches and pains. But if you save them for race day, can afford them, and really value that PR, then they will be worth it for you. That might include taking stretching seriously, and doing strengthening exercises for any aches or muscle tightness you are prone to. You can also use a foam roller to help reduce the symptoms of DOMS (the pain and stiffness you can get after a workout). Studies show that while their effect on performance itself may be negligible, rollers certainly can help relieve pain from sore muscles. You can read our full guide to foam rollers here, and also check out our guide to the best massage guns. Recovery can also include another, rather different pair of shoes. OOFOS recovery shoes are designed to help your recovery by giving you support all through your foot, from the heel to the forefoot, but with a lovely cushioned bouncy comfort. There is absolutely nothing better than unlacing (possibly with help) after a marathon and sliding your feet into a pair of OOFOS. Their proprietary foam absorbs 37% more impact than your standard post-run sliders, and they cradle your arches but also promote a more natural foot posture. Many runners with plantar fasciitis have, anecdotally, found them helpful too. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The meeting was a follow-up to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Kabul in April this year. The two sides reviewed progress on measures announced during that visit to support Afghan transit trade and held discussions on key areas of mutual interest, including trade, transit cooperation, security, and regional connectivity. Both parties acknowledged terrorism as a major threat to regional peace and stability. Pakistan emphasized the need for tangible actions against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, noting their detrimental impact on Pakistan's security and regional development. They highlighted the role of enhanced regional connectivity as a driver for long-term economic growth and shared prosperity. The issue of Afghan nationals' repatriation was also discussed. Pakistan outlined its facilitation of legal travel from Afghanistan, having issued over 500,000 visas since January last year for medical, tourism, business, and educational purposes. Both countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on legal and regulated cross-border movement. Finally, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continuous engagement, recognizing that lasting peace and security are essential for development and the deepening of bilateral relations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was short, with a weirdly shaped head and walked bent forward. A woman in California claims that her doorbell camera caught an "alien" walking through her backyard who exited from a back gate. She shared a clip showing the blue "alien" moving slowly. The neck seemingly appears to be coming out from his chest. It doesn't look like any animal either. Jessica's aunt told her that about 30 minutes before the creature was spotted on camera, she heard banging and scratching noises on her roof. So she asked her son to "double-check" it. He was shocked and said, "Mom it's an alien, call the cops." Ortiz said it was a weird and scary moment and they could not decide whether to call the police. "I was like 'we're going to sound crazy calling the police saying there's an alien in the backyard,'' Ortiz said. Also Read: In Siberia, aliens turned 23 soldiers into stone, remains of spacecraft are at a secret research base near Moscow However, Ortiz said in the interview that she wouldn't call it an alien. The host and Ortiz speculated what it could be. However, they couldn't believe that a child would be roaming around alone at 1 am in the night. He said that the creature was only three to four feet in height. He pointed out that its head has a "very weird shape". He then cited its colour, saying, it is a "blue-grey creature, of the typical Greys."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Khloé Kardashian is convinced that extraterrestrial life exists, and she's even experienced some spooky goings-on in her own home. The Kardashian opened up to fans during the latest episode of her podcast, Khloe in Wonder Land. In the July 2 instalment, Khloé fielded questions about her past romances, matrimony, motherhood, and even outer space. Midway through the chat, a fan quizzed her on whether she believed in life beyond Earth and if she'd ever had any eerie or paranormal experiences. Without hesitation, Khloé confessed that she could easily fill an entire video with her thoughts on this topic, but yes, she did believe in life in space. She never saw it, but my reaction, she's always believed me because we were driving for 'Keeping Up'... driving for my interview session." The Good American founder explained that Malika trusted her account due to how "sure and confident" Khloé was. Malika assured her that she knew Khloé had seen something based on the panic in her best friend's voice. Khloé then admitted that while she's never laid eyes on an alien, she does believe they exist, reports the Mirror US. In her previous residence, Khloé recalled a number of eerie incidents. Someone came to my house because I was sleeping and I remember it was in the day and something happened that night where I couldn't sleep." Khloé went on: "I text my sister cause I never take naps in the day, and Kourt lived like a block away from me, and I remember saying, 'I'm going to take a nap, so if you need me like come over, I'm not going to answer the phone." Allegedly, something whispered in Khloé's ear, saying: "Khlo, wake up," and she recalls responding to the voice, "I'm going to open my eyes now, please don't be there."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Khloé Kardashian is convinced that extraterrestrial life exists, and she's even experienced some spooky goings-on in her own home. The Kardashian opened up to fans during the latest episode of her podcast, Khloe in Wonder Land. In the July 2 instalment, Khloé fielded questions about her past romances, matrimony, motherhood, and even outer space. Midway through the chat, a fan quizzed her on whether she believed in life beyond Earth and if she'd ever had any eerie or paranormal experiences. Without hesitation, Khloé confessed that she could easily fill an entire video with her thoughts on this topic, but yes, she did believe in life in space. She never saw it, but my reaction, she's always believed me because we were driving for 'Keeping Up'... driving for my interview session." The Good American founder explained that Malika trusted her account due to how "sure and confident" Khloé was. Malika assured her that she knew Khloé had seen something based on the panic in her best friend's voice. Khloé then admitted that while she's never laid eyes on an alien, she does believe they exist, reports the Mirror US. In her previous residence, Khloé recalled a number of eerie incidents. Someone came to my house because I was sleeping and I remember it was in the day and something happened that night where I couldn't sleep." Khloé went on: "I text my sister cause I never take naps in the day, and Kourt lived like a block away from me, and I remember saying, 'I'm going to take a nap, so if you need me like come over, I'm not going to answer the phone." Allegedly, something whispered in Khloé's ear, saying: "Khlo, wake up," and she recalls responding to the voice, "I'm going to open my eyes now, please don't be there." She further described how it was a man's voice, and then her bedroom door opened and shut. Khloé continued to recount more ghostly encounters, including one involving a "little girl," who her daughter True saw and informed her about. True even spotted a lady with a "funny voice," whom they believed was Tristan Thompson's mother, who tragically passed away shortly after. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CNN-News18 had previously reported on Operation Sindoor was a live testing ground for Chinese weapons that China aims to upgrade. Top intelligence sources indicated that Chinese defence attachés worldwide pressured Rafale clients like Indonesia, Serbia, and Egypt to cancel or reconsider their orders, citing poor combat performance of the Rafale jets. The sources said in contrast, China offered up to 50 per cent discounts on J-35A stealth jets, showcasing Pakistan's endorsement as proof of quality. To reinforce their claims, video game simulations and CGI wreckage clips were spread across Telegram, Weibo, and X, depicting the Rafale's defeats, they said. They said additionally, forged diplomatic cables alleged that France advised India to ground the Rafales, a claim denied by Dassault and the French defence ministry. Rafale represents European strategic autonomy, and by undermining it, China has positioned itself as a reliable regional supplier. Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware – particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles – fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters. French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China. They said the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat. In recent years, China has stepped up disinformation campaigns on global social media platforms like X, Instagram or Facebook, using networks of state-sponsored influencers, sites that pose as news organisations, and fake social media accounts to spread narratives from Beijing. “The Rafale was also targeted because it represents a strategic French offering. The disinformation campaign therefore did not merely target an aircraft, but more broadly a national image of strategic autonomy, industrial reliability, and solid partnerships." Dassault Aviation has sold 533 Rafales, including 323 for export to Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Serbia and Indonesia.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian police recently discovered two siblings, ages 6 and 9, raised on an isolated farm in Piedmont by their virus-obsessed father. During the flood that affected the Italian province of Piedmont in April, local carabinieri visited an isolated farm in the foothills of Lauriano, a small comune near Turin. They were there to issue a temporary eviction notice for the safety of the residents, but what they found shocked them – a 9-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl in diapers, both unable to speak, read, or write, who didn't show up in any local registers. Their Dutch parents, a metal sculptor and a stay-at-home mom, claimed that they were home-schooled and otherwise had everything they needed, from food to toys and books, but the children were ‘ghosts' who didn't show up in any Italian records and seemed completely cut off from the outside world. The children could barely speak, they couldn't read or write, and they were described as extremely aggressive, even to each other. Il Messagero describes their 54-year-old father as “obsessed with the coronavirus and other laboratory-grown viruses” and did not want to have his children vaccinated. He reportedly thought nations were creating viruses in laboratories and planned to “contaminate the world,” so he wanted to keep his family safe. “I love my children, I just wanted to protect them,” the two siblings' father said, adding that he and his wife provided them with everything they needed to lead a normal life. “He had made the farmhouse independent from an energy and water point of view. For this reason, he had managed to isolate himself almost completely,” the mayor of Livorno said.</p>
