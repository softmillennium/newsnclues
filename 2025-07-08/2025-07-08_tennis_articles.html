                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British hopes rested on Norrie's shoulders, but he was easily beaten by the world No 2 and reigning champion They followed the women's world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who overcame a tough test against Laura Siegemund in three sets. And on No 1 Court, Taylor Fritz downed Karen Khachanov in four sets to set up a semi-final with Alcaraz, while Amanda Anisimova knocked out Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Before that, Monday evening saw huge drama on Centre Court as an injured Grigor Dimitrov was forced to dramatically retire when two sets up against No 1 seed Jannik Sinner. Follow all the latest tennis updates, scores and results from Wimbledon below. Here's a look at who's still left when it comes to the seeded players this year: It sounds like that's what the fan and Alcaraz said, anyway! “He's playing great, I think the grass season for him has been really successful so far. Two titles, a semi-final here at Wimbledon, so I've just got to be ready for that battle. “But right now, I just want to enjoy and live this moment, because it's not easy to play a semi-final here at Wimbledon.” “I'm pretty sure there's nobody who works harder than him, and I'm just really happy to see him fighting for great things and playing these kinds of matches.” Credit to Norrie, who saved a set point in that penultimate game, but the writing had long been on the wall. 6-2, 6-3, 6-3, Alcaraz is into the semi-finals as he continues his bid for a third straight Wimbledon crown. Meanwhile, British hopes are extinguished for another year in the men's and women's singles, with Norrie the last player left before this defeat. Fifth seed Taylor Fritz awaits Alcaraz in the final four... He holds serve against the odds, and stays in this one, for now... First Norrie fails to reach a drop shot, then he slices a backhand into the net and looks to the heavens in frustration. And as Norrie slaps a forehand long, Alcaraz will get three break points... The end could be nigh for Norrie in this match. Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American tennis icon make headlines during last month's French Open when he claimed Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner would both be favourites to beat a peak Nadal. Alcaraz and Sinner produced one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all time at Roland Garros, with the Spaniard coming from two sets behind and saving three Championship points on his way to a remarkable victory. It was Alcaraz's second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam in total at 22, the same age Nadal was when he won his fifth major. Sinner is a year older than Alcaraz and has three Grand Slams to his name, twice winning the Australian Open and winning last year's US Open. Reflecting on Alcaraz's victory in Paris, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: ‘You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best. ‘Do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.' Despite the affection for Alcaraz and Sinner, McEnroe's comments were seen by many as disrespectful to a player who is considered one of the best in history. Nadal finished his extraordinary career with 22 Grand Slam titles, a record 14 of which came at the 14 French Open. As Alcaraz breezed into the semi-finals with a 6-2 6-3 6-3 win, McEnroe said on BBC One: ‘I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot… I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time. McEnroe's comments were branded ‘disrespectful' and ‘ludicrous' by tennis coach Calvin Betton, who suggested peak Nadal would have beaten Alcaraz and Sinner ‘on the same day' on his favoured surface. Responding to McEnroe's comments, Betton – who coached Henry Patten to the Wimbledon doubles title last year – said on the Tennis Unfiltered podcast: ‘Sinner and Alcaraz are both phenomenal tennis players. People are talking about how big they hit and how the game has moved on… try doing that when Nadal has got you pinned in the backhand corner hitting balls above your shoulders. ‘Ask Roger Federer how easy it is to hit big against Rafael Nadal on a clay court. It's ludicrous and a little bit disrespectful to already be saying that. Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz faces American fifth seed Taylor Fritz for a place in the semi-final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka battled her way through to the Wimbledon semi-finals. Aryna Sabalenka had plenty of work to do after losing the first set of her Wimbledon quarter-final to Siegemund. She was missing plenty of forehands as she struggled to come to terms with the slices and short shots the 37-year-old was playing as she made great use of the grass. Sabalenka steadied the ship by securing the second set, which preceded a final set with plenty of momentum swings. When Siegemund was serving to stay in the match at 5-4, she was broken one final time by Sabalenka, who sealed a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory. That win means Sabalenka has become the second woman since 2000 to reach 10 singles Grand Slam semi-finals from 11 successive appearances. The first woman to achieve that feat was Serena Williams, who ended her illustrious career with 23 majors to her name. Siegemund was able to frustrate Sabalenka with a grass court game ideal for disrupting powerful players. Sabalenka struggled playing against a game style she is not accustomed to, but although it was not pretty, she found a way to win. Post-match BBC Sport commentator Billie Jean King outlined the ways in which Sabalenka was troubled by Siegemund before pulling off a comeback victory. “Siegemund was killing her with grass court tennis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka fought through arguably her toughest test at Wimbledon thus far to beat Laura Siegemund in three battling sets. The 27-year-old came from a set down, and constantly looked under duress as the tricky German continued to bamboozle with her variety. Speaking after the match, she looked back on how recent disappointment in the French Open final actually fuelled such a dramatic Wimbledon triumph today. Chatting with reporters after her hard-fought win, the Belarusian was once again reminded of her defeat in the French Open final last month. However, having sought to flip the narrative after Sabalenka apologised to Gauff, she is now viewing that loss in a positive light. 😅Aryna Sabalenka's honest assessment of her victory over Laura Siegemund.#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/hMtAarrAyY This was echoed in her statement, telling the press conference: “Honestly, I think there's a big possibility I would've lost this match if I hadn't learned that lesson at the French Open. “And in some moments I kept reminding myself, ‘come on, it's a quarterfinal of Wimbledon. I was just reminding myself that it's my dream. Why would I give up so easily? I was willing to push myself and get those tough points.” Sabalenka will now face Amanda Anisimova in the semi-final, after she beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova earlier today. Having somehow managed to beat Siegemund, who was slow, disruptive and awkward, Sabalenka will face a completely different challenge next up against Anisimova. The American is very much the opposite of her previous opponent, perhaps lacking fleet-footedness, but making up for it with thunderous hitting off both wings. And, crucially, the 23-year-old actually boasts a winning record over Sabalenka, despite the latter having won their most recent meeting at Roland Garros last month. After all, that will certainly be the key battle between this duo, who are guaranteed to bring the power to this hotly anticipated Wimbledon semi-final.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aryna Sabalenka completed a hard-fought comeback against Laura Siegemund to avoid elimination and move on to the semifinals at Wimbledon. The pair met at center court on Tuesday morning as Siegemund looked for another upset win after eliminating Madison Keys in the third round. Sabalenka decisively won the second frame, 6-2, before a thrilling third set. Sabalenka went down 3-1, before tying the set at 3-3 before the pair went on a back-and-forth to decide the winner. Siegemund went up 4-3 but was quickly extinguished by Sabalenka, who won the set and the match in straight games, 6-4. Siegemund was victorious against Peyton Stearns, Leylah Fernandez and Keys before exiting the competition. The Belarussian did not drop a set until meeting Siegemund in the tournament. Sabalenka recorded wins over Carson Branstine, Marie Bouzková, Emma Raducanu and Elise Mertens in the first four rounds. Sabalenka awaits the winner between Amanda Anisimova and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Sabalenka will play in the semifinal on Thursday morning as she looks to secure her 21st career singles title and her first at Wimbledon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Much has been made at Wimbledon about Carlos Alcaraz's series of golf matches against fellow former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Andy Murray. It appears the two-time defending champion at the grass-court major has a new challenger: Tom Holland The actor paid a visit to Alcaraz's practice court Tuesday before the Spaniard's quarter-final against Cameron Norrie. I saw you playing golf as well. Alcaraz called out to the actor in a video published by the tournament on social media.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka trailed by a set, then twice was down a break in the third before grabbing the last three games to reach the Wimbledon semifinals by overcoming 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at Centre Court on Tuesday.“She pushed me so much,” said Sabalenka, No. “After the first set, I was just looking at my box, thinking, ‘Guys, I mean, book the tickets.

(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth)Photo: Sabalenka hadn't dropped a set during this year's trip to the grass-court major until Tuesday — but she also hadn't faced an opponent whose style is quite as an unorthodox as that of the 37-year-old Siegemund.The German, who eliminated No. 6 Keys last week, was the oldest and by far the lowest-ranked of any woman in the quarterfinals, as well as the one with the fewest career titles (two).She arrived at Wimbledon with a career record there of 2-5 and with a 4-9 mark on tour in 2025.But her ability to change the depth, speed, angles and spins of her shots over and over can frustrate any opponent and dull the type of power that Sabalenka brings to the court. And, make no mistake: Sabalenka was frustrated, especially in the final set.“It's not like it's an annoying game. She's really making everyone work against her,” Sabalenka said. It doesn't matter if you're a big server, if you're a big hitter. And you have to earn the win.”As her mistakes mounted, she would look up at her box with a quizzical expression and raise her hands. After missing one forehand off a short ball, she knelt on the grass near the net.After getting broken for the sixth time of the afternoon to fall behind 4-3 in the last set, Sabalenka broke right back to open her match-ending run. In the next game, she finally delivered her lone two aces of the match, one at 103 mph, the other at 116 mph.When Sabalenka produced a volley winner to break again and end things after nearly three hours, she shut her eyes, spread her arms wide and let out a big scream. What else happened in the Wimbledon quarterfinals on Tuesday?Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull and reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov. 5-seeded Fritz, an American who was the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, came in with a 1-4 record in major quarterfinals, 0-2 at Wimbledon. He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain, who were scheduled to play each other later Tuesday. Who will play in Wednesday's quarterfinals at the All England Club?The last two women's quarterfinals are No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. Belinda Bencic, and No. 10 Ben Shelton, and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic vs. No. LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka trailed by a set, then twice was down a break in the third before grabbing the last three games to reach the Wimbledon semifinals by overcoming 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at Centre Court on Tuesday. “She pushed me so much,” said Sabalenka, No. “After the first set, I was just looking at my box, thinking, ‘Guys, I mean, book the tickets.

Sabalenka hadn't dropped a set during this year's trip to the grass-court major until Tuesday — but she also hadn't faced an opponent whose style is quite as an unorthodox as that of the 37-year-old Siegemund. She arrived at Wimbledon with a career record there of 2-5 and with a 4-9 mark on tour in 2025. But her ability to change the depth, speed, angles and spins of her shots over and over can frustrate any opponent and dull the type of power that Sabalenka brings to the court. And, make no mistake: Sabalenka was frustrated, especially in the final set. She's really making everyone work against her,” Sabalenka said. It doesn't matter if you're a big server, if you're a big hitter. And you have to earn the win.” After missing one forehand off a short ball, she knelt on the grass near the net. After getting broken for the sixth time of the afternoon to fall behind 4-3 in the last set, Sabalenka broke right back to open her match-ending run. When Sabalenka produced a volley winner to break again and end things after nearly three hours, she shut her eyes, spread her arms wide and let out a big scream. What else happened in the Wimbledon quarterfinals on Tuesday? Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull and reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov. 5-seeded Fritz, an American who was the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, came in with a 1-4 record in major quarterfinals, 0-2 at Wimbledon. He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain, who were scheduled to play each other later Tuesday. Who will play in Wednesday's quarterfinals at the All England Club? The last two women's quarterfinals are No. 7 Mirra Andreeva vs. Belinda Bencic, and No. 10 Ben Shelton, and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic vs. No. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without permission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain for a berth in the final. Fritz powered his way to a big early lead against No. 17 Khachanov, taking 40 of his 47 service points across the initial two sets and never facing a break chance in that span. But then two-time major semifinalist Khachanov grabbed eight of nine games. It was during that stretch that Fritz took a medical timeout, removing his right shoe and sock so the trainer could retape the foot. Khachanov broke to begin the fourth set, in a game in which Fritz's top serve was 117 mph, 18 mph slower than his fastest of the match to that point. Fritz finished with 16 aces and reached a top speed of 138 mph by the end.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Then he lost the first two sets, as Dimitrov put on a sizzling performance of aces, net rushes and all-out attack in the face of a player who has been untouchable this first week in London. A lightning storm was brewing, ready to remind a tennis world accustomed to the Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz duopoly that this sport still has its vicissitudes. But early in the third set, with the match on serve, Dimitrov hit an ace and seemed to seriously injure his right pectoral muscle. He collapsed on the court, and grabbed his chest. He even sat with him as a trainer evaluated Dimitrov, something tennis players rarely do, because they might gain a competitive advantage. “I don't know what to say, he is an incredible player,” a visibly shaken Sinner said, after Dimitrov came back from some brief off-court treatment and said he could not continue. I don't take this as a win at all, this is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us.” Sinner emerged unscathed from what would have been a shock result in a tournament that has been filled with them from day one. This one would have been different to all the others. Sinner had been nothing short of lethal in his first three matches, conceding just 17 games, a record for a man entering the fourth round. He had been both clinical and merciless, keeping his serves inches from the lines, conceding next to nothing in return games, and slamming winner after winner past his opponents. More than any other year in his young career, he appears to have picked the lock of grass-court tennis, mastering the subtle movement and footwork needed to succeed. He has shown that in fits and spurts before, but for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam his body abandoned him, forcing him to retire practically out of nowhere. He played more net points in two sets and one game than he had in his two completed three-set matches previously. He overwhelmed Sinner in one set and then did it again, before faltering up 5-4. He broke Sinner in the next game, with a slice return that bit his ankles. Then he went up two sets and the roof closed. Lightning was ready to strike, and then it did. A little more than an hour later, Sinner still seemed shaken in his post-match news conference. Sinner said he felt his own injury through the match on his serve and forehand and said he planned to get a scan Tuesday to assess its severity. “It's going to be a problem in two days,” he said. “Now I have to focus on other stuff first.” He is currently writing a book about tennis, "The Cruelest Game: Agony, Ecstasy and Near Death Experiences on the Pro Tennis Tour," to be published by Doubleday in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updates from men's and women's last-eight ties in SW19 Email Katy | Fritz survives line-call blooper to reach semis Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 2-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) A rare eruption from the crowd as the left-hander Norrie hits a classy backhand drop shot for 30-15. He rattles off the next two points for 2-2. And Norrie is skipping back to his chair as if he, not Alcaraz, is two sets to love up. But Alcaraz, for sure playing his best tennis of the fortnight in this quarter-final, quickly puts Norrie back in his place with a hold to love. Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 0-1 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) His smile is usually as wide as Centre Court but he's barely even celebrating; this has been too straightforward. The crowd, meanwhile, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber, are a little muted. Alcaraz holds for 5-3 as the shadows move over Centre Court. He looks set to put Norrie firmly in the shade as he advances to 15-30 on Norrie's serve, and then 30-40, set point. Second set: Norrie 2-6, 3-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server) “Andy Murray,” declares Elizabeth McGlynn in response to this teaser. But who was the other British man to knock out a reigning Wimbledon champion in the open era? Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server) So there's hardly been any of the Norrie fist-pumping and vamosing that was irking Jarry in the fourth round – virtually all the first-pumping and vamosing is coming from Alcaraz today. Having taken a break from the game and been through so much since her first Wimbledon quarter-final in 2022, the 23-year-old says it's been an “extraordinary year … I just keep telling myself to enjoy the moment”. The American has squeezed through the second set and is into her first Wimbledon semi-final, where she'll face Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday. Pavlyuchenkova, perhaps inspired by her fellow 30-something Siegemund's fight against Sabalenka earlier, is right back in it, with three set points at 6-3. Both players have now blinked while ahead in this set. The Russian gets a fifth set point when Anisimova nets her return. But again she can't take it. Now Anisimova has a third match point, about 20 minutes after her last, and this disappears too! Over on No 1 Court, Anisimova, having missed two match points against Pavlyuchenkova at 6-1 5-4, is into a second-set tie-break. And that means Alcaraz is serving for the first set. The defending champ swiftly brings up 40-15, and he settles it with a simple forehand volley. It doesn't get much easier than that. Again Alcaraz gets himself out of a little serving hole, from 0-30 behind, to consolidate the break. And Norrie is reeling when Alcaraz turns on the style to claim the double break with a forehand pass! Norrie really needed to get himself ahead on the scoreboard to really get his home crowd going – instead they're kicking back in the late afternoon sun, applauding and admiring the Spanish showman. Norrie opens with a hold from 15-30 down – before racing to 0-40 on Alcaraz's serve for six points on the spin. Then it's Alcaraz's turn to surge back, saving those three break points and then a fourth for 1-1. And Alcaraz makes Norrie pay for those missed chances by immediately breaking for 2-1 when Norrie coughs up a double fault. Only twice in the open era has Wimbledon's reigning men's champion been knocked out by a British player. Norrie has actually beaten Alcaraz in two of their past three matches – in Cincinnati and Rio de Janeiro – but this will be their first meeting on grass. “Facing Cam is always really difficult,” says Alcaraz. For me facing him is almost a nightmare. Sabalenka's victory means it's nearly showtime between Cameron Norrie and Carlos Alcaraz. Norrie is the most modest and unassuming characters off court, but the British No 3 made plenty of headlines for getting under Nicolas Jarry's skin in the previous round, with his rule-stretching ball bouncing and propensity to celebrate his opponent's errors with some very loud vamoses – call it shithousery if you like – and he'll need all of that today against the two-times defending champion, who's on a 22-match winning streak, which takes in the French Open and Queen's titles. It's a more modern-day brand of tennis on No 1 Court, where the American 13th seed Amanda Anisimova has overpowered Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to take the first set 6-1 in only 27 minutes. Pavlyuchenkova was furious in her fourth-round match against Sonay Kartal when the British No 3 won a game she shouldn't have after the electronic line-calling system was accidentally switched off – but she can have no complaints here. “You used to do that to me all the time!” screams Tracy Austin at Billie Jean King as they discuss Siegemund slicing nearly half of her forehands in that deciding set. It really was a grass-court throwback by the 37-year-old German, who should be applauded for playing her part in an absorbing quarter-final. Honestly I need some time to cool down and recover. After the first set I was looking at my box thinking: ‘Book my tickets, we're about to leave this beautiful tournament.' I wouldn't call her game annoying – she plays so smart. 15-30 … but Siegemund prods long and it's 15-40, two match points. Siegemund wins a heart-in-your-mouth first match point, as she drop shots off Sabalenka's drop shot … but Sabalenka secures the second with an emphatic smash! Sabalenka has survived the diciest and sliciest of tactical tests to advance to her third Wimbledon semi-final. The umpire is telling off a spectator for making too much noise between first and second serves. Having waited nearly three hours for an ace, two come along at once to help her edge 5-4 ahead. It means Siegemund, having been the frontrunner for most of this match, must now hold serve to stay in this quarter-final. Despite that self-flagellation, credit to Sabalenka for the way she's generally managed to control her emotions this afternoon, having been unable to do so during her French Open final defeat by Coco Gauff last month. She appears to have learned her lesson. She's playing Siegemund at her own game. Siegemund has sliced nearly 50% of her forehands in this deciding set. Sabalenka doesn't take the first BP but soon has a second, which she seizes on. There's yet another twist in this titanic tussle. Sabalenka is able to fend off the first break point at 30-40 – but then double faults at her advantage to give Siegemund renewed hope. The world No 1 has got it all to do again. Could he become the first to win a slam since Roddick at the US Open in 2003 and to win Wimbledon since Pete Sampras back in 2000? He's certainly in the form of his life on grass, but with a likely semi-final against Carlos Alcaraz to come – and then possibly Sinner or Djokovic in the final, it's a big, big ask. But Fritz probably won't be focusing on that right now – he deserves to celebrate finally being in the last four after his quarter-final heartbreakers against Nadal in 2022 and Musetti in 2024. I've never had a match change so drastically where I felt so in control, serving great, putting pressure on his serve. Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five twice, I don't think I could've taken another one. And with that, I'll hand back to Katy for what should be a gripping conclusion. After breaking the world No 1 at love to nose ahead in the decider, Siegemund held from love-30 down to consolidate. Fritz has seen off Khachanov in four sets to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time. The No 5 seed got off to a flying start in the tiebreaker, crunching aces on his first three service points and nabbing the early minibreak before holding off a brief Khachanov fightback to win 7-4. The Californian's run comes during an outstanding grass-court season that's already included titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne. He now leads the tour in grass wins in 2025 and has become just the third American man to reach the last four at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick's final run in 2009, joining Sam Querrey (2017) and John Isner (2018). Serving at 5-6, 30-30, Khachanov finds himself two points from elimination. But Fritz is forced into an error on a corner-to-corner baseline rally before Khachanov responds with a 125mph first serve that Fritz can't return into play. We're headed to a fourth-set tiebreaker on No 1 Court. Sabalenka has broken Siegemund again to force a decider on Centre Court. Fourth set: Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 5-4 Khachanov* (*denotes next server) Second set: Sabalenka 4-6, 5-2 Siegemund* (*denotes next server) Sabalenka backs up the break but she's made to work for it, saving a break point with a sensational forehand slam winner to finish a highlight-reel rally. It's the sixth of the Belarusian's nine service games that have gone to deuce, but she's in excellent shape here to force a decider. And with that, I'll hand you over to Bryan for the conclusion of these matches …</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu's brilliance on the tennis court is undeniable, and those in her inner circle have raved about her dedication away from the spotlight. The British sensation already boasts a US Open crown, and at just 22, there's bags of potential to boost her Grand Slam collection in years to come. Though her Wimbledon dream ended on Friday when world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka knocked her out in the third round, faith in Raducanu's ability to scale tennis' peaks again is echoed by the sport's elite – including Sabalenka herself. It's not merely Raducanu's sporting prowess that captivates observers, but her relentless work rate and exemplary professionalism. Here at Mirror Sport, we take a look at what some of tennis' best have had to say about Raducanu on the court as well as behind the scenes. Sabalenka is one win away from reaching the semi-finals of the tournament for the third time of her career, but must beat Laura Siegemund on Tuesday to do so. Whilst she's currently working alongside Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who offered a glimpse into Raducanu's behind-the-scenes professionalism, praising the Brit's exemplary training mentality. Speaking to SportsKeeda, the coach revealed: "Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things. "There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete." A friendship several years deep, Carlos Alcaraz has long been close with Raducanu with the pair set to become team-mates as they compete together in the US Open Mixed Doubles event next month. 2 and current French Open champion, the Spaniard would have surely had options from the WTA Tour to play alongside him but the 22-year-old cited Raducanu's influence on him as the reason he asked her to play with him. "I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. "I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. "I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. Having had a first-hand account of Raducanu's rise throughout the ranks into becoming a Grand Slam champion, fellow Brit Jack Draper knows exactly how much talent his compatriot has and will continue to show. Before her clash with Sabalenka, Draper expressed full confidence in Raducanu's prowess as he said: "She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that." Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu's talent on the tennis court is obvious, but those who know her closely praise her work behind the scenes. The Brit already has a US Open title to her name, and at the age of 22, there's promising potential to add to her major tally in the coming years. While her journey at Wimbledon this year was cut short on Friday after being knocked out of the third round by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, belief in Raducanu to once again reach the mountaintop of tennis is a view that is shared by some of the biggest names in the sport, including Sabalenka herself. It's not just the sporting talent that Raducanu possesses that has enamoured people with her but the work ethic and high level of professionalism she displays. It was at the hands of Aryna Sabalenka that Raducanu exited Wimbledon after a 7-6 6-4 defeat to the world No. In what was always going to be a hugely difficult test for the Brit to continue her journey at the All England Club, she put up a spirited display against the 27-year-old on Centre Court. The 22-year-old has already run through a wringer of coaches in her young career with the likes of Nigel Sears, Andrew Richardson, Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov, Sebastian Sachs, and Nick Cavaday all leading the tennis star at one point. While she's currently in partnership with Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who gave an insight into Raducanu's professionalism behind the scenes, admitting the Brit had a superb attitude when it came to training. Speaking to SportsKeeda, he said: "Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things. There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete." This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Having enjoyed a close friendship with Raducanu for years, Carlos Alcaraz is set to share the court with her next month as they compete in the US Open's revamped Mixed Doubles tournament. Revealing that it was himself that initiated conversations to team up at Flushing Meadows, the five-time Grand Slam champion praised her on-court influence, admitting without her, he wasn't sure he'd be able to play at the highest level. "I'm super excited about it," he said when the news was announced. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. "I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. Like Alcaraz, Jack Draper has had a friendship with Raducanu going back to their teenage years and is certainly well-informed when it comes to analysing her journey and potential in the sport. While already a Grand Slam champion, thanks to her US Open triumph in 2021, Raducanu has struggled to reach those same levels. However, Draper had every confidence in her ability to defeat Sabalenka at Wimbledon as before their clash the British men's No.1 said: "She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. Tuesday, 8th July 2025See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grigor Dimitrov's 2025 Wimbledon campaign came to a cruel end as he was forced to retire while leading Jannik Sinner in the fourth round, a story all too familiar for the Bulgarian. Seeded 19th at the grass-court Grand Slam, Dimitrov was sensational in the opening two sets on Centre Court as he won them 6-3, 7-5, but then his injury curse struck when he sent down an ace to make it 2-2 in the third. After receiving treatment off court, the disappointed Bulgarian returned to signal his retirement. Having set a new record for most consecutive retirements at Grand Slams at the French Open, Dimitrov has now extended that unwanted record to five. The unfortunate run started at Wimbledon 2024 when he retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev due to an abductor tear and he exited the US Open in similar fashion a few months later as he called it quits during his quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe with a leg injury stating “I think it's a combination of everything.” That, though, was his 10th retirement in Grand Slams, and he tops the all-time list. The Frenchman competed from 1993 until 2006 and made 26 Grand Slam main draw appearances with six ending in retirements. Former world No 3 Nishikori's maiden Grand Slam appearance at Wimbledon in 2008 ended in first-round forfeiture due to an abdominal muscle strain and in 2010 he reached the third round at the US Open before a groin injury ended his campaign. A back injury then forced him to retire from the first round at the 2011 US Open and he then enjoyed a four-year run with no Grand Slam retirements. But the curse hit again at Wimbledon in 2016 with a rib injury in the fourth round while exhaustion was the reason for his decision to call it quits during his 2019 Australian Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic. His most recent retirement was in the second round at Roland Garros in 2024 when he quit due to a hip injury. The 5 players to win a 6-1 set against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon: Alex de Minaur joins Carlos Alcaraz Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, & Rafael Nadal's Wimbledon head-to-heads against ‘Big 3' rivals The mercurial Monfils has retired from 25 top-level matches with six coming at Grand Slam level. He made it a hat-trick of retirements at Flushing Meadows in 2018 with another wrist injury. He reached the second round at Wimbledon in 2009 before retiring seven games into his match against Tommy Haas while at the 2010 US Open he made the third round before calling it quits. The great Novak Djokovic had a reputation for retiring during the early stages of his career, but he has well and truly moved on from that. His first Grand Slam retirement came at the 2005 French Open when he struggled with breathing and cramping issues during his second-round match against Guillermo Coria and he again exited in the same fashion the following year, this time during a lower-back injury in the quarter-final against Rafael Nadal. His 2009 Australian Open retirement resulted in Andy Roddick's infamous comment that “he's not the guy who's never given up before, so that's kind of disappointing to see” after the Serbian quit in the last eight. It would be another eight years before he retired again during a major as his 2017 Wimbledon campaign ended in heartbreak in the quarter-final due to an elbow injury, which required surgery. His elbow also forced him to quit during his 2019 US Open round of 16 clash against Stan Wawrinka while his most recent retirement was at the 2025 Australian Open when he retired in the semi-final against Alexander Zverev. The Serbian had 24 retirements during his career with eight taking place at Grand Slam level. At the 2009 French Open he reached the third round, but was unable to complete his match against Andy Murray with a hip problem. A groin injury forced him to throw in the towel at Wimbledon in 2011 and a left injury ended his quarter-final match against Djokovic at the US Open later in the year. He was seeded eighth at the 2013 Australian Open, but he retired in the fourth round due to a jarred heel. Retirement No 8 – which was a record at the time – came at Wimbledon in 2017 when he quit after being 5-0 down in the opening set. The Bulgarian made his Grand Slam debut in 2009 at Wimbledon and it ended in heartbreak as he suffered a knee injury during his first-round match. It would be another nine years before he retired again from a Grand Slam match, he was leading 6-2, 6-4, 5-7, 0-3 against Marcos Giron in the first round at Roland Garros when a back injury ended his campaign. Flavio Cobolli could have been a footballer - now he faces Novak Djokovic in his first Grand Slam quarter-final. Djokovic has few more valuable supporters than his children, Stefan and Tara Only one of Jannik Sinner's four matches has been longer than two hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a man who loved the stage bigger and brighter, Marcos Baghdatis remembers his final farewell on tennis' grandest grounds. It wasn't his solitary Grand Slam final, or his Centre Court showdown with a legend, it was in fact the final match he played as a professional. Baghdatis was beaten 6-1, 7-6 6-3 by 17th seed Matteo Berrettini who would go on to make the final in SW19 in 2021. There were plenty of tears on that Thursday afternoon six years ago, as Marcos then-pregnant wife - former top-20 WTA player Karolina Sprem - looked on from the players box as her husband handed out almost all of the equipment from his bag, kissed the grass and waved his goodbyes. "I always wanted to finish at the high level," Baghdatis tells talkSPORT just a stone's throw from the All-England Club as he launches a new venture of his own, the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy. "For me, one of the best places to retire in tennis, it's… I mean, Wimbledon, right? I mean, that's the best place to retire and I had the opportunity to have that experience. The Cypriot had a career full of nice moments, including wins over world No.1's Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - even though the pair stopped him at his closest point to winning a Grand Slam title. He won four ATP titles, but suffered eight defeats in Slams to Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and his best chances of a major fell at the hands of all three icons of the game. Now 40, and preparing for the Men's Invitational Doubles tournament at Wimbledon where he will partner Xavier Malisse this year - he is in a reflective mood. But with moments the theme of the conversation, there is only one place to turn, a memorable 2006. On to Wimbledon and Baghdatis was too strong for Andy Murray in the fourth round of just the Scot's second Wimbledon, and he then beat former champion Leyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals. Defeat to Rafael Nadal came in the semifinal, before the final Grand Slam of the year in New York and Baghdatis' idol Andre Agassi who was playing his final ever tournament. Baghdatis rallied from two sets down to take the match to a decider, where Agassi prevailed, before a third round defeat - it immortalises Baghdatis as the last man eight-time Grand Slam champion Agassi would beat. I was very emotional in that match. "Last year we brought him to the academy. "To be able to do that with a person I admire since a very young age, it's just a dream come true also and bring him to Cyprus." Baghdatis run to the Australian Open final in 2006 was one of tennis more memorable occasions, the man from Cyprus on the brink of becoming his country's first ever Grand Slam winner. Roared on by the Cypriot community at Melbourne Park he came close to winning the title as an unseeded contender - knocking out four seeds, including Andy Roddick along the way. Federer proved too strong, but only after Baghdatis had taken the first set to spark wild scenes on Rod Laver Arena. Injuries hampered him throughout much of his career, but the presence of the big three stopped many a player having their major breakthrough. Of the 60 Grand Slam events between Baghdatis' first in 2004 and last in 2019, 51 were won by either Federer, Nadal or Djokovic. "I just felt that there was no solution against him, you know, like it was always something, it depended on him. "But Djokovic for me, it was impossible." While Djokovic marches into yet another quarterfinal, Baghdatis harbours no regrets over the career he had, in fact he believes their standards made him - and his peers - even better. But you know, it pushed me to want more. I mean, you have to feel the pain. Baghdatis is now striving to find the stars of the future himself, alongside wife Karolina - a  Wimbledon quarterfinalist herself in 2004 - they have launched the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy. It's a subject close to his heart, having left home as a teenager to join the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy. Of course tennis has improved and there are so many players or kids who play tennis, but the facilities are not there. Maybe their dream is not just becoming professional tennis players but also going to college in America and studying. Marcos and Karolina have three children of their own, it's the reason following the Andy Murray or Goran Ivanisevic path to the coaches box, doesn't hold too much appeal. "I did it a bit with Svitolina. Of course, but it didn't work out. Family, it was very tough at that moment. So it didn't work out that way. And you can do it from a young age, be there, try to mentor them, try to prepare them for what's coming." Marcos was speaking to talkSPORT at the UK launch of the new Serve and Stay tennis packages at the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy based at City of Dreams, Mediterranean in Limassol, Cyprus.
