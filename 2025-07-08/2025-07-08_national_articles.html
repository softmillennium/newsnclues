The ‘Outnumbered' panelists react to explosive claims in a new book alleging President Joe Biden experienced a serious decline in health while in office, and that top officials worked to keep it hidden. President Joe Biden's former chief of staff and a fixture of his re-election campaign, Ron Klain, privately announced during Biden's disastrous debate performance: "We're f---ed." And backstage, as Biden stumbled over an answer that questionably ended with, "We finally beat Medicare," back in the holding room, Klain stood up and announced, "We're f---ed," according to the authors. President Joe Biden speaks during the consequential debate on June 27, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia. Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Klain were among those leading Biden's final prep ahead of the debate, according to the book. Despite Klain expressing doubt internally, Klain continued to defend the president amid calls from donors and politicians for Biden to step down. On June 30, 2024, Klain reshared an X post that urged Americans to ignore the "news reports" with "anonymous sources about Dem donors calling for Biden to withdraw." These people don't get to decide to oust a pro-labor pro-people President," Klain said on July 4, 2024, in response to The New York Times reporting about the Democrats' pressure campaign against Biden. Ron Klain, former White House chief of staff, speaks during a transition event in the East Room of the White House on Feb. 1, 2023. According to the book, after the debate, Klain called Jeff Zients, his successor as Biden's chief of staff, to say he was "disturbed that Biden was planning to spend the weekend at Camp David." "We have an emergency," Klain told Zients, according to the book. But Zients insisted Biden was going to Camp David to be with his family, instead of Klain's plan to appease the progressive wing of the party with a bold second-term agenda. "I have no f---ing clue why he's going to Camp David this weekend," Klain said, according to the authors. "He needs to be working the phones, day and night." Klain had overseen debate prep for every Democratic presidential candidate since 2004, according to the authors. Between Biden's cold, a shorter prep window than usual and staffers privately expressing concern, debate prep in Camp David did not quite go as planned, the authors claimed. "This is going to be really touch and go in Atlanta," Klain told Donilon and Reed ahead of the debate, according to the book. Fox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden's cognitive decline and his inner circle's alleged role in covering it up. When reached for comment, Klain told Fox News Digital, "I have nothing to add." Biden did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) unveiled its National Farm Security Action Plan on Tuesday morning. The plan is specifically meant to address threats from foreign governments, like China, and how those threats impact American farmers. "The farm's produce is not just a commodity, it is a way of life that underpins America itself. And that's exactly why it is under threat from criminals, from political adversaries, and from hostile regimes that understand our way of life as a profound and existential threat to themselves," USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a press event in Washington, D.C. Secretary Brooke Rollins outlines plan to tackle threats from China and other adversaries on American farmland on July 8, 2025. "For them, agricultural lands and our farms, because they are a previous inheritance, are weapons to be turned against us," she continued. All of this takes what is profoundly good and turns it toward evil purposes." Rollins was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. "As someone who's charged with leading the Defense Department, I want to know who owns the land around our bases and strategic bases and getting an understanding of why foreign entities, foreign companies, foreign individuals might be buying up land around those bases," Hegseth said. Bondi directly referenced how agroterrorism is becoming a top concern for the administration. Two Chinese nationals were arrested in Michigan last month for allegedly smuggling what FBI Director Kash Patel described as a "known agroterrorism agent." "A country who cannot feed itself, cannot take care of itself, and cannot provide for itself, is not secure, and we have to be able to feed ourselves to make sure that no other country ever controls us," Noem said. Noem said that during her time as governor of South Dakota she signed a law that banned the governments of China, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela and Russia and entities related to them from buying farmland in the state. Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks during a press conference in Budapest, Hungary, on May 9, 2024. The National Farm Security Action Plan calls for a ban on the purchase of American farmland by Chinese nationals. "And I've watched for decades as evil foreign governments, including China, have come into this country, and they have stolen our intellectual property. Numerous states have laws on the books restricting land purchases by those with ties to China and other foreign adversaries. In 2021, over 383,000 acres had ties to China, but the number has dipped in recent years, according to Agriculture Dive. Cameron Arcand is a politics writer at Fox News Digital in Washington D.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Concerns have been raised, including in Los Angeles, that ICE officers carrying out raids are doing so without identifying themselves and are, on occasion, concealing their identity with masks. The concerns have led to complaints that federal agents are operating in an authoritarian manner without full transparency, sparking a surge of kidnapping calls to police from outraged residents. Although the Trump administration has dismissed unease, arguing that officers need, at times, to conceal their identity due to the steep rise of violence against ICE, Padilla joined forces with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) to introduce a bill that would ban federal immigration officers from wearing most face coverings and require them to wear visible ID during public operations. “When federal immigration agents show up and pull someone off the street in plainclothes with their face obscured and no visible identification, it only escalates tensions and spreads fear while shielding federal agents from basic accountability,” Padilla said in a statement pushing Congress to support the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement Act. The VISIBLE Act's commonsense requirements will restore transparency and ensure impersonators can't exploit the panic and confusion caused by unidentifiable federal immigration enforcement agents.” Ten suspects were charged this week with attempting to murder ICE agents at a Texas detention facility in Alvarado. The Department of Homeland Security has also pointed to increasing doxxing threats against agents, including from leading Democratic politicians. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE, told CBS News in a recent interview that masks are “for the safety of those individuals or the work that they're doing as far as protecting their identity so they can continue to do investigative work.” Her words come as “No sleep for ICE” protesters have posted the exact locations of ICE agents' evening whereabouts across Los Angeles County on social media to organize large crowds to disrupt their slumber. Top Democrats have compared agents' identity concealment to Communist activity and Germany's secret police during the Nazi era, saying that such measures are unwarranted, unconstitutional, and “antithetical to democracy.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has vowed to publicly identify ICE agents and those who are “engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people.”</p>

President Donald Trump said that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it was cheaper to leave equipment in Afghanistan, prompting the two to clash. President Donald Trump disclosed he and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley clashed over leaving equipment in Afghanistan as the U.S. withdrew troops in 2021. Trump, who historically has pushed to recover billions of dollars' worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan, said Milley argued at the time it was cheaper to leave the equipment there. "That's when I knew he was an idiot," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. "Didn't take long to figure that one out. President Donald Trump said Gen. Milley argued at the time it was cheaper to leave the equipment in Afghanistan. Milley, who is now retired, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. The Taliban seized nearly all of the more than $7 billion worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan during the withdrawal process, according to a 2022 Department of Defense report. While U.S. troops removed or destroyed most of the major equipment, aircraft, ground vehicles and other weapons were left in Afghanistan. In 2021, President Joe Biden signed off on pulling U.S. troops from Afghanistan, following up on existing plans from the first Trump administration in 2020 with Taliban leaders to end the conflict. Then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley speaks during a news conference at the Pentagon, July 18, 2023. However, Biden bore the brunt of criticism for the withdrawal after the Taliban rapidly took over Afghanistan again, and more than a dozen U.S. service members died supporting evacuation efforts. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed during the withdrawal process due to a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, outside the then-Hamid Karzai International Airport, as the Taliban gained control of Kabul. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in May that he had instructed the Pentagon to launch a comprehensive review of the U.S. withdrawal to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the event and to hold those responsible accountable. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth instructed the Pentagon to launch a comprehensive review of the U.S. withdrawal. "This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation." Milley said in his apology that his appearance "created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics." "As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it," Milley said in the apology. Since then, Trump has issued various threats toward Milley, such as appearing to suggest Milley deserved to face execution for actions, including speaking to Chinese officials. Hegseth yanked Milley's security clearance in January. Milley told lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in March 2024 that he and the commander of U.S. Central Command at the time of the withdrawal, Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., both advised Biden to keep some U.S. troops in Afghanistan after pulling most forces. "The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war," Milley told lawmakers. "Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome." Diana Stancy is a politics reporter with Fox News Digital covering the White House.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A heavily armed man opened fire on federal agents with an assault rifle Monday morning at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Texas, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him. The Prairieland Detention Center is seen, Sept. 15, 2016, in Alvarado, Texas. (Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News via AP, File) Ten people have been arrested on attempted murder charges after attackers in black military-style clothing opened fire outside a Texas immigration detention center in a “planned ambush” that left one police officer wounded, a prosecutor said. He was treated at a hospital and released, the Johnson County Sheriff's office said. The shooting took place as President Donald Trump 's administration ramps up deportations, which will be turbocharged by a massive spending bill that became law last week. The attack “seemed to be designed” to draw U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel outside the facility, “and it worked,” Nancy Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a Monday night news conference in Fort Worth. Two unarmed corrections officers spoke to the group in the detention center's parking lot as someone standing in nearby woods appeared to signal with a flashlight, according to a criminal complaint. “Another assailant, who was across the street, nowhere near the corrections officers, shot 20 to 30 rounds at these unarmed corrections officers,” she said. A flag saying “Resist fascism, fight oligarchy,” and flyers with words such as “Fight ICE terror with class war” also were recovered near the center. Sheriff's deputies stopped seven people about 300 yards (275 meters) from where the officer was shot. “It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers,” she said. Sheriff's deputies also stopped a van leaving the area and found two AR-style rifles and a pistol, along with ballistic-style vests and a helmet, the complaint said. He said he had met some people online and drove some of them to the detention center from Dallas to “make some noise,” according to the complaint. On Monday, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility more than 400 miles (640 kilometers) south in McAllen, injuring a police officer. Asked if the two shootings were connected, Larson said she could not comment because of the ongoing investigation. Additional searches in Alvarado led to masks, goggles, tactical gloves, more body armor, weapons, spray paint and fireworks, Larson said. An extra layer of protection has been provided for staff at the Prairieland center, said Josh Johnson, the acting Enforcement and Removal Operations field office director in Dallas. Another person was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy for attempting to conceal and destroy evidence, Larson said. U.S. District Court records do not list names of attorneys representing the group, or scheduled court appearances.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will no longer consider Syria's Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group led by Syria's interim president, a foreign terrorist organization, according to a notice from Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The revocation was signed on June 23 and will take effect on Tuesday, according to the notice from Rubio. In a separate statement Monday, Rubio said the revocation of the designation “follows the announced dissolution of HTS and the Syrian government's commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms.” “This FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump's vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria.” The United States and Syria have not yet re-established diplomatic relations, although a number of administration officials have met with Syrian officials, including interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Al-Sharaa is the leader of the HTS, which was was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate. HTS, with Al-Sharaa at its helm, led the shocking ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to formally end US sanctions on Syria, following an announcement earlier in June that he would lift sanctions in order to help the country rebuild after years of war. As part of the executive order, the administration was reviewing Syria's state sponsor of terrorism and foreign terrorist organization designations, a senior administration official said. The state sponsor of terrorism designation has been in place since 1979. A State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that HTS “remains identified as an alias of Al-Nusrah Front, which is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) at this time.” Al-Sharaa is still listed as an SDGT on the Treasury Department's sanctions list.</p>

That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? What NWS and FEMA cuts could mean for future disasters, explained. In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, my colleague Noel King, who cohosts the Today, Explained podcast spoke with CNN senior climate reporter Andrew Freedman about what we know about the impact of cuts to the National Weather Service and what those cuts could mean for future disasters. This conversation originally appeared on the Today, Explained podcast and was featured in the Today, Explained newsletter, which you can subscribe to here. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. What do we know about [the two weather forecasting offices in Texas]? In the case of the Austin/San Antonio office, they're missing a warning coordination meteorologist and a science and operations officer. Both of those positions were opened up because people took early retirement under the Trump administration's program to try to get people to reduce the size of the federal government. These staff cuts in those two particular offices do not seem to have had a major impact or even a very clear impact on the way the weather service performed during this event. What I think I'm hearing is that your reporting does not seem to suggest at this point that the disaster in Texas was caused by the Trump administration cuts. Because that position is somebody who interacts with emergency managers who are then responsible for warning the community. But when I've talked to sources, they basically are saying it probably did not affect the timeliness of the warnings, the tone of the warnings, which ratcheted up very quickly, as well as how early they caught on to this event possibly taking place. Do we know why that top meteorologist position in San Angelo was unfilled? The National Weather Service lost about 600 people. They did get hit hard by DOGE cuts. What's happened with these cuts is they're losing the most experienced people. And then you have to train up people who are coming in, and they don't have the same level of experience. But there is one point that's really important here because the cuts have been so deep around the country: This is a question that's going to come up at every single disaster that takes place. Because the meteorologists that I've been talking to in the broader community are basically telling me this doesn't seem to be the event that vacancies caused a tragedy. But mark my words that that will happen at some point if this isn't addressed. This event actually was the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. And that rained out over inland Texas. We also just had Tropical Storm Chantal that made landfall in South Carolina and is causing flooding today and caused flooding over the weekend. So it's just this sense in the community that they're really stretched thin, that people are working longer shifts, people are working six-day weeks. When a disaster hits, FEMA is often there to pick up the pieces, to help clear up the wreckage. The Trump administration has also made cuts to FEMA. Do we know how broad those are? The cuts to FEMA are quite broad. However, they pretty much kind of stopped that process as hurricane season came upon us. These cuts are being made to the National Weather Service, FEMA, in the name of cost savings. I can tell you, though, that there are enormous economic benefits to accurate weather forecasts. Studies have shown savings of billions of dollars with more accurate hurricane track forecasts, for example. If you look at the proposals that the administration has put forward for the 2026 budget, they want to actually close every single weather and climate lab that we have in this country. So the people who are working on improving flash flood forecasts, the people who are working on improving hurricane forecasts, and doing the research that would then lead to the forecast capabilities of tomorrow would be out of a job if that budget were enacted as proposed.

White House Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, joined Fox News Digital for an exclusive interview as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" is debated in the Senate. Senate Republicans are set to consider a multibillion-dollar package of cuts from the White House, but the top Senate Democrat warned that doing so could have consequences for a later government funding showdown. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned on Tuesday that the Senate GOP's plan to move forward with a $9.4 billion rescissions package would have "grave implications" on Congress, particularly the forthcoming government funding fight in September. "Republicans' passage of this purely partisan proposal would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process," Schumer wrote in a letter to fellow Senate Democrats. "That's why a number of Senate Republicans know it is absurd for them to expect Democrats to act as business as usual and engage in a bipartisan appropriations process to fund the government, while they concurrently plot to pass a purely partisan rescissions bill to defund those same programs negotiated on a bipartisan basis behind the scenes," he continued. Such proposed cuts must be approved by both chambers within 45 days. Elon Musk announced the launch of his "America Party" via X on Saturday. This package in particular, which narrowly squeaked through the House by a two-vote margin last month, would claw back $8.3 billion in funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and over $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the government-backed funding arm for NPR and PBS. The package, informed heavily by the cuts proposed by President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, formerly helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, would only need to pass a simple majority in the upper chamber to pass. Musk and DOGE made USAID a primary target of their hunt for waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government, dismantling much of the long-standing organization ahead of the rescission request. Sen. Susan Collins speaks at a Senate Appropriations hearing on Nov. 20, 2024. And the rescissions package is not wildly popular among Republicans. Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, said during a hearing on the package late last month that she was concerned about proposed cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the CPB, and warned that cuts to the AIDS and HIV prevention program would be "extraordinarily ill-advised and shortsighted." Earlier this year, he withheld support for the House GOP-authored government funding extension before ultimately agreeing to the deal. That same scenario could play out once more come September. "Senate Republicans must reject this partisan path and instead work with Democrats on a bipartisan appropriations process." Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

In photo released by Geological Agency (Badan Geologi) of the Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki spews volcanic materials during an eruption in East Flores, Indonesia, Monday, July 7, 2025. MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Residents wore masks to protect themselves from thick volcanic ash that blanketed roads and green rice fields in villages in south-central Indonesia as rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Tuesday for a second straight day. The eruption at dawn sent lava and clouds of ash up to 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) high. That followed an eruption around midday Monday that sent a column of volcanic materials up to 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and an evening burst that spewed lava and send volcanic ash as high as 13 kilometers (8 miles) into the air. Photos and videos circulating on social media showed terrified residents ran for their lives under the rain of ash and gravel and motorists struggled to drive motorbikes and cars in the reduced visibility as the ash clouds from Monday's eruption expanded into a mushroom shape. No casualties have been reported from the latest eruptions of the volcano that has been at the highest alert level since June 18 when its no-go zone was expanded to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson. “People around the volcano have increasingly understood how to minimize the impact of disaster risks as eruptions became more frequent since the end of 2023,” Muhari said in a statement. The eruptions of the volcano on on Flores Island affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages in East Flores and Sikka districts, according to initial assessments by the local disaster management agency. Thick volcanic ash and rocks were reported to have fallen in villages of Nawakote, Klantanio, Hokeng Jaya, Boru, Pululera and Wulanggitang, where roads and green rice fields were transformed into grey thick mud and rocks, said Very Awales, an public information official at Sikka district administration, adding that schools were closed in those affected areas since Monday to protect students and staff from various hazards due to volcanic activities. “The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,” Awales said. Residents were also urged to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano. The eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki followed its eruption in November 2024  that killed nine people and injured dozens. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic materials, including hot thumb-size gravel, were thrown up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater. Muhari said two airports in the cities of Maumere and Larantuka in East Nusa Tenggara province remained closed Tuesday. Monday's initial eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California defied the Trump administration's stance on Monday on transgender-identifying biological males being allowed to compete against females in women's sports, rejecting a chance to resolve its dispute with the Department of Education. The Education Department had sent California a resolution agreement to “follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports.” After California rejected the proposal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon noted Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) comment earlier this year that requiring female athletes to compete against biological males is unfair. “California has just REJECTED our resolution agreement to follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports,” McMahon posted on X. Newsom's acknowledgment that ‘it's an issue of fairness' was empty political grandstanding. The Education Department said last month that California had violated Title IX, which protects against gender discrimination in women's sports. The Trump administration argued that allowing transgender-identifying biological males to compete in women's sports deprives female athletes of having their sex-segregated sports, while men get to have their own, thus constituting discrimination. The alleged violation came after transgender athlete AB Hernandez won two first-place medals and a second-place medal at the state's female track and field championships in May. President Donald Trump said Hernandez's participation “IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.” He then threatened to cancel “large-scale” federal funding to California if the state didn't comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports that do not correspond to their sex. He cited Newsom's statement from earlier this year, which McMahon had also pointed to, that transgender athletes competing in women's sports is “deeply unfair.” As McMahon indicated, the Department of Justice is now expected to get involved and possibly punish California and the CIF for their decision. “I think the attorney general is well poised and ready for a fight to go down,” said Kathie Moehlig, founder and executive director of TransFamily Support Services. Sophia Lorey, outreach director for California Family Council, indirectly countered Moehlig's statement by saying it was an “embarrassing hill” for California to “die on.” “It's a really embarrassing hill for the state of California to die on and lose that money simply because they want to allow males to be in girls locker rooms and girls sports teams,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>King Charles III will highlight the crucial bonds between the United Kingdom and France in the face of a “multitude of complex threats” as he welcomes President Emmanuel Macron for the first state visit by a European leader since Brexit. The French leader's three-day visit to the UK kicks off on Tuesday and sees Charles and Queen Camilla host Macron and his wife Brigitte at Windsor Castle, with a glittering banquet at the royal residence in the evening. In his toast on Tuesday evening, the King is expected to praise the strength of Anglo-French relationship as “our two countries face a multitude of complex threats, emanating from multiple directions,” according to Britain's PA Media news agency. The Macrons were greeted off the plane by the Prince and Princess of Wales on their arrival at RAF Northolt, west of London, and traveled together to Windsor where they were treated to a full ceremonial welcome by the King and his wife. After descending the plane's steps, the president greeted Prince William warmly before he lent forward and kissed Kate's hand. Macron described the state visit as an “important moment for our two nations” in a post on social media ahead of his arrival in Britain. “Together, we will address the major challenges of our time: security, defence, nuclear energy, space, innovation, artificial intelligence, migration, and culture. These are all areas in which we seek to act together and deepen our cooperation in a concrete, effective, and lasting way.” Macron's visit comes just under two years after Charles and Camilla visited France in September 2023 and seeks to “demonstrate the depth of the ties between our two countries and peoples,” according to the Elysee Palace. On Tuesday, Macron has a busy afternoon with a packed itinerary that will see him take a trip into London to lay a wreath at Westminster Abbey's Grave of the Unknown Warrior before addressing both Houses of Parliament in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery. In the days ahead, the French leader will hold several meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the pair seek to heal wounds after years of Brexit-fueled animosity. Their talks are expected to focus on support for defense and security cooperation as well as tackling illegal migration across the Channel. On Thursday, the pair will join a UK-France Summit at Downing Street. Support for Ukraine will also be a priority for the two leaders as they seek to build momentum around their “Coalition of the Willing” - the European peacekeeping force created in March. They are also expected to visit a military base in northwest London where they will dial into a meeting of the informal group of nations working to bolster support for Ukraine. Both leaders have faced political challenges at home amid an increasing fractured landscape, and have suffered from decreasing popularity in recent polls. It's likely they'll be hoping the visit offers a much-needed, if fleeting, boost. Major deals on Ukraine and curbing migrant boat crossings seem unlikely but even more humble announcements would illustrate a further resetting of the relationship between the two nations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit died by suicide on Monday, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin fired him from the job, officials said. Starovoit was dismissed by Putin on Monday morning. The decree announcing his dismissal was published on the official Kremlin website, with his deputy Andrey Nikitin appointed acting minister. Asked by reporters for the reasons behind Starovoit's dismissal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this was due to a “lack of trust,” but gave no alternative reason. On Tuesday, Peskov told journalists that the Kremlin was “shocked” by the news of Staravoit's death, describing it as “tragic and sorrowful.” “This cannot but shock any normal person. Naturally, it shocked us as well,” he said. “But an investigation is underway to answer all questions. He was found with a gunshot wound, the committee said. Russian state media reported that Korneichuk died at his workplace, possibly from “acute heart failure.” There is no indication the deaths are linked. While he left the post before Ukraine's surprise incursion, he was partially blamed for security failures in the Russian region. Russian media reported on Monday that Starovoit has been implicated in an investigation into the embezzlement of state funds allocated for building fortifications in the region. Vesti, a state TV program, as well as RBC, a Russian independent business media outlet, and the Russian business daily newspaper Kommersant reported that he was being investigated. The dismissal came amid a multi-day disruption to air travel in Russia. The Ukrainian military said it also struck a chemical plant in Krasnozavodsk, north of Moscow early on Monday. It said the plant manufactures “pyrotechnic devices and ammunition, including thermobaric warheads for Shahed-type” drones. At least 12 civilians were killed and more than 90 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine in the 24 hours to mid-morning on Monday, according to Ukrainian authorities. At least 17 more people, including a teenage boy, were injured when the same city was struck with drones again just five hours later, according to Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov. The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia fired four surface-to-air missiles and 101 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in the past 24 hours, adding that it downed 75 of the drones either by shooting them down or by jamming. Six draft offices across the country have been attacked by Russian drones in just over a week, the Land Forces said in a statement, adding that they believed Russia was attacking the offices in an attempt to disrupt the Ukrainian military's enlistment process. At least two people have been killed and more than a dozen injured in these attacks, the statement said. This story has been updated with additional developments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. military troops and federal immigration officers made a mighty but brief show of force Monday at MacArthur Park dubbed the “Ellis Island of the West Coast” as the community hub of a largely immigrant neighborhood in Los Angeles. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration LOS ANGELES (AP) — Federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out around a mostly empty Los Angeles park in a largely immigrant neighborhood on foot, horseback and military vehicles on Monday for about an hour before abruptly leaving, an operation that local officials said seemed designed to sow fear. Federal agents ride on horseback at MacArthur Park, Monday, July 7, 2025, in Los Angeles. Their uniforms read “Police U.S. Border Patrol,” and “HSI,” which stands for Homeland Security Investigations. About 90 members of the California National Guard were present to protect immigration officers, defense officials said. “What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,” said Mayor Karen Bass, who showed up at the park alongside activists. She said there were children attending a day camp in the park who were quickly ushered inside to avoid seeing the troops. Still, Bass said an 8-year-old boy told her that “he was fearful of ICE.” The operation occurred at a park in a neighborhood with large Mexican, Central American and other immigrant populations and is lined by businesses with signs in Spanish and other languages that has been dubbed by local officials as the “Ellis Island of the West Coast.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass talks on her mobile phone next to a border patrol federal agent at MacArthur Park Monday, July 7, 2025, in Los Angeles. Sprawling MacArthur Park has a murky lake ringed by palm trees, an amphitheater that hosts summer concerts and sports fields where immigrant families line up to play soccer in the evenings and on weekends. Among those who spoke with Bass were health care outreach workers who were working with homeless residents Monday when troops pointed guns at them and told them to get out of the park. Photos show federal officers riding on horseback toward a mostly empty soccer field. Other heavily armed authorities stood guard around the area alongside armored vehicles. Eunisses Hernandez, a council member whose district includes MacArthur Park said “it was chosen as this administration's latest target precisely because of who lives there and what it represents.” It came after President Donald Trump deployed thousands of Guard members and active duty Marines to the city last month following protests over previous immigration raids. Federal agents stage at MacArthur Park Monday, July 7, 2025, in Los Angeles. Trump has stepped up efforts to realize his campaign pledge of deporting millions of immigrants in the United States illegally and shown a willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. More than 4,000 California National Guard and hundreds of U.S. Marines have been deployed in Los Angeles since June — against the wishes of California Gov. Two defense officials told reporters that what happened at MacArthur Park on Monday was not a military operation but acknowledged that the size and scope of the Guard's participation could make it look like one to the public. “It's just going to be more overt and larger than we usually participate in,” that official said. “This morning looked like a staging for a TikTok video,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council, adding if Border Patrol wants to film in LA, “you should apply for a film permit like everybody else. “This was a reality TV spectacle much more so than an actual enforcement operation.” Since federal agents have been making arrests at Home Depot parking lots and elsewhere in Los Angeles, Newman said fewer people have been going to the park and immigrant neighborhoods near the city's downtown. Betsy Bolte, who lives nearby, came to the park after seeing a military-style helicopter circling overhead. She said it was “gut-wrenching” to witness what appeared to be a federal show of force on the streets of a U.S. city.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police Brigadier General Nicolas Torre speaks during a hearing on the arrest of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Manila, Philippines, March 20, 2025. MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighting fans, the Philippine police chief said Monday. The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano. The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region. The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere. National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias “Totoy,” provided crucial details. The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin. “I was very shocked,” Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. “It firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.” Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings. While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe. Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's proposed cuts to climate research and plans to overhaul federal disaster relief are under scrutiny after catastrophic flooding in Texas over the weekend left at least 104 dead. Asked Monday whether Trump still supports phasing out FEMA, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn't answer directly. Instead, she praised the response by Texas officials and reiterated that the president “wants states to do as much as they can, if not more.” “That's a policy discussion that will continue, and the President has always said he wants states to do as much as they can, if not more,” Leavitt said during the White House briefing. Following Friday's intense storms and sudden flooding in the Texas Hill Country, local leaders voiced frustration with what they saw as insufficient National Weather Service warnings. Under the Trump administration, NWS has seen steep workforce reductions, with nearly half of its 122 field offices operating with at least 20% fewer staff as part of a broader effort from the Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal government. Citing a New York Times report, Schumer noted that critical positions, including warning coordination meteorologist, science officer, and hydrologist, were vacant at NWS offices in San Angelo and San Antonio during the flooding. Members of the weather community and lawmakers alike have echoed concerns about NWS staffing gaps. “I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) told CNN on Sunday, calling for a formal investigation. “The WFOs [weather forecasting offices] had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,” Fahy told NBC News on Saturday. Leavitt defended NWS efforts and accused critics of politicizing the disaster. She said the agency issued timely warnings and deployed extra staff despite record-breaking rainfall, calling claims that Trump was to blame “a depraved lie.” “To any person who has deliberately lied about these facts surrounding this catastrophic event, you should be deeply ashamed,” she said. Pressed Sunday on whether federal cuts contributed to the staffing gaps, Trump flatly denied it. “They did not,” he said, calling the flooding “a 100-year catastrophe” and “so horrible to watch.” Asked if meteorologists should be rehired, Trump added, “I would think not. Very talented people in there, and they didn't see it.” “I think this is not a time for partisan finger-pointing and attacks,” Cruz said. “After we come through search and rescue after we come through the process of rebuilding, there will naturally be a period of retrospection where you look back and say, ‘OK, what exactly transpired, what was the timeline, and what could have been done differently to prevent this loss of life? Scientists and lawmakers say these facilities have been instrumental in advancing life-saving forecasting tools. “I've allowed things in my district to be closed before, but this is a national asset, and I want to be very careful about what we do with it.” His comments echoed broader unease among lawmakers from storm-prone regions, where weather forecasting is considered critical infrastructure. “I think many of us, especially from weather-prone states, are on high alert about this budget request and remain dedicated to ensuring that they don't lose funding,” said an aide to a GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect candidly on the situation.</p>
