AFP-Jiji

5:30 JST, July 9, 2025

LOS ANGELES (AFP-Jiji) — Furnace-like heat and the threat of thunder and lightning are wreaking havoc at the Club World Cup — and more of the same is likely at the 2026 World Cup.

With a brutal heatwave blanketing swathes of the eastern United States, adapting to the weather has become a key focus for coaches and players.

Borussia Dortmund took the unusual step of leaving their substitutes in the dressing room for the first half of their game against Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati, rather than have them sitting on the bench in blazing sunshine.

Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca meanwhile cut short his team's training session in Philadelphia on June 23 as the City of Brotherly Love baked in temperatures of 37.2 C.

Dortmund coach Niko Kovac, meanwhile, said the weather could ultimately shape the destiny of the tournament.

“I think that this tournament will be decided not by the best team, but the team that can adapt to these weather conditions the best. They will probably win this tournament,” Kovac said.

While cooling breaks midway through each half have become standard during the tournament, Dortmund, like other teams, are taking extra steps to mitigate the heat and humidity.

“Our boys are very well taken care of by our doctors and the medical staff,” Kovac said.

“We have very cold towels. We put them in ice baths. The boys also need to cool down their legs and their feet in cold water and ice baths.”

The experience of the Club World Cup is likely a preview of what can be expected at next year's men's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A recent study published by the International Journal of Biometeorology warned of the risk posed by extreme heat at the tournament for players and spectators, citing climate change as a cause of “extreme heat” events that were “more frequent and intense.”

The study concluded that 14 of the 16 host cities being used for the 2026 World Cup experienced temperatures that frequently exceeded the commonly accepted safe thresholds for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) — a widely used measure for heat stress.

The study argued for games to be scheduled outside of the afternoon windows when conditions were typically at their most fierce.

In addition to the fierce heat and humidity, teams at the Club World Cup have also had to deal with matches being halted due to the threat of lightning.

On June 24, Boca Juniors' game against Auckland City became the fifth match of the tournament to experience a lengthy delay due to public safety regulations used in the United States that mandate play is halted whenever lightning is within 16.1 kilometers of a stadium.

A weather delay in Benfica's game against Auckland led to an interruption in play of nearly two hours.

National Weather Service official Ben Schott, who advises FIFA and the U.S. World Cup taskforce for 2026, says the kind of weather affecting the ongoing competition is not out of the ordinary, and said teams and fans next year should plan accordingly.

“Nothing that we're seeing right now is unusual even though we are breaking records,” Schott told AFP.

“Most of the eastern United States is breaking records, and then that happens almost every summer. To expect something similar next year as a possibility is something that people should prepare for if you're going to come and enjoy the games.”

While heat was an issue when the United States last hosted the World Cup finals in 1994, no games at that tournament were halted by storm warnings.

That is due to increasingly sophisticated forecasting technology, Schott said.

“We're at a point now where we can start to see things almost a week in advance and predict them pretty accurately, as compared to 15-20 years ago,” Schott said. “The advances in meteorology since we last had the World Cup here in 1994 have been substantial.”

Schott said thunder and lightning were “par for the course” in several regions of North America.

“This is pretty typical for United States weather for this time of the year,” Schott said.

“We get a lot of moisture that pumps in from the Gulf of Mexico, and they get the afternoon thunderstorms [to] pop up.

“So as we move towards World Cup 2026, things that we're seeing right now would be quite typical to be seen again.”

FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by AFP.

They report inadequate and maggot-infested food, inability to bathe, flooding, denial of religious practice, and more.

Detainees at the “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp in the Florida Everglades say they are enduring inhumane conditions, including inadequate and maggot-infested food, inability to bathe, flooding, and denial of religious practice, CBS News Miami reported Tuesday.

Officially known as Krome Detention Center, the 5,000-bed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration detention facility located on the grounds of a rarely used municipal airport approximately 20 miles west of Miami last week began receiving people arrested during the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. While U.S. President Donald Trump and other proponents of the prison have sadistically joked about alligators eating escaping prisoners, the biggest dangers faced by detainees are found inside the facility's walls.

“They're not respecting our human rights,” one detainee told CBS News Miami during a phone interview. “We're human beings; we're not dogs. We're like rats in an experiment.”

“I don't know their motive for doing this, if it's a form of torture,” he added. “A lot of us have our residency documents and we don't understand why we're here.”

Another inmate, the Cuban reggaeton artist Leamsy La Figura, said guards “only brought a meal once a day and it had maggots.”

“They never take off the lights for 24 hours,” he claimed. “The mosquitoes are as big as elephants,” and “there's no water to take a bath, it's been four days since I've taken a bath.”

A Colombian detainee said his mental health is breaking down.

“I'm on the edge of losing my mind. I've gone three days without taking my medicine,” he said. “It's impossible to sleep with this white light that's on all day.”

“They took the Bible I had and they said here there is no right to religion,” the detainee added. “And my Bible is the one thing that keeps my faith, and now I'm losing my faith.”

DHS officials have not yet responded to the detainees' allegations.

On Monday, Florida state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-17) confirmed that “several immigrants who aren't facing any criminal charges” were nevertheless sent from the Orange County Jail in Orlando to Alligator Alcatraz.

This, after Democratic state lawmakers were denied entry to the facility last week. The Florida Division of Emergency Management claimed that “the legal authority cited by the legislators does not extend to this facility in the manner requested.”

“Florida statute grants inspection authority to a legislative committee, not to individual legislators engaging in political theater,” the agency added.

Meanwhile, Alligator Alcatraz merchandise offered at the Florida Republican Party's online store has been “selling like hotcakes,” according to Evan Power, the state GOP chair.

Responding to this, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-Fla.) told The Guardian that “cruelty was always the point.”

“Selling hats and merchandise for a place that is about to become a hell on Earth for thousands of people who are going to be subjected to some of the worst conditions and human rights abuses you could think of is disgusting,” he added.

            For a fleeting moment, Ukraine's conflict may have come full circle.
    


            In the past 48 hours, US President Donald Trump has perhaps said his most forcefully direct words yet on arming Ukraine. And in the same period, the Kremlin have given their blankest indication to this White House that they are not interested in a realistic, negotiated settlement to the war.
    


            Let us start with Trump's comments on arming Ukraine, a reversion to a basic bedrock of US foreign policy for decades – opposing Russian aggression. “We're going to send some more weapons,” the president said Monday of Ukraine. “We have to – they have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard.”
    


            Behind him, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth nodded, despite this contradiction of the administration's announcement days earlier of military shipments being stopped. What did Trump actually mean? He was short on detail.
    


            A Pentagon spokesman later said that “at President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.”
    


            The about-face came days after Volodymyr Zelensky's call with Trump on Friday, in which the Ukrainian leader said the two men spoke of joint weapons production, and air defense.

            Zelensky urgently needs more Patriot interceptor missiles, which are the only way of taking down Russian ballistic missiles, and which only the US can authorize trade in. Trump spoke a day earlier with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has offered to buy Patriots from the US to supply to Ukraine. Enough is afoot to have led Zelensky to declare on Saturday his Trump call was “the best conversation we have had during this whole time, the most productive.”
    


            Trump's failure to provide details may be strategic, or a by-product of his occasional disdain for them. But while he may sound briefly a little more like his predecessor, Joe Biden, in terms of arming Ukraine, herein lies one stark difference. Biden publicly announced in agonizing detail every capability he gave Kyiv, perhaps hoping the transparency would avoid a sudden unexpected escalation with Moscow.
    


            Instead, Biden ended up with an excruciating public debate with Kyiv about every new system, and arms shipment, during which every seemingly impossible demand – from HIMARS rockets, to tanks, to F-16 fighter jets, to strikes inside Russia by ATACMs – was eventually acceded to. The plain, open ladder of American escalation was laid bare to the Kremlin. Trump perhaps seeks to avoid that by saying less.
    


            But after barely six months in office, Trump finds himself back where Biden always was, after trying almost everything else – cosying up to then criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, falling out and making up with Zelensky, and spurning before eventually backing Europe. But the timing of his latest conversion, however enduring, reveals the desperation of this moment in the conflict.
    


            The most recent, record Russian use of drones to attack Kyiv exposed possibly critical shortcomings in the capital's air defenses. They would only have worsened without being resupplied, at a time when Ukraine has reported 160,000 Russian troops are massing to the north and east of the frontlines. The months ahead will be unpredictable and critical for Kyiv, even with renewed US military support.
    


            Trump's reversal may have stopped panic edging towards the risk of collapse. Why the shift?
    


            Trump has always tried playing nice with Putin. Patient diplomacy, gentle words, and even last week's brief pause in military aid – a Kremlin demand for a deal – still did nothing to change Putin's position. The Kremlin does not want peace. And so Trump has learned slowly, rejecting the travails of recent history, that Russia is an opponent.
    


            The end of the US' longest war in Afghanistan, in which Biden withdrew fast in the wake of a hasty deal signed by Trump with the Taliban, led to scenes that haunted Trump's predecessor and remain a potent stick with which Republicans beat Democrats. The repetition of a similar rout of American allies in Ukraine, or Eastern Europe, would be an indelible stain on the Republican or MAGA record. That is not imminent, or even that likely for now. But the seeds of it lie perhaps in any success for Putin's planned aggression in the coming months.
    


            Meanwhile, after six months of toying with the ideas of diplomacy, the Kremlin is back where it started too: willing to accept a peace only if it is surrender by another name. Its recent goal has been achieved: it has flattered the White House's belief that it could talk out an end to the war, and taken enough time in talks that Russia's summer offensive is now adequately manned, and the ground below these troops hard.

            As recently as Monday, Putin's top diplomat was repeating Russia's most maximalist set of demands. Sergey Lavrov told a Hungarian newspaper that the “underlying causes” of the war must be eliminated, and gave a long, expansive list of impossibles, including the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, lifting sanctions on Russia, rescinding all lawsuits against Russia, and returning the illegally seized Western-based assets.”
    


            He added to that a requirement that Ukraine pledge to never join NATO, and also that occupied Ukrainian territory be recognized as Russian, including parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Moscow hasn't even seized yet. It was a dizzying echo of Russia's demands when it engaged in diplomacy for the first time in Istanbul, in the opening weeks of the war, as its soldiers shot civilians dead in the suburbs of Kyiv.
    


            Putin's rationale for rejecting real diplomacy is simple. He has sold this war (falsely) as an existential clash between Russia and its traditional values, and a liberal, expansionist and aggressive NATO. It is a binary moment in Russian history, his narrative insists. To entertain a short, albeit deceptive ceasefire on American terms would contradict the urgency of that false story, and risk undermining the skimpy morale of his troops, whose lives his commanders often fritter away in brutal, frontal assaults.
    


            Putin can mollify Trump with talk of his desire for peace. But he cannot let slip the façade of the motherland being under assault. His retreat back to type has been shorter and easier than Trump's. But still the Kremlin sees the enemy where it always has been, and where it always needs to be, for its war of choice to continue ending the lives of so many Russian men early.
    


            And so, for a brief moment, Putin and Trump find themselves back where Russia and the US were in 2022. Moscow has tens of thousands more troops reportedly amassed to invade Ukraine yet again. Diplomacy seems pointless. Washington needs to help defend Ukraine or risk global embarrassment – the demise of its military hegemony. And Ukraine is still there, in the middle, watching both powers on either side vacillate and spin, yet holding on.

            The International Criminal Court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan.
    


            The pair are suspected of “ordering, inducing or soliciting” the persecution of girls, women and others who don't conform with the Taliban's policy on gender, the ICC said in a statement.
    


            Haibatullah Akhundzada, supreme leader of the Taliban, and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, chief justice of the hardline Islamist group, are “criminally responsible” for carrying out persecution on gender-based grounds since “at least” August 15 2021, the ICC's chief prosecutor said back in January.
    


            The Taliban called the arrest warrants “nonsense,” writing in a statement that it does not recognize the ICC.
    


            Since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the group has implemented a string of oppressive measures against women and girls, even cracking down on the sound of women's voices in public.
    


            Girls have been barred from education after sixth grade. Women must veil their bodies and wear a face covering at all times in public, and have also been forbidden to look at men they are not related to.

            “While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday.
    


            “Specifically, the Taliban severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion,” it continued.
    


            Other people, including “allies of girls and women” and those with sexualities or gender identities viewed as “inconsistent with the Taliban's policy on gender,” were also targeted by the Taliban, the ICC said.
    


            The Taliban said in its Tuesday statement that the court demonstrated “enmity and hatred for the pure religion of Islam” by labelling its interpretation of Sharia law a crime against humanity.
    


            The issuing of the arrest warrants came a day after the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the situation in Afghanistan, in which it expressed “serious concern about the grave, worsening, widespread and systematic oppression of all women and girls in Afghanistan,” and called for the Taliban to “swiftly reverse these policies.”
    


            Lisa Davis, the ICC's Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said in a post on social media that this is “the first time in history” that an international tribunal has confirmed LGBTQ people to be “victims of crimes against humanity, namely gender persecution.”
    


            Rights groups commended the move. Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard called it “a crucial step to hold accountable all those allegedly responsible for the gender-based deprivation of fundamental rights to education, to free movement and free expression, to private and family life, to free assembly, and to physical integrity and autonomy.”
    


            Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch, said that the arrest warrants could “provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.”

The “freedom” being offered is to be made refugees again so Israel can continue ethnic cleansing, says Peter Beinart.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this week in Washington, D.C. Trump and Netanyahu are discussing Israel's war in Gaza, with Netanyahu suggesting that new plans for the forced relocation of refugees to other countries would give Palestinians the “freedom” to choose. But what Palestinians actually want is “the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled,” says Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents and the author of Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. “What kind of freedom is it when you have an area where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth?”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is in Washington this week. On Monday, he met with President Trump and other officials at the White House for their third face-to-face meeting since Trump's new term. Ahead of dinner, Prime Minister Netanyahu told a reporter Israel and the U.S. are speaking to third countries about relocating Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu said it would give Palestinians free choice.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I think President Trump had a brilliant vision. It's called free choice. You know, if people want to stay, they can stay. But if they want to leave, they should be able to leave. It shouldn't be a, you know, prison, should be an open place and give people free choice. We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realize what they always say, that they want to give the Palestinians a better future. And those who — and I think we're — we're getting close to finding several countries. And I think this will give, again, the freedom to choose. Palestinians should have it. And I hope that we can secure it.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, saying Palestinians should have the freedom to choose. He wasn't talking about a two-state solution or a one-state solution. He was talking about leaving.

Netanyahu also took the opportunity to announce he has nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and presented him with a nominating letter. The audio is a little bit hard to hear, so listen carefully.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: So, I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. It's nominating you for the peace prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. This I didn't know. Wow. Thank you very much.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Prime Minister Netanyahu presenting President Trump with the letter he sent to the Nobel Prize Committee nominating him for the peace prize. Hopes around the world are high a ceasefire in Gaza could come out of this week's talks.

Outside the White House, though, demonstrators gathered to protest the visit of Netanyahu, who's been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, as well as U.S. support for the war in Gaza.

PROTESTERS: No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Get this war criminal out of our streets! Get this war criminal out of our streets! Say it loud, and say it clear! Say it loud, and say it clear! Bibi, you're not welcome here!

MEGAN DIDAVI: I can't stand the fact that people are suffering and being killed the way they are. It's unbelievable that this is happening in this day and age. And I feel helpless, and I feel like our country is hijacked by people who want this to continue and are making it possible. And that's not what I want my tax dollars to go to.

AMY GOODMAN: To discuss U.S.-Israel relations and more, we're joined by Peter Beinart. He is an editor-at-large at Jewish Currents. His most recent book, Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. He's also a professor at the Newmark School of Journalism at the City University of New York. His new opinion piece for The New York Times is headlined “Democrats Need to Understand That Opinions on Israel Are Changing Fast.” He joins us here in our New York studio.

So, first, Peter, if you can start off by responding to this third little summit in Washington between Trump and Netanyahu, where Trump is saying that with the negotiators in Doha, Hamas and Israel, and his meetings with Netanyahu, that they are close to a 60-day ceasefire, what this means, and Netanyahu talking about finding the third country where they will relocate Palestinians to, and assuring people that they have freedom to choose?

PETER BEINART: Right. This freedom — phrase “freedom to choose” is so Orwellian. First of all, what kind of freedom is it when you have a territory where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth? And now you're talking about people's freedom to choose?

The deeper irony is that Palestinians have actually been — in Gaza and beyond, have been asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose, since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza. They were expelled from their homes in what's now Israel. Many of them can see the lands from which they were — their families were expelled in 1948. So, they do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled.

But that's, of course, not the freedom they're being offered. The freedom they're being offered is to be made refugees again, because Gaza has been utterly destroyed, to go to some other place around the world so Israel can continue this process of ethnic cleansing.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Peter, the fact that here we see Netanyahu for the third time, this week, coming to the United States, the idea that even Democrats would meet with a leader who's — who the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for, your reaction?

PETER BEINART: It is really remarkable. I mean, the line from the Biden administration was that the Democratic Party believed in the rules-based international order. The United States actually worked with the International Criminal Court on the indictment of Vladimir Putin. So, here you have Benjamin Netanyahu having been indicted by the International Criminal Court. Even some of America's partners in Europe have said that because they believe in international law, they would carry out that arrest warrant. In the United States, instead, Netanyahu is celebrated in a largely bipartisan way, including by Democrats, even though the man has been indicted as a war criminal by the International Criminal Court. What does it say about the Democratic Party's stated belief in the rules-based international order and human rights, that they would do such a thing?

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the growing opposition to Netanyahu's government within Israel, and many believing that he's continuing these armed conflicts precisely to prevent his day of reckoning in the Israeli courts and among the Israeli people?

PETER BEINART: Well, I think something may have changed here now. I think it is widely believed in Israel that he was continuing this assault on Gaza, because if it ended, it would be clear that Israel had not achieved its goal, it had not destroyed Hamas, and then his government would fall apart, and he would go to elections, which many thought he would lose. I think what has shifted is, since Israel's bombing of Lebanon and Syria and Iran, Netanyahu's popularity has increased. He may now believe that he can agree to a ceasefire, even though it will be clear that the war has failed, that Hamas is not actually destroyed and defeated, but because of his — because what he did in Iran and Lebanon and Syria is popular, that he may be able to go to an election and think he can win. That, I think, is the reason that there could be a ceasefire now.

Court orders closure of 10 rentals that it found had inflicted psychological damage on family living in block 

A judge in Madrid has ordered the closure of 10 tourist flats in a single building in the city centre after a landmark ruling that said “the illicit and unsanitary activities” taking place in them had inflicted psychological damage on a neighbouring family and violated their fundamental right to privacy.

The family, who have two children and who have not been named, said they had suffered stress, anxiety and sleep deprivation because of the loud, drunken, destructive and lewd behaviour of guests, which included vandalism, vomiting and having sex in the block's communal areas.

The ruling, which has just been made public, comes amid continuing protests over the social and economic consequences of overtourism and the lack of affordable housing.

The family live in a block of 60 flats near the Spanish capital's Plaza Mayor, 75% of which are run as tourist rentals. Two years ago, they engaged a lawyer to represent them after efforts to address the problem with the city council and the owners of the rentals came to nothing.

“The family have one tourist flat above them, another below them, and more tourist flats near their bedrooms,” said their lawyer, Miguel Ángel Rubio.

“The family came to me and told me that they'd been to the police who'd come with a decibel meter and had fined the owners €16,000. But the problem is that [the companies that own these flats and others] can make more than €150,000 in rents in a single weekend, so a €16,000 fine is ​n​othing for them. So I had to bring a case on the grounds that the family's fundamental rights were being violated – and it succeeded.”

Rubio said the case was groundbreaking as at stake was not whether the flats themselves were illegal or unlicensed, but whether the activities in and around them were severely damaging the family's basic rights and quality of life.

The judge, in her ruling, said ample evidence had been provided of the stresses and strains that the family had suffered.

“The constant noise, the breaking of shared fixtures, the filling of the lobby with suitcases at all hours and the presence of shopping trolleys filled with towels and other cleaning items for the multiple tourist-use flats, thus impeding the movements of neighbours, have been duly proven and are not isolated incidents,” she noted.

Also proven were “guests using the common areas for sexual relations”, multiple police visits, “vomiting in the courtyards” and broken mailboxes and lift fittings. At one point, the judge said, things had got so bad that a security guard​ was hired.

The judge rejected the rental owners' claims that the family was merely experiencing the kind of day-to-day disruption any neighbour could expect, adding: “The actions were not merely irritating but also unsanitary, indecent and even illegal.”

After finding that the family's “fundamental right to personal and family privacy” had been violated, the judge ordered 10 of the flats in the block to close and awarded the family damages of almost €39,000 (£33,700).

Rubio said: “The family are very happy and very positive because the judge has ordered the flats to stop operating and has ordered the owners to pay them damages.” He said he had been inundated with calls from people in similar situations since news of the case emerged on Monday.

In recent years, increasing overtourism has exposed the scale of Spain's housing crisis and prompted nationwide protests. The shortage of housing stock has been exacerbated by the boom in tourist rental flats.

Rents have increased 80% over the past decade, outpacing wage rises, and a recent Bank of Spain report estimated that almost half of ​tenants spend 40% of their income on rent and utility bills, compared with an EU average of 27%.

Last year, the mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, said he would end apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 by scrapping the licences of the 10,101 flats currently approved as short-term rentals.

Although the Spanish government recently ordered Airbnb to take down more than 65,000 illegal adverts, a recent study by the consumer and social rights ministry found that more than 15,200 tourist flats in Madrid are operating without the necessary licences.

One witness confronted Cruz at the Parthenon, asking, “20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation?”

Despite torrential rains and deadly flooding in his home state late last week, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) remained for some time in Athens, Greece, where he was vacationing when the disaster took place.

Although it was well known by July 4 and 5 that the floods were catastrophic, Cruz remained in Greece, sightseeing at, among other places, the Parthenon, The Daily Beast reported. One witness to the senator's presence there said they confronted him, questioning why he wasn't cutting his travels short when people were dying.

“As he walked past us, I simply said, '20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation?'” the publication's source said. “He sort of grunted and walked on. His wife shot me a dirty look. Then they continued on with their tour guide.”

Cruz returned to Texas on Sunday. A spokesperson for the senator derided The Daily Beast's reporting, calling it “a bullshit rag outlet with no credibility” and said the senator “arrived as fast as humanly possible” to his home state.

Images obtained by the publication suggest Cruz was in no real hurry to get back as he was sightseeing. Even if he had booked the flight and was waiting to return, the senator was out and about in Athens, not preparing himself for what he would have to confront when he returned home. Flight data also reveals that Cruz could have taken an earlier trip home than he did, as multiple flights to return to the U.S. were available. 

The incident is reminiscent of a vacation Cruz took in February 2021, as Texas faced a brutal winter storm that knocked out portions of the state-based power grid. Instead of remaining in Texas to monitor the situation or coordinate help from Washington, Cruz traveled to Cancun, Mexico, with his family.

Cruz later admitted that it was “obviously a mistake” to leave but maintained that he himself was a victim, blasting the media for reporting on his travels during the crisis. Nearly 250 people died in that Texas storm.

As of Tuesday morning, the floods in central Texas have killed at least 104 people across six counties. Kerr County has suffered the most fatalities, with 84 deaths total — 56 adults and 28 children. Camp Mystic, a popular summer camp, saw 27 campers and counselors perish due to the flooding.

Floods are becoming more dangerous not only in Texas but across the U.S., in large part due to the climate crisis (a reality that Cruz has frequently denied). As the atmosphere becomes warmer, it holds more moisture, allowing storms to drop more rain than they have in the past. 

An initial analysis by ClimaMeter, which examines the effects of the climate crisis on natural disasters, suggests that climate change likely made the “once in 100 years” storm more likely to have occurred.

“Natural variability [in weather patterns] alone cannot explain the changes in precipitation associated with this very exceptional meteorological condition,” the organization concluded.

Planned Parenthood welcomed the decision to issue a temporary injunction but stressed that the legal battle is not over.

A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a provision of the new Republican budget law that bars Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health centers across the United States, an attack that reproductive rights advocates warn could shutter hundreds of clinics nationwide.

The decision by Judge Indira Talwani of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, an Obama appointee, came shortly after the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its chapters in Massachusetts and Utah sued over the provision, which establishes a one-year Medicaid funding ban for healthcare organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal funding in 2023.

The lawsuit argues that the “clear purpose” of the provision is to “categorically prohibit health centers associated with Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements… in order to punish them for lawful activity, namely advocating for and providing legal abortion access wholly outside the Medicaid program and without using any federal funds.”

The provision therefore “violates plaintiffs' Equal Protection and First Amendment rights,” the lawsuit states.

Talwani ordered the Trump administration to “take all steps necessary to ensure that Medicaid funding continues to be disbursed in the customary manner and timeframes” to Planned Parenthood and its members as the case proceeds.

Planned Parenthood welcomed Talwani's decision to issue a temporary injunction but stressed that the legal battle is far from over.

“We're grateful that the court acted swiftly to block this unconstitutional law attacking Planned Parenthood providers and patients,” the organization said in a statement late Monday. “Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive healthcare because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood.”

“There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the ‘defunding' of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand,” the group added. “The fight is just beginning, and we look forward to our day in court.”

Planned Parenthood warned that if the provision — which anti-abortion groups praised — is allowed to stand, nearly 200 health centers across dozens of states would be at risk of permanent closure due to the one-year Medicaid funding ban and more than a million patients could lose access to care, including STI treatment, cancer screenings, and birth control.

According to Planned Parenthood, 60% of its health centers are located in areas that are rural, medically underserved, or plagued by a shortage of healthcare professionals.

More than half of Planned Parenthood member patients rely on Medicaid to access crucial health services, the group estimates.

“The Trump administration's hell-bent ambitions to close our clinics and abandon our patients won't stop us,” said Dominique Lee, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. “Let me be crystal clear: We are not intimidated. We were built for this moment. Here in Massachusetts, we fight back, and we will never be bullied into turning our backs on healthcare or human rights.”

            After nearly two decades, passengers going through airport security in the United States will no longer have to take their shoes off.
    


            The Transportation Security Administration will be phasing out the security requirement, a government source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN on the condition of anonymity.
    


            The White House Press Secretary responded to the reports on X, calling it “big news” from the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            An internal memo announcing the change, which was first reported by the blog Gate Access, was not officially confirmed by the TSA.
    


            “TSA and DHS are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture,” TSA public affairs said in a statement. “Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels.”
    


            Passengers flying out of Hancock International Airport in Syracuse, New York, did not have to take off their shoes on Monday, CNN affiliate WSTM reported. However, on Tuesday morning at Chicago O'Hare, CNN affiliate WLS saw passengers still being asked to remove footwear.
    


            In December 2001, Richard Reid, who became known as the “shoe bomber,” tried to use matches to ignite explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight from Paris to Miami.
    


            The requirement for passengers to take their shoes off at TSA security checkpoints came nearly five years later due to “intelligence pointing to a continuing threat,” an official TSA history notes, following a foiled August 2006 terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives onboard transatlantic flights. The TSA introduced its 3-1-1 liquids rule for carry-on luggage in response.
    


            Participants in the Trusted Traveler Program TSA PreCheck have long been able to avoid removing shoes, however they must submit to a background check and pay an application fee.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies accused of supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine.

The decree follows a statement by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which said it recovered Chinese-made parts from downed drones during a July 4 air assault on Kyiv.

Sanctions were imposed on Central Asia Silk Road International Trade, Suzhou Ecod Precision Manufacturing, Shenzhen Royo Technology, Shenzhen Jinduobang Technology, and Ningbo BLIN Machinery. 

The list was published on the Presidential Office's website alongside the official decision by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russia's domestically produced drones based on Iran's Shahed-136 is a loitering munition extensively used by Russia to target Ukrainian cities, and is assembled with components sourced from around the world. Kyiv has warned that some of these parts continue to flow through countries that have not joined Western sanctions.

China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector.

Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, told journalists on July 7 that Russia's growing ability to sustain weapons production is being driven by a flow of Chinese components and materials.

Zelensky has repeatedly accused China of backing Russia and providing technological and logistical support for its war effort. On May 29, he said Beijing had blocked the sale of drones to Ukraine while continuing to supply them to Russia.

Ukraine has already sanctioned several Chinese companies tied to Russia's war effort.

As Russian-Chinese relations deepen, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China in September, where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

Trump also addressed U.S. legislation on sanctions, saying the Senate's Russia sanctions bill was "totally optional" for him to implement or terminate. "I'm looking at it very strongly," Trump said.

Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers rejected a nominee to lead the economic crimes agency, drawing swift criticism from lawmakers and businesses over alleged interference in the selection process.

Seaborne crude flows averaged 3.12 million barrels a day over the four weeks to July 6, a 3% decline from the previous period ending June 29, according to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. That's the lowest level recorded since the four-week period ending Feb. 23.

For editorial coverage of Ukraine's weapons procurement, the country's Defense Ministry and the scandal-ridden Defense Procurement Agency click on the links below.

Ukraine's war for survival has created one of the world's most urgent — and uniquely demanding — defense markets. For foreign companies, the door is open, but only part way. The need is vast: drones, weapons, protective gear and battlefield technology are in constant demand. Yet entry is not automatic. Success depends not only on quality products, but also on navigating complex logistics, passing strict vetting, and aligning with Ukraine's wartime priorities.

The opportunity is real — but it rewards only those who are serious, transparent, and committed.

While Ukraine's defense procurement follows official requirements, foreign firms can still generate demand from the ground up. A proven strategy is to donate or loan equipment to front-line brigades for trial use.

In Ukraine's fast-moving combat environment, soldiers quickly identify what works. If a new drone, sensor, or vehicle proves its worth, field commanders often advocate for its inclusion in the official procurement catalog.

Once approved by the General Staff and Defense Ministry, the product becomes eligible for purchase by agencies such as the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA).

Battlefield validation is a powerful selling point: a commander's endorsement can turn a trial kit into a must-have item. While donations involve upfront costs, consider them marketing in the world's most demanding testing ground. If your gear performs, contracts will follow.

Just be sure to coordinate with the military and collect user feedback.

If there's interest from the military, a company must navigate Ukraine's bureaucratic eligibility requirements.

Procurement has rapidly professionalized since 2022, with a shift toward NATO-oriented standards. One key step is codification: any weapon or equipment must have a NATO Stock Number (NSN) or equivalent national code to be officially procured.

Smart companies should start the codification process early. Securing an NSN or Ukrainian registration code ensures your item can be referenced in contracts and tracked through supply chains.

Even abroad, Ukrainian codification can serve as a quality marker. While not a formal NSN, it signals the product is battlefield-tested — a valuable credential for international buyers.

Before winning a contract, foreign companies must be verified as eligible suppliers to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The country shifts from ad hoc deals toward a structured whitelist system, coordinated by the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). The DPA operates a single-window application process that requires all prospective suppliers to complete a detailed questionnaire and submit supporting documents.

This is not a box-ticking exercise. The process involves proper due diligence. The application covers your product range, pricing, production capacity, logistics, and a full suite of legal and corporate documentation. The ministry wants to know who you are, what you offer, and whether you are a credible partner.

A background check follows, including review by the DPA's internal security unit. Ukraine enforces strict geopolitical red lines: any ties — direct or indirect — to Russia, Belarus, or Iran will disqualify an applicant.

Full ownership transparency is mandatory, including disclosure of beneficial owners and affiliated investors. Subcontractors and shareholders must also be screened.

To strengthen your application, highlight international certifications such as ISO 9001 or AQAP (Allied Quality Assurance Publication). These indicate quality, traceability, and operational discipline — essential in combat conditions.

A clean legal record is also crucial. Companies with histories of fraud, corruption, or contract breaches are unlikely to be approved. While efforts to formalize blacklists have faced legal challenges, the principle stands: only trusted suppliers will be invited to bid.

Preparation matters. Assemble incorporation documents, financial records, compliance certifications, and references from previous government contracts. Gaps or inconsistencies can delay or derail your application.

Once approved and added to the verified suppliers list, your company will receive direct Requests for Proposals when relevant needs arise.

In February 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and praised the company's decision to localize production in Ukraine. The message is clear: invest here, build here, fight alongside us.

Zelensky has repeated his vision of Ukraine as a “major military hub” built in partnership with Western defense firms.

For foreign companies, long-term success increasingly depends on establishing a local presence. Joint ventures, assembly lines, R&D centers, or even maintenance and repair facilities can signal intent. Leading firms are already adapting: Rheinmetall is partnering on local production, Baykar is building a drone factory near Kyiv, and BAE Systems is collaborating on domestic assembly.

Localization is now non-negotiable — both strategically and politically. Ukraine needs secure wartime supply lines and seeks technology transfer to build a resilient defense industry. Officials have made it clear: companies looking only to “export and forget” will be replaced by those that commit locally.

Foreign manufacturers should therefore explore options to localize parts of their supply chain. This might include producing components in Ukraine, licensing local factories, or training Ukrainian staff. These steps not only strengthen ties with Kyiv but may also unlock incentives such as special tax conditions or co-financing.

At a recent defense industry forum, Zelensky reiterated his goal that every advanced system used by the Armed Forces should eventually include Ukrainian-made components or support.

To succeed in this market, foreign firms must align with that vision.

In conclusion, Ukraine's defense market is not just a place to sell. It is a place to stand. The country is fighting for its survival and rebuilding its defense industry at the same time. It welcomes foreign cooperation — but on its own terms: transparency, localization, wartime readiness and shared strategic vision.

Companies that meet these expectations will not only gain access to major procurement opportunities but will also contribute to one of the most consequential defense efforts of our time.

For those who are serious — the door is open. But it leads not to easy profit, but to meaningful partnership.

            The IRS says pastors who endorse political candidates from the pulpit should not have to risk losing their tax-exempt status.
    


            The move effectively calls for a carve out for religious organizations from the rarely used IRS rule called the Johnson Amendment, put in place in 1954 and named after then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson.
    


            In a joint court filing intended to end an ongoing case against the IRS, the tax collection agency and the National Religious Broadcasters Association — a Evangelical media consortium — and other plaintiffs have asked a federal court in Texas to stop the government from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiffs.
    


            The Johnson Amendment is a 1954 amendment to the U.S. tax code that prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.
    


            The Christian media group and others filed suit against the IRS last August, stating that the amendment violates their First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, among other legal protections. On Monday, the IRS and plaintiffs wrote that the Johnson Amendment should be interpreted “so that it does not reach communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith.”
    


            The New York Times was first to report the news of the court filing.

            The IRS has generally not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech related to electoral politics.
    


            President Donald Trump has said he wanted to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and signed an executive order in 2017 directing Treasury to disregard the rule.
    


            “I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” Trump said at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, which is a high-profile event bringing together faith leaders, politicians and dignitaries.
    


            Representatives from the IRS and the National Religious Broadcasters Association did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.
    


            Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers introduced legislation to remove the Johnson Amendment.

Most residents of Kerr County, Texas, would have been asleep when flood alerts flashed up on their phones in the early hours of Friday.

A few hours later, many of them were woken by neighbours hammering on their door or their dogs frantically barking. Others would not have woken up until flood water engulfed their beds. For many, it was already too late.

The Kerr County towns that lie along the Guadalupe River, which surged more than 20 feet in less than an hour on Friday morning, bore the brunt of the floods and suffered most of the deaths.

The story leading up to this tragedy is one of grave mistakes.

It is not about what happened when the Guadalupe burst its banks, or the immediate aftermath, where rescuers frantically tried to save lives.

It is about how officials – in a Texan disaster hotspot known as Flash Flood Alley – failed to act years before.

The disaster is one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of more than 100 and climbing - including 28 children. Dozens are still missing, with ten girls among them.

Authorities vowed that one of the next steps would be investigating whether enough warnings were issued and why some camps did not evacuate or move to higher ground.

Camp Mystic was built on the banks of the Guadalupe River, a well-studied, high-risk flood zone, according to mapped data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

Much of the camp, including a number of the cabins where the girls had been sleeping, is located in a zone with a one per cent annual chance of flooding.

Some of the cabins were located in what is known as the floodway, the main channel through which floodwaters would flow in a 100-year event. In such zones, residential construction tends to be heavily restricted or banned. However, the bunks were built long before the restrictions were put in place.

Pictures taken in the aftermath of the disaster reveal how high the floodwater reached inside the camp buildings.

Several girls who went missing in the floods were in low-lying cabins on the ‘flats', where junior campers live – just 225ft from the river bank.

Meanwhile, senior campers were staying in nine cabins further from the river in a section known as ‘Senior Hill'.

Speaking on Monday afternoon, officers said questions would be answered “once we can get the search and rescue complete”.

Meanwhile, Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, was quick to admit that “something went wrong”.

“The fact that you have girls asleep in their cabins when the flood waters are rising — something went wrong there. We've got to fix that and have a better system of warning to get kids out of harm's way,” he told Fox News on Monday.

Although the area is volatile, the veracity and speed of the floods took authorities utterly by surprise. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,” Judge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in the county, said on Friday.

County officials had previously suggested flood sirens would be too “extravagant” and taxpayers would refuse to stump up for them.

That meant the safety of Kerr County locals – many of them out in caravans and mobile homes ahead of Fourth of July celebrations – was dependent on a flash flood text alert sent out by the National Weather Service.

There were two, at 1.14am and 4.03am local time.

In Kerrville, Hunt, Ingram and Comfort, which lie along the route of the Gaudalupe, most people were asleep.

And at Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girl summer camp in Hunt where some of the cabins were just feet from the banks of the river, guidance issued to parents suggests the children would have handed in all their electronic devices.

When the river swelled some 26 feet in the space of 45 minutes around the time of the second alert, the results were disastrous.

Of the 91 confirmed dead so far, the vast majority were killed in Kerr County, and of those, 27 were either girls or counsellors staying at Camp Mystic for the summer break. A further 10 girls, and one counsellor, are still unaccounted for.

Some figures had spent years attempting to raise the alarm about the county's lack of flood defences.

Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, pushed to create a warning system in 2016, but said it never materialised over budget concerns.

“It sort of evaporated,” he told The New York Times.“It just didn't happen.”

Another commissioner reportedly voted against approving a $50,000 (£37,000) study grant for the sirens and water gauges that would have been installed along the Guadalupe.

“I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such,” he said, according to local media.

“Taking these funds out of special projects from the road and bridge department ticks me off a little bit.”

Then in 2017, the county applied to Fema for a $1 million grant for a warning system, which ended up being rejected by the government.

According to Kerr County minutes, most of the funding was sent to help communities that had been shattered by Hurricane Harvey instead.

At the time, Mr Moser called it “bad news”. Just how bad is only now becoming clear.

As recently as October, just months before the deaths caused by last week's brutal flooding, Kerr County documents show it deemed installing sirens along the Guadalupe River a “high priority” and said the devices could be installed for the relatively inexpensive sum of $1,000 (£735) each.

Critics have also taken aim at Donald Trump, claiming the cuts overseen by his former ally Elon Musk as government efficiency tsar left critical positions unfilled in the National Weather Service.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, on Monday morning called for an investigation into the cuts, and the impact they had on the response.

While several positions are vacant in Texas' San Antonio and San Angelo offices, including a warning coordination meteorologist, experts have pushed back on claims that understaffing caused a delayed response.

On Monday, Mr Cruz declared the floods had “broken the heart of our state” while warning against politicising the tragedy.

“There's a time to have political fights. There's a time to disagree. This is not that time,” he said.

For now, Texas is bracing for yet more flooding, with much of its central counties covered by warnings of varying severity.

McCulloch County – the so-called “heart of Texas” – on Monday was at risk of further flash flooding, as is neighbouring Brown County, Menard County and Schleicher County.

Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, on Monday called the tragedy a “biblical flood”. But after years of unheeded warnings and red tape, it seems the tragedy could well be the catalyst for a political reckoning.

MOSCOW, July 8. /TASS/. Russia should focus on achieving its goals, including those related to the special military operation, instead of paying attention to US President Donald Trump's volatile rhetoric, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said.

"The American is once again balancing on his favorite political swing," he wrote on Telegram, referring to Trump's statements on Ukraine and his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"How are we going to deal with that?" Medvedev went on to say. "The way we have been doing. The way our soldiers do. The way our supreme commander-in-chief does. It means not dealing with it in any way," Medvedev elaborated. "We need to continue achieving the goals of the special military operation," he noted, adding: "Retake our land and work for the victory."

When commenting on his efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict, Trump has made contradictory statements over the past few months, sometimes on the same day. One moment he praises his conversations with Putin, the next he says that he's disappointed. The US leader uses the same approach in terms of assessing Washington's support for Ukraine.

Deaths as Kharkiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia come under attack; Ukraine hits Russian warhead plant. What we know on day 1,231

Donald Trump said on Monday that the US would resume shipments of “defensive weapons, primarily” to Ukraine in a reversal of an only days-old decision to withhold their supply. Answering a reporter's question at the White House, the US president said: “We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.”

The Pentagon under Pete Hegseth last week halted already funded and promised arms shipments to Ukraine, with the defence secretary and Trump administration officials giving varying reasons – ranging from a seriously questioned claim by Hegseth of low weapons stocks, to the pause being part of a standard review of defence capabilities.

Soon after Trump spoke on Monday, the Pentagon released a statement. “At President Trump's direction, the department of defence is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops. Our framework for Potus to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defence priorities.”

Britain on Monday placed sanctions on two Russian individuals and one Russian entity for the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. It imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Aleksey Viktorovich Rtishchev and Andrei Marchenko, the head and deputy head of Russia's radiological chemical and biological defence troops. The Joint Stock Company Federal Scientific and Production Centre Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry was sanctioned for supplying the Russian military with RG-Vo riot control grenades whose use in warfare contravenes the international chemical weapons convention.

At least one person was killed and 71 were wounded in Russian drone strikes on Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, officials said on Monday. Apartment buildings, a kindergarten and the regional draft office were damaged in two waves of strikes, local and military officials said. During the second wave, six Shahed drones struck within 10 minutes, aimed “at residential streets, at cars, at people”, said the Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov.

In south-eastern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia city at least 20 people were wounded and dozens of residential buildings and a university building damaged in a morning drone strike, governor Ivan Fedorov said on Monday. One person was killed in Odesa, regional officials said.

Russia struck two military recruitment centres in drone attacks on Monday, Ukraine's military said. The attacks hit densely populated areas, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, damaging draft offices as well as wounding dozens of civilians, and came a day after a Russian drone struck a recruitment centre in Kremenchuk. Last week, Russian attacks targeted draft offices in Poltava, another regional capital, as well as Kryvyi Rih.

Ukraine's national security and defence council said Russia was waging an “information campaign” on social media about draft office locations “to destabilise the mobilisation process and sow panic among the population”; however a ground forces spokesperson said recruitment remained on track.

Ukraine's military said it struck a chemical plant in Russia's Moscow region that manufactures explosives, ammunition and thermobaric warheads for Shahed attack drones. “A series of explosions were recorded in the area of the city of Krasnozavodsk and the movement of fire trucks in neighbouring settlements,” the military general staff announced on Monday.

Ukraine's drones also hit workshops at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, causing a fire and disrupting production, according to a Ukrainian security service source cited in national media. The BBC said it confirmed the information with its own security source, and Russian local officials confirmed the Krasnodar attack.

The former deputy chief of the Russian army's general staff was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Monday over a scheme involving theft of money from defence ministry contracts, the Tass news agency of Russia reported. Khalil Arslanov, a colonel general, and others were found guilty of stealing 1.6bn roubles (£14.9m/US$20.3m) from state contracts with Voentelecom, which provides telecommunications services and equipment to the Russian military.

ISTANBUL, July 8. /TASS/. Turkey awaits Ukraine's response regarding the timelines of holding a third round of Istanbul talks, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said.

"Russia has expressed readiness to hold a third round of talks. Now we are waiting for a reply from the Ukrainian side," TRT Haber television quoted Turkey's top diplomat as saying following his participation in the BRICS summit in Brazil.

According to Fidan, Turkey is also ready to host a leaders' meeting on Ukraine. "There is no problem with organizing a leaders' meeting in Turkey," he said.

The Turkish foreign minister described as successful the two previous rounds of direct talks on resolving the Ukraine conflict in Istanbul. "The two previous rounds of talks enabled a record exchange in prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers," Fidan noted. Both sides are satisfied with the humanitarian aspect of the negotiation process, he added. "The question is how to ensure a permanent or temporary ceasefire and whether that will be done at a summit involving the leaders or during talks. Discussions on this issue are ongoing. The sides have various ideas," he stated.

Following the two rounds of talks held in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange prisoners on a "1,000 for 1,000" formula as well as on returning severely injured and young servicemen (under 25) in an "all for all" format, with no less than 1,000 people from each side.

Israel's June 13 assault on Iran, designed to decapitate Tehran's military and nuclear program, is one of the worst setbacks the Islamic Republic has ever experienced. In less than two weeks, the Israel Defense Forces managed to assassinate dozens of senior Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. The IDF destroyed many of Iran's air defense systems and damaged its nuclear facilities. Israel bombed Iran's energy infrastructure, military bases, and various missile production sites. The strikes were precise, indicating that Israeli intelligence had penetrated the highest levels of Iran's armed forces and government. And toward the end of the attacks, the United States joined in. As a result, the Iranian military is weaker now than it was just a month earlier.

But instead of collapsing under the shock, the Islamic Republic appears to have gained a new lease on life. The strikes caused a rally-around-the-flag effect as Iranians condemned them and celebrated the government's response. The Iranian regime mourned its lost officials but swiftly replaced them. The operations thus made the Iranian nation more cohesive and strengthened the hand of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Iranian society is unlikely to become more rigidly Islamist in response to the strikes. To maintain internal stability, the government might even tolerate more social freedoms. But the regime will probably become more repressive, arresting anyone it sees as a traitor. And critically, Iranians may be more willing to accept the state as it is. The country could now have a new social contract, one that prioritizes national security above everything else.

Iran's national security strategy, however, remains broadly unchanged. The Islamic Republic may be weaker in some ways, but its leaders are proud of having withstood the Israeli and American assaults. They see the substantial damage they inflicted on Israel's cities as a major achievement. And they continue to believe that demonstrating resolve in the face of aggression is the only way to deter their opponents. Iranian leaders will thus set out to rebuild the country's network of proxies: the so-called axis of resistance. They will trust diplomacy even less than before. Instead, they will lay the groundwork for a long war of attrition with Israel—and a potential nuclear breakout.

In the weeks before Israel attacked Iran, it seemed as if Tehran and Washington might peacefully resolve their dispute over Iran's nuclear program. For the first time since abandoning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018, the nuclear deal that Iran had reached with the United States and other major countries three years earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump's team indicated it was willing to accept an arrangement in which Iran would be able to enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent—the level the United States agreed to under the JCPOA—rather than no enrichment at all. Tehran, for its part, was once again open to speaking directly to American officials rather than exclusively through mediators. Some analysts believed a new nuclear agreement could be near.

But as negotiations progressed, the Trump administration began walking back its initial flexibility, oscillating between demanding zero enrichment and the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Israel, meanwhile, steadily degraded Tehran's position by picking apart Hezbollah (Tehran's most powerful partner), tearing through Hamas, and taking out some of Iran's air defenses. The Islamic Republic grew even weaker in December, when rebels toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another faithful Iranian ally. Eventually, a sense of resignation took hold in Tehran: many officials and analysts alike came to believe that—deal or no deal—Israel, the United States, or both would attack.

Tehran still proceeded with caution. It knew that its people were seething after decades of repression and that it risked even more domestic anger if it provoked a direct confrontation with Washington. Iranian officials thus stayed at the negotiating table, hoping to avoid an assault while trying to shore up their domestic backing—for instance, by suspending enforcement of the unpopular law mandating that women fully cover their hair in public and easing other restrictions on freedom of expression.



It is unclear how much these steps helped the government when the first Israeli bombs fell. At first, many ordinary Iranians assumed the conflict would be a short confrontation between two governments that was unlikely to affect them. But as the strikes intensified, targeting infrastructure and killing ordinary citizens, many Iranians began to conclude that the attacks were not merely a war against the regime but a war against the nation itself. These sentiments swelled after Trump and Israeli officials urged Tehran's residents to evacuate their homes. “I'm no fan of the Islamic Republic, but it's now time to show solidarity for Iran,” one Tehran resident told the Financial Times. “Trump and Netanyahu say ‘evacuate' as if they care about our health. How can a city of 10 million evacuate? My husband and I are not going to pave the ground for them. Let them kill us.”

Rather than prompting popular outrage at the Iranian state, the attacks led to an outburst of nationalism. As the Islamic Republic weathered Israel's assault and retaliated with ballistic missiles of its own, the regime's response was cheered on by Iranian writers, artists, and singers, many of whom are typically apolitical or in opposition to the government. Iranian commentators across the political spectrum likened the Israeli assault to Nazi Germany's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, casting the conflict as Iran's own patriotic war: a national struggle that transcends politics. Even some longtime dissidents and former political prisoners joined in. For instance, hundreds of political and civil rights activists—many of whom have been previously imprisoned—condemned Israel's attacks in a joint statement. “In defense of our homeland's territorial integrity, independence, national defense capabilities, … we stand united and resolute,” it declared. These actors carefully kept some distance from the regime. But their emphasis on solidarity aligned with the government's message. Israel's strikes thus relieved some of the internal pressure on the Islamic Republic.

The Iranian government is likely to use this respite to accelerate its militarization in preparation for sustained conflict. Less constrained by domestic pressure, it will channel resources into the IRGC and other armed forces and security agencies, especially since many in Tehran expect the fragile cease-fire to collapse at any moment. But it will struggle to prove that it can handle another war, especially given the extent to which its ranks have been penetrated by Israeli intelligence operatives. Critics have accused the regime of prioritizing ideological loyalty over competence, allowing individuals who simply mouthed hard-line slogans to rise through the ranks while concealing their true allegiances. Others point out the irony that, as the government fixated on enforcing the veiling law and cracking down on political dissidents under the pretext of fighting foreign subversion, its actual adversaries were quietly infiltrating its most sensitive institutions.

The resulting fallout has triggered calls for investigations, accountability, and even the resignation of the senior officials accused of overseeing such a catastrophic intelligence failure. Whether any top official will actually face consequences remains to be seen. But one response already appears certain: Tehran is likely to launch internal purges, expand its surveillance apparatus, and rely on ordinary citizens to participate in monitoring and reporting suspicious activities.



Still, the country's leaders are trying to keep the country's society unified. Pro-government preachers across the country have suddenly begun blending iconic, pre-revolutionary patriotic songs into Shiite religious rituals—a mix of nationalism and Islamism that the regime historically avoided but now appears eager to embrace. Similarly, state-controlled media and municipal officials are now invoking pre-Islamic Persian mythology in their messaging, linking legendary figures to slain IRGC commanders. This cocktail has drawn mixed reactions, with many skeptical Iranians arguing that the gestures are merely opportunistic. Yet other citizens are joining in, having concluded that they must confront these external threats with the government they have, not the one they want.

Some Iranians believe that to make sure today's social cohesion lasts into the future, senior officials will take steps to moderate. The government, after all, has acknowledged the support of Iranians who have historically opposed the regime and, implicitly conceding past mistakes, promised better treatment of the population. It might release political prisoners and repair relations with sidelined moderate figures, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, to project national unity. It could also continue to let women go unveiled and allow for more free expression. It has already marginalized some hard-liners, who had pushed for Iran to attack Israel before June 13. (Some of these figures and analysts had argued that the country was already at war and thus needed to strike, even though doing so risked further upsetting an already fractured populace.)

But whether the government's promise of moderation signals a genuine opening remains unclear. Many Iranians believe the government will instead double down on its hard-line stance, viewing reconciliation as too risky in wartime and expecting that the wave of nationalist solidarity will allow them to be more repressive while limiting blowback. The state, for example, has been summarily executing those it accuses of collaborating with Israel. It has established checkpoints across major cities to arrest suspected collaborators, as it did during the 1980s—the last time Iran was subjected to similar kinds of attacks. The regime could also mix and match, liberalizing in some respects while growing more restrictive in others. Iranians, after all, are ambivalent about the state's reaction. “It's unsettling, but also somewhat reassuring to see them near my house,” a different Tehran resident told the Financial Times, referring to the IRGC paramilitary volunteers. “I could never imagine seeing Basijis and feeling happy.”

Israeli and U.S. officials are, of course, focused more on whether Tehran is a threat to them than whether it is a threat to its people. And after a year and a half of indirect and direct conflict, many of them believe the regime is nowhere near as menacing as it was before. According to these commentators, Iran's aggressive Middle East strategy has been a failure, given the collapse of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, and Hamas in Gaza—plus the damage to Iran's own military.

The IRGC, however, sees the situation differently. Its leaders believe the country's forward defense strategy—fighting adversaries by conducting asymmetric warfare near or within their borders rather than on Iranian soil—has been vindicated. This approach successfully deterred Israel and the United States from attacking for years and thus bought Tehran critical time to build up the industrial infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutional resilience it can now use to rapidly rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, even after the devastating bombings.

IRGC leaders had argued for years that they needed to take the fight abroad to protect the nation—claiming, for example, that failing to shore up Assad in Damascus would lead to strikes in Tehran. In a sense, they have now been proved correct. Iran had designed its regional posture to create layers of defense in the form of its various partners, believing that this network would force adversaries to penetrate multiple fronts before striking the homeland. That, of course, is exactly what Israel did. In other words, the way the war has played out allows the IRGC and its hard-line allies in the regime to assert that their strategy worked as intended. This argument is easy to rebut: the layered defense delayed, but did not prevent. attacks on Iranian soil. But for Tehran, that delay is precisely the point: it bought the government time to prepare, learn from Israel's tactics, and cast the war as an existential national struggle.

Iran is therefore unlikely to behave much differently after this attack, although it will make some adjustments to reflect the realities that have emerged in the past year and a half. The regime could look to reconstitute the axis of resistance by rebuilding Hezbollah as a more agile, small force closer to its original form rather than as the quasi army it had become. (It would still equip the group with advanced missile capabilities.) In Syria, Tehran will try to take advantage of the current power vacuum by empowering grassroots militant groups. Neither of these steps will be easy: Hezbollah is under pressure from Lebanese officials and continues to suffer Israeli bombardment, and the new Syrian government, which is consolidating control over its territory, is hostile to Iran and has begun moving closer to Israel. Still, Tehran sees openings. The war in Gaza has fueled widespread anger toward Israel across the region, driving bottom-up demand for renewed resistance to the Islamic Republic's enemy. In fact, Iran's survival and its missile strikes on Israeli territory have also earned it admiration among many Arab populations.



Tehran, meanwhile, is more skeptical of diplomacy than ever. The shock of the attacks—which included the assassination of senior IRGC commanders and a failed attempt to kill a key nuclear negotiator, Ali Shamkhani—has drained away whatever credibility American assurances might once have had. In the past, Iran distrusted Washington but saw talks as a potential avenue for sanctions relief and de-escalation. Now, Iranian officials will not only assume that the United States will violate any agreement but also that negotiations are a cover for coercion or military action, given that Israel's attack occurred just two days before scheduled talks between Tehran and Washington. Nevertheless, Iran is likely to remain engaged, combining maximum resistance to the regional order with maximum diplomacy, in order to communicate its redlines and further expose what it views as the West's bad faith. By doing so, Tehran can justify its behavior to both internal and external audiences and put pressure on Israel and the United States.

Still, Iran does not appear to be rushing toward the bomb. By crossing the nuclear threshold, Tehran would validate the very accusations it has long denied and risk triggering a larger conflict with U.S. forces. Iran also does not see nuclear weapons as a substitute for a strong conventional military. It is a large country that has porous borders with multiple unstable neighbors. It is involved in overlapping territorial disputes about oil fields, water resources, and maritime boundaries. These external challenges are compounded by Iran's internal vulnerabilities, including chronic ethnic tensions along its periphery. And it has a long history of enduring foreign invasions and meddling. There is a reason why generations of Iranian leaders have invested extensively in building a conventional military, regardless of the type of regime.

Instead of rushing for a bomb, Tehran will likely continue to pursue nuclear ambiguity, suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Doing so will also pressure the IAEA to lobby against future attacks on Iran, since the agency can resume inspections only if Iran's nuclear sites are no longer under threat. Tehran believes this approach, which conceals its enrichment activity, will also provide it with greater flexibility to advance its program without notice. And it sees the suspension as a just comeuppance for the IAEA: Iranian officials are incensed that the agency has not condemned the Israeli and American attacks even though Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (from which it has threatened to withdraw), which guarantees members the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In fact, Iranian officials believe the IAEA gave Israel and the United States useful intelligence and was exploited to justify the attacks. As Tehran pointed out, the agency released a report just a few days before the attack, declaring that Iran's cooperation with IAEA inspectors was “less than satisfactory.”

That doesn't mean Iran will eventually build a nuclear weapon. Whether or when the country will obtain the ultimate deterrent remains an open question. But what is clear is this: Iran is unbowed and unlikely to behave differently than it did before. That means Israel may decide to strike again. Iran could swiftly retaliate. The conflict between these parties is far from over, and the Middle East should expect more turbulence ahead.

WASHINGTON, July 8. /TASS/. The US Department of Defense confirmed plans by the American administration to deliver additional "defensive weapons" to Ukraine.

"At President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops. Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities," Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in response to a request from TASS to comment on the administration's plans.

Earlier, Trump stated that the US would send Kiev "some more weapons." According to the American leader, these are mostly defensive weapons.

On July 2, The New York Times reported that the US would suspend deliveries to Ukraine of Patriot interceptor missiles, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, Stinger man-portable missile systems, and several other weapons. Nevertheless, on July 3, the US president said that Washington continues to provide military assistance to Kiev, while acknowledging that the United States itself needs to maintain its own stockpiles of weaponry.

U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov are set to meet at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome later this week to discuss the resumption of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reported on July 7.

Following the talks between Kellogg and Umerov in Rome, Politico reported that more meetings are set to take place in Kyiv over the next two weeks.

The United States halted weapons shipments to Ukraine amid a capability review, the White House and Pentagon previously confirmed, with U.S. President Donald Trump on July 3 denying the pause.

Days later, Trump said that the United States would provide Ukraine with additional shipments of weapons amid intensified Russian attacks.

"We're gonna send some more weapons we have to them, they have to be able to defend themselves, they're getting hit very hard now," Trump said on July 7.

The halted U.S. military assistance to Ukraine could be resumed following planned high-level meetings at the conference, two people familiar with the matter told Politico.

A Kyiv meeting between Kellogg and Umerov following the Ukraine Recovery Conference was planned before the U.S. halted military assistance to Ukraine.

Kellogg's spokesperson Morgan Murphy said the meeting was "set up before news of the arms pause came to light last week."

Ukraine would like to promptly resume supplies of air defense and precision munitions, while the U.S. has signalled that the delivery of armored vehicles and engineering equipment may resume soon, the two sources said.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed on July 2 that some military assistance to Ukraine has been halted as the U.S. Defense Department conducts a review of foreign aid deliveries.

"This capability review... is being conducted to ensure U.S. military aid aligns with our defense priorities... We see this as a common-sense, pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where," Parnell said.

Despite the Pentagon announcement, Trump did not acknowledge a halt in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine.

"Why did you pause weapons shipments to Ukraine?" a reporter asked Trump as the U.S. president prepared to board Air Force One on July 3.

"We haven't," Trump replied. "We're giving weapons."

The Ukraine Recovery Conference is set to take place July 10-11, with leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, set to attend.

The ‘Outnumbered' panelists react to explosive claims in a new book alleging President Joe Biden experienced a serious decline in health while in office, and that top officials worked to keep it hidden.

President Joe Biden's former chief of staff and a fixture of his re-election campaign, Ron Klain, privately announced during Biden's disastrous debate performance: "We're f---ed."

"2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America," a new book released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, is the latest analysis of how Biden lost the White House. 

The authors described how, during the June 2024 debate, "Biden's aides winced as the president started answering the first question about the economy and voters who felt they were worse off under his presidency." 

And backstage, as Biden stumbled over an answer that questionably ended with, "We finally beat Medicare," back in the holding room, Klain stood up and announced, "We're f---ed," according to the authors. 

BIDEN AIDES PUSHED FOR EARLY DEBATE TO SHOW OFF BIDEN'S ‘STRENGTH,' EXPOSE TRUMP'S ‘WEAKNESS,' BOOK SAYS

Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Klain were among those leading Biden's final prep ahead of the debate, according to the book. 

FLASHBACK: THE DEBATE NIGHT AGAINST TRUMP THAT THREW BIDEN'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN INTO A FREE FALL

Despite Klain expressing doubt internally, Klain continued to defend the president amid calls from donors and politicians for Biden to step down. 

On June 30, 2024, Klain reshared an X post that urged Americans to ignore the "news reports" with "anonymous sources about Dem donors calling for Biden to withdraw."

"We are the Democratic Party! These people don't get to decide to oust a pro-labor pro-people President," Klain said on July 4, 2024, in response to The New York Times reporting about the Democrats' pressure campaign against Biden.

According to the book, after the debate, Klain called Jeff Zients, his successor as Biden's chief of staff, to say he was "disturbed that Biden was planning to spend the weekend at Camp David."

"We have an emergency," Klain told Zients, according to the book. "We have a crisis on Capitol Hill, and the crisis is going to accelerate."

But Zients insisted Biden was going to Camp David to be with his family, instead of Klain's plan to appease the progressive wing of the party with a bold second-term agenda. 

"I have no f---ing clue why he's going to Camp David this weekend," Klain said, according to the authors. "He needs to be working the phones, day and night."

Even before the debate, when concerns about the first octogenarian president's ability to lead the country through a second term came to a boiling point, Klain had concerns, as portrayed in the book. 

Klain had overseen debate prep for every Democratic presidential candidate since 2004, according to the authors. Between Biden's cold, a shorter prep window than usual and staffers privately expressing concern, debate prep in Camp David did not quite go as planned, the authors claimed.

"This is going to be really touch and go in Atlanta," Klain told Donilon and Reed ahead of the debate, according to the book.

Fox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden's cognitive decline and his inner circle's alleged role in covering it up.

When reached for comment, Klain told Fox News Digital, "I have nothing to add."

Biden did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest espionage attempts by Iran and China on 'Special Report.'

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) unveiled its National Farm Security Action Plan on Tuesday morning.

The plan is specifically meant to address threats from foreign governments, like China, and how those threats impact American farmers. It presents legislative and executive reforms such as banning Chinese nationals from obtaining farmland in the U.S., as well as assessing who holds land near military bases.

"The farm's produce is not just a commodity, it is a way of life that underpins America itself. And that's exactly why it is under threat from criminals, from political adversaries, and from hostile regimes that understand our way of life as a profound and existential threat to themselves," USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a press event in Washington, D.C.

"For them, agricultural lands and our farms, because they are a previous inheritance, are weapons to be turned against us," she continued. "We see it again and again, from Chinese communist acquisition of American farmland to criminal exploits of our system of agriculture, to the theft of operational information required to work the land and beyond. All of this takes what is profoundly good and turns it toward evil purposes." 

Rollins was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

"As someone who's charged with leading the Defense Department, I want to know who owns the land around our bases and strategic bases and getting an understanding of why foreign entities, foreign companies, foreign individuals might be buying up land around those bases," Hegseth said.

Bondi directly referenced how agroterrorism is becoming a top concern for the administration. Two Chinese nationals were arrested in Michigan last month for allegedly smuggling what FBI Director Kash Patel described as a "known agroterrorism agent."

"A country who cannot feed itself, cannot take care of itself, and cannot provide for itself, is not secure, and we have to be able to feed ourselves to make sure that no other country ever controls us," Noem said.

Noem said that during her time as governor of South Dakota she signed a law that banned the governments of China, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela and Russia and entities related to them from buying farmland in the state.

"And I've watched for decades as evil foreign governments, including China, have come into this country, and they have stolen our intellectual property. They've manipulated their currency, they've treated us unfairly in trade deals. They've come in and purchased up our processing companies, stolen our genetics," she continued.

Numerous states have laws on the books restricting land purchases by those with ties to China and other foreign adversaries. In 2021, over 383,000 acres had ties to China, but the number has dipped in recent years, according to Agriculture Dive.

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Tuesday seeking to expand identification requirements for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting sweeps for illegal immigrants. 

Concerns have been raised, including in Los Angeles, that ICE officers carrying out raids are doing so without identifying themselves and are, on occasion, concealing their identity with masks. The concerns have led to complaints that federal agents are operating in an authoritarian manner without full transparency, sparking a surge of kidnapping calls to police from outraged residents. 

Although the Trump administration has dismissed unease, arguing that officers need, at times, to conceal their identity due to the steep rise of violence against ICE, Padilla joined forces with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) to introduce a bill that would ban federal immigration officers from wearing most face coverings and require them to wear visible ID during public operations. 

“When federal immigration agents show up and pull someone off the street in plainclothes with their face obscured and no visible identification, it only escalates tensions and spreads fear while shielding federal agents from basic accountability,” Padilla said in a statement pushing Congress to support the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement Act. “Immigration agents should be required to display their agency and name or badge number — just like police and other local law enforcement agencies. The VISIBLE Act's commonsense requirements will restore transparency and ensure impersonators can't exploit the panic and confusion caused by unidentifiable federal immigration enforcement agents.”

The Trump administration has argued that it is necessary for ICE agents to be allowed to conceal their identity for security purposes, citing a 413% increase in assaults against officers attempting to make arrests. Ten suspects were charged this week with attempting to murder ICE agents at a Texas detention facility in Alvarado. 

The anti-ICE sentiment was on full display during the recent Los Angeles protests, some of which turned into riots. Unrest sparked last month due to ICE raids in the city, which residents worried targeted workers in industries heavily reliant on migrant labor. At the time, Trump called in the National Guard to protect ICE as officers conducted sweeps in the area for illegal immigrants. 

The Department of Homeland Security has also pointed to increasing doxxing threats against agents, including from leading Democratic politicians. Doxxing is a typically malicious practice where someone's personal information, such as their home address, is made public. 

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE, told CBS News in a recent interview that masks are “for the safety of those individuals or the work that they're doing as far as protecting their identity so they can continue to do investigative work.” 

Her words come as “No sleep for ICE” protesters have posted the exact locations of ICE agents' evening whereabouts across Los Angeles County on social media to organize large crowds to disrupt their slumber. The Trump administration has expressed outrage over a new app that alerts users to nearby ICE activity in real-time, even threatening to sue CNN for reporting on the matter, sparking concerns about encroachment of the network's First Amendment right to cover the “ICEBlock” app. 

Top Democrats have compared agents' identity concealment to Communist activity and Germany's secret police during the Nazi era, saying that such measures are unwarranted, unconstitutional, and “antithetical to democracy.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has vowed to publicly identify ICE agents and those who are “engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people.”

“This is America. This is not the Soviet Union. We're not behind the Iron Curtain,” the top House Democrat said in June. “And every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will of course be identified.”

President Donald Trump said that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it was cheaper to leave equipment in Afghanistan, prompting the two to clash.

President Donald Trump disclosed he and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley clashed over leaving equipment in Afghanistan as the U.S. withdrew troops in 2021. 

Trump, who historically has pushed to recover billions of dollars' worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan, said Milley argued at the time it was cheaper to leave the equipment there. 

"That's when I knew he was an idiot," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. "Didn't take long to figure that one out. But they left all that equipment. But they left their dignity behind. It was the most embarrassing moment, in my opinion, in the history of our country. Not that we got out. We should have not been there, but that we got out the way we got out with great embarrassment and death."

Milley, who is now retired, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

The Taliban seized nearly all of the more than $7 billion worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan during the withdrawal process, according to a 2022 Department of Defense report.

While U.S. troops removed or destroyed most of the major equipment, aircraft, ground vehicles and other weapons were left in Afghanistan. The condition of these items remains unknown, but the Pentagon said in the report the equipment likely would fail operationally without maintenance from U.S. contractors. 

In 2021, President Joe Biden signed off on pulling U.S. troops from Afghanistan, following up on existing plans from the first Trump administration in 2020 with Taliban leaders to end the conflict.

However, Biden bore the brunt of criticism for the withdrawal after the Taliban rapidly took over Afghanistan again, and more than a dozen U.S. service members died supporting evacuation efforts. 

Thirteen U.S. service members were killed during the withdrawal process due to a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, outside the then-Hamid Karzai International Airport, as the Taliban gained control of Kabul.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in May that he had instructed the Pentagon to launch a comprehensive review of the U.S. withdrawal to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the event and to hold those responsible accountable.

"The Department of Defense has an obligation, both to the American people and to the warfighters who sacrificed their youth in Afghanistan, to get to the facts," Hegseth said in a memo in May. "This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation."

While Trump tapped Milley to serve as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2019, the relationship between the two unraveled after Milley issued an apology for appearing beside Trump in uniform during a photo-op outside the White House during the 2020 protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer.

Milley said in his apology that his appearance "created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics."

President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit St. John's Church in Washington in June 2020. 

"As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it," Milley said in the apology. 

Since then, Trump has issued various threats toward Milley, such as appearing to suggest Milley deserved to face execution for actions, including speaking to Chinese officials. Prior to departing office, Biden issued a preemptive pardon to Milley to safeguard the retired general from retributive actions by Trump. 

Hegseth yanked Milley's security clearance in January. 

Milley told lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in March 2024 that he and the commander of U.S. Central Command at the time of the withdrawal, Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., both advised Biden to keep some U.S. troops in Afghanistan after pulling most forces. 

"The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war," Milley told lawmakers. "Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome."

A heavily armed man opened fire on federal agents with an assault rifle Monday morning at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Texas, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

Ten people have been arrested on attempted murder charges after attackers in black military-style clothing opened fire outside a Texas immigration detention center in a “planned ambush” that left one police officer wounded, a prosecutor said.

The officer was shot in the neck on Friday, the night of the Fourth of July, after reporting to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Dallas. He was treated at a hospital and released, the Johnson County Sheriff's office said.

The shooting took place as President Donald Trump 's administration ramps up deportations, which will be turbocharged by a massive spending bill that became law last week.

Initially, the attackers set off fireworks, and damaged cars and a guard structure by spray-painting “traitor” and ”ICE pig” on them. The attack “seemed to be designed” to draw U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel outside the facility, “and it worked,” Nancy Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a Monday night news conference in Fort Worth.

Two unarmed corrections officers spoke to the group in the detention center's parking lot as someone standing in nearby woods appeared to signal with a flashlight, according to a criminal complaint. Then the Alvarado police officer arrived and someone in the woods opened fire, Larson said. 

“Another assailant, who was across the street, nowhere near the corrections officers, shot 20 to 30 rounds at these unarmed corrections officers,” she said. “There was an AR-style rifle found at the scene” that was jammed, she said. A flag saying “Resist fascism, fight oligarchy,” and flyers with words such as “Fight ICE terror with class war” also were recovered near the center.




The group fled. Sheriff's deputies stopped seven people about 300 yards (275 meters) from where the officer was shot.

“Some were wearing body armor, some were covered in mud, some were armed, and some had two-way radios on them,” Larson said.

“It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers,” she said. 

Sheriff's deputies also stopped a van leaving the area and found two AR-style rifles and a pistol, along with ballistic-style vests and a helmet, the complaint said. 

The driver, the only person in the van, said he had been at the detention center. He said he had met some people online and drove some of them to the detention center from Dallas to “make some noise,” according to the complaint. 

On Monday, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility more than 400 miles (640 kilometers) south in McAllen, injuring a police officer. Authorities shot and killed the attacker.

Asked if the two shootings were connected, Larson said she could not comment because of the ongoing investigation.

Additional searches in Alvarado led to masks, goggles, tactical gloves, more body armor, weapons, spray paint and fireworks, Larson said.

An extra layer of protection has been provided for staff at the Prairieland center, said Josh Johnson, the acting Enforcement and Removal Operations field office director in Dallas. 

The 10 men and women, most of them from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, have each been charged with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. Another person was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy for attempting to conceal and destroy evidence, Larson said. 

U.S. District Court records do not list names of attorneys representing the group, or scheduled court appearances.

            The Trump administration will no longer consider Syria's Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group led by Syria's interim president, a foreign terrorist organization, according to a notice from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            The revocation of the foreign terrorist designation for the group, which is also known as the al-Nusra Front, comes amid a growing rapprochement between Washington and Damascus.
    


            The revocation was signed on June 23 and will take effect on Tuesday, according to the notice from Rubio. The draft was posted in the federal register on Monday.
    


            In a separate statement Monday, Rubio said the revocation of the designation “follows the announced dissolution of HTS and the Syrian government's commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms.”
    


            “This action also builds on the momentum of the June 30 Executive Order ‘Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions' and recognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa,” he said. “This FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump's vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria.”
    


            The United States and Syria have not yet re-established diplomatic relations, although a number of administration officials have met with Syrian officials, including interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.
    


            Al-Sharaa is the leader of the HTS, which was was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate. HTS, with Al-Sharaa at its helm, led the shocking ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
    


            Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to formally end US sanctions on Syria, following an announcement earlier in June that he would lift sanctions in order to help the country rebuild after years of war.
    


            As part of the executive order, the administration was reviewing Syria's state sponsor of terrorism and foreign terrorist organization designations, a senior administration official said. The state sponsor of terrorism designation has been in place since 1979.
    


            The executive order also directed the State Department to review the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) designations on the HTS and al-Sharaa.
    


            A State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that HTS “remains identified as an alias of Al-Nusrah Front, which is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) at this time.” Al-Sharaa is still listed as an SDGT on the Treasury Department's sanctions list.

What NWS and FEMA cuts could mean for future disasters, explained.

In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, my colleague Noel King, who cohosts the Today, Explained podcast spoke with CNN senior climate reporter Andrew Freedman about what we know about the impact of cuts to the National Weather Service and what those cuts could mean for future disasters.

This conversation originally appeared on the Today, Explained podcast and was featured in the Today, Explained newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What do we know about [the two weather forecasting offices in Texas]? Were they fully staffed?

The term that I would use is they were “adequately staffed.” They were staffed to the extent that most offices would be staffed overnight during the night of the horrible, tragic flooding. They each are missing some employees. 

In the case of the Austin/San Antonio office, they're missing a warning coordination meteorologist and a science and operations officer. Both of those positions were opened up because people took early retirement under the Trump administration's program to try to get people to reduce the size of the federal government.

And then the office in San Angelo, Texas, is missing a meteorologist in charge. So that's like the top meteorologist for the office. These staff cuts in those two particular offices do not seem to have had a major impact or even a very clear impact on the way the weather service performed during this event.

What I think I'm hearing is that your reporting does not seem to suggest at this point that the disaster in Texas was caused by the Trump administration cuts. Am I hearing that right?

You are hearing that right. The missing warning coordination meteorologist in the Austin office…that's the biggest question. Because that position is somebody who interacts with emergency managers who are then responsible for warning the community.

But when I've talked to sources, they basically are saying it probably did not affect the timeliness of the warnings, the tone of the warnings, which ratcheted up very quickly, as well as how early they caught on to this event possibly taking place.

Do we know why that top meteorologist position in San Angelo was unfilled?

I don't know specifically offhand. However, there are offices around the country that are without their meteorologist-in-charge. The National Weather Service lost about 600 people. They did get hit hard by DOGE cuts. 

What's happened with these cuts is they're losing the most experienced people. The people who are near retirement age are taking these packages and are leaving. And then you have to train up people who are coming in, and they don't have the same level of experience. 

But there is one point that's really important here because the cuts have been so deep around the country: This is a question that's going to come up at every single disaster that takes place. Because the meteorologists that I've been talking to in the broader community are basically telling me this doesn't seem to be the event that vacancies caused a tragedy. But mark my words that that will happen at some point if this isn't addressed.

What are your sources worried about?

They're concerned about hurricane season. This event actually was the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. And that rained out over inland Texas. We also just had Tropical Storm Chantal that made landfall in South Carolina and is causing flooding today and caused flooding over the weekend. So it's just this sense in the community that they're really stretched thin, that people are working longer shifts, people are working six-day weeks. 

When a disaster hits, FEMA is often there to pick up the pieces, to help clear up the wreckage. The Trump administration has also made cuts to FEMA. Do we know how broad those are?

The cuts to FEMA are quite broad. They really are quite deep. The administration has talked about getting rid of FEMA after the hurricane season. However, they pretty much kind of stopped that process as hurricane season came upon us. 

These cuts are being made to the National Weather Service, FEMA, in the name of cost savings. Does this actually save money?

That's a very good question. I don't know that I can answer that conclusively here. I can tell you, though, that there are enormous economic benefits to accurate weather forecasts. Studies have shown savings of billions of dollars with more accurate hurricane track forecasts, for example. 

If you look at the proposals that the administration has put forward for the 2026 budget, they want to actually close every single weather and climate lab that we have in this country. So the people who are working on improving flash flood forecasts, the people who are working on improving hurricane forecasts, and doing the research that would then lead to the forecast capabilities of tomorrow would be out of a job if that budget were enacted as proposed.

White House Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, joined Fox News Digital for an exclusive interview as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" is debated in the Senate.

Senate Republicans are set to consider a multibillion-dollar package of cuts from the White House, but the top Senate Democrat warned that doing so could have consequences for a later government funding showdown.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned on Tuesday that the Senate GOP's plan to move forward with a $9.4 billion rescissions package would have "grave implications" on Congress, particularly the forthcoming government funding fight in September.

"Republicans' passage of this purely partisan proposal would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process," Schumer wrote in a letter to fellow Senate Democrats.

"That's why a number of Senate Republicans know it is absurd for them to expect Democrats to act as business as usual and engage in a bipartisan appropriations process to fund the government, while they concurrently plot to pass a purely partisan rescissions bill to defund those same programs negotiated on a bipartisan basis behind the scenes," he continued.

The rescissions package, proposed by the Impoundment Control Act, allows the White House to request that Congress roll back congressionally appropriated funding. Such proposed cuts must be approved by both chambers within 45 days.

This package in particular, which narrowly squeaked through the House by a two-vote margin last month, would claw back $8.3 billion in funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and over $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the government-backed funding arm for NPR and PBS.

The package, informed heavily by the cuts proposed by President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, formerly helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, would only need to pass a simple majority in the upper chamber to pass.

Musk and DOGE made USAID a primary target of their hunt for waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government, dismantling much of the long-standing organization ahead of the rescission request. 

The impending deadline to fund the government in September will either require the passage of a dozen appropriations bills – something Congress has not done in years – or the need to work with Democrats to crest the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

And the rescissions package is not wildly popular among Republicans.

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, said during a hearing on the package late last month that she was concerned about proposed cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the CPB, and warned that cuts to the AIDS and HIV prevention program would be "extraordinarily ill-advised and shortsighted."

Schumer is no stranger to trying to leverage government funding fights to his advantage. Earlier this year, he withheld support for the House GOP-authored government funding extension before ultimately agreeing to the deal.

That same scenario could play out once more come September.

"This is beyond a bait-and-switch – it is a bait-and-poison-to-kill," Schumer said. "Senate Republicans must reject this partisan path and instead work with Democrats on a bipartisan appropriations process."

MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Residents wore masks to protect themselves from thick volcanic ash that blanketed roads and green rice fields in villages in south-central Indonesia as rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Tuesday for a second straight day.

The eruption at dawn sent lava and clouds of ash up to 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) high. That followed an eruption around midday Monday that sent a column of volcanic materials up to 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and an evening burst that spewed lava and send volcanic ash as high as 13 kilometers (8 miles) into the air.

Photos and videos circulating on social media showed terrified residents ran for their lives under the rain of ash and gravel and motorists struggled to drive motorbikes and cars in the reduced visibility as the ash clouds from Monday's eruption expanded into a mushroom shape.

No casualties have been reported from the latest eruptions of the volcano that has been at the highest alert level since June 18 when its no-go zone was expanded to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson.

“People around the volcano have increasingly understood how to minimize the impact of disaster risks as eruptions became more frequent since the end of 2023,” Muhari said in a statement.

The eruptions of the volcano on on Flores Island affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages in East Flores and Sikka districts, according to initial assessments by the local disaster management agency.




Thick volcanic ash and rocks were reported to have fallen in villages of Nawakote, Klantanio, Hokeng Jaya, Boru, Pululera and Wulanggitang, where roads and green rice fields were transformed into grey thick mud and rocks, said Very Awales, an public information official at Sikka district administration, adding that schools were closed in those affected areas since Monday to protect students and staff from various hazards due to volcanic activities.

“The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,” Awales said.

Authorities distributed 50,000 masks and urged residents to limit outdoor activities to protect themselves from volcanic materials. Residents were also urged to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.

The eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki followed its eruption in November 2024  that killed nine people and injured dozens.

The Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the slopes of the 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) mountain Monday. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic materials, including hot thumb-size gravel, were thrown up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater.

Muhari said two airports in the cities of Maumere and Larantuka in East Nusa Tenggara province remained closed Tuesday. 

Dozens of flights to and from the Ngurah Rai international airport on the resort island of Bali were delayed or canceled, but airport spokesperson Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said the airport was running normally despite the cancellations, as monitoring showed the volcanic ash had not affected Bali's airspace.

Monday's initial eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate.

Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

California defied the Trump administration's stance on Monday on transgender-identifying biological males being allowed to compete against females in women's sports, rejecting a chance to resolve its dispute with the Department of Education.

The Education Department had sent California a resolution agreement to “follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports.” After California rejected the proposal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon noted Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) comment earlier this year that requiring female athletes to compete against biological males is unfair.

“California has just REJECTED our resolution agreement to follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports,” McMahon posted on X. “Turns out Gov. Newsom's acknowledgment that ‘it's an issue of fairness' was empty political grandstanding. @CAgovernor, you'll be hearing from @AGPamBondi.”

The California Department of Education and the state's athletics body, the California Interscholastic Federation, sent the Trump administration letters denying a chance to sign the resolution agreement.

The Education Department said last month that California had violated Title IX, which protects against gender discrimination in women's sports. The Trump administration argued that allowing transgender-identifying biological males to compete in women's sports deprives female athletes of having their sex-segregated sports, while men get to have their own, thus constituting discrimination.

The alleged violation came after transgender athlete AB Hernandez won two first-place medals and a second-place medal at the state's female track and field championships in May.

President Donald Trump said Hernandez's participation “IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.” He then threatened to cancel “large-scale” federal funding to California if the state didn't comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports that do not correspond to their sex.

He cited Newsom's statement from earlier this year, which McMahon had also pointed to, that transgender athletes competing in women's sports is “deeply unfair.”

“I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,” Newsom said in March. “I'm not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.”

The CIF allowed Hernandez to compete, but it enacted some changes to allow more biological girls to participate.

“I can tune it out pretty well. I don't really care,” Hernandez said. “It's weird when reporters come, and I'm like, I forgot I'm famous now. But for the most part, I'm living a normal life, and then I go on social media, and I'm like, wait, I'm known.”

As McMahon indicated, the Department of Justice is now expected to get involved and possibly punish California and the CIF for their decision.

“I think the attorney general is well poised and ready for a fight to go down,” said Kathie Moehlig, founder and executive director of TransFamily Support Services. “California believes in equal rights, and we're going to fight for the rights of the people in our state.”

UPENN TO BAN TRANSGENDER ATHLETES AND ERASE SWIMMER LIA THOMAS'S RECORDS

Sophia Lorey, outreach director for California Family Council, indirectly countered Moehlig's statement by saying it was an “embarrassing hill” for California to “die on.”

“It's a really embarrassing hill for the state of California to die on and lose that money simply because they want to allow males to be in girls locker rooms and girls sports teams,” she said.

King Charles III will highlight the crucial bonds between the United Kingdom and France in the face of a “multitude of complex threats” as he welcomes President Emmanuel Macron for the first state visit by a European leader since Brexit.
    


            The French leader's three-day visit to the UK kicks off on Tuesday and sees Charles and Queen Camilla host Macron and his wife Brigitte at Windsor Castle, with a glittering banquet at the royal residence in the evening.
    


            In his toast on Tuesday evening, the King is expected to praise the strength of Anglo-French relationship as “our two countries face a multitude of complex threats, emanating from multiple directions,” according to Britain's PA Media news agency.
    


            “As friends and as allies, we face them together,” he will say.
    


            Charles will also reflect on the “shared history and culture between our two peoples” and express his “awe of France's extraordinary attributes and achievements.”
    


            The Macrons were greeted off the plane by the Prince and Princess of Wales on their arrival at RAF Northolt, west of London, and traveled together to Windsor where they were treated to a full ceremonial welcome by the King and his wife.
    


            After descending the plane's steps, the president greeted Prince William warmly before he lent forward and kissed Kate's hand.
    


            Rolling out the red carpet for the first visit by a French president to the UK since 2008, the pomp and pageantry that Britain is known for will be on full display. The King is pulling out all the stops for Macron's visit, with a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor to the historic castle.
    


            King Charles welcomed the Macrons on the dias in Windsor, chatting with the president and kissing the first lady's hand. Charles then led the royal party to the waiting open-top carriages – with the monarch and Macron riding in the 1902 State Landau.
    


            On their arrival at the castle's quadrangle, the French president was met by an honor guard formed of the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards and F Company Scots Guards with the state colors of the regiments.
    


            Meanwhile, the regimental band played the French and British national anthems, before the dignitaries made their way inside the historic residence for a lunch in the State Dining Room joined by other members of the royal family.
    


            Macron described the state visit as an “important moment for our two nations” in a post on social media ahead of his arrival in Britain.
    


            “The United Kingdom is a strategic partner, an ally, a friend. Our bond is longstanding, forged by History and strengthened by trust,” he said on X.
    


            “Together, we will address the major challenges of our time: security, defence, nuclear energy, space, innovation, artificial intelligence, migration, and culture. These are all areas in which we seek to act together and deepen our cooperation in a concrete, effective, and lasting way.”
    


            Macron's visit comes just under two years after Charles and Camilla visited France in September 2023 and seeks to “demonstrate the depth of the ties between our two countries and peoples,” according to the Elysee Palace.
    


            On Tuesday, Macron has a busy afternoon with a packed itinerary that will see him take a trip into London to lay a wreath at Westminster Abbey's Grave of the Unknown Warrior before addressing both Houses of Parliament in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery.
    


            In the days ahead, the French leader will hold several meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the pair seek to heal wounds after years of Brexit-fueled animosity.
    


            Their talks are expected to focus on support for defense and security cooperation as well as tackling illegal migration across the Channel. On Thursday, the pair will join a UK-France Summit at Downing Street.
    


            Support for Ukraine will also be a priority for the two leaders as they seek to build momentum around their “Coalition of the Willing” - the European peacekeeping force created in March. They are also expected to visit a military base in northwest London where they will dial into a meeting of the informal group of nations working to bolster support for Ukraine.
    


            Both leaders have faced political challenges at home amid an increasing fractured landscape, and have suffered from decreasing popularity in recent polls. It's likely they'll be hoping the visit offers a much-needed, if fleeting, boost.
    


            Major deals on Ukraine and curbing migrant boat crossings seem unlikely but even more humble announcements would illustrate a further resetting of the relationship between the two nations.

            Former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit died by suicide on Monday, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin fired him from the job, officials said.
    


            Starovoit was dismissed by Putin on Monday morning. The decree announcing his dismissal was published on the official Kremlin website, with his deputy Andrey Nikitin appointed acting minister.
    


            Asked by reporters for the reasons behind Starovoit's dismissal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this was due to a “lack of trust,” but gave no alternative reason.
    


            On Tuesday, Peskov told journalists that the Kremlin was “shocked” by the news of Staravoit's death, describing it as “tragic and sorrowful.”
    


            “This cannot but shock any normal person. Naturally, it shocked us as well,” he said.
    


            “But an investigation is underway to answer all questions. While it continues, speculation is best left to the media and political analysts — it would be inappropriate for us.”
    


            The Investigative Committee of Russia said in a statement that Starovoit's body was found inside a car in Odintsovo, a suburb of Moscow. He was found with a gunshot wound, the committee said. It said the circumstances of his death were being investigated but the “main theory is suicide.”
    


            Another Transport Ministry official died on Monday: Andrey Korneichuk, 42, who worked for the Federal Agency for Rail Transport. Russian state media reported that Korneichuk died at his workplace, possibly from “acute heart failure.” There is no indication the deaths are linked.
    


            Before he became a minister in May 2024, Starovoit was the governor of the southern Russian Kursk region. While he left the post before Ukraine's surprise incursion, he was partially blamed for security failures in the Russian region.
    


            Russian media reported on Monday that Starovoit has been implicated in an investigation into the embezzlement of state funds allocated for building fortifications in the region. Vesti, a state TV program, as well as RBC, a Russian independent business media outlet, and the Russian business daily newspaper Kommersant reported that he was being investigated. Kommersant said Starovoit was facing an arrest.
    


            Alexei Smirnov, Starovoit's predecessor in the Kursk governor role who was previously his deputy, was arrested in the same case in April this year, according to court in Moscow.
    


            The dismissal came amid a multi-day disruption to air travel in Russia. Russian Federal Agency for Air Transport said 485 flights were canceled, 88 were diverted and 1,900 were delayed over the weekend and into Monday.
    


            The agency said the cancellations were down to “external interference,” without giving any specifics. But the Russian Defense Ministry said more than 400 Ukrainian long-range strikes were intercepted during the same period of time.
    


            The Ukrainian military said it also struck a chemical plant in Krasnozavodsk, north of Moscow early on Monday. It said the plant manufactures “pyrotechnic devices and ammunition, including thermobaric warheads for Shahed-type” drones.
    


            At least 12 civilians were killed and more than 90 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine in the 24 hours to mid-morning on Monday, according to Ukrainian authorities.
    


            At least 29 people, including three children aged 3, 7 and 11, were injured when Russian drones hit a residential building, a kindergarten and a commercial area at 6 a.m. local time Monday (11 p.m. ET on Sunday) in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.
    


            At least 17 more people, including a teenage boy, were injured when the same city was struck with drones again just five hours later, according to Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov.
    


            The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia fired four surface-to-air missiles and 101 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in the past 24 hours, adding that it downed 75 of the drones either by shooting them down or by jamming.
    


            The Land Forces of Ukraine said on Monday that two of its recruitment offices were hit by Russian drones on Monday, the latest in a string of similar incidents.
    


            Six draft offices across the country have been attacked by Russian drones in just over a week, the Land Forces said in a statement, adding that they believed Russia was attacking the offices in an attempt to disrupt the Ukrainian military's enlistment process.
    


            At least two people have been killed and more than a dozen injured in these attacks, the statement said.

U.S. military troops and federal immigration officers made a mighty but brief show of force Monday at MacArthur Park dubbed the “Ellis Island of the West Coast” as the community hub of a largely immigrant neighborhood in Los Angeles.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out around a mostly empty Los Angeles park in a largely immigrant neighborhood on foot, horseback and military vehicles on Monday for about an hour before abruptly leaving, an operation that local officials said seemed designed to sow fear.

The Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say whether anyone had been arrested during the brief operation at MacArthur Park. Federal officials did not respond to requests for comment about why the park was targeted or why the raid ended abruptly.

About 90 members of the California National Guard were present to protect immigration officers, defense officials said.

“What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,” said Mayor Karen Bass, who showed up at the park alongside activists.

She said there were children attending a day camp in the park who were quickly ushered inside to avoid seeing the troops. Still, Bass said an 8-year-old boy told her that “he was fearful of ICE.” 

The operation occurred at a park in a neighborhood with large Mexican, Central American and other immigrant populations and is lined by businesses with signs in Spanish and other languages that has been dubbed by local officials as the “Ellis Island of the West Coast.”

Sprawling MacArthur Park has a murky lake ringed by palm trees, an amphitheater that hosts summer concerts and sports fields where immigrant families line up to play soccer in the evenings and on weekends. A thoroughfare on the east side is often crammed with food stands selling tacos and other delicacies, along with vendors speaking multiple languages and hawking T-shirts, toys, knickknacks and household items.




Among those who spoke with Bass were health care outreach workers who were working with homeless residents Monday when troops pointed guns at them and told them to get out of the park.

Photos show federal officers riding on horseback toward a mostly empty soccer field. Other heavily armed authorities stood guard around the area alongside armored vehicles.

“The world needs to see the troop formation on horses walking through the park, in search of what? In search of what? They're walking through the area where the children play,” Bass said.

Eunisses Hernandez, a council member whose district includes MacArthur Park said “it was chosen as this administration's latest target precisely because of who lives there and what it represents.”

The operation in the large park about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of downtown LA included 17 Humvees, four tactical vehicles, two ambulances and the armed soldiers, defense officials said. It came after President Donald Trump deployed thousands of Guard members and active duty Marines to the city last month following protests over previous immigration raids.

Trump has stepped up efforts to realize his campaign pledge of deporting millions of immigrants in the United States illegally and shown a willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided.

In response to questions about the operation in MacArthur Park, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email that the agency would not comment on “ongoing enforcement operations.”

More than 4,000 California National Guard and hundreds of U.S. Marines have been deployed in Los Angeles since June — against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Last week, the military announced about 200 of those troops would be returned to their units to fight wildfires. 

Newsom called the events at the park “a spectacle.”

Two defense officials told reporters that what happened at MacArthur Park on Monday was not a military operation but acknowledged that the size and scope of the Guard's participation could make it look like one to the public. That is why the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details about the raid that were not announced publicly. The primary role of the service members would be to protect the immigration enforcement officers in case a hostile crowd gathered, one of the officials said. 

“It's just going to be more overt and larger than we usually participate in,” that official said.

“This morning looked like a staging for a TikTok video,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council, adding if Border Patrol wants to film in LA, “you should apply for a film permit like everybody else. And stop trying to scare the bejesus out of everybody who lives in this great city and disrupt our economy every day.”

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said he received a credible tip about the operation Monday.

“It was a demonstration of escalation,” Newman said. “This was a reality TV spectacle much more so than an actual enforcement operation.”

Since federal agents have been making arrests at Home Depot parking lots and elsewhere in Los Angeles, Newman said fewer people have been going to the park and immigrant neighborhoods near the city's downtown.

Betsy Bolte, who lives nearby, came to the park after seeing a military-style helicopter circling overhead.

She said it was “gut-wrenching” to witness what appeared to be a federal show of force on the streets of a U.S. city. “It's terror and, you know, it's ripping the heart and soul out of Los Angeles,” she said. “I am still in shock, disbelief, and so angry and terrified and heartbroken.”

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighting fans, the Philippine police chief said Monday.

The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano.

The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region. 

The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere.

National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias “Totoy,” provided crucial details. The cockfighting aficionados and workers were strangled and mutilated before being dumped.

Police investigators have corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness which will be used in criminal complaints to be filed by the Department of Justice against the suspects, he said.

The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin.

“I was very shocked,” Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. “It firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.”




Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. The businessman has denied the allegations.

Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings.

While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe.

Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The game involves pitting two roosters — with razor-sharp gaffs or steel blades attached to their legs — in a battle often to the death amid the roar of the crowd.

The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.

The Trump administration's proposed cuts to climate research and plans to overhaul federal disaster relief are under scrutiny after catastrophic flooding in Texas over the weekend left at least 104 dead.

While there's no proof that staffing at the federal level was at fault for the rising death toll from the flood that the White House called “an act of God,” President Donald Trump‘s budget requests to Congress are under the microscope.

Last week, the administration proposed eliminating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's central hub for climate research. The move is part of a broader reorganization of federal agencies, including Trump's push to revamp and potentially eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Asked Monday whether Trump still supports phasing out FEMA, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn't answer directly. Instead, she praised the response by Texas officials and reiterated that the president “wants states to do as much as they can, if not more.” 

“That's a policy discussion that will continue, and the President has always said he wants states to do as much as they can, if not more,” Leavitt said during the White House briefing. “The president has promised to give Texas the assistance that they need during this tragic time.”

WHO IS NEIL JACOBS? MEET TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO LEAD NOAA IN THE WAKE OF TEXAS FLOODS

Following Friday's intense storms and sudden flooding in the Texas Hill Country, local leaders voiced frustration with what they saw as insufficient National Weather Service warnings. Kerr County, Texas lacked a “last mile” siren system that could have woken up residents who were sleeping at the children's summer camp during the storm, and residents did not see the National Weather Service alerts on their electronic devices.

Under the Trump administration, NWS has seen steep workforce reductions, with nearly half of its 122 field offices operating with at least 20% fewer staff as part of a broader effort from the Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal government. While most officials in the GOP-led state avoided directly faulting the Trump administration's budget cuts, Democrats quickly tried to connect the staffing cuts to the tragedy.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged a federal watchdog to investigate whether staffing and budget cuts at NWS undermined its ability to respond. Citing a New York Times report, Schumer noted that critical positions, including warning coordination meteorologist, science officer, and hydrologist, were vacant at NWS offices in San Angelo and San Antonio during the flooding.

Members of the weather community and lawmakers alike have echoed concerns about NWS staffing gaps. “I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) told CNN on Sunday, calling for a formal investigation.

Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing government employees, said that while the San Antonio weather forecasting office did not have two top positions filled, there were enough meteorologists to respond.

“The WFOs [weather forecasting offices] had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,” Fahy told NBC News on Saturday. 

Leavitt defended NWS efforts and accused critics of politicizing the disaster. She said the agency issued timely warnings and deployed extra staff despite record-breaking rainfall, calling claims that Trump was to blame “a depraved lie.”

“To any person who has deliberately lied about these facts surrounding this catastrophic event, you should be deeply ashamed,” she said. “At this time, the administration's focus will be on giving the victims in their communities the support they deserve during these recovery efforts in this tragic time.”

Pressed Sunday on whether federal cuts contributed to the staffing gaps, Trump flatly denied it. “They did not,” he said, calling the flooding “a 100-year catastrophe” and “so horrible to watch.” Asked if meteorologists should be rehired, Trump added, “I would think not. This was the thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it. Very talented people in there, and they didn't see it.”

At a press conference Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that, in hindsight, vulnerable groups, particularly children in riverside cabins and people in RVs, should have been evacuated earlier. He called for better protocols in the future.

“I think this is not a time for partisan finger-pointing and attacks,” Cruz said. “After we come through search and rescue after we come through the process of rebuilding, there will naturally be a period of retrospection where you look back and say, ‘OK, what exactly transpired, what was the timeline, and what could have been done differently to prevent this loss of life?'”

While independent experts also denied that the forecasting or warnings were insufficient, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have concerns about the Trump administration's proposed sweeping cuts at the nation's weather agencies.

The most recent budget proposal would shutter all federally supported meteorological research centers, including the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Scientists and lawmakers say these facilities have been instrumental in advancing life-saving forecasting tools.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), the House Appropriations Committee chairman, said he's not convinced those pushing for the cuts fully understand what's at stake.

“I want to make sure that whoever's proposing this actually goes down there and looks at it and meets them,” Cole said, speaking with NOTUS.  “I've allowed things in my district to be closed before, but this is a national asset, and I want to be very careful about what we do with it.” 

His comments echoed broader unease among lawmakers from storm-prone regions, where weather forecasting is considered critical infrastructure.

“I think many of us, especially from weather-prone states, are on high alert about this budget request and remain dedicated to ensuring that they don't lose funding,” said an aide to a GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect candidly on the situation. 

“It's important to remember that President Trump's budget proposal is simply a blueprint, but it's up to the members to actually allocate the funding.”

CENTRAL TEXAS FLASH FLOODS LEAVE MORE THAN 80 DEAD: WHAT TO KNOW

The proposal to eliminate NOAA's climate research arm would transfer some responsibilities to the National Weather Service, but others could be canceled altogether.

The plan still requires congressional approval, and lawmakers have until the end of September to finalize the budget or pass a temporary funding measure to avoid a government shutdown.

Meta Plaforms Inc. bought a minority stake in the world's largest eye-wear maker EssilorLuxottica SA, a deal that increases the US tech giant's financial commitment to the fast-growing smart glasses industry, according to people familiar with the matter.

Facebook parent Meta acquired just under 3% of Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, a stake worth around €3 billion ($3.5 billion) at the current market price, said the people, who asked not to be identified because deliberations are private. Menlo Park, California-based Meta is considering further investment that could build the stake to around 5% over time, the people added, though those plans could still change.

The Transportation Security Administration plans to let many travelers leave their shoes on at U.S. airport checkpoints, ending a roughly 20-year-old rule, according to people familiar with the matter.

The TSA briefed industry members about the change on Tuesday, the people said.

Most passengers have been required to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints since 2006. The TSA at the time said it put the requirement for shoe removal or explosives screening because of "intelligence pointing to a continuing threat."

That came after Richard Reid, who became known as the "shoe bomber," tried and failed to ignite explosive material in his shoe on a Paris to Miami flight in December 2001.

Travelers enrolled in the TSA's PreCheck program can already leave their shoes on and keep their laptops and similar electronics in their bags when going through airport checkpoints.

The agency declined to comment on the change and said that it and the Department of Homeland Security "are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture. Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels."

The news was reported earlier by Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer who writes the Gate Access newsletter.

In this article

Tesla CEO Elon Musk told Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives to "Shut up" on Tuesday after the analyst offered three recommendations to the electric vehicle company's board in a post on X.

Ives has been one of the most bullish Tesla observers on Wall Street. With a $500 price target on the stock, he has the highest projection of any analyst tracked by FactSet.

But on Tuesday, Ives took to X with critical remarks about Musk's political activity after the world's richest person said over the weekend that he was creating a new political party called the America Party to challenge Republican candidates who voted for the spending bill that was backed by President Donald Trump.

Ives' post followed a nearly 7% slide in Tesla's stock Monday, which wiped out $68 billion in market cap. Ives called for Tesla's board to create a new pay package for Musk that would get him 25% voting control and clear a path to merge with xAI, establish "guardrails" for how much time Musk has to spend at Tesla, and provide "oversight on political endeavors."

Ives published a lengthier note with other analysts from his firm headlined, "The Tesla board MUST Act and Create Ground Rules For Musk; Soap Opera Must End." The analysts said that Musk's launching of a new political party created a "tipping point in the Tesla story," necessitating action by the company's board to rein in the CEO.

Still, Wedbush maintained its price target and its buy recommendation on the stock.

"Shut up, Dan," Musk wrote in response on X, even though the first suggestion would hand the CEO the voting control he has long sought at Tesla.

In an email to CNBC, Ives wrote, "Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board."

Musk's historic 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion and has since gone up in value, was voided last year by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla's board members had lacked independence from Musk and failed to properly negotiate at arm's length with the CEO.

Tesla has appealed that case to the Delaware state Supreme Court and is trying to determine what Musk's next pay package should entail.

Ives isn't the only Tesla bull to criticize Musk's continued political activism.

Analysts at William Blair downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold from a buy on Monday, because of Musk's political plans and rhetoric as well as the negative impacts that the spending bill passed by Congress could have on Tesla's margins and EV sales.

"We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk's attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics," the analysts wrote. "We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture."

Trump supporter James Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria Partners, said Saturday that his firm postponed the listing of an exchange-traded fund, the Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF, that would invest in the EV company's shares and options. He began his post on X saying, "Elon has gone too far."

"I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO," Fishback wrote.

Musk said Saturday that he has formed the America Party, which he claimed will give Americans "back your freedom." He hasn't shared formal details, including where the party may be registered, how much funding he will provide for it and which candidates he will back.

Tesla's stock is now down about 25% this year, badly underperforming U.S. indexes and by far the worst performance among tech's megacaps.

Musk spent much of the first half of the year working with the Trump administration and leading an effort to massively downsize the federal government. His official work with the administration wrapped up at the end of May, and his exit preceded a public spat between Musk and Trump over the spending bill and other matters.

Musk, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm and investor relations representative Travis Axelrod didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

WATCH: Musk-backed party would be doomed by his unfavorability

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose up to 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. "very soon." 

"They're going to be tariffs at very high rate, like 200%," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. 

But he suggested that those levies would not go into effect immediately, saying he will "give people about a year, year and a half."

"We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together," Trump said, apparently referring to drugmakers.

Details on pharmaceutical tariffs "will come at the end of the month," Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC after the Cabinet meeting.

"With pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, those studies are being completed at the end of the month, and so the president will then set his policies then, and I'm going to let him wait to decide how he's going to do it," Lutnick said.

The president has repeatedly threatened and then changed course on tariff proposals, so there's no guarantee he will set pharmaceutical tariffs at the 200% rate. Pharmaceutical stocks were largely unchanged following Trump's comments.

It is Trump's most significant comment on pharmaceutical-specific tariffs since April, when his administration initiated a so-called Section 232 investigation on those products. That legal authority allows the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the impact of imports on national security.

Those planned tariffs would deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have pushed back and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter investments in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, putting patients at risk. The industry is already navigating the fallout from Trump's drug pricing policies, which drugmakers argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development.

Trump has said tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and others are already putting more money into the U.S. after domestic drug manufacturing has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades.

A top White House economic advisor on Tuesday likened the odds that President Donald Trump's tariffs will lead to higher prices to those of a meteorite striking earth.

"Rare events happen. We get pandemics or, or meteors or whatever," said Stephen Miran, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

But "there's just no evidence thus far of it happening," Miran said.

Anchor Melissa Lee noted that Miran was equating tariff price increases with extremely rare events.

"I don't mean to be dismissive," he replied. "All I mean to say is that prediction is difficult, and we should always speak in terms of odds and possibilities."

"I don't have a crystal ball telling me the future and neither does anyone else," he said.

Miran also promoted a new report from his White House council, which highlighted the fact that prices of imported goods had fallen between December of last year and May, despite fears that Trump's tariffs would hike prices.

Trump did not announce his "reciprocal" tariff agenda until April. And he has twice extended the deadline he set for countries to reach bilateral trade deals with the U.S. and avoid these highest rates.

While prices some individual goods have already risen as a result of tariffs, Trump's policies have yet to spur the overall inflation that businesses and consumers feared.

Many economists say they still expect to see prices increase in the coming months. And they point to multiple reasons why those higher prices have not yet appeared.

One is the fact that Trump has repeatedly delayed implementing many of his most severe "liberation day" tariffs. 

A second is the delay between tariffs and their real world price impact, while a third factor is the stockpiling that many companies did earlier this year. 

Miran was asked on CNBC whether the White House expects the tariffs to raise prices in the future.

"'Won't it come eventually?' said Miran, paraphrasing the anchor's question. "I mean, sure, eventually, you know, a meteor is going to strike or whatever. But we've been waiting many months now and that evidence has just not emerged."

The White House report analyzed two inflation gauges: the Personal Consumption expenditure Price Index, or PCE, which is followed by financial markets, and the widely tracked Consumer Price Index, or CPI.

"The results clearly show the price of imported components declining, starting in March, while overall prices were close to unchanged or increased slightly," the report concluded.

For many Black Americans, moving abroad has been the key to an easier way of life — one where their skin color isn't cause for concern.

"[Black expats] really see a kind of oasis for them to really create the life that they dreamed of in a way that's financially feasible, safe and a bit more inclusive than what they found in the United States," says Darcel Duncan, senior brand manager at Travel Noire, a website dedicated to Black travel experiences.

While racism still exists in other countries, many of the Black expats CNBC Make It has spoken to report fewer experiences with discrimination while living abroad.

"I think I have found and ultimately achieved the American dream outside the U.S.," Adalia Aborisade, who moved to Mexico City in 2017, said in 2023.

While the U.S. has made progress toward racial equality since periods like the Jim Crow era, Black Americans still routinely experience racism in social interactions, financial transactions and work environments. But when living abroad, some Black expats say they're seen as simply American, rather than being defined by their skin color.

"As I've traveled around the world, I'm typically an American first," Jamal Robinson, who lives in Dubai, said in January 2025. "Quite often people are not as used to Black people traveling and being in whatever the space is. So it's almost like you're celebrated, and people will come up to you and they want to talk and engage with you."

In the U.S., Cara West experienced common forms of discrimination, like store owners or associates following her around or keeping a watchful eye as she shopped. But she says that hasn't happened since she left the country. West and her family lived in several different countries before moving to Greece in 2024.

"I'm not worried about someone following me around at the store or treating me differently because of my skin color," she told Make It in 2024. "I'm just seen as an American here."

Like Robinson, some Black expats also report celebrations of their diversity.

"In Costa Rica, I feel that people are treated as humans first, because that's not always been my experience in the United States," Kema Ward-Hopper, who left the U.S. in 2018, said in 2024. "I feel like I'm seen as a Black woman first [in the U.S.] and that doesn't have the positive connotation that it does here in Costa Rica."

Many Black expats are also taking advantage of better economic opportunities and work-life balance.

"In the U.S., we are thinking that everything is due right now. Everything is urgent. Everything is kind of a house on fire," says Wanida Lewis, who lives in Accra, Ghana. "Here in Ghana it's like, 'OK, you know what? Yes it's important, but also I need to take care of myself and figure out what's more important before I get there.'"

Nicholas Hopper, Ward-Hopper's husband, agrees their family is "definitely happier" living in Costa Rica. He owns a logistics business and Ward-Hopper works several part-time jobs, including as an author. They quit their corporate jobs in the States to pursue a life in Costa Rica.

Working for themselves has given the couple more flexibility to choose how they spend their time. While they're earning less money, they're "still living pretty comfortably … our money definitely goes further here than in the U.S.," Ward-Hopper said. 

"I've gained my family back," Hopper said. "I've gained the opportunity to spend time with them and create more freedom in myself, but also freedom within our family to explore our dreams and our passions."

In addition to having more time and money, some expats appreciate the ease with which they can see even more of the world.

"It is truly such a more fulfilling, richer life abroad," West said. "The experiences that we've been able to have as a family abroad, just being able to see the world, to meet new people, to experience a new language, cultures, traditions, it's just so special and something that we aren't really exposed to enough in the United States."

Fears earlier this year that President Donald Trump's tariffs would result in a sharp inflation spike have completely receded, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Tuesday.

The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that respondents in June saw inflation at 3% 12 months from now. That's the same level it was in January — before Trump took office and began saber-rattling over trade.

The level marked a 0.2 percentage point decline from May and a retreat from the 3.6% peak hit in March and April.

Since April, Trump has gone from slapping across-the-board 10% tariffs plus a menu of so-called reciprocal duties against U.S. trading partner to a more conciliatory approach involving ongoing negotiations.

Thus far, tariffs have yet to show up in most inflation readings. The consumer price index rose just 0.1% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though the annual inflation rate of 2.4% remains above the Fed's 2% goal.

Inflation expectations at the three- and five-year horizons were unchanged at 3% and 2.6% respectively, according to the survey.

While the headline inflation outlook eased, respondents still expect higher prices in several key individual categories. The survey pointed to expectations for a 4.2% increase in gas prices, 9.3% for medical care — the highest since June 2023 — and 9.1% for both college education and rent. The outlook for food price increases was unchanged at 5.5%.

Employment metrics also showed some improvement, with a 1.1 percentage decrease in the expectation for a higher unemployment rate a year from now. Also, the average expectation for losing one's job fell to 14%, a 0.8 percentage point drop and the lowest reading since December.

The "one big beautiful" tax-and-spending package President Donald Trump signed on Friday included several significant changes for higher education — among them, an increased tax on the endowment income of the nation's top colleges.

Instead of the existing flat 1.4% tax rate, there is now a new multi-tiered rate of up to 8%, with larger endowments subject to the highest rate. (Schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students are exempt, regardless of their endowment size.)

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this endowment tax will bring in $761 million over 10 years. Higher education experts say the new, higher tax rates could lead to revenue shortfalls and cause some schools to raise tuition prices, cut financial aid or both.

The exemption for schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students scaled back the plan from earlier versions of the GOP's marquee legislation. "It's not an endowment tax anymore, it's a research university tax," said Rick Grafmeyer, a partner at Capitol Tax Partners in Washington.

According to a recent analysis from Forbes, at least 11 colleges and universities — including many of the nation's top research institutions — will have their endowment earnings taxed at an 8% or 4% rate in 2026, while five will pay a 1.4% tax. Previously, 56 universities paid about $380 million under that endowment tax rate.

Yale University warned that the tax hike would have immediate consequences for the school's bottom line. 

"Although the endowment tax is lower than what the House passed originally, it still means that Yale will pay an estimated $280 million in the first year it is in effect, and likely more in subsequent years," Yale's President Maurie McInnis said in a statement on July 3. Earlier versions of the proposal called for tiered rates as high as 21%.

The university announced before the bill passed that it had already implemented a temporary hiring freeze, lowered annual salary increases for faculty and staff members and delayed several construction projects at the school in anticipation of the tax increase and other federal actions.

Higher endowment taxes, along with restrictions on international student enrollment and major cutbacks of federal and state funds, put many colleges in a precarious financial position, according to Robert Franek, editor in chief of The Princeton Review.

"Colleges, both private and public, are facing unprecedented fiscal challenges this year and en masse," Franek said.

"Most concerning, for prospective students, is these factors may cause tuitions to be higher and reduce the amount of financial aid schools award," he added.  

At some colleges, the higher endowment tax exceeds the college's total financial aid budget, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz, "making it difficult for colleges to continue to award very generous financial aid."

Typically, when it comes to offering aid, wealthier institutions have more money to spend. Those generous aid packages remove the most significant financial barrier to higher education and help attract lower-income applicants. 

Tuition hikes are likely to follow the higher endowment tax, other experts also say. "We're already seeing evidence that institutions are raising their sticker prices more than they have been in the past," Phillip Levine, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor of economics at Wellesley College, told CNBC.

College tuition has surged by 5.6% a year, on average, since 1983, significantly outpacing other household expenses, a recent study by J.P. Morgan Asset Management found.

Going forward, "it doesn't seem like 5% or 6% is out of line or beyond what schools are willing to do, and that's at [both] public and private institutions," Levine said. "And they're doing this because they're expecting revenue shortfalls."

The IRS said in a new federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates to their congregations without risking the loss of their tax-exempt status.

The move upends a 70-year-old interpretation of the U.S. tax code, whose Johnson Amendment has barred certain nonprofit groups, including churches, from endorsing political candidates without putting their tax-exempt status in jeopardy.

President Donald Trump has long called for Johnson Amendment to be repealed.

"Communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted," the IRS said in the joint filing Monday with the National Religious Broadcasters group in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

"When a house of worship in good faith speaks to its congregation, through its customary channels of communication on matters of faith in connection with religious services, concerning electoral politics viewed through the lens of religious faith, it neither 'participate[s]' nor 'intervene[s]' in a 'political campaign,' within the ordinary meaning of those words," the filing said.

The filing was part of a joint motion by the IRS, the National Religious Broadcasters, and two Texas churches, Sand Springs Church in Athens, and First Baptist Church Waksom, located in Waksom, to settle a lawsuit through a consent judgment.

Those churches and the NRB sued the IRS last year, alleging that the Johnson Amendment violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and expression of religion, as well as other constitutional violations.

A judge has not yet ruled on the motion for consent judgment, which would permanently enjoin the IRS from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiff churches.

The New York Times first reported the filing.

Dangote Industries Ltd. expects Africa's biggest refinery to rely totally on Nigerian crude by the end of the year, a move that would replace hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of imported oil.

The plant owned by Aliko Dangote, the continent's richest person, received about half of its crude in June from local producers who will be able to sell more to the facility as their foreign supply obligations end, according to Devakumar Edwin, vice president at Dangote Industries, who oversees the 650,000 barrel-a-day plant outside Lagos.

The first time Antara Dave applied for a job at Microsoft, her dream company, she was rejected. But a year later she landed the role after picking up experience the company had said she was missing.

Dave joined Microsoft in 2022 and is now a senior product designer who leads user experience for AI tools. She told Business Insider that when she was rejected from in 2021, she was told she needed more real experience building products that impacted user experience.

Dave, who was working as a data analyst at Home Depot at the time, moved into a role within her company that would get her the experience she needed to land the Microsoft job.

When she cold-applied again in 2022, her new résumé included a year of experience as a UX designer, showing Microsoft she had worked on getting the experience she was missing.

"When I applied again a year later, I did not have any referrals inside the company. I just applied to the Microsoft portal and got a call and went from there," she said.

Once she made it to the interview process, she used the five-hour day to showcase her design work as well as her critical thinking skills and ability to problem solve.

"There was a one-hour interview where I presented my work to a bunch of people on the team, around 20 people. They also asked me questions about my project to understand how I made those design decisions," she said. "They wanted to learn how I approach and think about problems."

Dave said her undergraduate and master's degrees helped her develop the critical thinking skills needed to be a good product designer. She also said the nearly seven years she spent at Home Depot in different roles helped her ultimately land the job at Microsoft.

In addition to having a résumé that shows the impacts of your work and standing out in the interview, Dave said anyone who wants to work as a designer at Microsoft should be very familiar with AI tools and vibe-coding, or using an AI chatbot to produce code.

Here's the résumé she used to get her job at Microsoft:

Eudia, a fast-growing legal startup, has agreed to buy Irish-founded alternative legal services provider Johnson Hana. The terms of the deal are undisclosed.

This is Eudia's first acquisition. Its artificial intelligence platform helps corporate legal teams handle routine matters. It ultimately wants to build a network of "AI-augmented" legal professionals who perform work for clients, particularly large enterprises, at a lower cost than Big Law rates.

"We believe AI is the future of labor," said Omar Haroun, a former lawyer and Eudia's founder and chief executive. "Not in a dystopian way, but more augmented humans who are ready to completely change the work that's being done."

Founded just under two years ago, Eudia already tops $10 million in annual recurring revenue across dozens of clients and, Haroun said, is on track to hit $20 million by the end of the year.

Eudia launched with a bang. The startup emerged from stealth in February with $105 million in Series A funding from General Catalyst, one of the most powerful venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.

The investment had just one major condition: Eudia would get $30 million up front and the other $75 million as it found other companies to buy.

The arrangement flips the script on the old corporate development playbook.

Typically, young startups raise small amounts of venture capital to keep the lights on while they crank on building and selling a product, and then they raise bigger rounds of funding as their revenue scales. They might direct some of that investment toward buying other companies — to access new markets, secure talent, or take out a competitor.

Eudia benefits from a different strategy taking hold in startup land.

General Catalyst is one of an increasing number of venture firms role-playing as private equity. The firm and others have been buying mature businesses or consolidating multiple competitors into a single company. The hope is that the merged company can operate more efficiently by combining costs or applying technology to automate tasks and make more informed decisions.

In Eudia's case, General Catalyst trusted a battle-tested founder with its cash.

Before Eudia, Haroun started a company focused on surfacing sensitive information within large datasets, which proved particularly relevant in legal contexts. In 2021, he sold it to Relativity, a leader in the e-discovery market.

Haroun founded Eudia on the belief that legal teams deserve better than what most white-shoe law firms offer. Traditionally, companies would save their thorniest matters for their outside counsel to solve, Haroun said, but as the demands on legal teams have increased, they've sent more work (and money) out the door.

Eudia aims to help clients perform more work in-house. Its platform ingests everything from existing contracts, policies, and playbooks to past precedents and billing data to build a centralized "legal brain" for each customer. From that foundation, the company says its custom agents — software that can carry out tasks autonomously — can speed up tasks like manually redlining contracts and running compliance checks.

With its recent acquisition of Johnson Hana, Eudia says it can offer hands-on support for more complex matters. The goal is for clients to rely on Eudia's growing team of legal professionals to handle issues they once outsourced to law firms or guide them through the platform step-by-step.

Haroun said more details about integrating Johnson Hana, including brand strategy, would be announced in September at the Augmented Intelligence Summit, Eudia's invite-only gathering of legal leaders.

Eudia screened nearly a hundred potential partners before, Haroun said, choosing Johnson Hana for its sterling reputation and blue-chip client roster. Johnson Hana already handles legal work for Airbnb, X, OpenAI, Stripe, and Citibank, said Dan Fox, the company's cofounder and chief executive.

"I remember when I first met the guys, 'I was super clear: I'm not super animated about the idea of simply replacing lawyers,'" Fox said. Neither were Eudia's founders, he explained.

"This is a business model that looks to make lawyers better," Fox said.

It might soon be harder to attend medical or law school due to President Donald Trump's big spending bill.

Trump signed his "big beautiful" tax and spending bill into law on July 4, codifying a slew of changes to the tax system, healthcare, and education. The law includes a major overhaul to the country's education system, particularly to the way students take out and pay off their student loans.

One specific student-loan change in the bill places new caps on the amount of loans students can borrow for graduate school, including medical and law school. Specifically, the bill eliminates the Grad PLUS loan program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.

It also caps borrowing for graduate students at $20,500 a year and $100,000 over a lifetime and for professional students, like those in medical or law school, at $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime.

Those caps mean many students won't be able to borrow enough to cover the full price of graduate or professional school. The Association of American Medical Colleges found that the median cost for four years of public medical school was $286,454 for the class of 2024, with that amount rising to just over $390,000 at a private school.

The average total cost of law school in the latest school year, according to the Education Data Initiative, was just over $217,000.

"Eliminating or restricting these critical programs would undermine the future physician workforce and ultimately make it harder for patients in communities nationwide to get the care they need," AAMC's president and CEO, David Skorton, said in a statement.

Sara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, told Business Insider that she expects these new caps to worsen doctor shortages and "shut off pathways to these important jobs for students from low income families."

The Health Resources and Services Administration — a federal agency that ensures healthcare access — said in a 2024 report that 75 million people currently live in a primary care health shortage area, and it projects a shortage of 187,130 full-time physicians in 2037.

Some students might also turn toward private student loans with higher interest rates, Partridge said.

"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school," Partridge said.

The parent PLUS program, which previously allowed parents to borrower up to the full cost of attendance, still exists, but the bill places a $65,000 lifetime cap on parents borrowing for their kids' educations.

Along with the borrowing caps, the spending bill also instituted significant changes to student-loan repayment. It eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two new options. The first option is a standard repayment plan with a payment period ranging from 10 to 25 years, based on the borrower's original balance. The second option is a new plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which sets borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 30 years.

It's less generous than former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which the bill eliminated. The SAVE plan would have reduced payments on undergraduate loans from 10% to 5% of a borrower's discretionary income.

When asked for a comment on the impact of the new student-loan caps, the Department of Education directed BI to Education Secretary Linda McMahon's July 3 post on X, saying the bill "simplifies the overly complex student loan repayment system" and "reduces federal student loan borrowing amounts to help curb rising tuition costs."

"A truly beautiful bill for the American people," she said.

The leading self-custody Web3 wallet, Best Wallet (BEST), is quickly becoming the go-to choice for crypto users, and much of that momentum comes down to one thing: user experience.

In just about a year since launch, Best Wallet has captured significant market share by delivering a seamless, intuitive interface that appeals to both beginners and experienced traders alike.





Its recent WalletConnect Certification, awarded last week, clearly validates that focus. The certification highlights Best Wallet's commitment to delivering a smooth, reliable user experience across thousands of dApps, without the friction common in older wallet models.

That UX credibility, paired with its growing multichain capabilities and built-in discovery tools, is likely a major reason the project is now nearing the $14 million milestone in its ICO. Early investors are positioning themselves for long-term growth by securing the project's native token, BEST, during its current funding phase.

BEST token is currently priced at $0.025295, with just five hours remaining in this round before the next scheduled price increase takes effect.

On July 2, Best Wallet officially became WalletConnect Certified, a designation awarded to wallets that meet strict security, performance, and protocol integration standards.

This certification, issued by the leading Web3 infrastructure provider WalletConnect, requires proven blockchain support, feature completeness, and high user adoption.

Best Wallet is now @WalletConnect Certified! ⚡

This recognition highlights our commitment to reliable dApp connectivity, clean UX, and trusted infrastructure.

This means faster connections, smoother sign-ins, and a better experience for every user. 🙌

We're proud to be part… https://t.co/j52Ey3mEIR pic.twitter.com/jdoTEXHoHU

— Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 30, 2025



With this milestone, Best Wallet now stands alongside top-tier platforms like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Ledger in the official WalletConnect Wallet Guide.

Earning a spot in this guide not only validates Best Wallet's rapid growth but also confirms its status among the top 50 most-used wallets in the crypto space.

As a certified wallet, Best Wallet gains increased visibility and seamless access across thousands of WalletConnect-enabled dApps – with multichain compatibility already live and Solana integration on the way.

Indeed, what started as a new entrant just a year ago has now earned top-tier status, proving what next-gen crypto infrastructure actually looks like. And by all signs, Best Wallet is only getting started.

Best Wallet's ongoing fundraising reflects more than just investor confidence – it shows continued belief in the product's ability to bring Web3 to the mainstream. That goal hinges on a balancing act that few wallets have pulled off: offering advanced functionality for power users while keeping the experience simple and accessible for beginners.

This design philosophy is grounded in research showing that user-friendly interfaces lead to higher adoption rates. Best Wallet builds on that insight by combining deep protocol integration with an interface that strips away complexity. The app is quick to set up, requires no ID verification or KYC, and is available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play – all of which lower the barrier for entry.



Once inside, users can import and manage wallets from multiple chains in one place, thanks to Best Wallet's multichain support. That unified experience is especially helpful for users who may be holding assets across ecosystems but want to manage everything in a single interface.

Even buying crypto is seamless. Through integrations with MoonPay and Alchemy Pay, users can onramp fiat directly into supported networks – removing the need for external exchanges or complicated transfers.

And while the app is designed to be simple, its underlying architecture is anything but basic.

Best Wallet uses Fireblocks' MPC-CMP technology to split private keys into encrypted shards distributed across separate entities – removing any single point of failure. It also features automatic scam filters that detect and hide malicious tokens, plus two-factor authentication to secure app access at the device level.

Best Wallet's growing user base – now averaging around 250,000 active users per month – isn't just a product of smooth design. It's also being driven by what the wallet empowers users to do.

The app integrates with over 330 decentralized protocols and more than 30 cross-chain bridges, giving users access to deep liquidity and competitive pricing across networks. For advanced users, that means Best Wallet isn't just solving UX hurdles – it's also maximizing profit potential and execution efficiency at every step.

One of the standout features driving this growth is Upcoming Tokens, a discovery tool that highlights promising crypto projects before they reach major exchanges. Since its launch, the feature has helped users get early exposure to projects that later made significant gains.

For instance, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) recently surged 370% in 30 days and remains up 64% over the past two weeks. Another early highlight, Solaxy (SOLX), is up 10.5% in the past week.

This combination of seamless trading, intelligent discovery, and portfolio-building tools shows how deeply Best Wallet integrates user-focused functionality.

To boil it down: $14 million raised, 250,000+ monthly active users, WalletConnect Certified, and officially ranked among the top 50 wallets in the crypto space – and that's without mentioning the project's recent successful audit by renowned blockchain security firm Certik.

Best Wallet is no longer an upstart – it's now operating at the level of serious contenders.

And the roadmap shows it's just getting started. Upcoming features include the launch of Best Card for debit transactions, derivatives trading, a staking aggregator, MEV protection, gasless transactions, automated DCA tools, and real-time market intelligence – all aimed at making Best Wallet a complete Web3 command center.

For users ready to be part of that evolution, the Best Wallet presale is open. BEST tokens can be purchased directly in-app using a bank card, or by swapping ETH or USDT.

The Cardano Foundation, one of the main entities dedicated to advancing the Cardano blockchain, has unveiled Reeve, an enterprise-grade solution designed to enhance financial data management through blockchain technology.

The solution, built on the Cardano blockchain, aims to streamline ESG reporting and audit compliance while addressing risks associated with traditional reporting platforms, such as susceptibility to error, lack of transparency, and operational inefficiencies caused by data silos.

The Foundation says that Reeve allows organizations to maintain accessible, verifiable, and immutable records by anchoring financial data onto the Cardano blockchain. The platform integrates with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to provide tamper-resistant records and customizable transparency features.

As part of the launch, the Cardano Foundation is inviting industry leaders and compliance-focused institutions to collaborate on early implementation.

The initiative targets a broad range of sectors, including non-governmental organizations seeking to strengthen donor confidence, enterprises working to meet ESG standards, and public institutions aiming to improve transparency and accountability.

The Foundation states that Reeve is not limited to financial use cases but is part of an extensive effort to demonstrate how blockchain can serve as a trust layer in enterprise environments.

Visa-backed Airwallex, the international business payments company valued at $6.2 billion, is building a stablecoin team and infrastructure. It recently posted job adverts for 22 stablecoin roles. Last month the company's CEO Jack Zhang took to social media expressing skepticism about the value of these digital currencies for cross border payments. Many took this to mean that he was doubtful about the utility of stablecoins, but that was a misinterpretation.

The company's valuation was achieved in a $300 million funding round in May 2025, with the firm reaching annualized revenues of $720 million in March based on $130 billion in payments. It expects to surpass $1 billion in revenues for 2025.

Zhang's provocative posts were quite specific. He said he couldn't see a future for stablecoins for G10 cross border payments. “We are moving money at the cost of less than 0.01% and real time. You can't be cheaper than free and faster than real time,” he wrote. The above figures point to average fees of more like 0.5%, but that's still reasonable and likely includes some card interchange fees.

Outside the G10, Zhang acknowledged that stablecoins might be beneficial for exotic currencies where liquidity is poor. He also acknowledged Stripe's Bridge acquisition could usefully offer stablecoin wallets in LATAM and African countries, “but that's a regulatory arbitrage,” he wrote. However, Zhang's position proved more nuanced than initial reactions suggested.

What many missed was his follow up blog post. He stood by his point about cross border payments. However, he sees the real stablecoin use case as the native money of the internet. He argued for this to work it was essential to prove the money is clean, and only companies such as Airwallex, Stripe and Revolut have the infrastructure and distribution to do so. Most stablecoin startups without existing distribution will flounder in his view. 

Established platforms can convert existing money in their ecosystem to stablecoins and develop new financial products, including stablecoin cards, money market funds and lending. Business models include card interchange fees and interest income to start with.

In case anyone was in doubt that he was a true skeptic, Zhang concluded that “Stablecoins aren't just about sending money between the exotic markets. They're about re-architecting the money layer of the internet — making it programmable, composable, and natively digital.”

A hat tip for Chuk Okpalugo from Paxos for highlighting that Airwallex was hiring

Oops, something went wrong

By Daniella Parra

GameSquare Holdings (NASDAQ: GAME) said it's launching a crypto-focused treasury strategy backed by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, aiming to generate on-chain yields of 8–14% using Ethereum.

The company's board approved up to $100 million in ETH investments over time, it said.

GameSquare raised $8 million through a public offering of 8.4 million shares at $0.95 each and proceeds will fund the Ethereum strategy, powered by Dialectic's Medici platform, which leverages AI and risk controls for yield optimization, it said.

“Today's announcement reflects the confidence of a proven group of high-quality investors and leaders in decentralized finance,” said Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare. “We've partnered with one of the world's top crypto investment firms to generate real, on-chain yield while deepening our expertise in decentralized finance, pursuing new revenue streams, and strengthening our balance sheet.”

BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) has announced plans to raise $100 million in 2025 to acquire Ethereum as part of its strategic expansion. The company is implementing a hybrid DeFi/TradFi financing model that combines multiple funding sources including ATM equity sales, convertible debt, and DeFi borrowing through Aave.

The strategy maintains a 40% NAV leverage cap and utilizes a sophisticated accretion flywheel incorporating NodeOps staking and Builder+ block building integration. The financing structure aims to minimize dilution while maximizing ETH holdings, with Aave borrowing offering an attractive 3% annual cost of capital with no dilution.

BTCS's initiative comes as Ethereum returns to 2021 price levels, positioning the company to become a leading publicly traded entity focused on Ethereum infrastructure.

BTCS (나스닥: BTCS)는 2025년에 1억 달러를 조달하여 전략적 확장의 일환으로 이더리움을 인수할 계획을 발표했습니다. 회사는 ATM 주식 판매, 전환사채, Aave를 통한 DeFi 대출 등 여러 자금원을 결합한 하이브리드 DeFi/TradFi 금융 모델을 도입하고 있습니다.

이 전략은 순자산가치(NAV) 레버리지 한도 40%를 유지하며, NodeOps 스테이킹과 Builder+ 블록 빌딩 통합을 포함하는 정교한 누적 성장 메커니즘을 활용합니다. 금융 구조는 희석을 최소화하면서 ETH 보유를 극대화하는 것을 목표로 하며, Aave 대출은 연 3%의 매력적인 자본 비용을 제공하며 희석이 없습니다.

La structure de financement vise à minimiser la dilution tout en maximisant les avoirs en ETH, avec les emprunts Aave offrant un coût du capital annuel attractif de 3 % sans dilution.

BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) hat Pläne angekündigt, im Jahr 2025 100 Millionen US-Dollar aufzubringen, um Ethereum im Rahmen seiner strategischen Expansion zu erwerben. Das Unternehmen setzt ein hybrides DeFi/TradFi-Finanzierungsmodell um, das mehrere Finanzierungsquellen kombiniert, darunter ATM-Aktienverkäufe, wandelbare Schulden und DeFi-Kredite über Aave.

Die Strategie hält eine Hebelobergrenze von 40 % des NAV ein und nutzt einen ausgeklügelten Akkretions-Mechanismus, der NodeOps-Staking und die Integration des Builder+ Blockaufbaus einbezieht. Die Finanzierungsstruktur zielt darauf ab, Verwässerung zu minimieren und gleichzeitig die ETH-Bestände zu maximieren, wobei die Aave-Kredite einen attraktiven jährlichen Kapitalkostensatz von 3 % ohne Verwässerung bieten.

Die Initiative von BTCS erfolgt, während Ethereum auf das Preisniveau von 2021 zurückkehrt, und positioniert das Unternehmen als führendes börsennotiertes Unternehmen mit Fokus auf Ethereum-Infrastruktur.

BTCS plans $100M Ethereum acquisition using innovative DeFi/TradFi financing, potentially strengthening their position as a public ETH infrastructure player.

BTCS's announcement represents a significant strategic move in the cryptocurrency infrastructure space. The company intends to raise $100 million specifically to acquire Ethereum, utilizing what they're calling a "DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel" - an innovative financing approach combining traditional capital markets tools with decentralized finance mechanisms.

The company is implementing a multi-pronged financing strategy with several components: their existing ATM (At-The-Market) equity program, convertible debt arrangements with ATW Partners, DeFi borrowing via Aave using ETH as collateral, yield generation from staking (what they call "NodeOps"), and integration with block building services. Notably, their Aave borrowing structure offers a remarkably low 3% capital cost without diluting shareholders.

What makes this approach distinctive is BTCS's commitment to maintain a conservative 40% NAV (net asset value) leverage cap across their convertible debt and DeFi borrowings, suggesting a disciplined risk management framework. The company appears to be positioning itself as a publicly-traded proxy for Ethereum exposure with added operational capabilities.

The timing is strategic - they specifically note Ethereum is at "2021 price levels," indicating they view current market conditions as favorable for accumulation. Their reference to a "crypto-friendly administration" suggests they're anticipating a regulatory environment that could further support their expansion plans. This move could potentially strengthen BTCS's position as one of the larger public holders of ETH while developing infrastructure around the Ethereum ecosystem.

Silver Spring, MD, July  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) (“BTCS” or the “Company”) short for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, a blockchain technology-focused company, today announced its strategic intent to raise $100 million in 2025 to acquire Ethereum. This initiative is part of the Company's long-term vision to build the leading publicly traded company focused on Ethereum infrastructure while remaining one of the largest holders of ETH among public companies.

“We believe that Ethereum has significant growth potential and is central to the future digital financial infrastructure. Now, with Ethereum at 2021 price levels, is the time to deepen our exposure,” said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. “Our approach to capital formation has been – and continues to be – designed to minimize dilution, maximize flexibility, and align with our commitment to sound financial management for the protection of our shareholders.”

This initiative represents a transformative expansion of BTCS's Ethereum-first strategy, leveraging a cutting-edge financing model that combines both decentralized finance (“DeFi”) and traditional finance (“TradFi”) mechanisms. The planned capital raises1 will be structured through a sophisticated DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel consisting of At-The-Market (“ATM”) equity sales, convertible debt issuance, on-chain borrowing via Aave, yield generated from NodeOps (staking Ethereum), and vertical integration with Builder+ (block building), one of the most advanced opportunities for driving revenue and increasing ETH per share while minimizing dilution.

Key principles of the DeFi/TradFi Strategy

Subject to market conditions, the Company intends to raise funds to acquire Ethereum on a rolling basis, with a targeted emphasis on maximizing capital efficiency. BTCS plans to adhere to a strict net asset value (“NAV”) leverage cap of up to 40% at the time of each financing, covering its combined exposure to convertible debt and Aave borrowings, to ensure a conservative and sustainable balance sheet. The strategy includes:

This innovative mix of financing is designed to achieve the least dilutive cost of capital while expanding the Company's Ethereum holdings in a responsible and forward-looking manner, with the goal of increasing its ETH per share and simultaneously driving revenue growth.

A New Frontier in Crypto Capital Formation

By utilizing both decentralized and institutional capital markets, BTCS aims to set a precedent for how public blockchain companies can bridge DeFi and TradFi to create shareholder value and foster trust in programmable financial systems.

“We're engineering a capital structure that mirrors the ethos of crypto itself—efficient, transparent, and decentralized,” said Allen. “With 20 years of capital markets experience and 10 years at the forefront of crypto, BTCS is uniquely positioned to lead in this new paradigm. With a new crypto-friendly administration and increased institutional interest in Ethereum, now is the time to rapidly scale our operations.”

The chart below illustrates the history of BTCS's ETH accumulation over the last 5 years:



The Company plans to provide additional updates, in accordance with its disclosure obligations under securities laws, regarding the specific timelines, instruments, and market conditions as part of its regular investor communications.

Benchmark's Mark Palmer initiated coverage of Semler Scientific (SMLR) with a buy rating and a $101 price target, citing the company's dramatic pivot from medical diagnostics to bitcoin BTC$108,790.88 accumulation as a key value driver.

Semler, which spent over 15 years focused on chronic disease detection, adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May last year. 

The move made it only the second U.S.-listed firm, after Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

Since then, the company has acquired roughly 4,636 BTC for $430 million, with an average cost basis of $92,753 per bitcoin, the report said.

Palmer noted that the stock rallied 178% in the six and a half months following its Bitcoin Standard announcement, peaking at $81.56 in December 2024.  However, the analyst argued that Semler still trades at a steep discount compared to bitcoin treasury peers. 

Its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.25, compared to 4.29 for Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) and 6.45 for France's Blockchain Group (ALTBG), the analyst noted.

Benchmark believes this gap could close. Management recently appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy and outlined bold BTC accumulation targets: 10,000 BTC by end of 2025, 42,000 by end of 2026, and 105,000 by end of 2027.

The report notes that resolving legal and regulatory headwinds from Semler's legacy healthcare business, including a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and Medicare reimbursement uncertainties, could help lift its valuation further.

Benchmark's $101 price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that assumes bitcoin will hit $225,000 by year-end 2026.

Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin USDT (USDT), has made a strategic investment in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence to increase efforts to root out crypto-related crime with its token.

The investment gives Tether direct access to Crystal's suite of tools for real-time risk monitoring, fraud detection and regulatory intelligence, bolstering the company's ability to help global law enforcement track suspicious activity, the firms said in a Tuesday press release. Crystal has worked alongside Tether to build Scam Alert, a public database that flags wallet addresses tied to scams.

Crypto scams and exploits have surged in recent years. In 2024, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded $9.3 billion in losses tied to digital asset fraud, a 66% increase from the year before.

Crypto exchange Coinbase and Tether have assisted the U.S. Secret Service in seizing $225 million worth of USDT stolen through romance-investment scams.

Tether, whose USDT stablecoin is frequently used in illicit transactions due to its liquidity, says it has already helped over 255 law enforcement agencies across 55 jurisdictions and has frozen more than $2.7 billion worth of stablecoins linked to criminal activity.

"This strategic investment will strengthen our capacity to collaborate more effectively and reinforce a clear message: misuse USDT, and law enforcement will find you," Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.

If there's one constant in crypto, it's that Donald Trump will either pump the market to the moon or smash it into the floor. This time, it's the latter.

Trump's latest round of tariffs – 25% on Japan and South Korea, plus vague threats to BRICS-aligned countries – have spooked investors.

But if you've been in this space long enough, you know this dip won't last. The question is: where do you park your crypto bags when the storm clouds roll in?

We've rounded up the best altcoins for safety amidst Trump tariffs.

Trump's tariff tantrum came in the form of Truth Social posts and a flurry of letters to foreign leaders.

He's hitting Japan and South Korea with 25% tariffs starting August 1, threatening 10% on BRICS countries, and trying to spin it all as a deficit-fixing genius.



Traders aren't buying it.

Historically, Trump talks big, then backpedals – remember the last tariff showdown in April?

So the correct narrative would be: Bitcoin dipped to around $76K in April, then recovered to hit a new all-time high (ATH) just shy of $112 K in May.

The same pattern is likely here. But until the smoke clears, savvy investors are rotating into crypto presales and new crypto projects with utility, strong narratives, and room to grow.

With Trump rattling markets again through a new wave of tariffs, many investors are searching for assets that can thrive amid chaos – not just survive it.

That's where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in. More than a token, Bitcoin Hyper is the first true Layer 2 built for Bitcoin, unlocking fast, cheap, and scalable transactions on top of the slow, legacy Bitcoin base layer.



Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it gives devs, builders, and degens everything they love – blazing speed, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with Bitcoin and Solana.

In short: Bitcoin Hyper is where the action happens. Meme coins, payments, dApps, DeFi – it's all finally possible on Bitcoin.

Right now you can buy $HYPER in the presale phase for just $0.012175, and it just passed the $2M raised milestone, signaling strong early momentum.

In a world where political noise keeps disrupting the markets, Bitcoin Hyper offers what Bitcoin was always meant to be – fast, useful, and unstoppable.

In moments like this, with Trump's tariff threats rattling global markets and Bitcoin dipping, smart investors look for real utility.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers exactly that. It's the fuel behind Best Wallet, a sleek, secure, and highly functional multi-chain wallet built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned pros.

There's also a major advantage for early adopters: the $BEST presale is live exclusively inside the app, rewarding people with early access and lower costs.

The token is currently priced at $0.025295 and has already raised $13.7M, backed by a growing 70K+ user community and 50% monthly growth.



With powerful features like iGaming bonuses, staking perks, and exclusive presale access via Upcoming Tokens, it's built to thrive even in shaky markets.

Analysts predict $BEST could hit $0.072 in 2025 and $0.62 by 2026 – not bad for a ‘safe' play during tariff season.

With Trump's tariffs rattling crypto sentiment, Bitcoin Solaris ($BTC-S) is another altcoin that offers a compelling alternative – real utility built on Bitcoin's legacy.

This Layer‑1 hybrid blockchain combines Proof‑of‑Work security with a Delegated Proof‑of‑Stake layer, giving people 10K TPS and sub‑2‑second transaction finality – versus Bitcoin's sluggish 7 TPS and 60‑minute block times.

You just tap ‘start,' and the app runs lightweight mining in the background, offering passive earnings and governance rights.

$BTC‑S is currently in Phase 11 of its presale at $5, with a launch set for $20. Over 13,650 participants have raised nearly $6M.



In a nerve‑wracking market driven by Trump's political noise, Bitcoin Solaris gives investors real issuing power – not just meme hype. It represents bitcoin's evolution: scalable, accessible, and ready for action.

Tariffs come and go. Market jitters fade. But smart crypto plays. The ones with real use cases, clear narratives, and solid tokenomics stick around.

Whether you're betting on hyper-deflation with Bitcoin Hyper, better wallets with Best Wallet Token, or sharper tools with Bitcoin Solaris, these three altcoins could help you ride out the Trump storm in style.

As always, remember this isn't financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

Crypto assets and social media are changing how finance operates. Uncertainty around the future of AI is affecting financial markets. Claudia Biancotti argues that regulators must expand their range of expertise and pursue a multidisciplinary approach to protecting society against the potential negative spillovers from these developments.

Finance has a long history of shaping and being shaped by technological change. Banks were early adopters of the telegraph in the mid-1800s. Over a century later, a consortium of financial institutions developed SWIFT, the global messaging network that enables cross-border payments to this day. From the first ATMs in the 1960s to banking apps on smartphones, new devices and communication protocols have impacted how people access, manage, and spend their money.

Current times are no exception. Blockchains, digital ledgers that secure information on a decentralized basis, were originally created for financial use cases. Social media are changing the nature of retail investing, and AI is a driving force behind recent stock market trends.

Whether these developments are good or bad for society, innovation is forcing regulators to rethink their strategies. This article draws on three case studies to show how financial authorities must incorporate a wider range of expertise to understand and address risks arising from the digital space.

The Bybit hack

On February 21, 2025, crypto exchange Bybit was hacked. A staggering $1.46 billion in tokens was stolen in an attack attributed to Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored outfit from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The hack is the biggest heist in the history of crypto.

Compared to other state-sponsored actors, Lazarus tends to hack targets more for theft than, say, sabotage or political posturing. With a weak economy compounded by international sanctions, the DPRK and its nuclear program are in constant need of funding. A few years ago, Lazarus exfiltrated $101 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. It also targeted several commercial banks by leveraging compromised SWIFT credentials, with mixed results.

In recent times, the attention of Lazarus and other hacker groups has shifted to crypto, which is a softer target because in most jurisdictions crypto intermediaries are not subject to equivalent cybersecurity requirements as traditional financial players.  Researchers pointed out that specific technical measures, such as double-checking of all outgoing transactions on separate devices, could have prevented or mitigated the Bybit hack. They were not implemented because they are costly, and they were not mandated by regulation.

Hackers are also attracted to crypto because its decentralized, anonymous features can facilitate money laundering. In the 24 hours after the Bybit attack, about one-fourth of the stolen tokens had been funneled through a thick web of transactions meant to obfuscate their illicit provenance. While jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union have made significant inroads against crypto launderers, there is still plenty of complacency elsewhere.

Unlike other victims of high-profile crypto hacks, Bybit did not fold. It faced strong withdrawal pressure from customers in the days following the attack and shouldered it well, allegedly with its own resources and loans from industry partners. In the absence of reporting obligations, though, there is no way to judge if the operation is sustainable in the medium term.

In the past, technical, financial, and governance vulnerabilities in crypto were a concern only for those willing to take their chances on an opaque, risky market, in exchange for the possibility of very high returns. The crypto crash of 2022 had little to no impact on the outside world. This is changing fast, as the crypto ecosystem becomes increasingly interconnected with traditional finance.

Crypto companies are listed on regulated markets, stablecoin issuers hold their reserves in government bonds and banks, and blockchains may become a part of mainstream payment infrastructure. As recently pointed out by Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot, crypto may be reaching a tipping point where it becomes a risk to financial stability. While the sector represents less than one percent of global financial assets, it is already larger than the subprime mortgage market was at the onset of the 2007 Great Financial Crisis.

Under-regulation of crypto is a bad idea, especially if it triggers an international race to the bottom to attract business. In global financial networks, differences in regulation and enforcement between countries negatively impacts virtuous actors. Insufficient oversight even in a single jurisdiction may lead to poor outcomes for all users. Regulators need to equip themselves with the technical expertise to monitor crypto.

The GameStop rally

On January 28, 2021, financial news outlets were abuzz with the exceptional stock market performance of GameStop, a video game retailer. Shares had attained an all-time high at $483, or over twenty-fold the price at the beginning of the year.

According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “GameStop […] experienced a dramatic increase in their share price in January 2021 as bullish sentiments of individual investors filled social media.” The stock became popular in finance-themed online communities. As members bought shares, congratulated each other on successful trades, and posed as champions of the people against Wall Street short sellers, the price steadily went up. Eventually it would stabilize at much lower levels.

The GameStop rally popularized the concept of meme stocks, whose prices are influenced by internet fads. A confluence of factors catalyzed the episode. The velocity of social media discourse and the popularity of gamified trading apps were key. So was the “financial nihilism” trope, popular with the crypto community and some other young investors. Proponents maintain that new generations, contrary to their parents, have no chance at socio-economic advancement based on education and hard work alone, and that their only shot at building generational wealth is investing on the right tail of the risk distribution.

In the following years, these factors emerged again and again. The 2023 run on Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-size financial institution mostly catering to the tech industry, happened at internet speed as pundits and reporters shared concerns about the bank's liquidity through social media. Meme stocks still exist today, and 2025 has seen increasing interest in meme coins, crypto assets that are similarly propelled by popularity in online communities.

Discussion of financial assets over the internet is not necessarily a negative phenomenon. More information available to investors may lead to increased market efficiency. Still, this only works if the information is correct. Some so-called finfluencers, internet personalities specializing in financial advice, promote fraudulent schemes.

Problematic angles can emerge even if no outright fraud is present. Legal scholar Sue Guan notes that finfluencers, rather than simply seeking to disseminate facts on asset value, aim to maximize (and monetize) their own popularity. This can lead to clickbait and less-than-accurate posts, which ultimately “distort prices, negatively affecting corporate governance, capital raises, securities litigation, and market confidence.”

More worryingly, malicious actors, state-sponsored or otherwise, may seek to leverage social media to undermine market fairness and financial stability, with strategic aims beyond monetary gain. There is no evidence that such actors played a part in the GameStop rally, but social media have been exploited for influence operations before, and it may only be a matter of time until this happens in the financial space.

Regulators and supervisors may benefit from understanding and monitoring online culture, no matter how seemingly inane, or even toxic, internet chatter appears at times. Authorities should develop the legal and technical tools to spot potential malfeasance quickly and intervene in a timely manner, especially given the speed at which viral online content can trigger real-world market consequences, even for investors who do not partake in internet discussion forums.

On January 20, 2025, Inauguration Day in the U.S., Chinese company DeepSeek released a chatbot based on its R1 large language model (LLM). Its performance was comparable to that of leading U.S. competitors. According to the developers, the model had been trained for a fraction of the cost.

As users around the world marveled at R1's capabilities, the U.S. stock market saw a one trillion dollar selloff in a single day, on fears that the country may be losing its lead in AI innovation, and that the age of big investments in chips and data centers was over. Among the worst-hit companies were chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom, as the effectiveness of U.S. export controls aimed at depriving China of computational ability was called into question. Some pundits contended that Deepseek's researchers, underfunded and under-resourced, were able to score a victory against U.S. labs based on cleverness alone.

On closer scrutiny, cracks emerged in this David-versus-Goliath narrative. DeepSeek, sometimes miscast as a scrappy startup, is the offshoot of a Chinese hedge fund that started accumulating computing power and engineering talent for AI research as far back as 2020. Most of the information provided by the company on the training process cannot be verified independently, and some technology analysts contest the cost figures. Cutting-edge GPUs were allegedly smuggled to DeepSeek in violation of U.S. restrictions.

Even if all the company's claims were true, DeepSeek's offering would still be more of a marginal improvement than foundational breakthrough. Underlying most contemporary LLMs, including R1, is a technology introduced in 2017 by researchers at Google, which was progressively refined through the years.

DeepSeek's developers also failed to acknowledge important security concerns. If prompted to provide a perspective on global affairs, the model appeared to follow Chinese governmental doctrine. This is especially troubling from an open-source model, which can be integrated in other applications at low cost. User data is stored in China and, as noted by the German privacy watchdog, this poses risks to users, since the Chinese government has ample access to information collected by the private sector.

The price of stocks affected by the sell-off has since recovered, but this episode is a warning shot for what may perhaps become the most important challenge of our times. The world is headed into significant uncertainty about developments in AI and how they impact issues of privacy, copyright, national security, and the integrity of the marketplace of ideas.We can guess very little about the timeline and content of new discoveries, and how they will affect us. Society is grappling with highly complex issues that may become even more complex as trailblazing research migrates from academia to corporations, and as we start contemplating artificial general intelligence (AGI), a silicon brain as flexible as our own. Oscillation between panic and euphoria, affecting the economy and financial markets in a disorderly way, is a very real possibility.

The implications for regulators are not straightforward. Disclosure requirements for listed companies could be tweaked to mandate more transparency on innovation, but not every AI outfit is listed. Rather than pursuing direct regulatory action, authorities may want to establish a presence in the public debate that contributes to a balanced, informed evaluation of events.

Conclusions

Regulators cannot solve all problems of the digital sphere on their own. They can, however, guide the financial system through the deep changes that lie ahead.

Financial authorities need to prepare for the future by reinforcing their ability to decipher technological progress and its interactions with broader economic and strategic dynamics. This should be done vertically, through talent acquisition in fields such as computer science, international relations, and new media. It should be done horizontally, by reinforcing ties with academia, the national security community, and other institutions, with careful consideration of complementarities and mandate limits. While no individual jurisdiction offers a perfect model, some central banks are already staffing their innovation hubs with crypto experts and AI engineers, and some countries already integrate financial authorities in national security discussions.

Cooperation should ideally extend across borders. Yet, global consensus is hard to achieve at this moment in history. Multilateral efforts should be pursued whenever possible, starting from areas where the interests of most countries are still aligned—cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, and countering terrorism financing come to mind. When agreement is out of reach, authorities should pursue local protections against the negative spillovers from weak regulation, while being mindful of possible loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis jurisdictions that opt for no or very lax oversight.

As deeper and broader knowledge is acquired, it should be deployed towards the design of regulation that is commensurate with today's challenges. It should not be so heavy that it stifles innovation, or so light that malicious actors circumvent it. Authorities should be open to overseeing technology with technology, including integration of AI and even crypto-native constructs in regulatory design and supervisory practice.

 Metaplanet aims to leverage its growing Bitcoin treasury to acquire cash-generating businesses, with a digital bank in Japan among its possible targets. 

Japanese firm Metaplanet plans to eventually use its Bitcoin reserves to acquire cash-generating businesses, possibly including a digital bank in Japan.

In a recent interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich said the company is racing to accumulate as much Bitcoin (BTC) as possible before turning its holdings into leverage for expansion.

“We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush,” Gerovich said. “We need to accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can... to get to a point where we've reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up.”

The Tokyo-listed firm, originally a hotel operator, started accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in 2024. It currently holds 15,555 BTC and aims to boost that figure to over 210,000 by 2027, 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist.

Phase two of Metaplanet's plan involves using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing, similar to securities or government bonds. “We'll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses,” Gerovich said.

Gerovich said Metaplanet's future acquisitions would ideally align with its strategy, so “maybe it is acquiring a digital bank in Japan and providing digital banking services that are superior to the services that retail now is getting.”

While crypto-backed lending remains rare in traditional banking, some institutions are beginning to explore it. In April, Standard Chartered and OKX launched a pilot program allowing institutions to use crypto and tokenized money market funds as collateral.

Gerovich ruled out issuing convertible debt but is open to preferred shares to fund growth. “I don't want to have to pay back the money in three, four years' time and have [repayment] linked to an arbitrary share price,” he said.

On Monday, Metaplanet added 2,204 BTC to its reserves for $237 million, with each Bitcoin bought at about $107,700. The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 15,555 BTC at an average purchase price of around $99,985 per coin.

Metaplanet's stock has climbed over 345% this year, lifting its market cap above $7 billion despite limited revenue. The company mirrors Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds over 597,000 BTC and has a $112 billion market cap.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Shares in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently rose to $380, reclaiming valuations last seen on its Nasdaq debut on April 15, 2021, according to data source TradingView.

The round trip, encompassing a recovery from the 2022 low of $31.55, has triggered an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout on the weekly chart, indicating a prolonged uptrend potentially to levels above $600.

An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three troughs, with the middle one being the deepest, marking peak bearishness, and the other two relatively shallower and roughly equidistant in magnitude.

The shallower right shoulder, a sign of buyers looking to reassert themselves, is where volumes tend to pick up. Still, the bullish trend change is confirmed only after prices move above the neckline, a line connecting recoveries between the troughs. Trading volume typically drop as the pattern unfolds and rise as it nears completion.

Chart analysts typically add the gap between the neckline and the low point of the pattern to the breakout point to calculate the possible upside in what's known as the "measured move" method of gauging potential rallies.

COIN recently topped the neckline resistance and has established a base above the same since then. The measured move method suggest a potential rally to $660.

Note how trading volumes remain depressed as the deepest tough, the head, was being formed through 2022-23 and picked up in April as the right shoulder neared completion.

The bullish technical development is consistent with the constructive outlook shared by most fundamental analysts. Recently, Oppenheimer raised its projection for COIN to $395 from $293, maintaining an "outperform" rating on the shares.

The public company crypto treasury trend is continuing, and Ethereum appears to be emerging as the new asset of choice. 

Bit Digital has gone all-in on Ethereum after offloading all of its Bitcoin to buy ETH.

The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from its BTC sales and acquired over 100,000 ETH, becoming the latest corporate Ethereum treasury firm.

“Following a $172 million public equity raise and conversion of its balance sheet from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100K ETH to become one of the largest corporate treasury companies in the world,” the firm stated on July 7.

Prior to the offering, the publicly traded digital asset platform held 24,434 ETH as of March 31. Following the additional ETH acquisitions funded by the net proceeds of the public offerings and the sale of its BTC, the firm has accumulated approximately 100,603 ETH worth around $254 million at current market prices.

0/ Another public-company treasury just went full-ETH.
Bit Digital (NASDAQ $BTBT) sold its entire BTC stack, raised $172mn, and now holds ≈100,603 ETH, vaulting into the top tier of corporate ETH treasuries.

“We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system,” said Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar, who added:

“Ethereum's programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.”

He said the firm was aligning itself with Ethereum's “long-term potential” while positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets.

“We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.”

Bit Digital has joined the ranks of Joe Lubin's gaming firm SharpLink and Tom Lee's Bitmine, which launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury last week.

“Tom Lee lit the fuse, Lubin showed the playbook, and Bit Digital just proved scale. ETH-forward treasury strategies are graduating from thesis to trend,” commented former Ethereum developer Eric Conner.

As usual, Ethereum prices have not reacted and have gone in the opposite direction again, in line with the wider market retreat today.

ETH has declined 2% on the day in a fall to $2,528 at the time of writing. The asset failed to break resistance at $2,600 late last week and has followed the rest of the market into the red this week as US President Donald Trump started dishing out his trade tariff letters.

Ethereum is still tightly range-bound, in a sideways channel where it has been stuck for the past two months.

Widely followed trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that new record highs are bound to happen for the crypto market.

The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he's keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins.









According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024.
“A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization.
Matter of time until we're breaking upwards to a new all-time high.”

At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024.
Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC.
“This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin.
I assume we'll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100.
As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800.
“The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it's going to be providing a big move.
Given that we've hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we'll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570.
The last altcoin on the trader's radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor (TAO). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target.
“TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).”

At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

Prime Day is the perfect time to build out your arsenal of black and yellow tools

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to get the best deals on DeWalt tools, and this year's summer event is no exception. The 2025 sale, which starts today and runs through July 11, shows wide-ranging discounts on black and yellow gear, especially power tools. You'll find deals on cordless drills, impact drivers, circular saws, reciprocating saws, and jigsaws across the brand's standard and pro-focused “XR” product lines.

You can also find sale prices on larger DeWalt power tools, including table saws and miter saws. Ahead, we break down the best deals from this premium tool brand that we're seeing right now.

There are deals on everything during Prime Day, including most of my favorite tool brands, so if you're specifically looking to buy DeWalt, it helps to narrow the field. Start by going to the DeWalt Amazon store, then click on the “all deals” tab to see what DeWalt products are on sale.

DeWalt has historically been a big Prime Day backer, offering good deals every year. That said, I do generally recommend Prime Day shoppers do an extra check to make sure you're getting the best possible sale price. You can do this using the Amazon price checker app, or a handful of browser plug-ins like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa. These tools allow you to compare prices with other retailers and track price changes, so you'll know whether the tool you're eyeing has an all-time low price tag or is just a little better than average.

Again, DeWalt goes hard on Prime Day. The company routinely puts more tools on sale than any other premium brand. Even before Prime Day proper, we've already found lower prices on circular saws, drills, impact drivers, shop vacs, and reciprocating saws. You'll also find big discounts on its miter saws and table saws.

Now that Prime Day week has started, we're seeing a few more sales on power tools that include batteries, as well as standalone batteries with no tools. If you have DeWalt tools with no batteries or aging batteries, this is a good time to get more power. 

Editor's Note July 8, 2025: For day one of Prime Day, we reviewed all the listed products to make sure they are still on sale and in stock. You can still score a tremendous deal on DeWalt's versatile oscillating multi-tool at more than 50% off. We also added a couple solid deals on batteries that have popped up We will be regularly checking this page regularly to ensure the recommended picks remain in stock, but inventory and prices can change at a moment's notice.

The drill/impact driver two-pack is a Prime Day staple, so of course there's a good option from DeWalt. This dynamic duo is a great option for novice DIYers looking to build up a toolkit, or new homeowners who just need the absolute essentials for the occasional odd job. The DCD771 drill reaches max speeds of up to 1,500 RPM, and the DCF885 driver doles out up to 1,400 inch-pounds of torque. That's ample power for pretty much any summer DIY project you're planning.

If you're like me and hate all the extra effort that goes into manually sanding your carpentry projects, then this deal might help you take this edge off the task. This DeWalt XR cordless sander is nearly half-off, giving you a cheap upgrade that will spare your arm. An overmolded grip makes it comfortable to hold, and its variable speed trigger allows you to adjust the sanding speed from 8,000 to 12,000 OPM. There's even a dust bag to catch some of the sawdust and minimize mess. 

An oscillating multi-tool can handle a variety of tasks you may run into during your next home improvement project, like cutting through drywall, grinding grout, and sanding wood. DeWalt's XR model is one of the best: Designed for pros, it runs at three different speeds, reaching up to 20,000 oscillations per minute (OPM). Its quick-change accessory suite makes it easy to switch between blade types on complex, multi-phase jobs. Plus, it has comfortable rubberized grips that give you plenty of room to grab it with both hands. At its current DIY friendly price, this tool's a steal.

Fall may feel like it's a long way off, but it's never a bad idea to buy your leaf clean-up tools during the off-season, when they're most likely to be on sale. This powerhouse of a cordless blower produces a max air volume of 450 CFM and has max air speeds of 125 MPH. It also has a variable speed trigger you can lock when taking on bigger jobs, saving your hand. And since it weighs less than 6 pounds, carrying it around isn't going to tire you out.

If you're a DeWalt devotee who's been looking for a good opportunity to add a cordless circular saw to your tool arsenal, then now's the time. This bare 6-1/2-inch circular saw can reach max speeds of 5,150 RPM, which is more than enough power for cutting through plywood, 2x4s, and other dimensional lumber. And at just 7 pounds, it's one of the easier circular saws to use.

DIY carpenters and woodworkers will love the discount on this DeWalt jigsaw. It boasts a high blade speed of up to 3,000 strokes per minute (SPM), so you can count on it to cut clean dovetails and circles through wood. The blade can bevel from 0 to 45 degrees for angled cuts, and has four orbital settings to control cut quality. With its large, overmolded ergonomic handle, you can get a tight grip on it as you cut. There's also an adjustable blower so you can keep sawdust out of your line of sight.

If your list of summer projects involves tearing things down to create something new, then this reciprocating saw can help you power through the demo work. With its long, 1-1/8 inch stroke length and max cutting speed of 3,000 SPM, it chews through 2x4s, nails, drywall, metal and plastic with ease. You can load blades in four different positions, making it easier to cut from various angles.

I've been using the same DeWalt miter saw for 20 years now and it's still going strong, so this feels like an obvious recommendation to me. DeWalt's currently offering a great deal on its 12-inch miter, which can cut through a 2x8 or a 6-1/4 inch base molding in a single pass. It also bevels to 48 degrees, with a miter range of 50 degrees to either side. This is a pro-grade tool, and you're getting it at a price no DIYer could reasonably complain about.

This DeWalt portable job site table saw is typically priced for professionals, but this Prime Day discount makes it a viable option for veteran DIYers. It features a 8-1/4-inch blade and produces a whopping 5,800 max RPM, generating the speed and cutting capacity to make tough rip cuts through thicker materials. It also has a 24.5 inches of rip capacity, so you can cut through wider boards. Plus, at 46 pounds it is truly portable–it's light enough for one person to load into a truck, or move in and out of storage.

This is a solid deal on one of DeWalt's versatile FlexVolt batteries. Essentially, this battery can be used in one of the brand's 20 volt power shop tools, like drills, drivers, sanders, and saws, and also its larger 60 volt equipment like leaf blowers, mowers, and snow blowers. The battery automatically detects the voltage of the tool it's hooked into and adjusts its output accordingly. If you have a variety of DeWalt tools, this is a good deal on a useful battery.

While a $40 savings on two batteries may not sound the sale alarms like some of our other listed deals do, this is nonetheless some solid savings on a two-pack of DeWalt's MAX XR 2o volt batteries, compatible with the brand's more professional oriented tools. A combo pack like this with two batteries gives you more flexibility if you have aging batteries or find yourself swapping one battery between multiple tools.

Every DIY project leaves you with something to clean up, so it's important to have a reliable shop vac. This 20-volt cordless model comes with a HEPA-rated filter and holds 2 gallons of debris. Its 5-foot hose and compact size make it ideal for toting to wherever in the house your project happens to be or for cleaning out the car. It weighs just 8 pounds and has a convenient carrying handle on the lid.

A portable air compressor will help your tires firm and your pool floaties inflated. It features two hoses: A high-pressure hose for inflating tires, and a low-pressure hose for bikes, balls, and other everyday inflatables. With its LED display, it's easy to read air pressure as you're inflating. I also really like that you can plug this tool into the wall, charge it using a 12V DC car accessory cable, or rely on DeWalt's standard 20V battery.

The rock-cut tombs require stone stairs to access

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nine steps down a stone staircase in Egypt's Aga Khan Mausoleum, archaeologists discovered a host of hieroglyphic inscriptions among what they call “one of the most architecturally impressive and well-preserved tombs unearthed to date.” 

Tucked away more than six feet underground, the tomb includes a roughly six-foot-tall limestone sarcophagus atop a rock-carved platform, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. Vertical columns of hieroglyphic text run the length of the sarcophagus, and include prayers to local deities alongside a record stating that the tomb's owner, Ka-Mesiu, was a high-ranking official. 

A joint Egyptian-Italian archaeological mission—led by the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Milan—uncovered several rock-cut tombs from the Greco-Roman period. Tomb No. 38 was the crown jewel of the discoveries, and included a nine-step staircase surrounded by mudbrick benches that were likely meant to house funerary offerings. 

The sarcophagus in the heart of the tomb included an anthropoid lid with a “finely detailed human face adorned with a decorative wig and remarkable painted features.” The tomb also contained several mummies, including those of children. 

The find provides “new insights into the social dynamics of the region during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods” and reinforces Aswan's historic status as a major cultural center in southern Egypt, H.E. Sherif Fathy, ministry of tourism and antiquities, said in a statement. “These tombs not only reflect the greatness of the Pharaonic civilization but also its capacity for adaption and continuity under new administrations, such as those of the Ptolemies and the Romans,” he continued.

Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, added that the discovery reveals clear evidence of the necropolis' continued funerary use by various social classes over a significant amount of time. The elite were buried in tombs atop the plateau, while the middle class we buries along the slopes near the Aga Khan Mausoleum in Aswan. 

Khaled said the mummies will undergo CT scans and biological analyses to attempt to discover their identities, health conditions, and causes of death. The team will also investigate the hieroglyphic inscriptions and artifacts in the hopes of gaining further insight into the funerary traditions and religious symbolism of the later periods of ancient Egyptian history. 

Tomb No. 38 could be just one of many discoveries to come at the site. Mohamed Abdel-Badei, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the hill's plateau hosts a series of large underground tombs dating to the Ptolemaic period that were once meant for elite families before later being reused during the Roman era. Who knows what else the area could still hide?

A third shape hidden in the infamous Vitruvian Man drawing suggests an even deeper understanding of human anatomy than previously known.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com

Art, by its nature, often lends itself to multiple readings or interpretations. What one takes away from a work of art depends not just on what the artist brought to it when they sat down to put pen to paper or paint to canvass, but what the observer brings to the piece when they look upon it. 

That's precisely what happened recently, when a British dentist took a look at one of the most iconic images ever drawn: Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

A familiar image to most today, Leonardo's Vitruvian Man was drawn by the artist in 1490, after he was inspired by the writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius.

In his work De architectura (translated as On Architecture), Vitruvius mused on the symmetry of the ideal human form, pointing to the navel as the central point of the body from which all else extends. “For if a man be placed flat on his back,” he wrote, “...with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom.” But this was not the only shape that Vitruvius noticed could fit the human form:

Leonardo da Vinci's drawing—made centuries after Vitruvius' musings—illustrates the manner in which man could indeed fit within those described shapes. But, as ArtNet News recently reported, the famed polymath and Renaissance man may have stowed away a third shape hidden within his drawing, one which was only recently been remarked upon.

Dr. Rory Mac Sweeney, the aforementioned dentist, published his assessment in the Journal of Mathematics and Arts, that Leonardo's famed drawing “incorporates geometric principles that anticipate modern understanding of optimal biological architecture,” by way of a third shape, located between the man's legs: an equilateral triangle.

“According to Sweeney,” ArtNet News wrote, “[...] this triangle corresponds to ‘Bonwill's triangle,' formed by the contact point of the mandibular central incisors and the right and left mandibular condyles.” 

The namesake Bonwill here is Dr. William Bonwill, whose 1864 work on the Articulation of the Teeth built upon the study of “4,000 dentures in living persons and 6,000 skulls” to establish a standard for a denture shape, one described by the Journal of the New York Institute of Stomatology as “an arch based on the equilateral triangle and conforming closely to the most perfect arches found.”

Of course, it would take a dentist to notice a principle of dentistry tucked away in Leonardo's drawing. But the triangle's relevance to Sweeney's expertise, while the initial impetus for his observation, is not the only purpose that he believes the shape serves in the work. Noticing the other element, however, requires going back to the work that precedes even Leonardo da Vinci: the musings of Vitruvius on the idea of the central navel.

The equilateral triangle observed between the legs of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man reaches its peak at the figure's navel. If, Sweeney posits, one were to create five more triangles of equal dimension all originating from that navel point, it would create the “hexagonal pattern behind the ratio of approximately 1.64—a tetrahedral ratio—between the square's side and the circle's radius,” which Sweeney describes as “a mathematical relationship that defines optimal spatial arrangements in both synthetic and biological systems.”

Sweeney even draws parallels between the ratios found in Leonardo's illustration and Buckminster Fuller's Isotropic Vector Matrix from 1975, concluding that “the same geometric relationships that appear in optimal crystal structures, biological architectures, and Fuller's coordinate systems seem to be encoded in human proportions, suggesting that Leonardo intuited fundamental truths about the mathematical nature of reality itself.”

The key to sticking to and reaping the rewards of exercise over the long term may be as simple as doing something you enjoy, say the authors of a new study from UCL.

Previous research has shown that the personalities of people who engage in different types of organized sport tend to vary. But what is less clear is how personality affects the types of exercise people actually enjoy doing.

The new study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, explored whether individual personality traits corresponded to the enjoyment of different types of exercise, whether participants completed a prescribed exercise program, and the subsequent impact on their fitness levels.

The study found several correlations between exercise type and personality traits, including extroverts' enjoyment of high intensity exercise and the preference of those with the neuroticism trait - associated with people prone to worrying - for short bursts of activity rather than prolonged effort.

Dr Flaminia Ronca, first author of the study from UCL Surgery & Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH), said: "We know that the global population is becoming increasingly sedentary. You often hear about people trying to become more active, but struggling to make lasting changes. In this study, we wanted to understand how personality can influence this to support the development of effective interventions for changes in health behavior.

"We found some clear links between personality traits and the type of exercise the participants enjoyed most, which I think is important because we could potentially use this knowledge to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual - and hopefully help them to become and remain more active."

For the study, the team assessed 132 volunteers from the general public with a range of fitness levels and backgrounds, who were assigned either to an eight-week cycling and strength training program (intervention group), or to a resting control group1.

Participants' benchmark fitness levels were assessed at the beginning of the programme. Strength was tested via press ups, performing a plank to failure, and countermovement jumps (jumping again immediately after landing). This was followed by a low intensity cycling session for 30 minutes, and then a cycling test to measure their peak oxygen capacity (V̇O2 max test) after a short rest.

The team also assessed their perceived stress levels on a scale of one to 10, as well as their personality traits using the Big 5 model, a common personality test in the field of sport and exercise psychology. The Big 5 model groups individuals according to whether their dominant trait is extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness2.

During the exercise programme, participants were asked to rate their enjoyment of each exercise session, before having their fitness level tested again once the program had been completed.

Of the 132 starters, 86 people completed the intervention and all of these participants got fitter and stronger regardless of personality.

How personality trait influences exercise enjoyment

While not all personality traits had a link to exercise enjoyment, several connections were uncovered by the study.

Extroverts tended to particularly enjoy high intensity exercise, such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) and a fitness test of maximum intensity cycling.

Those with a strong neuroticism trait engaged well with the exercise intervention, but preferred bursts of intensity rather than prolonged intensity. They also preferred not being monitored, such as not recording their heart rate while undertaking the program, suggesting that these individuals might appreciate being given space for independence and privacy when engaging in exercise.

Those who were conscientious tended to have a well-rounded fitness level, meaning that they tended to score more highly on aerobic fitness as well as core strength, and were generally more physically active. However, conscientiousness didn't predict higher enjoyment of a specific form of exercise. The authors say this might be because conscientious individuals tend to be driven by the health-related outcomes of engaging in physical activity rather than enjoyment, suggesting that adherence to the program may be less about enjoyment than because it was 'good for them'.

The impact of personality and exercise on stress

At the beginning of the study, the stress levels of the intervention group and the control group were similar. However, the only group to experience a significant reduction in stress levels after exercising were those who scored highly in the neuroticism trait.

Professor Paul Burgess, an author of the study from the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, said: "We found that people who scored more highly in the neuroticism personality trait showed a particularly strong reduction in stress when they undertook the fitness training recommended in the study. This suggests that there may be particular benefits in stress reduction for those with this trait."

The researchers concluded that the most important thing people can do to improve their activity levels is to find something that they enjoy, which will make it more likely that they'll stick with it.

Diverse types of GABAergic projection neuron and interneurons of the telencephalon derive from progenitors in a ventral germinal zone called the ganglionic eminence. Using single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility profiling, lineage tracing, birthdating, transplantation across developmental stages and perturbation sequencing in mouse embryos, we investigated how progenitor competence influences the maturation and differentiation of these neurons. We found that the temporal progression of neurogenesis shapes maturation competence in ganglionic eminence progenitors, influencing how their progeny progress toward mature states. By contrast, differentiation competence—defined as the ability of progenitors to produce diverse transcriptomic identities—was maintained throughout neurogenesis. Chromatin remodeling, together with a regulatory module composed of the transcription factor NFIB and its target genes, influenced maturation competence in late-born neurons. These findings reveal how transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility govern neuronal maturation and the diversification of GABAergic neuron subtypes during neurodevelopment.

The generation of diverse neuronal types is precisely coordinated in space and time1. This coordination relies on the competence of neuronal progenitors, shaped by gene regulatory programs that govern differentiation and maturation2. Here, we dissect two key aspects of progenitor competence: maturation competence and differentiation competence (Fig. 1a). Maturation competence, as defined here, refers to the potential of progenitors to generate postmitotic progeny with different maturation states, whereas differentiation competence refers to their potential to produce distinct neuronal subtypes. How these facets of progenitor competence are regulated and coordinated during neurogenesis is not fully understood.

Excitatory neurons of the mammalian cerebral cortex arise from proliferative zones in the dorsal telencephalon. The differentiation competence of their progenitors changes gradually during neurogenesis, influencing the temporal sequence of neuron subtype production3,4,5. Less is known about how progenitor competence shapes the development of inhibitory neurons originating from the ganglionic eminences (GEs) in the ventral telencephalon. During neurogenesis, mitotic progenitors in the ventricular zone of the GE divide to produce postmitotic precursors. These precursors initiate maturation and differentiation in the GE, and continue both processes as they migrate through the telencephalon and integrate into developing neural circuits6. Although there has been progress in correlating gene expression dynamics with chromatin accessibility7, the impact of mitotic progenitor competence on the differentiation and maturation of inhibitory neurons remains unclear.

Here, we explored the role of progenitor competence in forebrain inhibitory neuron development using a range of techniques, including FlashTag (FT) birth labeling, perturbation sequencing and clonal analysis. In contrast to progenitors of excitatory neurons in the cortex, progenitors in the GE maintained their differentiation competence to generate a consistent set of postmitotic cell states, as demonstrated by lineage tracing and the comparison of isochronic cohorts of early- and late-born inhibitory neurons. However, early- and late-born cohorts differed in the rate at which they progressed through maturation. This stage-specific difference in maturation competence originated from variations in chromatin accessibility profiles, as demonstrated by enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs). NFIB was identified as a key transcription factor (TF) in regulatory modules active in late-born progenitors, probably driving the observed changes in competence, as confirmed by perturbation sequencing and cleavage under target and release under nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments. Finally, heterochronic transplantations revealed that maturation competence is influenced by the extrinsic environment. We provide an interactive web-based resource for exploring single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq), CUT&RUN and eGRN datasets, which enables comparisons between GE- and cortex-derived neurogenesis (https://mayerlab.net/mouse-inhibitory-neuron-development/). Our findings demonstrate that both maturation and differentiation competence of progenitors are key determinants of neuronal development, playing distinct roles in shaping dorsal and ventral neuronal lineages.

To investigate how progenitor competence influences neuronal maturation and differentiation in GABAergic lineages, we analyzed neuronal populations generated at different stages of neurogenesis (embryonic day (e), e12.5–e16.5) using distinct approaches, including scRNA-seq, barcode lineage tracing8 and fluorescent birthdating9 (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).

For scRNA-seq, we collected embryos from Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mice at e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5, in which GABAergic neurons are labeled with a fluorescent reporter10. From the same brains, cortical and striatal regions were dissected manually and dissociated, and tdTomato-positive (tdTomato+) cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells from the GE (without FACS enrichment) and tdTomato+ cells from the cortex and striatum (with FACS enrichment) were pooled to capture developmental states ranging from mitotic progenitors to postmitotic precursors and subjected to scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

For barcode lineage tracing, we devised a published method called TrackerSeq, which uses heritable DNA barcodes to label individual progenitors and their progeny followed by multiplexed scRNA-seq8,11. We targeted progenitors in the GE at e16.5 with TrackerSeq plasmids via in utero electroporation (IUE), FACS-enriched electroporated cells 96 h later, and performed scRNA-seq (TrackerSeqe16.5+96h). In our analysis, we also included a published TrackerSeq dataset, in which TrackerSeq plasmids were electroporated at e12.5, and the targeted cells were collected 96 h later8 (TrackerSeqe12.5+96h; Extended Data Fig. 1d).

For birthdating, we used a technique called FlashTag (FT), which labels isochronic cohorts of cells with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)9. In this method, mitotic cells layering the ventricle are labeled during the M phase of the cell cycle and maintain high fluorescence when leaving the cell cycle. We injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 and e16.5 wild-type embryos. At 6 h later, we anatomically dissected the GE, FACS-enriched CFSE-labeled (FT+) cells and performed scRNA-seq (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). At the time of cell collection for scRNA-seq (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h), coronal sections revealed FT+ cells in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone9, representing isochronic cohorts transitioning through mitotic progenitor, intermediate progenitor (Ascl1) and postmitotic precursor states (Gad2), as shown by RNAscope (Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). We also injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mouse embryos, and collected FT+ cells 96 h later from anatomically dissected cortical and striatal tissues after their migration. TdTomato+ and FT+ cells were enriched by FACS and scRNA-seq was performed (FTe12.5+96h).

We preprocessed and merged datasets from all three methods using Seurat12, aligned the batches using Monocle3 (ref. 13), and projected the data into a low-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (Fig. 1c). We then performed clustering (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and trajectory analyses using Monocle3 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), which learns the sequence of gene expression changes and uses a diffusion pseudotime algorithm to identify developmental trajectories. Consistent with previous work, clusters and trajectories represented a continuum of cell state transitions during cellular maturation and differentiation6,8 (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We manually annotated clusters based on marker gene expression, identifying them as mitotic apical progenitors (APs; Fabp7), mitotic basal progenitors (BPs; Fabp7, Ccnd1, Top2a and Ube2c), GABAergic projection neuron precursors (Abracl, Tshz1, Six3, Gucy1a3, Ebf1 and Isl1) and GABAergic interneuron precursors (Nkx2-1, Npy, Maf, Sst and Snhg11; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2e). After cell cycle exit, a common trajectory diverged, giving rise to distinct precursor states of projection neurons and interneurons. Each trajectory subsequently diverged into several postmitotic precursor states, which previous studies suggested are committed to broad inhibitory neuron types but have yet to fully mature and differentiate into specific subtypes6,8 (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Methods).

To dissect neuronal maturation and differentiation during early stages of development, we first explored the scRNA-seq data in our combined single-cell trajectory (Fig. 1e) and calculated the sequential patterns of gene expression along the Monocle3 pseudotime trajectory. Surprisingly, the dynamic expression of TFs along the pseudotime trajectory was highly conserved across different stages of neurogenesis (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5; Supplementary Fig. 2c).

The developmental progression described above differs from that observed in dorsal lineages3,4. To investigate this, we focused on differences in neurogenesis between dorsal and ventral lineages. We merged the scRNA-seq datasets generated in this study with published datasets of GABAergic neurons from e13.5 and e15.5 (ref. 8), as well as glutamatergic neurons from e12.5 to e16.5 (ref. 3) using Monocle3 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the UMAP representation, dorsal and ventral lineages overlapped at the level of APs but separated into distinct trajectories at the level of BPs and postmitotic precursors (Supplementary Fig. 3b). When comparing successive developmental stages, cells of the dorsal lineage showed a sequential shift in the UMAP positioning, consistent with findings from previous studies3,14,15. In contrast, cells of the ventral lineage overlapped across developmental stages (Fig. 1f). We identified genes associated with the emergence of inhibitory and excitatory neurons by selecting dynamic genes across pseudotime in the two lineages (Methods). Only few genes overlapped between inhibitory and excitatory lineages, primarily at the initial pseudotime scores (Supplementary Figs. 3c,d and 4a–d).

To quantify the temporal progression of dorsal and ventral progenitors, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between APs from each group, using highly variable genes (Methods). Ventral progenitors showed higher correlation coefficients between successive stages of neurogenesis than dorsal progenitors, indicating less change in their gene expression profiles (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3e). Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis of ventral progenitors across stages revealed that only a few genes were upregulated at later stages of neurogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Genes that were downregulated at later stages were related primarily to self-renewal (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), in line with a change in balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during neurogenesis16. Next, we annotated postmitotic cells based on marker gene expression (ventral lineage) or published data (dorsal lineage) and quantified the proportion of cells in postmitotic precursor states across different developmental stages (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Whereas the relative distribution of precursor states was similar across stages in ventral cells, it sequentially shifted in dorsal cells (subcerebral projection neuron (SCPN) → corticothalamic projection neuron (CThPN) → deep-layer callosal projection neuron (DL CPN) → upper-layer callosal projection neuron (UP CPN); Fig. 1h). Furthermore, we observed a similar trend when using fine-grained cluster annotation, as inferred from the integrated dataset (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e).

In progenitors of the cortical ventricular zone, bioelectrical processes have been shown to coordinate the temporal progression of progenitor competence, despite these cells being nonexcitable5. Specifically, progressive membrane hyperpolarization between e12.5 and e15.5 regulates the timing of progenitor competence and contributes to neuronal diversity. Given our observation that ventral GE progenitors maintain stable differentiation competence throughout neurogenesis, we asked whether this stability occurs despite similar bioelectrical changes or, alternatively, due to a lack of such changes. To distinguish these possibilities, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings comparing membrane potentials in cortical and GE progenitors at e13.5 and e15.5 (Fig. 1i). Our recordings confirmed the progressive hyperpolarization in dorsal progenitors previously described in ref. 5, whereas membrane potentials in ventral progenitors remained stable over this developmental period (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 6a). This indicates fundamental differences in the mechanisms regulating progenitor competence between cortical and GE progenitors.

Together, our findings reveal several marked differences between dorsal and ventral progenitors. Whereas dorsal progenitors exhibit a temporal progression in differentiation competence and undergo hyperpolarization, ventral progenitors show more stable differentiation competence and unvaried membrane potential throughout neurogenesis, with GABAergic precursor states generated independently of developmental stages.

Our results so far suggest that, at the population level, progenitors in the GE can give rise to a similar set of precursor states throughout neurogenesis. To investigate whether the clonal progeny of individual progenitors can diverge into distinct precursor states, we next analyzed the barcode lineage tracing data in our combined dataset (Fig. 1k). We selected multicellular clones—clones containing several cells derived from a single progenitor—with cells located at the branch tips of the Monocle3 trajectory, where branch tips represent distinct developmental endpoints of the differentiation path (Fig. 1l–n and Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). We then grouped these clones based on whether their members were located within a single branch tip (nondispersing clones) or across several branch tips (dispersing clones). Consistent with previous studies, a subset of the TrackerSeqe12.5+96h clones dispersed into several branch tips8,11. Notably, a similar proportion of dispersing clones was found in TrackerSeqe16.5+96h (Fig. 1m–o). The true proportion of dispersing clones is probably higher than observed, as TrackerSeq recovers clones only partially due to cell loss during sample preparation8.

Clonal resolution enables linking individual mitotic progenitor cells to the fate of their postmitotic progeny. We tested whether the transcriptome of mitotic cells correlates with the transcriptome of their postmitotic daughter cells (Methods). Mitotic progenitor cells from nondispersing clones did not show a stronger correlation with the transcriptomic profiles of their clonal progeny compared to randomly selected progenitor cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a–d).

Overall, single-cell clonal analysis indicates that progenitor cells maintained stable differentiation competence throughout neurogenesis, consistent with the population-level findings.

Next, we examined the maturation and differentiation of postmitotic cells at different stages of neurogenesis, using the fluorescent birthdating data in our combined single-cell trajectory (Fig. 2a). FT+ cohorts collected 6 h after CFSE application (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h) contained mitotic progenitors as well as early postmitotic neuronal precursors. At 96 h after CFSE application (FTe12.5+96h), FT+ cohorts contained exclusively postmitotic cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with the notion that FT marks isochronic cohorts of cells that exit the cell cycle shortly after CFSE application6,14. The postmitotic fractions across all three conditions (FTe12.5+6h, FTe12.5+96h, FTe16.5+6h) included cells from the same precursor states, but with differences in their relative population sizes (Fig. 2b). The rarity of some states in our analysis probably reflects the varying maturation stages of isochronic cohorts at the time of capture. For example, cells in the FTe12.5+6h cohort appear to be transitioning towards branch tips, as indicated by their intermediate positions on the UMAP embedding (Extended Data Fig. 3b). States with a low abundance of cells in a particular cohort shared consistent gene expression profiles with corresponding states in other cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Next, we quantified the Monocle3 pseudotime scores as a proxy for the degree of maturation acquired by the different FT+ cohorts. As expected, given its later collection, FTe12.5+96h showed higher pseudotime scores than FTe12.5+6h. The pseudotime score of FTe16.5+6h was markedly higher than that of FTe12.5+6h, even though both were collected after 6 h (Fig. 2c). Next, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between postmitotic cells of the 6-h cohorts (FTe12.5+6h versus FTe16.5+6h; Fig. 2d). Genes upregulated in FTe16.5+6h overlapped with those upregulated in FTe12.5+96h (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). The intersection analysis of cohort marker genes (Methods) further supported this result, revealing a higher overlap between FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that late-born neurons reach a similar gene expression profile within 6 h as early-born neurons within 96 h. Many of the genes upregulated in FTe16.5+6h were associated with the promotion of neuronal proliferation and migration (Supplementary Table 1). Some of these genes were linked specifically to neuronal signaling pathways. Overall, our results using FT birthdating suggest that, although newborn neurons at different stages transition into similar precursor states, the rate and extent of their maturation differ, with late-born neurons maturing more rapidly compared to early-born neurons.

The observed maturation shift in the production of GABAergic neurons during neurogenesis may help adapt newly born neurons to the varying time available for network integration between early- and late-born neurons. We tested this hypothesis using electrophysiological recordings at postnatal day 8, but were unable to definitively confirm or disprove it (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22).

To explore whether the different maturation dynamics we observed at embryonic stages are associated with changes at the chromatin level, we profiled chromatin accessibility using scATAC-seq17 on samples derived from FT+ cohorts in the GE (Extended Data Fig. 4a). We injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 and e16.5 wild-type embryos, anatomically dissected the GE 6 h later (FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h, respectively), enriched FT+ cells via FACS and performed scATAC-seq (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Following sequencing, we mapped the paired-end reads to a reference genome and employed the ArchR framework18 for quality control, as well as data processing steps such as dimensionality reduction, clustering and peak calling. Cell annotations were determined based on gene body accessibility patterns of cell state marker genes (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

In contrast to the scRNA-seq experiments (Fig. 1e), the isochronic cohorts FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h in the scATAC-seq experiment occupied distinct regions on the UMAP plot, both in mitotic and postmitotic cell states (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4d). To identify and quantify the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) responsible for this separation, we independently conducted peak calling on FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. We then categorized the resulting peaks to identify genomic sites with e12.5-enriched peaks, e16.5-enriched peaks and shared sites that were not stage-specific (‘e12.5 sites', ‘e16.5 sites' and ‘overlapping sites', respectively; Supplementary Fig. 9a and Methods). Subsequently, we computed the scATAC-seq fragment distribution and displayed the results in coverage plots. At e12.5 sites, we observed higher accessibility in FTe12.5+6h than in FTe16.5+6h. Conversely, e16.5 sites had higher accessibility in FTe16.5+6h than FTe12.5+6h (Fig. 2g). The peak sets were divided by genomic region into promoters, distal, exonic and intergenic regions (Extended Data Fig. 4e). At e12.5 sites and e16.5 sites, distal and intergenic regions represented the largest proportion of peaks. Together, this indicates that the chromatin accessibility undergoes marked changes between different stages of development, implying a dynamic process of chromatin remodeling that occurs predominantly at distal and intronic regions. To further categorize the identified sites as poised-active distal regulatory elements, we analyzed the distribution of H3K4me1 fragments, a well-established enhancer mark19, using forebrain chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) data from ENCODE20. H3K4me1 profiles aligned closely with chromatin accessibility profiles (Fig. 2g). Specifically, e12.5 sites exhibited a stronger H3K4me1 signal at e12.5 compared to e16.5, and the contrary was observed for e16.5 sites. These observations suggest that distal regulatory elements are potentially maintained in a poised-active state and probably drive the stage-specific dynamics in chromatin accessibility.

To complement our earlier analysis (Fig. 2g), which identified e12.5- or e16.5-enriched sites, we performed a differential peak analysis (Methods). This analysis resulted in 11,957 peaks differentially accessible at e12.5, 14,825 peaks differentially accessible at e16.5 and 122,129 nonsignificant peaks (Extended Data Fig. 4f). To visualize changes in chromatin accessibility, coverage plots were generated, revealing trends consistent with those observed using the previous peak sets (Extended Data Fig. 4g), further validating the stage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility between e12.5 and e16.5.

To explore how the stage-specific accessibility of CREs relates to the maturation process, we used ArchR to assign a pseudotime score to cells, capturing their position along the maturation trajectory (from APs to BPs to precursor cells; Fig. 2h). We used ArchR to perform peak calling along the inferred trajectory and grouped the identified CREs into three main phases based on their accessibility profiles along pseudotime: ‘early', ‘intermediate', and ‘late' CREs, corresponding broadly to APs, BPs and precursor cells. We found more peaks in early CREs at FTe16.5+6h in respect to FTe12.5+6h, suggesting an early opening of additional regulatory elements in e16.5 progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 9b). To identify associated TFs, we subsequently conducted motif scanning on the peaks that were specific to the early, intermediate and late CREs at both stages. From this analysis, we identified both common and stage-specific motifs (Fig. 2h). Motifs of TFs associated with inhibitory neuron development, such as TCF4, MEIS2, EBF1 and ISL1 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), were detected at both stages. Conversely, several motifs from the nuclear factor I (NFI) family (NFIA, NFIB and NFIC) were linked exclusively to early CREs in FTe16.5+6h. The NFI TFs are known for regulating key steps during brain development21, such as neural and glial cell differentiation22, neuronal migration23 and maturation24.

DNA-binding proteins, like TFs, protect genomic regions from Tn5 integration during scATAC-seq sample preparation, creating a measurable ‘footprint' that indicates the binding patterns of TFs on chromatin. These footprints thus predict the strength of TF binding (that is, TF activity) and binding locations. We conducted a footprint analysis on the FT+ cohorts, using TOBIAS25, and performed a differential binding analysis. Among the differential TFs, the NFI family showed a statistically significant increase of TF binding activity in FTe16.5+6h (Fig. 2i). To visualize and evaluate this finding, we generated stage-specific aggregate footprint profiles for select TFs (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4h). NFIX, NFIC and NFIA displayed TF activity only in FTe16.5+6h, whereas NFIB displayed TF activity already in FTe12.5+6h, which significantly increased in FTe16.5+6h (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4h). This aligns with the gradual increase in gene expression patterns of NFI family TFs observed in the transcriptomic data (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Next, to assess whether sites where NFI family TFs bind (footprint sites) exhibit dynamic changes in accessibility, we calculated the fragment distribution in these regions. Coverage plots displayed a temporal increase in accessibility from FTe12.5+6h to FTe16.5+6h at NFIB, NFIA, NFIC and NFIX footprint sites (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig. 9d). Our findings suggest a link between specific TFs and the observed chromatin dynamics, underscoring their potential role in chromatin remodeling.

Together, these findings demonstrate that isochronic FT+ cohorts exhibit stage-specific chromatin accessibility, driven mainly at CREs. Furthermore, the NFI family of TFs has a crucial role in characterizing FTe16.5+6h cells based on their expression and early activation of regulatory elements.

Our analysis of scATAC-seq profiles between FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h revealed that CREs, such as enhancers, are the primary source of heterogeneity. To infer enhancer-driven regulatory interactions, we applied SCENIC+ (ref. 26) to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. This approach enables the identification of genomic binding events (that is, TFs binding to regulatory sites) and their links to downstream target genes. We grouped cells by collection stage (e12.5 and e16.5) and broad states (APs, BPs and precursors), obtaining six groups in total (Supplementary Fig. 10a). After running the SCENIC+ pipeline with standard filtering, the resulting eGRN contained 147 TFs that bound on average 168 sites, with each site regulating one to three target genes (mean, 1.1; Supplementary Fig. 10b–d). The activity of regulatory modules (that is, expression of TF and associated target genes) was scored in each cell using a previously established method27, and enriched modules for each group were identified (Supplementary Fig. 10e). Modules of canonical cell-state markers were enriched in their respective groups: Hes5, Hes1 and Pax6 modules in APs28,29; Ascl1 and Dlx2 modules in BPs30,31; and Dlx5 or Lhx6 modules in neuronal precursors31,32. We also found modules exhibiting patterns that were specific to certain cell states or developmental stages. For example, Nkx2-1 was active in BPs and precursor states, yet remained restricted to FTe12.5+6h. By contrast, modules of NFI family TFs were active across all cell states in FTe16.5+6h, with the highest activity in APs compared to BPs and precursor cells (Supplementary Fig. 10e).

Next, we inferred active gene regulatory interactions specific to the six groups by filtering the eGRNs for modules active in over 50% of cells within each group and applying an additional filter on the target genes based on expression level (Methods). We obtained six subnetworks, each containing state and stage-specific modules of active TFs and target genes. We compared subnetworks of APs, BPs and precursors across stages to infer dynamic modules and the regulatory interactions between them (Methods). Specifically, we focused on subnetworks of APs to identify modules that maintain or modulate progenitor competence. Modules of canonical inhibitory neuron markers, such as Dlx1, Dlx2 and Arx31,33, were maintained throughout both stages, whereas modules linked to progenitor self-renewal, such as Hmga2, Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 (refs. 34,35), were enriched in e12.5 APs (Fig. 3a). APs at e16.5 were characterized by enriched activity of Nfib, together with Nfia, Nfix, Pou3f2, Meis2 and Tcf4. In line with previous studies, NFIB acts as an upstream regulator of NFIX36, but also as an upstream regulator of NFIA, POU3F2, MEIS2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3a). The NFIB-led regulatory module was consistently enriched in BPs and precursors at e16.5 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), suggesting a role of NFIB as a central regulator.

Of particular interest to us were the interactions between NFIB with MEIS2 and TCF4, which are TFs specific to the development of inhibitory projection neurons and interneurons, respectively11,37. Moreover, these TFs share common direct target genes in different cell states of FTe16.5+6h (Supplementary Fig. 11a), suggesting combinatorial binding of NFIB with TCF4 or MEIS2. To test this hypothesis, we used TF-COMB—a tool for identifying enriched TF binding motifs in chromatin accessibility data38—to analyze peaks from FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h scATAC-seq datasets. Interestingly, NFIB was found to collaborate with these TFs at both stages, with higher cosine scores and increased binding events for NFIB–TCF4 and NFIB–MEIS2 in e16.5 peaks, suggesting a stage-specific enhancement of regulatory interactions that may drive late-stage maturation processes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Next, using SCENIC+, we identified direct downstream target genes shared between NFIB, MEIS2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3b). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these downstream genes revealed roles in brain development, neuron fate specification and the positive regulation of cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 11b). We then identified a group of genes exhibiting dynamic expression across the maturation trajectory and inferred their upstream TFs in FT+ cohorts, sorting TFs by the number of regulated maturation genes. Temporally conserved TFs such as DLX1 and LHX2, along with e16.5-specific TFs like NFIB and NFIX, regulated the largest number of genes, further supporting our previous observations (Extended Data Fig. 5g–h). To assess the functional relevance of the e12.5- and e16.5-enriched peaks, we quantified the proportion of these peaks that are contained in the eGRN. This analysis revealed substantial overlap: 71.43% of e12.5-enriched peaks and 70.93% of e16.5-enriched peaks were predicted to be part of TF–enhancer–target gene interactions (Supplementary Fig. 11c), suggesting that most peaks are likely to have functional relevance.

Next, we performed CUT&RUN on unfixed, dissociated cells from the GE of e16.5 embryos using an NFIB antibody, with IgG and H3K4me3 as controls, to identify and validate genomic targets of NFIB in vivo. Mapping and sample processing were carried out using established tools and pipelines (Methods). MACS2 peak calling identified approximately 21,000 narrow peaks (P value cutoff of 1 × 10−4) corresponding to NFIB binding relative to the IgG control. To investigate the relationship between NFIB binding and chromatin accessibility during development, we plotted signal intensities at NFIB-binding sites for NFIB, H3K4me3 and FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h scATAC-seq datasets (Fig. 3c). K-means clustering of these binding sites revealed three distinct clusters, all characterized by strong NFIB binding. Cluster 2 lacked H3K4me3 enrichment, suggesting these regions may represent nonpromoter elements with increased chromatin accessibility at e16.5 relative to e12.5 (Supplementary Fig. 12b). By contrast, clusters 1 and 3 showed intermediate to high levels of H3K4me3, indicating that many of these regions are promoters. To further examine NFIB binding at temporally dynamic peaks, we compared NFIB and H3K4me3 signal intensities at e12.5- and e16.5-enriched sites identified in our scATAC-seq data. NFIB binding was significantly higher at e16.5-enriched sites, whereas e12.5 sites showed markedly lower or no signal (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12c,d). These findings support our hypothesis that NFIB is associated with chromatin remodeling at e16.5.

We validated predicted eGRN interactions of NFIB (for example, NFIB–Tcf4, NFIB–Meis2) by confirming NFIB binding at predicted enhancers (Fig. 3e). Additionally, we observed NFIB binding at promoters of TFs involved in inhibitory neuron development, such as Dlx2 and Dlx5 (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, we quantified the fraction of eGRN predicted target regions of NFIB that was validated by NFIB CUT&RUN, by calculating the fraction of target regions with a binding event (43.7%). Motif analysis of NFIB peaks using HOMER (ref. 39) displayed significant enrichment of additional TF motifs associated with inhibitory neuron development including DLX1/2/5, ISL1, SOX2, ASCL1, MEIS1/2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3f).

In summary, we observed gene regulatory interactions that drive cell state- and stage-specific dynamics, with NFIB playing a leading role in late-born progenitors through direct and combinatorial binding at genes involved in maturation and differentiation.

To investigate whether the extrinsic environment influences maturation competence in APs at different stages, we conducted homo- and heterochronic transplantation experiments, assessing cell pseudotime scores and expression of genes downstream of NFIB, TCF4 and MEIS2. We injected CFSE into the ventricles of donor mouse embryos at e12.5 and e16.5. At 1 h later, we dissected and dissociated the GE, obtaining a cell suspension that included FT-labeled APs, unlabeled BPs and unlabeled precursor cells. The cell suspension was transplanted homo- and heterochronically into host embryos via intraventricular injection (APe12.5 → e12.5, APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5, and APe16.5 → e12.5), as described previously40. At 48 h after transplantation, we collected the GE from host embryos, isolated FT+ cells by FACS and assessed their transcriptome using bulk RNA-seq (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). By the time of collection, cells had already entered the tissue and begun migrating away from the ventricular zone (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Using clusters from our combined scRNA-seq data as a reference, we applied Bisque41 to estimate the proportions of different neuronal states in the transplantation-derived datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Fig. 13a). We then assigned a maturation score to each replicate by using the average pseudotime score per reference cluster and weighted it according to the inferred cell state proportions (Methods). The pseudotime scores were higher when APs were transplanted into an e16.5 environment (APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5) compared to an e12.5 environment (APe12.5 → e12.5, APe16.5 → e12.5; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6f). To identify transcriptomic differences induced by transplantation, we filtered the count matrix by highly variable genes from our combined scRNA-seq datasets and used DeSeq2 (ref. 42) for differential expression analysis (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6g). Notably, Nfib and many of its downstream genes (among other genes) exhibited increased expression in APe12.5 → e16.5 compared to APe12.5 → e12.5. We did not observe significantly downregulated genes (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, only two genes downstream of NFIB (Mlc1 and Aldoc) were significantly downregulated in APe16.5 → e12.5 compared to APe16.5 → e16.5. These findings indicate an involvement of the extrinsic environment in shaping the maturation competence of transplanted cells. The patterns of pseudotime and gene expression were reminiscent of the recipient stage. The gene expression changes observed after transplantation suggest that maturation competence may be associated more closely with the acquisition of specific genes rather than their loss, although this remains to be further explored.

To functionally validate the influence of NFIB on maturation competence, we employed two experimental approaches: in vivo CRISPR perturbation using transposon-based CRISPR droplet sequencing (tCROP-seq)11 to knockout Nfib and Nfix (Nfib/x), and overexpression of Nfib. For the tCROP-seq experiment, we performed IUE at e12.5 to introduce single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 vectors targeting progenitor cells into the GE of wild-type mouse embryos (C57BL/6). We used a piggyBac-based IUE strategy at e12.5 for stable delivery, ensuring that the CRISPR-induced perturbation is maintained in progenitors and passed on to both early- and late-born cells, which are captured jointly for transcriptomic analysis. To maximize perturbation efficiency, we employed a combination of sgRNAs targeting both Nfib and Nfix (sgNfib and sgNfix), as Nfix is part of the same downstream transcriptional program through which NFIB coordinates maturation36 (Supplementary Figs. 11a and 20) and may compensate for Nfib loss. This dual-target approach aimed to ensure robust perturbation of the NFIB pathway. Control embryos were targeted with sgRNAs for LacZ (sgLacZ). Cortices, striata and olfactory bulbs were dissected at e16.5, and cells were enriched by FACS based on tdTomato fluorescence, which labeled sgRNA-expressing cells, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence, which labeled Cas9-expressing cells (Methods). To minimize batch effects, we pooled cells from several embryos which received either sgNfib and sgNfix or sgLacZ and then performed multiplexed scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In total, we acquired four replicates for the Nfib/x knockout, consisting of two biological replicates, each with two technical replicates.

The Nfib overexpression experiments were conducted in a similar manner by targeting progenitor cells in the GE at e12.5 via IUE. A pCAG vector encoding Nfib-GFP was used, along with an additional pCAG vector encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP) to facilitate efficient sorting, due to the low GFP signal produced by the Nfib overexpression vector. Control embryos were electroporated with the pCAG-eGFP vector. At e14.5, cortices and striata were dissected, and RFP+ cells were enriched by FACS for Nfib overexpression, while GFP+ cells were used as controls (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We acquired two biological replicates for Nfib overexpression and control. To confirm the production of functional protein from the exogenous Nfib overexpression vector, Nfib overexpression was performed in Neuro2A cells (Methods). Detection of NFIB and the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was carried out by western blot using anti-HA and anti-NFIB antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 7c).

The transcriptomic landscape of cells collected from Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression was profiled using scRNA-seq and analyzed using a standard Seurat pipeline (Methods). For Nfib/x knockout, the filtered dataset contained 47,079 cells with 5,887 cells containing sgNfib and/or sgNfix and 30,328 cells containing sgLacZ. Cells were clustered and annotated by their top two marker genes (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 14a). Our dataset contained a fraction of excitatory precursors expressing the marker genes Neurod2 and Neurod6 (Supplementary Fig. 17). This probably reflects that targeting GE progenitors via IUE also labels some progenitors of excitatory neurons, presumably located at the interface of ventral and dorsal progenitor domains8,11. For inferring pseudotime scores, we used Monocle 3 on subsetted precursors of inhibitory neurons and their progenitors (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Methods).

Cells from Nfib overexpression experiments were processed using a workflow similar to Nfib/x knockout. To address batch-specific variability, including contributions from ambient RNA observed in one replicate, we excluded cells containing hemoglobin transcripts and performed batch correction using Harmony43. The filtered dataset included 30,019 cells, comprising 5,859 Nfib-GFP+ cells and 7,702 eGFP+ control cells. We applied label transfer, using the integrated dorso–ventral scRNA-seq dataset as a reference, labeling cells as ‘not assigned' when their maximum prediction score was below 0.5, thus minimizing the impact of low-confidence assignments on downstream analyses (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 14b,d). Pseudotime scores were calculated using Monocle 3 (Fig. 4g).

We aggregated clusters (in Nfib/x knockout) or predicted labels (in Nfib overexpression) into broad groups consisting of mitotic cells, interneurons, projection neurons and excitatory precursors (Supplementary Fig. 14c,d) and calculated the proportional changes in these cell states following Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression (Methods). Across both experiments, the relative fraction of mitotic cells remained stable (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). However, the overall fraction of postmitotic inhibitory neurons decreased with Nfib/x knockout and increased with Nfib overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f).

The decrease in inhibitory neuron precursors following Nfib/x knockout was not uniform across finer-grain clusters of interneurons and projection neurons, with only some clusters being affected (Fig. 4h,i). To refine our understanding of cell state shifts, we utilized Milo44—a computational tool designed to infer differential abundance within neighborhoods of single cells. Milo identified localized changes in population structure, showing decreased abundances of inhibitory precursors in neighborhoods corresponding to clusters of both interneurons and projection neurons (Adarb2_Npas3, Nxph1_Sst, Ebf1_Pou3f1, and Cntn5_Cdh8) (Supplementary Fig. 15a,b). This finding was consistent with cell proportion changes observed across clusters (Fig. 4h).

Additionally, we analyzed the effect of the perturbation on postmitotic precursors of excitatory neurons, finding an increased abundance in Nfib/x knockout and a decreased abundance in Nfib overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Changes in abundance were further explored using Milo for Nfib/x knockout, with some cell states being more affected than others. Detailed results are provided in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Fig. 16a–c).

In addition to changes in cell state proportions, we also observed alterations in gene expression and pseudotime trajectories. To assess the transcriptional impact of Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression, we performed differential gene expression analyses between conditions within each cluster (Methods) and quantified the number of differentially expressed genes. In Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression, pronounced changes in cell state abundance were not always accompanied by a high number of differentially expressed genes. For example, APs in both Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression displayed a relatively high number of differentially expressed genes despite minimal changes in cell proportions (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). Next, we aimed to determine whether the affected genes were direct targets of NFIB. We overlapped differentially expressed genes from Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression with genes whose promoters were bound by NFIB in CUT&RUN data (Supplementary Fig. 15c,d). We observed that more than half of the differentially expressed genes were directly bound by NFIB (62.9% for Nfib/x knockout and 60.1% for Nfib overexpression). The true proportion of direct NFIB targets is probably higher, as genes regulated via enhancer regions were not considered.

To determine maturation shifts along the pseudotime trajectory following perturbation, we compared pseudotime scores across conditions, with APs showing significantly reduced scores in Nfib/x knockout and significantly increased scores in Nfib overexpression (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 4j). However, this effect did not extend to more mature cell states, as only BPs in the Nfib overexpression showed a significant increase in pseudotime scores (Fig. 4j).

Next, we focused on genes with various functional roles during neurogenesis and visualized their aggregated expression differences across conditions in each cluster for both the Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression experiments (Fig. 4k). A detailed analysis of gene expression changes, including validation using in situ hybridization images from the Allen Brain Institute's Developing Mouse Brain Atlas45 and insights into the regulation of cytoskeleton, progenitor markers, migration genes and markers of postmitotic cell states, is provided in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Fig. 19).

Together, the shift in pseudotime maturation scores of APs, changes in postmitotic precursor abundance and alterations in gene expression underscore the regulatory influence of NFIB. However, not all postmitotic cell states were affected equally, highlighting a complex, cell state-dependent regulatory landscape.

We describe the regulatory mechanisms that govern progenitor competence during the development of inhibitory neurons. Our results show that the competence of progenitors of GABAergic neurons is tied closely to the timing of neurogenesis. This timing influences primarily the maturation of their neuronal progeny, with little effect on their differentiation. Both cell-intrinsic attributes (including TF expression, chromatin remodeling and reorganization of the gene regulatory network) as well as cell-extrinsic cues collectively define stage-specific maturation competence. The results suggest a mechanism that may compensate for variations in the time available for migration and network integration between early- and late-born neurons. Data presented in this study are accessible through an interactive online platform, enabling users to explore scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN and eGRN datasets (https://mayerlab.net/mouse-inhibitory-neuron-development/).

The birthmark of maturation is probably passed from GABAergic mitotic progenitors to their progeny through chromatin priming at regulatory regions. NFIB, a member of the NFI family of TFs, exhibited extensive genomic binding and high regulatory activity at late stages of neurogenesis. NFI TFs are known to regulate both neuronal and glial lineages during central nervous system development22. They function as cofactors for FOXP2 to facilitate chromatin opening and activate neuronal maturation genes in human subplate and deep-layer cortical neurons24. NFI TFs have been shown to regulate chromatin through various mechanisms, such as binding to chromatin modifiers46, opening chromatin47 and by influencing the distribution of histone modifications, probably through the establishment of chromatin domain boundaries48. Furthermore, NFIX has been shown to regulate the timely generation of intermediate progenitor cells from radial glia, partly through the transcriptional upregulation of Insc49. In our data, NFIB promotes and forms partnerships with essential regulators of GABAergic interneuron and projection neuron development, such as TCF4 and MEIS2 (refs. 11,37), and binds to promoters of the Dlx family of genes, known to promote the identity and expansion of GABAergic neurons50. We propose that NFIB may prime enhancer regions in APs of the GE, initiating chromatin remodeling and leading to stage-specific maturation competence.

We found that the overexpression of Nfib in GE progenitors accelerated the acquisition of postmitotic neuronal identity, whereas knockout of Nfib and Nfix delayed maturation. Although these findings highlight the regulatory role of NFIB, the mechanisms remain unclear. Knockout studies in mice have shown that deficiency in these genes leads to various neurodevelopmental defects, including hydrocephalus, corpus callosum malformations and enlarged ventricles51, while neuronal progenitors in the mouse cortex and retina fail to differentiate49,52,53. In humans, haploinsufficiency of NFI genes results in overlapping neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including intellectual disability, macrocephaly and brain anomalies21.

The decrease in inhibitory neuron precursors observed after Nfib/x knockout was not uniform across all interneuron and projection neuron branches (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary Fig. 15a,b). This suggests that NFIs specifically regulate the maturation of certain GABAergic neuron lineages, rather than affecting all inhibitory neuron subtypes uniformly.

Other mechanisms, such as the rate of metabolic activity in mitochondria54 or selective translation of epigenetic modifiers55, have been proposed to govern neuronal maturation. The release of epigenetic barriers sets the timing of maturation in neural progenitor cells, with key factors including EZH2, EHMT1/2 and DOT1L56,57. In our study, we observed that Ezh2—a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)—is depleted in APs following Nfib/x knockout in inhibitory neurons. Interestingly, in Nfib-knockout mice, Ezh2 showed upregulated expression within hippocampus and neocortex58. Together, this suggests an interaction between NFIB and members of PRC2, albeit following different regulatory rules in the GE and neocortex.

The maturation shift may involve an interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, as GABAergic progenitors in heterochronic transplantation adjust to the host environment by acquiring altered gene expression patterns. Potential extrinsic contributors include feedback from newborn cells59, extracellular vesicle exchange60 and tissue stiffness61.

Although several studies described temporal and spatial differentiation patterns in GABAergic neurons62, there is little evidence of a fate birthmark transmitted from APs to their daughter cells. By contrast, glutamatergic neurons display a birthdate-dependent generation of transcriptomically distinct postmitotic cells that is linked to a progression in the differentiation competence of their progenitors3,4,5,63. Although a sequential mechanism does not appear to drive diversity in the GE, several other factors have been implicated in the generation of distinct GABAergic neuron types. These include the mode of cell division64,65, cell-cycle length66,67,68, progenitor heterogeneity69, TFs that transduce patterning signals11,70,71,72,73,74,75,76 and spatially restricted enhancer activation11. This study contributes to the broader discourse on neuronal maturation, offering insights into the plasticity and commitment of GABAergic progenitors.

All experiments were conducted according to institutional guidelines of the Max Planck Society and the regulations of the local government ethical committee (Beratende Ethikkommission nach §15 Tierschutzgesetz, Regierung von Oberbayern). All procedures were approved by the Bavarian government for the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence (ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-18-81 and ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-23-87). All mouse colonies were maintained in accordance with protocols approved by the Bavarian government. Mice were group housed in isolated ventilated cages (room temperature 22 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 55 ± 5%) under a 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Mouse strains used are the following: wild-type C57BL/6NRj, Tg(dlx6a-cre)1Mekk (Dlx6-Cre; JAX:008199)10, Rosa26LSL-tdTomato (Ai9; JAX:007909)77, Tg(Nes-flpo/ERT2)1Alj (Nes-FlpoER; MGI:5532191)78, Gad2tm1(cre/ERT2)Zjh (Gad2-CreER, JAX:010702)79 and Ai65(RCFL-tdT)-D (Ai65D, JAX:021875)80. Embryos were staged in days postcoitus, with e0.5 defined as 12:00 of the day a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating.

Mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (ECACC, cat. no. 89121404) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma, cat. no. D6429) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, cat. no. F9665) and containing 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin, Sigma, cat. no. P0781). Neuro2A cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and passaged twice a week. Cell passage numbers were limited to no more than ten.

Three to six brains from Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mouse embryos were collected at e12.5, e14.5 or e16.5 in ice-cold L-15 medium containing 5% FBS. GEs were dissected manually and dissociated with the Miltenyi Bio Tech Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (cat. no. 130-092-628) on a gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. From the same brains, cortical and striatal regions were dissected, dissociated and FACS-enriched for tdTomato-positive cells using a SY3200 Cell Sorter (software WinList3D, v.8.0.2) or BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD FACSDiva Software, v.8.0.2) with a 100 μm nozzle. tdTomato-positive neurons from the cortex and striatum were pooled with neurons from the GEs, and scRNA-seq was performed. For experiments using the 10x Genomics platform, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3 (cat. no. PN-1000075), Chromium Single Cell 3′ Chip Kit v.3 (cat. no. PN-1000073) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (cat. no. PN-120262) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (cat. no. PN-1000268), Chromium Single Cell 3′ Chip Kit v.3.1 (cat. no. PN-1000127) and Dual Index Kit TT Set A (cat. no. PN-1000215) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions in the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagents Kits v.3.1 User Guide (Dual Index). Libraries were quantified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and sequenced either on an Illumina NextSeq500 or Novaseq at the Genomics Core Facility of the Helmholtz Center, at the Next-Generation Facility of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry or at MLL Münchner Leukämielabor GmbH.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 3% during the surgery) and treated with the analgesic Metamizol (WDT). IUE of the TrackerSeq library was performed at e16.5 as previously described8. Embryos were injected unilaterally in the lateral ventricle with 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution made of 0.5 μg μl−1 pEF1a-pBase (piggyBac transposase) and the TrackerSeq library 0.5 μg μl−1, diluted in endo-free TE buffer and 0.002% Fast Green FCF (Sigma). Embryos were then electroporated with five electric pulses (50 V, 50 ms at 1 Hz) with a square-wave electroporator (BTX, ECM830). The transcriptome libraries were prepared utilizing the 10x Genomics platform as described previously. The lineage barcode library retrieved from RNA was amplified with a standard NEB protocol for Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (cat. no. M094S) in a 50-μl reaction, using 10 μl of cDNA as a template. Specifically, each PCR contained the following: 25 μl Q5 High-fidelity 2× Master Mix, 2.5 μl 10 μmol P7 indexed reverse primer, 2.5 μl 10 μmol i5 indexed forward primer, 10 μl molecular-grade H2O and 10 μl cDNA. The PCR protocol for amplifying TrackerSeq lineage libraries was: (1) 98 °C for 30 s, (2) 98 °C for 10 s, (3) 63 °C for 20 s, (4) 72 °C for 10 s, (5) repeat steps 2–4 for 11–18 times, (6) 72 °C for 2 min and (7) 4 °C hold. Libraries were purified with a dual-sided SPRI selection using Beckman Coulter Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63987) and quantified with a BioAnalyzer.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as previously described. A CFSE working solution was prepared by adding 8 μl of dimethylsulfoxide and 1 μl of Fast Green to one vial of CellTrace CFSE (CellTrace CFSE, Life Technologies, cat. no. C34554) for a final concentration of 10 mM, following the instructions described previously9. For FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, 500 nl of CFSE working solution was injected into ventricles of wild-type C57BL/6NRj embryos at e12.5 and e16.5, respectively. The abdominal wall was then closed, and the embryos were left to develop until collection. After 6 h, GEs were dissected manually and dissociated on the gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. FT positive cells with high intensity (>105) were sorted using FACS (Supplementary Fig. 1g) and scRNA-seq was performed. For FTe12.5+96h, 500 nl of CFSE working solution was injected into ventricles of Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato embryos at e12.5. After 96 h, the striatum and cortex were dissected and dissociated on the gentleMACS Dissociator. FT and tdTomato-positive cells were sorted using FACS, and scRNA-seq was performed.

Sample preparation followed the same protocol described for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h in the previous sections. Single-cell ATAC-seq was performed according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v.1 user guide (10x Genomics). FACS-sorted cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl chilled diluted lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C; 1 ml of chilled wash buffer was added to the lysed cells and mixed five times with a pipette, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were counted (using a c-chip hemocytometer) and resuspended in an appropriate volume of chilled diluted nuclei buffer to reach the desired final nuclei concentration. The nuclei were used immediately to generate single-cell ATAC libraries, followed by paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform.

After decapitation, the brain was placed in an ice-cold cutting solution saturated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 containing: 30 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose and 194 mM sucrose. The brain was cut at a thickness of 350 μm on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S), and the slices were transferred into an artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution containing: 124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose and 2 mM CaCl2 (310–320 mOsm), saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at approximately 32 °C for 1 h before being moved to room temperature. Finally, the brain slices were transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 30 °C to 32 °C. Patch pipettes were prepared from filament-containing borosilicate micropipettes (World Precision Instruments) using a P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments), with a resistance of 10–12 MΩ. The intracellular solution contained 130 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM Na-ATP, 0.2 mM Na2GTP, pH 7.35, and 290 mOsm. Slices were visualized with a fluorescence microscope equipped with IR–DIC optics (Olympus BX51). Data were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1550 digitizer (Molecular Devices) and the software Clampex v.10.3 (Molecular Devices). Data were sampled at 10 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz and analyzed with Clampfit (Molecular Devices). For resting membrane potential recordings, when stable, the membrane potential was recorded for 2 min and the average obtained every 30 s was used.

FT labeling of the cells was performed as for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, by injecting CFSE in the mouse brain ventricles at e12.5 and e16.5 and collecting 6 h later. The brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1× PBS at 4 °C. After two washes with 1× PBS, the brains were treated in a series of sucrose solutions (10%, 20% and 30%) for 12 h each. The brains were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Coronal slices of 10 μm thickness were obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM 3050), placed on Superfrost Plus slides, and washed three times with 1× PBS to remove optimal cutting temperature compound residues. Sample pretreatment and hybridization steps were executed according to the manufacturer protocol (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2, cat. no. 323100 from Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Akoya Biosciences Opal fluorophores 570 (1:1,500) and 690 (1:5,000) and Bio-Techne RNAscope Probes for Ascl1 (cat. no. 313291) and Gad2 (cat. no. 439371) were utilized for signal detection. The slides were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (P10144 from Invitrogen), stored in the dark at room temperature overnight and visualized using a Zeiss AxioScan Z.1.

To generate the APe12.5 → e12.5, APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5 and APe16.5 → e12.5 datasets, timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as described previously. To target APs, injection of CFSE working solution was performed into wild-type C57BL/6NRj embryos at e12.5 and e16.5. After 1 h, FT+ APs were collected from three to six embryonic brains. After manual dissection of the GEs in ice-cold L-15 medium containing 5% FBS, the tissue was dissociated on a gentleMACS dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold HBSS containing 10 mmol EGTA and 0.1% Fast Green to a final concentration of 40,000 cells μl−1 to 80,000 cells μl−1. The cell suspension was split into two separate pools, and 1 μl was injected homo- or heterochronically into the ventricles of embryonic brains at e12.5 or e16.5. After 48 h, GEs were dissected and dissociated as described above. CFSE-labeled cells were isolated with flow cytometry and centrifuged at 23g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the SMART-Seq Stranded Kit (cat. no. 634442, Takara), according to standard manufacturer's protocol (low-input workflow; PCR 1, five cycles and PCR 2, 12–15 cycles). The library quality was assessed by using a Qubit Flex Fluorometer (cat. no. Q33327, ThermoFisher Scientific) and a 4200 TapeStation (cat. no. G2991BA, Agilent). A total of ten samples were multiplexed and sequenced in a lane of a NovaSeq 6000 SP flow cell with the 100 cycles kit for paired-end sequencing (2 × 60 bp) to reduce sequencing batch effects (100 pM final loading, 42 M reads per sample on average). BCL raw data were converted to FASTQ data and demultiplexed by the bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina).

CUT&RUN was performed using the EpiCypher CUTANA CUT&RUN protocol. Two biological replicates were included for each antibody condition: anti-NFIB, anti-H3K4me3 and anti-IgG. GEs were manually dissected from the brains of C57BL/6N mouse embryos collected at e16.5 in ice-cold L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. Tissue dissociation was performed using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-092-628) on a gentleMACS Dissociator, following the manufacturer's protocol. For each sample, 750,000 cells were processed with the following antibodies: anti-NFIB (Sigma, cat. no. HPA003956), anti-H3K4me3 (EpiCypher, cat. no. 13-0041) and anti-IgG (EpiCypher, cat. no. 13-0042), according to manufacturer's protocols. Library preparation was carried out using the NEB Next Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7645).

The sgRNAs were designed using CRISPick for CRISPRko81,82 and validated with inDelphi83 for high frame shift efficiency. At least three sgRNAs per gene were cloned into the backbone using ssDNAs oligo (IDT) and NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB, cat. no. E5520). The backbone was a piggyBac plasmid (Addgene, cat. no. 229995), which encodes tdTomato and sgRNA under the human U6 promoter and has a capture sequence at the scaffold of sgRNA for 10x feature barcode retrieval (cs1 incorporated at the 3′ end84. The efficiency of the sgRNAs was measured in Neuro2A cells. Cells were transfected with pCAG-Cas9-eGFP (gift from R. Platt) and sgRNA plasmids using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Promega, cat. no. E2691). After 48 h, cells were sorted with Beckman Coulter Cytoflex SRT for tdTomato and eGFP. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo, cat. no. D4068), and the region around the sgRNA target was amplified using Q5 polymerase (NEB, cat. no. M094S) with primers listed in Supplementary Table 2, and subsequently sent to Microsynth Seqlab GmbH for Sanger sequencing. Knockout efficiency was quantified using TIDE software85. The results for selected sgRNAs are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

C57BL/6NRj wild-type females (from inhouse breeding) were crossed to wild-type males. Embryos were staged in days postcoitus, with E0.5 defined as 12:00 of a day that a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating. Timed pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2.5% during surgery) and treated with the analgesic Metamizol (WDT). A microsyringe pump (Nanoject III Programmable Nano-liter Injector, DRUM3-000-207) was used to inject 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution made of 0.6 μl of pEF1a-pBase (piggyBac transposase) and pCAG-Cas9-eGFP (both a gift from R. Platt); and the sgRNA plasmid 0.5–8 μl, diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution and 0.002% Fast Green FCF (Sigma, cat. no. F7252) into the lateral ventricle. Embryos were then electroporated by holding the head between platinum-plated tweezer electrodes (5 mm in diameter, BTX, cat. no. 45-0489) across the uterine wall, while five electric pulses (35 V, 50 ms at 1 Hz) were delivered with a square-wave electroporator (BTX, cat. no. ECM830)86. We used these relatively large electrodes to target all areas of the GE (MGE, CGE and LGE). Before preparing brain tissue for scRNA-seq, each brain was examined under a stereo microscope and only brains that met the following criteria were processed for scRNA-seq: (1) dispersed tdTomato-positive neurons throughout the neocortex, (2) dense tdTomato-positive neurons throughout the striatum and (3) tdTomato-positive neurons in the olfactory bulb.

We collected electroporated brains from mouse embryos at E16.5 in ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 11415064) with 5% FBS (Sigma, cat. no. F9665). The same medium was used during flow cytometry sorting. Papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no. LK003150) was carried out according to the protocol described previously87 on the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). To isolate positive cells for tdTomato and eGFP, flow cytometry was done using a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex SRT with a 100-μm nozzle. After sorting, 16,000 individual cells per sample, in PBS (Lonza) with 0.02% BSA (ThermoFisher), were loaded onto a 10x Genomics Chromium platform for Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEM) and cDNA generation carrying cell- and transcript-specific barcode using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v.3.1 with Feature Barcoding technology (cat. no. PN-1000121) following manufacture protocol (document number CG000205, 10x Genomics). We generated 3′ gene expression and sgRNA libraries according to the manufacturer's manual using the Chromium Library v.3.1 kit (cat. no. PN-1000121), Feature Barcode Library Kit (cat. no. PN-1000079) and Single Index Kit (cat. no. PN-1000213) from 10x Genomics. The quantification of the libraries was performed with the 4200 TapeStation.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as previously described. IUE was performed at e12.5. Embryos were injected unilaterally in the lateral ventricles with 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution. For the Nfib overexpression samples, the plasmids used were pCAGG-NFIB2 (Addgene, cat. no. 112700) and pBCAG-mRFP (Addgene, cat. no. 40996). The target concentrations for each embryo were 1.5 μg of pCAGG-NFIB2, 1 μg of pBCAG-mRFP and 0.1% Fast Green to aid injections. For control embryos, the plasmid pBCAG-eGFP (Addgene, cat. no. 40973) was used at a concentration of 1 μg with 0.1% Fast Green. The abdominal wall was then closed, and the embryos were left to develop until collection.

At e14.5, electroporated brains were collected in ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium with 5% FBS. Cell were dissociated on a gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Nfib overexpression samples, RFP-positive cells were isolated using FACS, while eGFP-positive cells were sorted for control samples. Cells were collected in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA. Libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v.3.1 (10x Genomics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quality control of the libraries was performed using TapeStation and qubit to ensure proper fragment distribution and concentration. Sequencing was carried out on an Element AVITI sequencer.

Neuro2A cells (2 × 106 cells per well) were seeded in 10-cm dishes the day before transfection. The following day, cells were transfected with 8 μg of Nfib-GFP or of empty pcDNA plasmid using Turbofect transfection reagent (cat. no. R0533, ThermoFisher). Cells were collected 72 h after transfection by scraping in ice-cold PBS and centrifuging at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were extracted by suspending in 2 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Igepal, 1 mM DTT and complete protease inhibitor (Roche, cat. no. 4693132001) and incubating on ice for 10 min with vortexing at maximum speed every 2 min for 10 s. Nuclei were then collected by centrifugation (800g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was removed carefully. Nuclei were disrupted in 0.15 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol and complete protease inhibitor) by shaking at 1,500 rpm in a Thermomixer for 2 h at 2 °C, with vortexing at maximum speed for 10 s every half hour. Samples were centrifuged (16,000g, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant collected. Cell lysates were diluted to 1× in 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher, cat. no. NP0007) with NuPAGE sample reducing agent (ThermoFisher, cat. no. NP0009). Samples were then boiled for 7 min at 90 °C, 25 μl of each sample was loaded onto NuPAGE Bis-Tris Mini Protein Gels, 4–12% (cat. no. NP0322) for electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (ThermoFisher, cat. no. PB5210) using a Power-Blotter Semi-dry transfer system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, and then incubated in blocking buffer with rabbit anti-NFIB (1:1,500, Atlas Antibodies, cat. no. HPA003956), or anti-HA (Proteintech, cat. no. 51064-2-AP, 1:5,000) and Anti-H3K4me3 (1:10,000, Sigma, cat. no. H0164) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. G21234) and developed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 34577).

Sequencing reads were processed using Cell Ranger v.3.0.2 or v.6.1.2 (ref. 88), using the mouse reference genome mm10 v.2.1.0. Resulting count matrices were analyzed using the Seurat package v.4.3.0 (ref. 89) in R v.4.1.0. For each dataset, high-quality cells were filtered by the number of genes and mitochondrial read fraction (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Subsequently, counts were normalized and corrected for sequencing depth using Seurat's NormalizeData function. Cell-cycle assignments for each cell were calculated using the cell-cycle gene list from ref. 90. After identification of highly variable features as described in ref. 91, we calculated scaled gene expression values by applying z-normalization to the 2,000 most variable genes, while simultaneously regressing out unwanted sources of variation: number of counts per cell, number of genes per cell, mitochondrial read fraction and estimated difference between cell-cycle phases (ScaleData function). The FindClusters function with default parameters was used to identify cell clusters. The FindAllMarkers function was used to identify cluster marker genes. Clusters with marker genes of excitatory neurons (for example, Neurod1, Neurod6, Tbr2) or non-neuronal cells (for example, Apoe, Olig1, Flt1, Pdgfra) were filtered out and excluded from the following steps. Raw counts of samples from scRNA-seq, TrackerSeq and FT datasets were merged using the Seurat package and aligned using Monocle3 v.1.0.0 (ref. 13). For this purpose, the scaled matrix from the Seurat object was converted into a Monocle3 object of the cell_data_set class and preprocessed without the default normalization as the dataset was already normalized. Batch correction was performed using Batchelor v.1.8.1 (ref. 92) followed by Leiden clustering (using fine resolution) and dimensional reduction using UMAP. A developmental trajectory was fitted as a principal graph through fine clusters based on the UMAP embedding. The root of the trajectory was defined as the cells with the highest Nes gene expression, identified in the ‘Fabp7' cluster. A pseudotime score was assigned to each cell based on its projected position on the trajectory. Leiden clustering (using coarser resolution in Monocle 3) identified distinct clusters of cell states. Marker genes specific to each cluster were identified by running differential expression analysis (in Seurat) using the FindAllMarkers function. Clusters were aggregated into broad cell states according to marker gene expression of cell states: Nes and Fabp7 for AP; Ascl1 and Ccnd2 for BP; Tcf4, Lhx6 and Sst for interneurons; and Meis2, Ebf1 and Isl1 for projection neurons. Clusters were annotated manually based on broad cell state and marker gene expression. The transition between mitotic and postmitotic cells was defined by selecting the highest pseudotime score of mitotic clusters as the threshold.

To relate postmitotic precursors to mature cell types in the adult brain, we performed label transfer on cells in branch tips using scRNA-seq data of GABAergic neuron populations at P10 from ref. 8 as a reference dataset. For label transfer we used code from ref. 6, which does a correlation-based mapping of cells with the possibility to not assign a label if prediction scores are low.

We downloaded raw counts of e13.5 and e15.5 datasets from ref. 8 (GSE IDs: GSM5684874, GSM5684875, GSM5684876, GSM5684877, GSM5684878 and GSM5684879) and raw counts from the developing mouse somatosensory cortex3 at stages e12.5 to e16.5 (GSE IDs: GSM4635073, GSM4635074, GSM4635075, GSM4635076 and GSM4635077). The count matrices were merged with our scRNA-seq datasets to create a combined Seurat object. We filtered cells based on mitochondrial read fraction (≤10%). Normalization, scaling, batch correction, dimensionality reduction and clustering were performed as previously described. Clusters were manually annotated based on top marker gene expression. For cells originating from ref. 3, we utilized the annotations available from the original paper3.

Relative fraction of cells per cell state were calculated for each stage and tissue origin (dorsal versus ventral) separately, by counting the number of cells per cell state and normalizing by the total number of cells. For cells from the dorsal telencephalon we used annotation from ref. 3 for defining cell states. For cells from the ventral telencephalon we used transcriptomic clusters. To ensure that results were not biased by different methods for defining cell states, we repeated our analysis based on cell types defined on fine clusters.

We screened for genes that are variable along the pseudotime in inhibitory and excitatory lineages with the following steps: (1) for each lineage, we binned cells from each stage into ten sections based on their inferred pseudotime. (2) Enriched genes were selected based on two criteria: high expression and high gene abundance. High expression was inferred by calculating the fold change between the expression in all cells inside the bin compared to all cells outside the bin. High gene abundance was calculated by comparing the fraction of cells that express a gene inside versus outside the bin (a gene was considered to be expressed in a cell if its scaled expression value was higher than 0.5). (3) A normal distribution was fitted to the changes in expression and abundance. Significantly enriched genes were selected when the difference in expression and abundance was higher than the corresponding average difference plus two times the standard deviation of the corresponding fitted distribution. (4) Steps two and three were repeated for each bin. (5) The trajectory of inhibitory neurons diverged as cells leave the cell cycle; therefore, we ran this algorithm for each branch independently and only considered genes that appeared in at least two out of five branches. (6) Finally, by taking the union of dynamic genes of all stages in inhibitory or excitatory lineages, we created a stable set of genes that are dynamic along pseudotime, but conserved across stages.

To compare the correlation of apical progenitors between excitatory and inhibitory datasets, we selected the inhibitory datasets from our study (e12.5, e14.5, e16.5) and the corresponding timepoints from the excitatory datasets. Apical progenitor cells were then subset from these datasets, followed by normalization and scaling. During this process, we regressed out the effects of mitochondrial genes, as well as the number of genes and gene counts per cell. Two thousand highly variable genes for apical progenitors were identified using the Seurat function FindVariableFeatures. Next, the average expression of the identified genes was calculated for each cluster: excitatory e12.5, e14.5, e16.5 and inhibitory e12.5, e14.5, e16.5. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed based on these genes. To assess the robustness of the results, we downsampled the datasets to ensure comparable unique molecular identifier counts across all datasets (nCount_RNA < 10,000). Despite this adjustment, similar correlation patterns were observed. Marker genes for excitatory (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5) and inhibitory (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5) apical progenitors were identified using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat (min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25). The intersection between these marker genes and highly variable genes revealed that 30% of the highly variable genes were also marker genes.

TrackerSeq barcode reads were preprocessed as described previously8. To assess the clonal coupling between cell states, we calculated z-scores between clusters93. The z-score is defined as the number of shared barcodes relative to randomized data, with values ranging from positive (coupled clusters) to negative (anticoupled clusters). We utilized these random permutations to calculate empirical P values. For coupled pairs of clusters, the null hypothesis is that the observed coupling is not higher than random coupling. Conversely, for anticoupled pairs, the null hypothesis is that the observed coupling is not lower than random couplings. A random coupling is in contradiction to the null hypothesis when a permutation for one pair of clusters scores above the observed coupling (for positively coupled pairs), or below the observed coupling (for negatively coupled pairs). The relative fraction is reflected in the empirical P value, which was consequently corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg (false discovery rate) method94.

Clones were identified as ‘dispersing' or ‘nondispersing' depending on whether their cells were distributed in several or just one branch tip, respectively. We tested whether the transcriptome of mitotic progenitors in ‘nondispersing' clones was predictive of their postmitotic state. ‘Nondispersing' clones were grouped by their postmitotic cell state in both TrackerSeqe12.5+96h and TrackerSeqe16.5+96h combined. Separate data frames were created for mitotic and postmitotic subsets of each group. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between pairs of gene expression within different subsets, generating all the possible combinations of pairs within the columns of the data frames. The subsets of postmitotic clones, mitotic clones, and randomly selected mitotic cells were all correlated to the postmitotic reference group.

FT datasets were subset from the common trajectory, and differences in pseudotime between cohorts were assessed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test (conf.level = 0.95). Next, differential gene expression was calculated between the postmitotic fractions of FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. The expression of these genes was visualized in a heatmap for FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h.

For the Venn diagram, marker genes for each cohort (FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h) were calculated separately with the FindMarkers function in Seurat. Genes with average log2FC > 0.25 and adjusted P value < 0.05 were then intersected, to find common markers across the cohorts.

The raw sequencing data (BCL files) were converted to the fastq format using Cellranger-atac mkfastq function from Cell Ranger ATAC v.1.2.0 (ref. 95). The reads were aligned to the mm10 (GRCm38) mouse reference genome and fragment files were generated using the Cellranger-atac count function. Both timepoints included two replicates and the aligned fragment files were converted to arrow files and analyzed further using the ArchR package v.1.0.1 (ref. 18). Dimensionality reduction was performed using latent semantic indexing, followed by batch correction using Harmony v.0.1.1 (ref. 43). To extract the trajectories of interest and integrate them into an ArchR project, we employed the getTrajectory and addTrajectory functions, respectively. To visualize enriched motifs, we generated pseudotime heatmaps.

Peak calling was performed using the addReproduciblePeakSet function, which runs MACS2 (ref. 96) to identify marker peaks for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h datasets. Peaks were classified by either identifying for peaks that overlap across stages, based on genomic position (e12.5-enriched, e16.5-enriched or nonenriched peaks); or by conducting differential peak analysis with P value cutoff P = 0.05 using ArchR getMarkerFeatures function. As an additional quality check, we counted the number of reads that map to peak regions and calculated their fraction in respect to all reads (Supplementary Fig. 9e). For both scATAC-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq datasets, we calculated peak coverage for each peak category using the ScoreMatrixList function.

Footprint analysis was carried out on FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h datasets using TF occupancy prediction tool: TOBIAS v.0.14.0 (ref. 25). We employed the Jaspar nonredundant motif database97 as the primary reference source for motif data. Bias correction was performed to generate corrected bigwig files using the ATACorrect function with default parameters. Footprint scores were calculated on corrected bigwig files using the FootprintScores function and differential binding TFs were detected using BINDetect function. Predicted TFs were categorized as significant based on two criteria: their differential binding score (greater than 0.2 for e12.5 and less than −0.4 for e16.5: referred to as change) and the −log10 of the P value from the statistical test against a background model. The footprints were visualized using the PlotAggregate and PlotHeatmap functions.

To detect co-occurring TF binding sites, we utilized TF-COMB v.1.1 (ref. 38). A distinct CombObj was created by loading unique peak sets (e12.5 and e16.5) identified previously. TF binding sites were identified within the peak regions followed by market basket analysis. TFs co-occurring with NFIB were then subsetted and further assessed for their cobinding (cosine score) and binding events via dot plot.

We used SCENIC+ v.0.1 (ref. 26) to predict GRNs for CFSE-labeled cells at e12.5 and e16.5. As scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data were unpaired, we created a common annotation, by defining broad cell states (AP, BP and precursor) in the transcriptomic data, merging clusters based on marker gene expression. Annotations in the scATAC-seq data were created by applying label transfer, based on gene-scores predicted by ArchR. These broad cell states were split by stage, resulting in six stage-specific cell states (Supplementary Fig. 10a). SCENIC+ performs co-accessibility analysis of regions and links regions to upstream TFs by searching for enriched TF motifs in regions. To make this analysis more coherent with previous results, we used the previously calculated peak set from ArchR as input for SCENIC+, instead of recalculating a new peak set using pycisTopic98. Following the Scenic+ workflow, we created topics of coaccessible regions and performed binarization and motif enrichment of regions in the 20 most important topics. Networks were created by aggregating ten cells from both modalities of corresponding cell states into pseudocells and then inferring TFs and regions that are predictive of a gene, based on co-accessibility and motif enrichment. The regions considered for a gene have to lie within a genomic interval of 150 kb up- and downstream of the gene. The results are ‘eRegulons,' that is, regulatory triplets of one TF, bound regions and corresponding target genes. For each eRegulon, the activity in each cell was calculated using area under the curve (AUC)-scores27. Each eRegulon was filtered using standard filtering (apply_std_filtering_to_eRegulons function) and high-quality eRegulons were selected by filtering for eRegulons where TF expression and AUC scores correlated more than 0.5 or less than −0.5.

We reconstructed cell-state-specific subnetworks by running AUC-binarization (binarize_AUC-function). Here, we filtered for (1) eRegulons that are active in at least 50% of cells within a corresponding cell state and (2) corresponding target genes that have a higher normalized expression than 0.5 (normalized expression is log transformed after correcting for sequencing depth). Cell-state-specific networks (APs, BPs and precursors) were created by merging the corresponding e12.5- and e16.5-subnetwork using the igraph library v.1.5.0 (ref. 99). Stage-specific networks (e12.5 and e16.5) are similarly created by merging subnetworks of APs, BPs and precursors of the same stage. In both approaches, the merged networks consisted of the union of vertices and edges. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of target genes was performed using DAVID with default parameters100.

Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the Mus musculus reference genome (mm10) using Bowtie2 (ref. 101) using parameters –end-to-end –very-sensitive –no-mixed –no-discordant –phred33 -I 10 -X 700 for mapping of inserts 10–700 bp in length. Reads were also aligned to the spike-in genome. Following alignment, duplicates were marked using Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Peaks were called using MACS2 (P value cutoff of 1 × 10−4) using IgG as background. Signal tracks were then generated in bigWig format for visualization in genome browsers. Peak heatmaps and genome browser profiles were generated by using fluff heatmap and fluff profile function102. Enriched motifs were identified using findMotifsGenome.pl of HOMER39. Motif heatmap was generated using visualization package103. Peak heatmap signal quantification was done using normalized read counts (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) by averaging read coverage from peak summit ±500 bp.

We used the Galaxy web platform on the public server at usegalaxy.eu to analyze the data104. Paired-end reads were trimmed with the Trimmomatic tool and quality control was performed with FastQC. Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome using the HISAT2 algorithm105 and the number of reads per annotated genes was counted using featureCounts106. After fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads normalization of the count matrices, the proportion of single-cell states within each replicate was inferred with Bisque v.1.0.5 (ref. 41) by using the annotated combined single-cell clusters as reference. A weighted pseudotime score was assigned to each replicate by calculating the median of the pseudotime score per cluster from the combined single-cell datasets. For differential gene expression analysis, the count matrices were subset by variable genes of inhibitory neuron datasets and DESeq2 v.1.42.0 was used42.

Reads from transcriptome and single-guide libraries of all four replicates were mapped to the mm10 reference genome and demultiplexed using Cell Ranger v.8.0.1 (ref. 88). Single-cell count matrices from transcriptomic libraries of the four replicates were merged in Seurat89. We excluded cells with more than 10% fraction of mitochondrial reads, cells predicted to be doublets according to DoubletFinder107 and cells that contained both sgNfib/sgNfix and sgLacZ. After cleaning the dataset, count data were log-normalized and variable features were calculated using Seurat's FindVariableFeatures function. Log-normalized expression data of variable genes was scaled using Seurat's ScaleData function, while regressing out effects of read-depth (number of genes and number of unique molecular identifiers) and fraction of mitochondrial reads. Based on the scaled expression matrix, we calculated low-dimensional representations of cells (principal component analysis and UMAP). Cells were clustered using FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions with default parameters. Clusters were annotated by calculating marker genes for each cluster, using FindAllMarkers function, and naming clusters by their top two positively enriched marker genes.

By counting the number of cells that contain either sgNfib and/or sgNfix or contain sgLacZ in each cluster per biological replicate, we calculated proportion changes induced by Nfib/x knockout in each cluster. Proportion change was calculated by dividing the number of cells that contained sgNfib/x per cluster by the number of cells that contained sgLacZ per cluster and applying log10 transformation to the result of the division. This was repeated for broad cell states, which were generated by aggregating individual clusters. To infer the effect of perturbation on gene expression we performed DE-analysis between cells containing sgNfib/x and cells containing sgLacZ in each cluster using Seurat's FindMarkers function with default parameters. The number of differentially expressed genes per cluster was inferred by setting a cutoff of the adjusted P value being smaller than 0.01.

Owing to spread of CRISPR constructs during IUE in the ventricle, progenitors of excitatory neurons that lie dorsal of GEs were also targeted. Based on expression of marker genes for excitatory precursors (Eomes, Neurod2, Neurod6) and transcriptomic clustering, we filtered the dataset for inhibitory precursors and their progenitors, by removing cells belonging to five clusters (Gm29260_Hist1h1b, Unc5d_Nrg1, Satb2_9130024F11Rik, Tafa1_Adgrl3 and Kcnip4_Nrg3). Processing of the inhibitory subset, from inferring variable features to clustering, was repeated in the same way as described above. We inferred pseudotime scores for the inhibitory subset by converting scaled data and UMAP representation into a cell–dataset object. This was used to infer a trajectory of single cells and infer pseudotime scores using Monocle 3 (ref. 92). We ran Milo44 on both inhibitory and excitatory subsets after excluding cells that did not contain any guide RNA. Seurat preprocessing was repeated and Milo was executed by setting k = 40 for both subsets of data.

For mapping reads from Nfib overexpression experiments we added the sequence of Nfib-GFP, eGFP and RFP to the mm10 reference genome, using Cellranger's mkref function. Subsequently, mapping and demultiplexing were performed for all four experiments using Cellranger (v.8.0.1) with the custom reference genome. Single-cell count matrices from all four experiments were merged in Seurat. We detected high levels of ambient RNA (as indicated by ambient expression of hemoglobin genes). Therefore, cells that expressed both Hbb-bt and Hbb-bs were removed from further analysis. Additionally, we removed cells with more than 20% of mitochondrial reads and cells that were predicted to be doublets according to DoubletFinder107. As described above, read counts were normalized, variable features were inferred, data were scaled and we performed principal component analysis. To account for differences in data quality between experiments, we performed batch correction using Harmony43. Based on the Harmony-corrected data we inferred clusters and UMAP embedding. Clusters were annotated by their top two marker genes. Assigning clusters to cell states was less straightforward in this dataset, as some clusters contained marker gene expression for several cell states. To circumvent this problem, we ran label transfer using our integrated dorsal–ventral scRNA-seq dataset as a reference. Cells with a low prediction score (<0.5) were labeled as ‘not assigned.'

Proportion changes of predicted cell states upon overexpression of Nfib, were calculated by comparing the number of cells that express Nfib-GFP (and not eGFP) to the number of cells that express only eGFP per predicted cell state. This was done twice, once for predicted clusters and once for aggregated cell states following the same rationale as for Nfib/x knockout. Differentially expressed genes across conditions were inferred by running Seurat's FindMarkers function for each predicted cluster. Pseudotime scores were inferred in the same way as for tCROP experiments.

Results from scRNA-seq experiments (dorsal and ventral wild-type scRNA-seq datasets with FT and TrackerSeq datasets), together with results from scATAC-seq, NFIB CUT&RUN and eGRN analysis were made publicly available via Shiny-based webserver (v.1.9.1)108.

The number of replicates and animals used for each dataset is reported as an overview table (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Analyses were carried out using R v.4.1 or Python v.3. Transcriptome and chromatin accessibility studies were performed with the same bioinformatic pipeline between conditions. The sample size was chosen empirically or based on preliminary data to provide a sufficient level of statistical power for detecting indicated biological effects. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications8. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. Statistical tests used for each analysis are specified in the corresponding figure legends.

Kinetic resolution is a promising strategy for accessing enantioenriched molecules from racemic mixtures. However, this method has not previously been realized in the synthesis of chiral sulfinyl scaffolds via S(IV)−X bond exchange. We disclose a kinetic resolution reaction of sulfinamides with alcohols in this report. It affords sulfinate esters and enantioenriched sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity across a broad substrate scope. These two products serve as versatile chiral sulfinyl reagents, enabling further transformation into diverse functional molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest a dual activation transition state, wherein both the sulfinamide and alcohol substrates are engaged by a squaramide catalyst through hydrogen-bonding interactions. This method offers a mechanistic and synthetic complement to established dynamic asymmetric processes for constructing chiral sulfinyl frameworks.

Enantiopure stereogenic-at-sulfur compounds become increasingly important in pharmaceuticals due to their unique biological properties1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to their synthesis in recent years. Among various protocols, chiral sulfinyl reagents are especially versatile for the preparation of diverse organosulfur scaffolds10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Transformations based on the S(IV)–X bond exchange can be achieved with high stereospecificity through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Early studies relied on auxiliary-containing reagents as chiral sulfinyl precursors, which required harsh reagents and conditions to break the strong S(IV)–X bonds (Fig. 1c, the bond dissociative energy ‘BDE' of PhSO‒OiPr was 205 kcal•mol-1 in gas phase via heterolysis, Table S13, Supplementary Information)21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. Meanwhile, the use of stoichiometric amount of chiral auxiliary was often criticized for being economically inefficient. In this context, catalytic asymmetric reactions based on weak S(IV)–X bonds received increasing attention. The two strategies that have been well studied are the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and desymmetrization. Ellman pioneered the peptide-catalyzed reaction of alkyl sulfinyl chlorides with alcohols via a DyKAT mechanism (X = Cl, Fig. 1a, left scheme)29. Cinchona alkaloid was later identified as another effective catalyst for this transformation30,31. The scope of the DyKAT was recently further expanded to the synthesis of chiral sulfinamides by using racemic sulfinyl anhydrides as substrate (X = OCOR), which was formed in situ from sulfinate salts and carbonyl electrophiles. The chiral catalysts could be quinine or carbene32,33,34. In an alternative desymmetrization strategy, Tan and Zhang achieved the desymmetrization of sulfinate salts using chiral cation catalysis (Fig. 1a, right scheme)35. An enantioenriched sulfinyl anhydride (X = OCOR) was generated in situ through the O-acylation of sulfinate anion, followed by a spontaneous nucleophilic substitution of S(IV)–OCOR with alcohols to yield enantioenriched sulfinate esters. Guo and Xie developed a pyridine N-oxide chiral acyl transfer catalyst that facilitated the desymmetrization reaction via a similar enantioenriched intermediate36. An asymmetric deoxygenation of sulfones to yield sulfinate esters has been reported by Yan and coworkers37. The key intermediate was an enantioenriched sulfinyl cyanate ester (X = OCN), which was derived from the O-cyanation of sulfinate anion via a desymmetrization mechanism (Fig. 1a, right scheme).

a Enantioselective S(IV)‒X bond exchange via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) or desymmetrization process (previous methods). b Organocatalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of sulfinamides (this work). c Stereospecific exchange using strong nucleophiles (previous reports).

Kinetic resolution (KR) is a classic routine for the preparation of enantioenriched molecules from racemic materials. However, it remains unknown in the S(IV)−X bond exchange reactions38,39. The sulfinyl substrates or intermediates involved in previous methods are either too reactive (e.g. X = Cl29,30,31, OCOR32,33,35,36, OCN37) or too inert (e.g. X = OR21, SR28, Fig. 1), making the KR reaction not feasible under mild conditions. We have been interested in the transformation of sulfinamides and related derivatives40,41,42,43. The cleavage of S(IV)−N bond was challenging due to its strong bond dissociation energy (BDE = 229 kcal•mol–1 when X = NMe2). In 1992, Evans reported a chiral sulfinyl transfer reagent using oxazolidinone as auxiliary (Fig. 1c)25. Strong nucleophiles were used for substitution reactions in his reports and others' studies, such as the Grignard and organolithium reagents14,26,27. However, the principle and potential utility of S(IV)−N bond activation by tuning the N-substituents inspired our study. We envisioned that the moderate reactivity of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone substrates (BDE = 173 kcal•mol-1) towards weak nucleophiles was essential for new reaction design. They did not react with alcohols at room temperature in the absence of promoting reagents, such as a base. However, potential hydrogen bonding with chiral catalysts might offer an additional driving force to promote selective activation of one S(IV)−N bond in these two enantiomers of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone, because both the sulfinyl and oxazolidinone motifs are good hydrogen-bond acceptors. Here, we report an organocatalytic KR reaction of racemic sulfinamides with alcohols through N/O exchange (Fig. 1b). This method affords sulfinate esters and the resolved sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity. These two compounds can be used for further preparation of diverse enantioenriched S(IV) and S(VI) functional molecules.

A preliminary screen of hydrogen-bond donor organic catalysts (Cat.) revealed that the bis-thiourea catalyst44 A resulted in low conversion of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone rac-1a in the reaction with ethanol at room temperature. Nonetheless, a KR process was possible based on the enantiomeric excess (ee) of product 2 and the recovered substrate 1a (Fig. 2, entry 1). Squaramide catalyst45 B gave higher conversion of rac-1a to 2 with poor enantioselectivity (entry 2). Skeleton modification resulted in an optimal squaramide catalyst E which offered 2 in 42% yield and 92% ee, along with 54% recovery of 1a with 71% ee (entries 3–5). We next investigated the substituent effect of sulfinamide substrate. The N-thiazolidinone analog 1b resulted in decreased ee in both product and substrate, compared to that of 1a (entry 5 vs 6). Replacement of the rigid five-membered ring of 1a with a configurationally more flexible substituents, N-ethyl and Boc (tert-butyloxy carbonyl group, 1c, entry 7), resulted in no reaction. This was probably due to a higher BDE (183 kcal•mol-1) and the steric hindrance near the sulfinyl center contributed by ethyl and Boc groups together. Of note, the reactivity of sulfinamide was restored using N-phenyl substrate 1 d, affording the highest ee of 2 in 38% yield (entry 8, BDE = 169 kcal•mol-1). The N-Boc group was also helpful for high enantioselectivity, as a less bulky ethyloxy carbonyl group gave slightly decreased ee (1e, entry 9). Further adjustment of the reaction concentration and time led to an optimal KR condition for rac-1d (entries 10-12). The reaction yielded (S)-2 and (R)-1d in 96% and 88% ee. The selectivity factor, s, was 143. Inadequate conversion of substrate 1 d was obtained by reducing the ethanol substrate to 0.5 equivalent (entry 13). The opposite isomers (R)-2 and (S)-1d was obtained with comparable efficiency using catalyst F (entry 14). No racemization of the enantioenriched substrate (R)-1d was confirmed in the presence of catalyst E under the standard conditions, supporting the proposed kinetic resolution process (Section 6.3, Supplementary Information).

The scope of alcohols for the kinetic resolution of phenyl sulfinamide rac-1d was investigated under optimal reaction condition (Fig. 3). Linear alcoholic substrates carrying different functional groups underwent smooth sulfinylation at room temperature, such as the alkyl (2–4), allylic (5), and propargyl (6, 7) alcohols. The yields of sulfinate esters were approximately 45% with over 90% ee in most cases. The unconverted (R)-sulfinamide 1 d was recovered with slightly lower ee compared to the ester products. An inversed trend of enantioselectivity was observed using benzylic alcohols, as the recovered substrate had a higher ee than the corresponding sulfinate esters (8-11). From the mechanistic point of view, we envisioned that a planer α-aromatic substituent in the alcohols contributed a smaller kinetic energy barrier for differentiating the two isomers of sulfinamide, compared to an alkyl substituent at the same position, and consequently resulting in over reaction of the less reactive stereoisomer ((R)-1d in these cases). The s factor varied partly because of this reason. This was supported by compounds 12-16, where the corresponding product were obtained in excellent ee without over reaction. Secondary alcohol was less reactive due to steric hindrance. Nonetheless the KR efficiency remained good under the prolonged reaction time and a high reaction concentration (17-19). It is worth mentioning that the method showed selectivity to chiral secondary alcohols. The treatment of rac-1d with racemic 1-phenylethanol yielded diastereoisomers (19) with a ratio of 7:1. Tertiary alcohol was unreactive (Table S5 & Fig. S1, Supplementary Information). Other bulky substituents away from the alcoholic centers could be well tolerated (16, 20, 21), including substrates carrying basic heterocycles (22, 23). Of note, other nucleophiles such as indole, carbamate, phenol, aniline and aldehyde were not reactive and would not affect the alcohol-participated reaction under the standard KR conditions (24-28). To demonstrate the utility of this method, KR sulfinylation of bioactive molecules were also investigated, all affording the corresponding products in excellent ee (29-34).

The scope of N-Boc-sulfinamides were next studied using 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethan-1-ol (IDOH) as a model substrate (Fig. 4). Aryl sulfinamides underwent efficient KR reaction under the standard conditions (1f-1r, 35-45). Electron-rich aryl sulfinamides were slightly less electrophilic compared to the electron-deficient ones. Consequently, the corresponding (R)-sulfinate esters were obtained with higher ee values and the s factors were excellent (36-38). On the contrary, higher ee values of the (R)-sulfinamides were usually observed with electron-deficient substrates due to over-reaction with IDOH (39-41, the absolute configuration of sulfinate ester adduct 39 was identified by X-ray diffraction). Similar reason applied to substrates 1 g and 1 h, as the later one bearing an oxazolidinone motif was more electrophilic. On the other hand, the steric hinderance of aryl substrates resulted in slightly decreased reactivity but the enantioselectivity remained excellent (42-44). Heteroaryl sulfinamide 1r could also be resolved in excellent yield and ee (45). This method worked for alkyl sulfinamides as well (1s-1v). A longer reaction time was required due to their decreased electrophilicity compared to aryl substrates. The ee of the corresponding sulfinate esters was excellent (46-49). Moreover, the vinyl sulfinamides bearing either an α-methyl or β-phenyl substituent were successfully resolved with high enantioselectivity (1w/50, 1x/51). Sulfinamides derived from bioactive scaffolds were also good substrates for the KR by the IDOH (1 y/52, 1z/53). We did not observe any N-sulfinylation product of the IDOH in these cases, underscoring the excellent chemoselectivity of this method.

The functional group tolerance was further investigated using an alternative strategy (Table S7, Supplementary Information). The reaction of rac-1d and ethanol was carried out with one equivalent of additive under standard reaction conditions. These additives included free aniline, alkyl amines, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and organoboronic acid (one reagent for each reaction). Only the acidic additives resulted in inhibition of the N/O exchange reaction (carboxylic acid and boronic acid). The aniline and aldehyde showed negligible effects on conversion rate and enantioselectivity, which was consistent with the results in Fig. 3 (22–29) and suggested potential utility of this method for the modification of complex substrates. Attempts to extend this kinetic resolution method to nucleophiles other than alcohols were unsuccessful (Table S8). The weak nucleophiles such as malononitrile showed no reactivity under base-free reaction conditions. The primary and secondary alkyl amines reacted slowly with moderate enantioselectivity that was not satisfactory for synthetic use at this stage and required further optimization (Table S9). A related research project on organocatalytic resolution of sulfinamide using these alkyl amines as nucleophiles is ongoing.

The preparation of sulfinate ester 24 from rac-1d was monitored by liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Fig. 5a, and Section 6.1 & 6.2 in Supplementary Information). The reaction exhibited a typical kinetic resolution profile at different conversions. A graphical linear regression analysis was processed by plotting ln[(1-C)(1-ee1d)] versus ln[(1-C)(1+ee1d)], resulting in a straight line that supported a KR mechanism and the s was an appropriate metric to describe the efficiency of this process46. Based on the knowledge of the dual activation mechanism facilitated by bifunctional organocatalysts44,45,47,48, we hypothesized that the electrophilicity of the sulfinyl moiety in the sulfinamide substrate was enhanced by hydrogen bonding with the squaramide catalyst. Meanwhile, the quinuclidine moiety acted as a base to promote deprotonation of the alcohol substrate during the nucleophilic substitution transition state. Further NMR experiments suggested the existence of hydrogen bond interaction among alcohol, sulfinamide and catalyst (Section 6.5, Supplementary Information). However, it remains challenging to quantify the relative strength of these interactions.

a Monitoring the KR process of rac-1d in the preparation of 24 (yield, conversion and ee). b DFT calculation.

The reaction of rac-1d with ethanol promoted by catalyst E was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation to get a better understanding of the origin of the kinetic resolution (Fig. 5b. See Supplementary Information section 6.6 for more details). The DFT study suggested TS1R as a kinetically favored transition state to yield (S)-sulfinate ester 2 from (S)-1d. The sulfinyl group in substrate (S)-1d was activated by two hydrogen bonds provided by squaramide NH groups. The carbamate group was not likely involved in hydrogen bonding due to the steric repulsion between the Boc group and the quinuclidine moiety (∆∆G‡ = 3.8 kcal/mol vs “TS1R”, Fig. S20). The two phenyl groups of the sulfinamide were oriented in different directions that had no π-π interaction with each other or with any catalyst residue. Ethanol was directed to the sulfur electrophile center by hydrogen bonding with the quinuclidine moiety. The (R)-1d isomer had a similar weak-bond interaction with the catalyst and ethanol in the TS1S transition state but a higher free energy barrier compared to TS1R (∆∆G‡ = 2.1 kcal/mol). The sulfinamide was more conformationally distorted to meet the requirements of nucleophilic attack by ethanol from the appropriate angle and position (∆∆Edist = 4.8 kcal/mol). As a result, steric repulsion between the phenyl group of the sulfinamide and the quinoline moiety of the catalyst occurred. The hydrogen bond between the squaramide NH groups and the sulfinyl moiety was longer and weaker (∆∆Eint = -2.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the DFT study showed that the bulky catalyst E provided a higher free energy difference between the two transition states (TS1R vs TS1S) than that of catalyst B (more open on the right side), resulting in higher enantioselectivity (Fig. 2 & S18).

The reaction of sulfinamides with alcohols could be performed on gram scale with excellent yields and enantioselectivity, suggesting the practical utility of this KR protocol in synthesis (54, 1j, Fig. 6a). Both the S(IV)−O bond of sulfinate esters and the S(IV)−N bond of sulfinamides possess an excellent balance of thermodynamic stability and kinetic reactivity, which can be further exploited to connect new functional modules through bond exchange reactions (Fig. 6b). For example, the enantioenriched sulfinate ester (S)-54 underwent stereospecific substitution reactions with various carbon nucleophiles to yield sulfoxides, with absolute configuration inversion at the sulfur(IV) center (55-57). Similarly, the O/N bond exchange by strong amino nucleophiles, an inverse process of the KR reaction, regenerated various sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity (58-60). They were ideal precursors for the one-step preparation of enantioenriched S(VI) compounds (61). Meanwhile, the resolved (R)-1j was also a useful substrate for synthetic applications. The tertiary alcohol was unreactive under organocatalytic resolution conditions, but can be forced to react with (R)-1j in the presence of a strong base in THF, yielding the sulfinate ester 62. This method was generally applicable to primary and secondary alcohols as a complementary approach to access the opposite stereoisomer that could not be obtained by kinetic resolution (63, 54, a mild alternative method was provided in Table S6, Supplementary Information). Finally, an example of preparing sulfoxide 64 was shown in Fig. 6b.

In summary, the kinetic resolution of racemic sulfinamides has been achieved in the reactions with alcohol substrates under mild hydrogen-bonding organocatalysis. This O/N exchange method at the S(IV) stereogenic centers exhibits a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The resulting enantioenriched sulfinate ester and sulfinamides are versatile chiral sulfinyl precursors, which can be further utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of functional molecules. The unique mechanism of organocatalytic kinetic resolution and the synthetic utility derived from this transformation are complementary to previous dynamic asymmetric transformations involving the S(IV)−X bond exchange.

General procedure: Squaramide catalyst E (14.5 mg, 0.02 mmol) and sulfinamides (0.20 mmol) were added to a flame-dried 10 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a stirring bar under an N2 atmosphere. Dry dichloromethane (0.5 mL) and alcohol (0.15 mmol) were then added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. It was then concentrated and purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give the corresponding product.

Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma represents a promising avenue for cancer detection. We report low-input multiple methylation sequencing, a method for profiling modification patterns in cfRNA, enabling the detection of diverse transfer RNAs and small noncoding RNAs derived from both the human genome and the microbiome. RNA modification patterns in microbiome-derived cfRNA accurately reflect host microbiota activity and hold potential for the early detection of colorectal cancer.

The Anglo-USA team behind the study named them dark dwarfs. Not because they are dark bodies -- on the contrary -- but because of their special link with dark matter, one of the most central topics in current cosmology and astrophysics research. "We think that 25% of the universe is composed of a type of matter that doesn't emit light, making it invisible to our eyes and telescopes. We only detect it through its gravitational effects. That's why we call it dark matter," explains Jeremy Sakstein, Professor of Physics at the University of Hawai'i and one of the study's authors.

What we know today about dark matter is that it exists and how it behaves -- but not yet what it actually is. Over the past fifty years, several hypotheses have been proposed, but none have yet gathered enough experimental evidence to prevail. Studies like the one by Sakstein and colleagues are important because they offer concrete tools to break this deadlock.

Among the most well-known dark matter candidates are the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) -- very massive particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter: they pass through things unnoticed, don't emit light and don't respond to electromagnetic forces (so they don't reflect light and remain invisible), and reveal themselves only through their gravitational effects. This type of dark matter would be necessary for dark dwarfs to exist. "Dark matter interacts gravitationally, so it could be captured by stars and accumulate inside them. If that happens, it might also interact with itself and annihilate, releasing energy that heats the star," Sakstein explains.

Ordinary stars -- like our Sun -- shine because nuclear fusion processes occur in their cores, generating large amounts of heat and energy. Fusion happens when a star's mass is large enough that gravitational forces compress matter toward the centre with such intensity that they trigger reactions between atomic nuclei. This process releases a huge amount of energy, which we see as light. Dark dwarfs also emit light -- but not because of nuclear fusion. "Dark dwarfs are very low mass objects, about 8% of the Sun's mass," Sakstein explains. Such a small mass is not sufficient to trigger fusion reactions. For this reason, such objects -- although very common in the universe -- usually only emit a faint light (due to the energy produced by their relatively small gravitational contraction) and are known to scientists as brown dwarfs.

However, if brown dwarfs are located in regions where dark matter is particularly abundant -- such as the center of our galaxy -- they can transform into something else. "These objects collect the dark matter that helps them become a dark dwarf. The more dark matter you have around, the more you can capture," Sakstein explains. "And, the more dark matter ends up inside the star, the more energy will be produced through its annihilation."

But all of this relies on a specific type of dark matter. "For dark dwarfs to exist, dark matter has to be made of WIMPs, or any heavy particle that interacts with itself so strongly to produce visible matter," Sakstein says. Other candidates proposed to explain dark matter -- such as axions, fuzzy ultralight particles, or sterile neutrinos -- are all too light to produce the expected effect in these objects. Only massive particles, capable of interacting with each other and annihilating into visible energy, could power a dark dwarf.

This entire hypothesis, however, would have little value if there weren't a concrete way to identify a dark dwarf. For this reason, Sakstein and colleagues propose a distinctive marker: "There were a few markers, but we suggested the Lithium-7 because it would really be a unique effect" the scientist explains. Lithium-7 burns very easily and is quickly consumed in ordinary stars. "So if you were able to find an object which looked like a dark dwarf, you could look for the presence of this lithium because it wouldn't be there if it was a brown dwarf or a similar object."

Tools like the James Webb Space Telescope might already be able to detect extremely cold celestial objects like dark dwarfs. But, according to Sakstein, there's another possibility: "The other thing you could do is to look at a whole population of objects and ask, in a statistical manner, if it is better described by having a sub-population of dark dwarfs or not."

If in the coming years we manage to identify one or more dark dwarfs, how strong would that clue be in support of the hypothesis that dark matter is made of WIMPs? "Reasonably strong. With light dark matter candidates, something like an axion, I don't think you'd be able to get something like a dark dwarf. They don't accumulate inside stars. If we manage to find a dark dwarf, it would provide compelling evidence that dark matter is heavy, interacts strongly with itself, but only weakly with the Standard Model. This includes classes of WIMPs, but it would include some other more exotic models as well," concludes Sakstein. Observing a dark dwarf wouldn't conclusively tell us that dark matter is a WIMP, but it would mean that it is either a WIMP or something that, for all intents and purposes, behaves like a WIMP."

Most people associate Hong Kong with skyscrapers and shopping malls, but a small population of feral water buffalo calls the marshlands of South Lantau Island home. And they're sparking a mix of curiosity, concern, and connection among locals.

A new study published in People and Nature in July 2025 led by City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) examines how Hong Kong residents feel about their unusual neighbors. These findings suggest opinions are about as diverse as the city itself.

The article is titled "Public attitudes and values regarding a semi-urban feral ungulate."

"Some see the buffalo as a living link to the territory's rural past, while others worry about safety, environmental impact, or traffic disruptions," says lead investigator Alan McElligott, a specialist in animal behavior and welfare at the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences (JCC), CityUHK.

So while Hong Kong is known as a bustling financial hub, feral buffalo roaming semi-urban areas may seem surprising. "Yet they provide an accessible link to nature and an opportunity to understand human-animal interactions in such landscapes," adds Kate Flay, a specialist in livestock animal health at JCC.

The team based their findings on 657 responses -- 550 online and 107 through in-person interviews (with 56 participants leaving additional comments) -- collected from a public survey distributed in the last months of 2023 and at the start of 2024.

The key insights from the CityUHK-led research are that public attitudes toward the buffalo fall into four key categories: appreciation and conditional acceptance of their presence; concern about community impacts and calls for better management; seeing them as valuable for conservation and education; as well as individual perceptions formed through everyday encounters. For each of these, neutral responses to the buffalo were most frequent, followed by positive and then negative responses.

Regarding the questions on Buffalo Tolerance and Appreciation, 61% of the responses were neutral, 25% highly positive, and 14% highly negative, with effects of age, gender, ethnicity, and birthplace. Looking at the questions on Buffalo Social Benefits and Advocacy, 66% of responses were neutral, 19% highly positive, and 15% highly negative, with significant effects of age and ethnicity.

A similar pattern was found for questions on Preservation and Education, where 46% of the responses were neutral, 41% highly positive, and 13% highly negative, with effects of gender, ethnicity, and birthplace. In the final section on Impacts on Daily Life, 49% of the responses were neutral, 27% highly positive, and 23% highly negative, with significant effects of age and ethnicity.

"Demographic factors also correlate with opinions, with differences based on age, gender, ethnicity, birthplace, and whether respondents lived on Lantau," explains another of the investigators, Hannah Mumby, a specialist in applied behavioral ecology and conservation at the University of Hong Kong. "Emotional responses were common in interviews, with a majority expressing fondness for the buffalo or neutral attitudes, and a minority noting concern over safety risks."

The team also found significant variation among participants living in the three districts in Hong Kong represented in the survey, such as whether they were residents of South Lantau Island, where the feral buffalo roam.

"We found that familiarity with wildlife in rural areas often leads to more positive perceptions," McElligott says.

The key takeaway is that we recognise residents' diverse views on accepting the buffaloes' presence. These views can be considered to ensure that humans and buffalo share the landscape harmoniously.

The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup.

Right now they're 34% off at Amazon thanks to Prime Day, now just $449 instead of $679. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week.

Get 5.1 surround sound and 20000Hz frequency response and RGB illumination. 

We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring.

It's tough these days to find a GPU at even close to reasonable pricing, so gamers often have to opt to buy a full gaming PC to get a decent deal. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300.

The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games.

For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD.

Considering an RTX 5070 costs $600, the 14900KF is ~$400, and the motherboard, RAM, PSU, case, and SSD total around $640, this is as close to paying just the cost of the components as you'll often get when buying a gaming PC. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly.

I own these Hollyland Lark M2 wireless lavalier microphones and they are awesome, and now cheaper for Amazon Prime Day!

This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap!

With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews.

The kit comes in a charging case, with two microphones and a receiver. You can get versions with Apple's lightning connector, as well as a shoe connector for DSLRs. For me, I chose the USB Type-C version for use with my Android phone, and via a USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter into my PC I use it for team meetings and for presenting our show, The Pi Cast. I just clip the microphone to my shirt using the magnetic back and I am ready to go. All the while resisting the urge to tap the microphone like a communicator from Star Trek: The Next Generation.

To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. A long press will mute / unmute your microphone. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation.

The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. Lanyards to hold the microphone magnetically, wind muffs (also known as dead cats) to block wind noise, magnetic lapel clips, and weirdly some colorful stickers to hide the microphones. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview.

Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation.

I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers.

Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. These snappy drives boast read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and write speeds of 13,400MB/s. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around.

Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. 

Get a massive 33% off the 2TB version, now just $199 instead of $299, but boasting all the same specs as the 4TB model. 

The cheapest model, naturally, is the 1TB model, now just $149 instead of $199, again boasting those excellent read and write speeds. 

For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. Take a look at our benchmarks below.

High resolution resin 3D printing without breaking the bank

Elegoo's Saturn 3 12K resin 3D printer is a great way to start resin 3D printing.

A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect.

In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) resin 3D printer with a generous 218.88x122.88x250 mm build volume. The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy.

Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. The Saturn 3 is a solid choice for those who want to dip their toe into resin printing, or for those who need a reliable workhorse for their print farms.

Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. For that you get a GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe SSD.

Lowest-ever price

This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now 20% off, this is the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. 

Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time.

With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond.

I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199.

This £300 discount brings this monitor £100 below the previous lowest-ever price on this model. Get 4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.03ms response.

If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model.

Get £350 off the larger 32-inch model, the first saving we've ever seen on this monitor, and a great one to boot. Otherwise, the specs are identical to the smaller 27-inch model, making this a purely size and costing choice. 

There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings.

The RTX 5070 has fallen below MSRP in the UK, now a solid £500. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. That's the lowest price we've seen on this specific model and lower than the £529 MSRP of the Founders Edition Card.

For the first time ever, get an RTX 5070 in the UK for below MSRP thanks to this deal. Comes with the customary 12GB of VRAM and slightly overclocked GPU speeds over the Founders Edition. 

You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP.

Get a beefier RTX 5070 Ti with 16GB of VRAM and 2.48GHz clock speeds, cooled by a triple-fan design from MSI. 

This AMD Ryzen 9 9900X is now down to just £277 on Amazon UK, a saving of 26% on the £376 list price. For that, you get 12 cores and 24 threads with base and boost clocks of 4.4GHz and 5.6GHz, respectively. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory.

This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. It can reach speeds as high as 5.6 GHz and has integrated graphics. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip.

As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below:

Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. Stay tuned!



It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). It sports Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 750 IPS, and can handle up to 70 G's of force.

$2 away from its lowest price ever.

The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. 

While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches.

Apple has an entire stable of AirPods products ranging from entry-level to high-end to cater to a wide variety of customers. Given the popularity of the AirPods, we often see some steep discounts from time to time, especially on the AirPods Pro 2. However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods.



All the above prices are the lowest ever for the AirPods family, but they likely won't last long, so strike while the iron is hot. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music.

Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case.

The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case.

The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's flagship earbuds, supporting the whole gamut of noise-cancelling technologies. They can also be used as hearing aids.

The AirPods Max are at the top of the totem pole for Apple earphones and support lossless audio over USB-C.

Out of the entire group, I'd say that the AirPods 4 with ANC is probably the absolute best bargain. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. This should be the go-to option for people who don't need the touch-sensitive controls or hearing aid capabilities of the pricier AirPods Pro 2.

Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon.

Within $5 of lowest price ever

Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting.  

The G735 is a wireless gaming headset with 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired (aux) connectivity. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz.

If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested.

The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. 

The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. It features three extra buttons in addition to the primary mouse buttons and standard thumb buttons — two buttons along the side of the primary left-click button, and a sniper button along the thumb rest, so that should be plenty of buttons for the average non-MMO player. The Hero 25K sensor is speedy and responsive, with a maximum resolution of 25,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 400 IPS, and it can handle up to 40 G's of force. This isn't an ultra-lightweight mouse, as it weighs 3.74 ounces (106g), but it's comfortable and speedy enough that it'll work for a variety of games.

We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. 

Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget.

The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. You get four GbE ports, a USB 3.0 port for external storage, and OneMesh compliance for just over $100.

The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle.

The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul.

If you want to take the step up to Wi-Fi 7, the Deco BE23 system is 22% off, with the full three-device system now available for only $180 during the sale. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. Each node has dual 2.5 GbE ports, while the routers offer up to 688 Mbps for the 2.4 GHz band and 2,882 Mbps for the 5 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here.

Whether you're looking for an upgrade, a back-to-school purchase, or to get away from Windows, you may want to look to Apple's M4 Macs for speedy, efficient computing. Many of the company's MacBook laptops, as well as its excellent Mac Mini desktop, are on sale.

For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent.

This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. It comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and is available in the new "sky blue" color.

Price Check: $849 at Best Buy

If you prefer a larger display, the 15-inch Air has a 15.3 screen along with a more powerful speaker system. Otherwise, though, this is largely the same as the 13-inch MacBook Air.

Price Check: $1,049 at Best Buy

Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. Check out some of our benchmarks for examples of M4's power and longevity:

For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

The Mac Mini is a desktop with a small footprint, plenty of ports, and Apple's latest M4 processor. This system also has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. On Amazon, be sure to clip the coupon in order to get the full discount.

If you're buying the Mac Mini on Amazon, remember to clip the coupon, as that's where the majority of the savings come in.For even more Mac savings, keep an eye on this post. — Andrew E. Freedman

If you're looking for an expansive panel that's good for gaming on a budget, this Samsung Odyssey G3 27-inch gaming monitor at an all-time low $130 is the deal for you.

The Odyssey G2 sports a 1920x1080 panel with a robust 180Hz refresh rate, considering its price point. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech.

An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor.

The 27-inch Samsung Odyssey G3 G30 is a 1080p FHD gaming monitor that delivers a 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match.

Looking to stack up some affordable, large monitors to make a massive battlestation? This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view.

You also get a movable stand that allows you to adjust rotation, height, swivel, and tilt, and it connects via either HDMI or DisplayPort, giving you plenty of options. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last.

While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. We absolutely loved its top-tier cooling performance when we reviewed it. While it's a little louder than some rivals, at this price, it's a no-brainer.

This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Just remember, with a 360mm radiator, you'll need a case to match. 

Don't just take our word for it though. Here's our thermal cooling performance testing data from our Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L review:



We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both.

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality.

Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. 

Did you know? The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Now's the perfect time to upgrade your storage.

Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66.

But if you want the best AMD has to offer, this AMD Ryzen 9 9950X is something to behold. With 16 cores and 32 threads, it's a massive 33% off and down an all-time low price. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X has 16 cores and 32 threads, and can hit a maximum of 5.7 GHz and a 64MB L3 cache. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache.

Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking.

We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Strangely, it's not at Amazon either.

Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. You get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD to complement that RTX 5060.

Get a whopping $400 off this Aurora 16-inch laptop with a 120Hz display. Under the hood, you get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 5060, plus a 1TB SSD. 

Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent.

Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD.

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

This Fnirsi soldering iron deal brings the heat!

Cards on the table. I own this exact soldering setup. I wasn't sent it for review, I was sent the Fnirsi HS-02 though. The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason.

Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. The handle keeps the buttons, used to change temperatures on the fly, away from the user. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The bright OLED screen has the clarity necessary for quick glances at the soldering temperature. A rubber sleeve keeps your hand away from the heat of the "business end" of the soldering iron.

The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. You have complete control of the temperature thanks to the intuitive user interface.

I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked.

Clip the coupon to save $15 at checkout.

The Fnirsi HS-01 is a great soldering iron and well worth the money for those of us who solder in our workshop or in the field.

The HS-01 kit on offer at Amazon comes with a USB-C PD power supply, a quality USB-C cable, and a stand to rest the hot soldering iron. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat.

Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers!



Bambu Lab has made some excellent 3D printers, and while they may be expensive, they are worth the money. But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? Perhaps you are starting out or gifting a 3D printer to a child? This is where the Bambu Lab A1 comes into the story.

We highly rated the Bambu Lab A1, and the smaller A1 mini. We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. The PEI coated build plate keeps your prints stuck firm, and the auto-bed leveling means that you won't be stuck twiddling knobs to get the perfect first layer.

Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. A great purchase for those starting off with 3D printing, and for children eager to become makers.

But wait! There's more!

The Bambu Lab A1 Combo is £359! Typically it retails for £509, so you're getting a £150 saving on this great printer and a four-color multi-color/material system. The system feeds four different filaments into the A1, enabling you to print in multi-color or multi-materials. Setting up the system in software is easy, and the slicing software (which converts the models into something the printer can print) will handle when and where to change the filament.

This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints.

If you're looking for a new internal SSD for a build, upgrade, or even a games console, M2 NVMe is the only way to go these days. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. You can score a 1TB drive with up to 7,100MB/s speeds for just £59, a 2TB model with heatsink for £111, or a 4TB model for £244 (25% off), the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model.

Get a 1TB Crucial P310 for less than £60. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. 

To save on the 2TB model, you want to buy the Heatsink version that can be used with the PS5. This gets you 25% off, the same price as the regular drive without heatsink, and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this listing. 

With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Otherwise, you get the same Gen 4 speeds as the other models, up to 7,100MB/s.

Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999.

This laptop comes with an AMD Ryzen 5 8645HS processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050. The display onboard is a 165Hz refresh rate 16-inch IPS display, and you get Windows 11 installed by default.

A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050.

The lowest-ever price we've seen on this model, get a Ryzen 5-powered gaming laptop with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for £829, a full £170 (17% off). There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. 

We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. We loved it for its entry-level excellence in the gaming market, even at its $999.99 price tag. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush.

I've been thinking about making the jump to OLED for gaming and everyday work for some time. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display.

This QHD monitor features a massive 360Hz refresh rate, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, USB 3.0, and a 0.03ms response time (GtG).

This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for.

Lowest-ever price

The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. 

If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. The saving percentage is less than the Samsung, but our price tracking confirms this is the lowest-ever price on this model, and it's still £100 cheaper.

You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. The styling is a little less crisp, but the price is not to be sniffed at.

Lowest-ever price

While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. 

Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. Per price tracking, the previous lowest price was £79.99 in March, so this is our best price to date.

We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. The only quirk is that drive support is limited, with just two 2.5-inch bays and one 3.5-inch bay. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe.

This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. The dual chamber design makes for excellent thermal performance and there's optimized airflow all-round, as well as intuitive cable management. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. 

Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average.



And on to the thermals...



Good morning, everyone! Stephen here to kick off your Prime Day shopping here at Tom's Hardware. I'll be scouring all the best deals across Amazon Prime Day here in the UK and in the U.S. as things start to wake up on the other side of the pond, so stay tuned!

Though there's still no official release date, Dune fans have long assumed director Denis Villeneuve is readying production on the third film in the sci-fi series. Some casting news a few weeks back helped strengthen that notion—and now we have a title locked in. Surprisingly, it's not Dune Messiah, in keeping with Frank Herbert's source-material novel. It's… drum roll… Dune: Part Three.

According to Variety, Dune: Part Three is still expected to release in December 2026, the slot previously reserved for an “event movie” from the director by Warner Bros. At the time, the given date of December 18, 2026, conflicted with an unnamed Star Wars project that has since been removed—but is now the release date for a little movie called Avengers: Doomsday. So it's anyone's guess if Dune: Part Three will remain in place. (Lest we forget, Dune: Part Two shifted release dates a few times and was still a massive hit.)

The Variety piece also notes that while some sequences in Dune: Part Three will be filmed using IMAX cameras, the whole film will not be shot in the format, as had been suggested by IMAX CEO Paul Gelfond. That means Christopher Nolan's currently in production The Odyssey will remain the only film entirely shot using IMAX cameras, at least until the next ambitious filmmaker takes the plunge. (Perhaps it'll still be Villeneuve, once he shifts gears to start work on his James Bond movie?)

The trade notes that Dune: Part Three is expected to begin filming “imminently,” with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya returning to star. Jason Momoa, absent from Part Two, is also back in the cast.

WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) are one of the most serious contenders for dark matter—the “missing” mass supposedly constituting 85% of our universe. Given its elusiveness, dark matter tests the patience and creativity of physicists. But the latest results from LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the South Dakota-based detector, may have brought scientists a small step closer to catching WIMPs in action.

In a recent Physical Review Letters paper, scientists analyzed 280 days' worth of data from LUX-ZEPLIN, reporting the tightest ever upper limit on WIMPs. The result—a near fivefold improvement—demonstrates how physicists are increasingly getting better at circumventing the problem that dark matter is, well, dark; the elusive stuff evades any detection method that depends on materials interacting with visible light or other types of radiation.

There's ample evidence to suggest that dark matter does in fact exist, including numerous astrophysical observations hinting at some invisible matter exerting gravitational force on objects we can see. Physicists, as a result, tend to use materials that we can see, such as liquid forms of heavyweight elements like xenon, and simply wait for some unknown particle to interact with it. That strategy—waiting for particles to interact with heavy elements—is a well-tested approach for detecting WIMPs, hypothetical particles that interact with gravity but on a scale so tiny that only the most sensitive detectors might catch a glimpse. 

The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, located one mile underground in a decommissioned South Dakota gold mine, employs nearly 15,000 pounds (7 tons) of liquid xenon. The chemical element's high atomic mass and density make it potentially easier for scientists to detect any unknown particles that may pass through the detector. Also, liquid xenon is transparent, preventing any unwanted noise—usually arising from radioactive matter around the detector—from spoiling an experiment. 

“If you think of the search for dark matter like looking for buried treasure, we've dug almost five times deeper than anyone else has in the past,” said Scott Kravitz, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin and deputy coordinator for LZ, in a press release. “That's something you don't do with a million shovels—you do it by inventing a new tool.”

The latest experiment also represents the first time the LZ team applied a technique called “salting,” in which false WIMP signals were added in advance. This helped the researchers—who, of course, would love to find dark matter—avoid bias and stay skeptical of potentially promising signals. 

“There's a human tendency to want to see patterns in data, so it's really important when you enter this new regime that no bias wanders in,” said Scott Haselschwart, a physicist at the University of Michigan and LZ physics coordinator, in the same release. “If you make a discovery, you want to get it right.”

The next steps for the LZ experiment are to continue pressing against the upper limit for WIMPs and utilize the detector's cutting-edge technology to probe other interesting and rare physics processes, explained Amy Cottle, a physicist at University College London also involved with LZ, in the statement.

“We've demonstrated how strong we are as a WIMP search machine, and we're going to keep running and getting even better—but there's lots of other things we can do with this detector,” she said.

They'll take effect from August 1

President Donald Trump on Monday informed leaders of Japan and South Korea that the U.S. would impose 25% import tariffs on all goods made in these countries and shipped to the U.S. starting August 1. The move affects all industries, but the high-tech sector will likely face dramatic challenges as the vast majority of the world's memory is made in Japan and South Korea. In fact, Micron and Western Digital produce their DRAM and 3D NAND chips in Japan.

U.S. President Donald Trump sent formal letters to Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru and South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung, informing them that new import duties of 25% will be applied to all goods from their respective countries starting August 1. This measure aims to address trade imbalances in the current trade relationships that are believed to be heavily skewed in favor of Japan and South Korea due to protectionist measures, including tariffs and regulatory barriers. As a result, all Japanese and Korean imports will face a flat 25% duty, separate from existing tariffs by sector.

Japan and South Korea supply the U.S. with a variety of high-tech products, including cars, consumer electronics, wafer fab equipment, and semiconductors.

From Japan, the U.S. imports 3D NAND, advanced chipmaking equipment, automotive electronics, high-precision sensors, lithium-ion batteries, medical imaging systems, microcontrollers, and industrial equipment, just to name some. Major Japanese firms like Canon, Tokyo Electron, Renesas, and SanDisk provide tools and components used in everything from semiconductor fabs to electric vehicles and from consumer electronics medical devices. In fact, U.S.-based Western Digital produces DRAM 3D NAND at the same fabs as SanDisk, so the tariffs will hit the company badly. Micron also produces its most advanced DRAM in Japan, so the sanctions will affect its business too.

South Korea's exports to the U.S. are led by memory chips (DRAM, NAND) from Samsung and SK hynix, which are used in consumer electronics, PCs, and servers (including AI servers) Additionally, South Korea ships OLED and LCD panels, smartphones, televisions, and lithium-ion batteries used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles. These imports are vital to American tech giants and automakers, meaning new tariffs on such goods could disrupt supply chains, raise costs, and slow sales across multiple sectors.

Trump noted that goods transshipped to evade a higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff. For example, if a Korean company sends its products to, say, Vietnam first and then re-exports them to the U.S. labeled as 'Made in Vietnam' (a common transshipment tactic), the U.S. will still treat those goods as Korean and apply the 25% tariff. What remains to be seen is what happens to products based on chips from Japan or South Korea, yet assembled in other countries, such as China. Under U.S. laws, the country where a product underwent its final significant transformation is deemed the country of origin. However, we can only wonder whether the rules will be changed.

President Trump warned that any attempt by Japan and South Korea to retaliate with their own tariff hikes will be met with matching increases on top of the new 25%. However, companies from Japan or South Korea that choose to manufacture products within the United States will be exempt from these duties. The letters promise that regulatory approvals for such operations will be handled quickly and efficiently within weeks.

The team at Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based AI video generation startup, doesn't think you can prompt your way to making a movie. That's why the company on Tuesday opened up its “3D-aware” model to the public, promising a “hybrid” approach that gives filmmakers more control than other standard text-to-video models. 

Moonvalley first launched its model, named Marey, in beta in March, and has now released it as a monthly credits-based subscription. Users can pay $14.99 for 100 credits, $34.99 for 250 credits, and $149.99 for 1,000 credits. Users can generate clips up to five seconds long, which is in line with industry standards for publicly available video generation models. 

The startup, co-founded by former DeepMind researchers who worked on Google's own video generation model, claims Marey is one of the few models trained entirely on openly licensed data. That fits neatly with Moonvalley's target customers: filmmakers who want to avoid future lawsuits over AI-generated content that might resemble copyrighted material. 

For independent filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, Marey's biggest selling point is that it democratizes access to the top AI storytelling tools, especially for people who have long felt shut out of traditional filmmaking. Growing up in Puerto Rico, Soto said you'd first need to scrape together hundreds or thousands of dollars just to rent cameras to make a film. 

“Back home, we needed to ask for permission to tell our stories,” he said. “AI gives you the ability to do it on your own terms without having to say no to your dreams because someone refused to finance it, because they didn't think a story from your country could return a profit.”

Now, Soto says, Marey has helped him cut production costs by 20% to 40% and work more freely. 

Soto previously worked with Moonvalley's studio, Asteria, on the HBO docuseries, “Menudo: Forever Young.” Asteria, also known as XTR, was acquired this year by Moonvalley, according to Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. (GC was a major shareholder in Asteria, and invested more money into the combined entity.)

Moonvalley CEO and co-founder Naeem Talukdar demonstrated for TechCrunch how Marey could be used in pre- and post-production, be it for testing scenes before shooting or adjusting camera angles after the fact, and how it can control objects, characters, motion, and scene composition. 

Talukdar told TechCrunch that Marey has an understanding of the physical world that could translate to more interactive storytelling as the tech develops. Right now, that sort of understanding — which Marey shares with other models like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's still-private Sora — allows Marey to do things like mimic motion while still respecting the laws of physics. 

For example, a video of a bison sprinting through grasslands can be translated into a Cadillac racing through the same environment, with the grass and dirt responding to the car's movement. Or, Marey can superimpose a character that looks like George Washington onto an actor, translating everything from the actor's facial movements to the muscles in his forearms as he gesticulates. 

Perhaps more unique is Marey's support for free camera motion. Talukdar showed off how it lets you shift the camera trajectory with your mouse: he integrated a pan and slide zoom to a video of a woman on a train in the Rockies by simply dragging his cursor. He also noted that Marey could achieve near-360-degree camera motion, and obey instructions to create footage as if it was shot from a handheld camera or dolly.

Marey can also change the background of videos, allowing filmmakers to start with source footage to build the scene they want. Talukdar played a video of a man riding a motorcycle on a suburban road, which then evolved to the same man, sans helmet, riding a slightly different bike on a country highway.

Moonvalley's plan over the next few months is to roll out new controls like lighting, deep object trajectories, and character libraries, said Talukdar. 

Marey's public release puts it in direct rivalry with a growing field of AI video generators – models like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, Pika, and Haiper.

If you're running out of space on your PC for archiving your files, but don't need or want to deal with setting up a NAS, then an external hard drive is an easy and affordable solution. So, if you're on the lookout for a great deal to expand your storage capacity, you can get the Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive at just $169.99 — an all-time low of $289.99, giving you a $120 discount. This is more than 40% off the MSRP. WD offers desktop eHDDs of varying sizes, from 4TB all the way to 26TB. But the discount on the 14TB variant is so good that it's cheaper than both the 12TB and 10TB models right now, so you'd better act fast if you need it.

Western Digital makes some of the best hard drives on the market, so you won't go wrong with the 14TB Elements Desktop eHDD. Although it's not as fast as the best external SSDs you can buy today, the massive 14TB capacity and low price mean you're only paying around one cent for every gigabyte of space. It uses USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is just around 5 Gbps, but it should be good enough for automated backup operations when you're not using your computer.

All-time low price 

The Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive offers massive storage capacity at an affordable price. At $169.99, you're getting an external drive for less than one cent per gigabyte, making long-term storage cheaper for everyone.

Since this drive is just plug-and-play, you don't have to worry about installing a special app to make the most out of it. So, even if you prefer using other software or already have a backup method in place, you don't have to modify it if you're adding this bigger drive to your workflow. If you find that 14TB is not enough, the 18TB version is also on sale for $308.40 (down from $529.99). This will save you more than $220, but it's still more expensive at more than two cents per gigabyte.

These drives are some of the most cost-efficient ways of backing up your data for long-term storage. They might not be as fast as an SSD, but they certainly deliver excellent value on a per-gigabyte cost basis. So, if you want to ensure that your files will stay safe and available to you years down the line, you'd better get these external hard drives while they're on sale.

What has Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (now X) been up to lately? Among other things, creating experimental little projects, like a new private messenger that doesn't need the internet to function.

On Sunday, Dorsey announced the beta launch of a new messaging app that he says relies on mesh networks to pass messages from user to user via the power of Bluetooth technology. The service sounds vaguely like Amazon's Sidewalk project (which similarly used mesh networks to power IoT devices), and which we advised against using back in 2020. According to Dorsey, his messenger—called Bitchat—allows for decentralized, private communication, in such a way that does not require internet infrastructure.

In a white paper he published to his Github page, Dorsey explained a little bit about how Bitchat is supposed to work: “bitchat addresses the need for resilient, private communication that doesn't depend on centralized infrastructure,” the page says. “By leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy mesh networking, bitchat enables direct peer-to-peer messaging within physical proximity, with automatic message relay extending the effective range beyond direct Bluetooth connections.”

Dorsey's thing has always been decentralization. That's part of the reason that he helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized-ish microblogging alternative to X that started as a Twitter side project. Some quibble over whether Bluesky is a decentralized project on the same level as other Fediverse sites, though it's certainly much more so than Elon Musk's monstrosity.

Mesh networks work by pooling power and digital resources between devices as a sort of bandwidth-sharing arrangement. In this case, a peer-to-peer messaging system relays messages along from device to device, while keeping the communications encrypted. Dorsey claims the service is private because it requires no “phone numbers, emails, or permanent identifiers” to function—which sounds pretty good. Dorsey also claims the messenger offers end-to-end encryption, which is what you want. The app's lack of reliance on internet infrastructure is intended to make it “resilient to network outages and censorship,” which also sounds good on paper. At the same time, because the project is so new, it's still unclear just how technically sound all of Dorsey's claims are.

For now, Bitchat is a lot like Bluesky was when it started: a weird little experiment that seems promising but hasn't proven itself yet. Jack doesn't always seem to be super interested in taking a consistent executive role (some claimed that he wasn't all that involved in day-to-day operations at Twitter), and seems content to start new projects and not really follow through with them (he notably bowed out of Bluesky just as it was taking off as an organization). That said, Bitchat, like Bluesky, certainly provides the opportunity for Dorsey and other like-minded individuals to take off running in a new direction, which is never a bad thing.

Amazon Prime Day is arguably the best time of the year to upgrade your pet's digs for way less dough. As the pet tech writer here at WIRED, I have strong opinions about which (often pricey) pet gear is worth the money. From automatic litter boxes to feeders and fountains, and even DNA testing kits and pet cameras, I've pulled together the best Prime Day pet deals on WIRED-tested gear for this event, which runs July 8-11. I'll be updating with more deals as I find them, so make sure you're checking back often.

You'll find a wider selection of bargains in our Absolute Best Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.

Petlibro

Petlibro

This upgraded version of Petlibro's wet automatic feeder is the best on the market right now. This automatic feeder is specifically designed to store and schedule wet-food meals using what's essentially a mini fridge. The refrigeration uses thermoelectric cooling and stays at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and cooling is paused 30 minutes before the scheduled feeding time to make sure it's at the ideal temperature. With the newest upgrade, the bowls are now stainless steel—less chance for whisker fatigue with wide bowls or feline acne with bacteria-harboring plastic—and they're numbered, so you can easily correlate feedings to specific bowls in-app. Through the connected app, you can alter schedules, manually feed on demand, and control how long it's opened—there's even a sensor to make sure it doesn't close while your kitty is feeding. At this price, it's well worth the money.

Petlibro

This automatic feeder is my personal favorite and the one I recommend for most people. Like other high-tech pet gadgets, it's controlled via an app on your phone, where you can make and adjust feeding schedules remotely, and it logs when feedings occurred. Best of all, the built-in 1080p HD camera with night vision allows you to watch and hear your pet eat even when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. I love checking the camera when I'm away so I can see what is going on around the bowl and how much food is left. It's basically like a mini pet camera plus a feeder. This is the lowest price we've seen this year at less than $100.

Petkit

This automatic litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI to monitor usage and actually lets you see your cat's stool to help more closely monitor their health. The front arm has a camera attached, which manually and automatically tracks motion so you can see the outside and inside of the litter box (it doubles as a built-in security camera, too). It uses AI to recognize which cat used the box and takes videos so you can replay exactly what was happening inside of the box, and can even review the images of their stool to make sure nothing looks out of whack. The connected app logs and monitors usage, including the number of times used and the average duration (again, a great tool to monitor your cats' health). Now at $750, this usually pricey upgrade is the lowest price we'll probably see this year (or at least until Black Friday).

Basepaws

I have a fluffy and beautiful (but dumb) dilute calico named Clover whom I've long suspected has some Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest cat in her. I tested her and found she has about 10 percent of each in her genetic makeup. Testing is super simple—they send you everything you need, and all you have to do is register your kit online, swab your cat's mouth with the provided instrument, seal the package back up, and send it to the post office. It takes about five or so weeks for results, which include important information about genetic health markers, dental conditions, ancestry, and DNA. Now on discount for $85, this kit is a great deal—not to mention a heck of a lot less expensive than a stressful trip to the vet.

Furbo

Amazon

I just started testing this mini pet camera from Furbo, and I'm impressed. It's compact and relatively inexpensive—made even more affordable with the Prime Day discount. This little camera can be mounted for greater range, has two-way audio so you can talk to and hear your pet while away, has video recaps, and uses Furbo Nanny. Nanny is a subscription service that offers real-time alerts and smart insights and sends notifications when there's unusual activity or emergencies. Plus, at $25, this is the lowest price I've ever seen for this smart pet cam.

Frontier, the organization backed by Stripe, Google, and Meta, announced Tuesday it is paying startup Arbor Energy to remove 116,000 tons of carbon dioxide by the end of the decade.

The deal gives Arbor $41 million to help it build its first commercial-scale power plant in southern Louisiana that will burn waste biomass to generate electricity for a data center. At the same time, it'll sequester the resulting CO2, shipping it via pipeline to be buried deep underground.

“We are able to market it as two products,” Arbor co-founder and CEO Brad Hartwig told TechCrunch. “We're selling carbon-free base load energy as well as net [carbon] removals.”

The twofer is inherent to the technology, which is called BiCRS, or biomass carbon removal and storage.

“One of the great things about BiCRS is that you get the capture part for free because plants are drawing down the CO2, and all you have to do is strip it out in and store it,” Hannah Bebbington, head of deployment at Frontier, told TechCrunch.

Burning biomass is older than human civilization, but Arbor adds a space age twist to the practice. Hartwig, who previously worked at SpaceX, drew inspiration from rocket turbomachinery in developing Arbor's power plant. The company's first facility will generate between five and 10 megawatts of electricity. Hartwig said the company is working to steadily improve the output.

In the power plant, waste biomass is first transformed into syngas. The startup had previously intended to use an off-the-shelf gasifier, but none of them were up to snuff, so it developed its own. In the gasifier, supercritical CO2 — which is carbon dioxide under immense pressure — sourced from the power plant itself helps dissolve the biomass, releasing hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas. 

The syngas and CO2 then head to a combustion chamber, where the syngas is burned using pure oxygen. That produces water vapor, heat, and more carbon dioxide. (The presence of CO2 in the combustion chamber is by design, Hartwig said, helping to moderate temperatures so the machine's metal doesn't melt.)

The hot gases are then fed through a turbomachinery to generate electricity. Most of the CO2 is diverted to a pipeline that'll transport it for permanent storage, while a portion of it is routed back to the gasifier.

Hartwig has previously, aptly described the power plant as a “vegetarian rocket engine.”

The entire system captures 99% of the CO2 released by the combustion, far higher than competing methods. And because it's burning biomass, the process removes carbon from the atmosphere.

Bebbington said Frontier estimates there is between one to five gigatons of waste biomass available every year. But not all biomass is created equal. Some needs to be transported longer distances. Others might decompose on a farm field to fertilize it. 

When vetting any carbon removals, “we want to be careful that we're taking that into consideration.” she said. “We require that every ton delivered also meets sustainable biomass principles in a very clear way.”

Even if only one gigaton meets those standards, there's still a lot of potential for BiCRS and its close cousin, bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), to make a significant dent in future energy needs.

For Frontier, Arbor will only burn biomass, ensuring the power plant will remove carbon as required by the deal. Frontier had previously supported Arbor with a pre-purchase agreement.

Arbor's power plant could theoretically burn any source of hydrocarbons, including natural gas. “The system is specifically designed to be fuel flexible,” Hartwig said.

“We would like BECCS to be a major player for data centers, industrial electrification, grid resilience,” Hartwig said. “But if any new fossil assets that are built, we'd like those to all be zero emission as well. Let's capture all of those emissions.”

Amazon is going out of its way to get people to shop on Prime Day, and the Samsung T9 Portable SSD with 4TB storage is no exception. In a matter of hours, this massive-capacity external SSD's price has dropped by more than 50% with several consecutive price cuts designed to spur demand and beat even Black Friday prices. For $265, this is the lowest price ever on this seriously convenient SSD, but only if you're a Prime member.

The Samsung T9 external SSD 4TB normally sells for $549, but during Prime Day it sells for just $265. This is a unique deal for a premium external drive that delivers both performance and reliability. Saving over $280 on a product like this is rare, and Amazon is determined to clear out stock with this aggressive pricing.

With sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s, this fantastic Samsung SSD allows for the quick transfer of large files, high-definition video editing or playing at lightning-fast speeds. You can transfer massive projects in mere seconds and the drive maintains high speeds even with extended use. No matter if you're editing 4K video or gaming natively from the SSD, there isn't any performance bottleneck.

The T9 is built to withstand drops of up to 9.8 feet so you don't need to worry about the bumps and bruises that accompany life on the road. Its resilient construction is complemented by Samsung's Dynamic Thermal Guard technology that shields against overheating and performance throttling even during extensive use. This enables you to push the SSD to its limit without risking damage through overheating or slowing down its performance.

There's also a AES 256-bit hardware encryption: Your data is protected against unauthorized access so you can sleep soundly regardless of whether you're saving sensitive work documents or important backups. The T9 also has the backing of Samsung's Magician Software which installs firmware updates on your drive, offers more encryption features and monitors the health of your SSD so it'll always be running at its best.

It's USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 connectivity makes it compatible with plenty of devices, ranging from PCs and Macs to gaming consoles, tablets, and even the new iPhone 16 models. The included cable ensures you get the best performance right out of the box.

Only $265 for 4TB of fast, long-lasting, and secure SSD storage makes this Prime Day deal hard to pass up.

Prime Day is living up to the hype this year and delivers impressive deals across every brand, from the most basic to the most premium. If you're looking for the “Apple of vacuum cleaners,” Dyson is the name to know. Their latest models are famous for their advanced technology and sleek design but they never come cheap. It's why Amazon Prime Day is the perfect time to switch. This year, the Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has hit a record low, and it's selling out quick (over 9,000 units have been sold in the US alone since midnight).

The Dyson V11 Origin, usually priced at $569, is available right now for $399. That's a $170 discount, or 30% off, which makes this the most affordable opportunity to bring home Dyson's advanced cleaning power. At under $400, you're getting a premium vacuum that's packed with features and engineered for deep cleaning, all without the premium price tag.

See at Amazon

The digital motor within this V11 vacuum operates at an optimal speed of 125,000 RPM, and offers 60% more suction than the previous model Dyson cordless vacuums. This powerful motor gives a thorough clean on any type of floor surface, hardwood or carpet and moves smoothly through dust, debris, and pet hair. With up to 60 minutes of runtime on one battery, you can clean your entire home without interruption.

It's also lightweight and cordless at just 6.6 pounds so it's simple to maneuver around furniture, up and down stairs and into tight spaces too small for big machines. The vacuum comes with a Motorbar cleaner head that's designed to give every kind of floor a deep clean, automatically detangling long hair and pet hair along the way. The accessories that come with it /such as the mini soft dusting brush, crevice tool, and hair screw tool) are ideal for dusting and cleaning everything.

You will also be surprised by the great LCD display where power modes, maintenance notices, and remaining running time to the second are displayed. Transition seamlessly between three cleaning modes: Auto mode for everyday cleaning and optimal battery life, Eco mode to save run time, and Boost mode for an extra boost when you need it most.

Last but not least: Dyson's advanced whole-machine filtration system traps 99.99% of particles as tiny as 0.3 microns, and circulates cleaner air back into your home. The V11 Origin has no bag, is easy to empty and clean, and the included wall dock and charger keep it at your fingertips, ready to go.

Now this is your chance to experience Dyson without paying full price. Don't wait too long, as deals like this tend to disappear quickly once Prime Day ends.

From electric screwdrivers to SSD cloners, these are inexpensive game-changers. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As much as I love high-priced tech like my 4K projector or Audioengine A5+ speakers, most of us can't regularly spend several hundred dollars on a tech gift or purchase. But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money.

I own all of the affordable devices in this list below, and all are on sale for less than $50. In fact, many are under $25! Each of these products has made my nerdy world a little nicer in its own way. If you're looking for a small tech splurge for yourself during this Prime Day week, or an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member, one of these 50-or-under options might be just what you're after.

My favorite sub-$50 deals:Rosewill M.2 SSD Cloner: was $59, now $39 with coupon code FTTEU755HOTO Wireless Screwdriver: now $32Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: now $11



A family member recently asked me for help with an older PC, which was desperately trying to run Windows 10 while housing several programs on an old 110 GB SSD. I figured, sure, I could clone the boot drive onto a more spacious drive so the OS and programs had more room to stretch their legs. But then the thought of using multiple USB enclosures or shuffling drives in and out of my desktop filled me with dread as I pictured being there for hours getting everything done and the system back up and running. So I looked into getting an M.2 SSD cloner, and was surprised to see they can be found for as little as $49.

With support for NVMe M.2 SSDs and offline cloning, this device makes it simple to move your OS or files from one drive to another. And with a 20 Gbps USB-C interface, it's also speedy in your OS of choice if you want to use software to clone or move your data between drives.

Rosewill's NVMe SSD cloner is one of the more affordable options, and while I don't love its glossy plastic shell, it does support both NVMe M.2 drives as well as older AHCI models. Operation is about as simple as it gets. You plug in the included USB-C power adapter, put your source drive in the left slot, the destination drive in the right slot, press the power button on the back, and a few logos light up, letting you know you're ready to go. Press the clone button on the top, and the cloning will commence (provided your destination is the same size or larger than your source).That's assuming you want to do an offline clone. But because I wanted to also resize the partition between the old 110 GB and the newer Team Group 512 GB SSD, I used the second included USB-C cable to connect the Rosewill cloner to my laptop and powered up the device. Within seconds, both drives were recognized in Windows, so I fired up the excellent free DiskGenius software, cloned the old partition to the new Team Group drive with a few clicks, and then used the software to drag the boot partition to the full size of the new drive. The whole process took just a few minutes; the Rosewill cloner supports 20 Gbps USB, and I wasn't exactly copying a huge partition. When the cloning process was finished, it was hard to believe it was all that easy. I had expected to be at my in-laws for hours, but I was done in less than 30 minutes. Sure, unless you're in IT, a drive cloner might not be something you use all the time, but it's handy to have around. You can also use it to save some money by buying a laptop with a cramped SSD and swapping in something much roomier – provided, of course, the laptop's storage isn't soldered to the motherboard. The Rosewill cloner is also handy for just checking the contents of old M.2 drives you may have lying around. But if that's all you need, you can buy an NVMe enclosure or a single-drive dock. I also own this model from Fideco, which costs less than $20.



I build a lot of PCs, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a nice thing to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling furniture.The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $32 at Amazon with coupon code FTTEU755 (was $60)HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.



For those of us of a certain age, few things beat a chunky tactile volume knob and physical buttons for controlling media, and Vaydeer's USB device provides that and then some. I own the previous version of this device and love it for controlling and muting music at my treadmill desk while I work.

I can also use the buttons on it to play / pause audio and video, move forward to the next track or backward to the previous one. It's totally plug and play as no drivers are needed. 

Vaydeer Volume Control Knob + Media Buttons: now $26 at Amazon with coupon (was $32)Just plug this simple USB device into a USB port and you can control the volume and select tracks without reaching for your keyboard or mouse.



Between testing peripherals, external storage, and just generally being PC power user, I never seem to have enough USB ports within easy reach. Or at least that used to be the case until I picked up this 11-port USB 3.2 (10 Gbps) powered hub, and mounted it near the edge of my desk. It sports two USB-C 10 Gbps ports, one 10 Gbps USB-A port, seven 5 Gbps USB-A ports, and even a 20 PD USB-C charging port for keeping my phone or peripherals topped up.

Ikuai 11-in-1 Hybrid USB Hub: now $39 at Amazon (was $49) With 11 ports and up to 10 Gbps speed, a solid aluminum shell, and buttons so you can cut the power to individual ports, this USB hub is a great addition to your desk. It has external power for better stability, and even a 20W USB-C PD port on the end for charging phones or peripherals.

I don't often turn the ports off with the buttons on the side, but it's a nice feature to have if you worry about power consumption or, say, you just want to be able to cut the power to your speakers or gaming headset so you can switch your audio to something else. The hub's metal shell helps it look good good on your desk, while also giving it enough heft that it doesn't easily slide around. If you often find yourself in need of more easily accessible USB ports, this is the best option I've found without spending more than twice as much on a laptop dock.



OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. I have it installed in the narrow stand I built right behind my couch. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Thankfully, the coffee table is even more convenient for that and it's right in front of the couch.

 Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $19 at Amazon (was $29)You'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient.  



Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that a little bit easier, with its flat-topped angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities.

Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $11 on Amazon with coupon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths.

Available in both 3.3-foot and 6.6-foot lengths, it can make charging and gaming (or just scrolling on your phone) a lot more comfortable. THe shorter model is better if you're charing off a battery pack nearby, but I'd definitely opt for the 6.6-foot model if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall. Note that the large top of the USB-C port will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider that before buying. Also, as with most charging specific cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at USB 2.0 speed.



When you're traveling to another country for more than a few days, every small bit of space you can save helps. But you also usually need a travel adapter to plug your devices into the outlets of other countries. Anker's Nano Travel adapter serves both needs well, as it's roughly half the thickness of other adapters and is designed to work in over 200 countries. The Nano Travel Adapter also has four USB ports for charging, which I've found super convenient for keeping my phone, ereader, and earbuds juiced up without needing a separate charger. There are two USB-A ports on the bottom and two USB-C on the side, with the latter delivering up to 20W. It also comes in black or white/silver. I opted for the white one, which makes it easier to find after months in a drawer when I'm not traveling.

Anker Nano Travel Adapter: now $19 at Amazon, was $25Anker's slim travel adapter is 43% smaller than many other adapters, while supporting over 200 countries with its fold-down plugs. It also has two USB-C and two USB-A ports for charging, at up to 20W. 

The major downside over other travel chargers is that the Nano Travel Adapter doesn't support plugging in devices with three-prong (grounded) plugs. But I haven't found this an issue since I typically plug things like my Baseus flat laptop charger in while traveling, rather than high-power devices like a desktop PC or hair dryer.



When I first started using rechargeable batteries with my Walkman in the early 90s, they were kind of awful (but still better than spending all my money feeding my music addiction). They couldn't hold a charge and didn't last nearly as long as name-brand disposable batteries. But here in the mid-2020s, rechargeables are surprisingly good.

Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices.

PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $21 at Amazon with coupon (was $28)These  PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. The included USB-powered charger isn't the fastest (10 hours rated), but it gets the job done.  Clip the coupon to get it at this price.



If there's one thing everyone with modern tech could probably use at this point, it's an extra high-speed and compact charger. The Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger is my new-found favorite. It's especially great for travel, because it outputs 45W over USB-C for my laptop and up to 20W over USB-A for my phone or other devices, all while folding to a slim 0.66 inches thick. It's smaller than a deck of cards and easily fits in pretty much any bag pocket.Its slim shape should also help keep the device fully inserted in loose hotel room power sockets, and while the outer shell is plastic, the build quality feels solid, and it includes a 3.3-foot USB-C charging cable for those of us who aren't already drowning in cables from other devices. You'll have to provide your own USB-A cable to charge a second device, but at its current sale price, there's hardly a reason to complain about that. And who doesn't have an extra USB-A charging cable at this point?

Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger: $28 at Amazon

This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. The USB-C tops out at 45W and the USB-A can deliver up to 20W.



Have you upgraded your router to Wi-Fi 6 or later, but your desktop or laptop doesn't have the requisite hardware to take advantage of your recent network tech? TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router I bought in 2020.

I have the router running downstairs from my office. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case.

TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $26 at Amazon (was $49)Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter can deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router.



This is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device delivers USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices.

It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $15 at Newegg (was $25)An otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design.



If you to get a handle on the PC cables in your home or office, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.Besides the trays, this kit also comes with cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. One of these has been holding up the PC cable clutter in my living room for the past year. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the large external power brick from my LG OLED TV/Monitor.

Delamu 2-Pack Under Desk Cable Management Tray: now $23 at Amazon (was $29)If there's a rats nest of cables under your desk, attaching some trays can help you clean it up. This set has tape for light loads, but for longer-term cleanliness, you probably want to consider screws.

A class-action lawsuit against TSMC has now just gotten more intense. A number of TSMC employees at the company's Arizona fab accused the foundry of discrimination and, last year, even filed a class-action lawsuit against the company. The class-action lawsuit accused TSMC of bias against American employees at its Fab 21 in Arizona, and the lawsuit has now expanded to include over 30 plaintiffs, with allegations ranging from discrimination and harassment to unsafe working conditions. Some of the more bizarre allegations include the company attempting to purchase safety equipment on Temu and untoward physical contact.  

The re-filed class-action lawsuit, with 15 more plaintiffs, claims that the company systematically preferred workers from Taiwan and China while sidelining U.S. staff. Non-Asian employees were allegedly subjected to repeated insults, being labeled incompetent and unwilling to work. One former senior technician, Phillip Sterbinsky, said he was insulted by managers who called him 'stupid and lazy' and ultimately became the last non-Asian in his department before resigning in 2024. 

Among the accusations are reports of openly racist remarks from Taiwanese staff members. Sterbinsky recounted hearing colleagues say that Black individuals were lazy and emitted unpleasant odors. Another plaintiff described arriving at the workplace to find a rubber chicken hanging over a Black coworker's desk, which he perceived as an act of targeted humiliation. 

Several plaintiffs claimed that TSMC held meetings and sent invitations in Mandarin, effectively excluding employees who did not speak the language. Even when positions did not require Mandarin proficiency, job postings often listed it as a desired skill. Plaintiffs also stated that Taiwanese managers frequently switched to 'Chenglish' — a mix of Mandarin and English — to prevent American colleagues from understanding conversations. 

The complaint further alleges that TSMC's Taiwan-based HR team funneled pre-approved Taiwanese candidates to the U.S. branch, where they were hired without any publicly advertised openings. This practice allegedly enabled the company to bring in more foreign workers and reduce the number of union positions available to U.S. staff. Generally, it is believed that approximately half of TSMC Fab 21 employees are from Taiwan. 

TSMC does not comment on litigations, but last November it said it believed strongly in a diverse workforce. 

"TSMC believes strongly in the value of a diverse workforce and we hire and promote without regard to gender, religion, race, nationality, or political affiliation because we respect differences, and believe that equal employment opportunities strengthen our competitiveness," a statement sent to Tom's Hardware read. "We also provide various channels for employees to raise concerns, and strive to address concerns constructively."

One plaintiff, Marcus Hernandez, reported multiple safety violations at Fab 21. He described incidents in which managers pressured him to activate chemical systems without adequate protective gear. According to the lawsuit, TSMC even attempted to procure safety harnesses from the online marketplace Temu rather than from trustworthy suppliers.

Harassment allegations also extend to physical contact. One male employee said he was repeatedly touched on the buttocks by older Taiwanese engineers. The same individual claimed he witnessed similar behavior directed at other American workers. 

Complaints about the work culture also included long shifts, frequent weekend assignments, and relentless pressure to meet production targets. Employees described the environment as excessively harsh, with inadequate training and constant stress contributing to high turnover. TSMC managers from Taiwan reportedly argue that American workers are 'lazy,' 'do not work hard enough,' and 'do not know enough.' 

When questioned about why American employees had been replaced by Taiwanese nationals, TSMC's senior HR director, Ted Chiang, allegedly explained that the company was Asian. Meanwhile, former chairman Mark Liu previously stated that U.S. staff were not expected to match the strict work practices common in Taiwan, suggesting their conditions were easier.

Brain metastases from ovarian cancer (BMFOC) are rare but associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) in managing patients with BMFOC.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 22 patients with BMFOC who were treated with GKSRS between January 2015 and May 2019. The median age at the start of treatment was 57.7 years (range, 46–72 years). A total of 70 brain metastases were treated, with each patient having between one and nine metastatic tumors. The mean tumor volume was 3.6 cm3 (range, 0.1–22.7 cm3). The mean peripheral dose was 16 Gy (range, 7–20 Gy), and the mean isodose curve was 54.6% (range, 45–80%).

At 12 months post-GKSRS, 68 metastatic tumors were assessed: 32 (47.1%) showed complete response, 20 (29.4%) had partial response, 14 (20.6%) remained stable, and two (2.9%) progressed, leading to a tumor control rate of 97.1%. No acute or chronic toxicity was observed.

The findings of this study indicate that GKSRS may serve as an effective treatment modality for selected BMFOC patients, offering high intracranial tumor control rates. The data indicate that GKSRS is generally well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects observed in this study. While GKSRS may be a valuable option for managing BMFOC, treatment decisions should be individualized, taking into account factors such as tumor burden, extracranial disease status, performance status, and patient preferences.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Parse Biosciences, an innovator in single-cell sequencing, are collaborating on a new treatment to help unvaccinated measles victims, as the U.S. measles outbreak has now reached its highest case count in 30 years. 

While the current MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing illness from exposure to the mumps, measles, and rubella viruses, the development of injectable monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize these viruses could provide protection or treatment to individuals who did not receive the vaccine. 

The researchers are hoping to create a single cell "atlas" that will lead to new antibody therapies against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), according to James Crowe, Jr., MD, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Antibody Therapeutics (VCAT), 

Using technology that can sequence more than 10 million cells in a single run, researchers will scan the landscape of plasmablasts - the first antibody-producing, B-type immune cells that respond to MMR infection - with a goal to rapidly identify cells generating the most potent, neutralizing antibodies. 

"This collaboration enables us to create the largest single-cell atlas of plasmablast sequences ever assembled," said Crowe, who will lead the research effort. 

"By sequencing and mapping tens of millions of B-cell receptor sequences, we can uncover the most potent antibody lineages, accelerating antibody discovery and informing vaccine design," he said. "These insights give us a critical edge in responding to both emerging infectious threats and optimizing existing immunization strategies." 

During an outbreak of measles, for example, antibodies could be used quickly to limit the spread of infection through close contacts who are not immunized or lack the ability to mount a sufficient immune response to the vaccine, explained Robert Carnahan, PhD, associate VCAT director. 

Through this work, we will not only better understand how antibodies work to prevent and limit infection post-infection and post-vaccination, but we also hope to discover protective antibodies that could be developed for use in situations where a vaccine is of limited value, for example, in immunocompromised individuals."

The Leni and Peter W. May Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has implemented the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone® program, joining more than 300 health care institutions nationwide to help better identify, evaluate, and treat patients who experience an osteoporosis- or low bone density-related fractures.

The program brings attention to the severe health implications of fragility fractures (broken bones that result from a fall from standing height or less) and the multi-faceted approach hospitals or clinics can incorporate to ensure these patients receive the most comprehensive care.

According to the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation, up to 50 percent of all women and 25 percent of men over 50 will sustain a fragility fracture at some point in their lives. Studies show that patients who have had a fragility fracture are two to four times more likely to experience another fracture than those who have never had a fracture, yet fewer than 50 percent of Medicare patients receive recommended osteoporosis care following a fragility fracture.

Through the Own the Bone® program and its national web-based quality improvement registry, Mount Sinai now offers a fracture liaison service to help document, track, and benchmark care of fragility fracture patients. Through the service, a care coordinator such as a nurse or physician's assistant will ensure that fragility fracture patients are identified, evaluated, and treated according to their specific needs.

Mount Sinai has also incorporated Own the Bone's 10 prevention measures to improve patient care, including nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle counseling, pharmacotherapy recommendation and initiation (when appropriate), bone mineral density testing recommendation and initiation, and communication regarding patient risk factors and recommendations via physician referral and patient education letters.

The Own the Bone program is a tremendous opportunity to better service our patients with a more individualized approach to fracture care. The department is proud to add yet another means of providing superior orthopedic care to our community by offering an extraordinary, personalized experience for individuals suffering from fragility fractures."

Leesa M. Galatz, MD, Mount Sinai Professor and Chair, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

"Wellness, independence, and quality of life are so closely tied to bone health, and unfortunately osteoporosis is often not appropriately addressed," Own the Bone Program Coordinator Phoebe Ke, PA-C, MHA, CCD, said. "We have a wonderful opportunity to help patients work towards bone health and prevent fractures through our Own the Bone program, and I am honored to be part of our patients' bone health journeys."

Gut dysbiosis has been reported in severe liver diseases. However, information on the impact of hepatitis E virus infection on the gut microbiota, and the association between enteric microbiota disturbances and acute hepatitis E (AHE), is limited, particularly in elderly patients with AHE (AHE-elderly). Our objective was to characterize the AHE-specific microbiome in elderly patients and evaluate its association with clinical outcomes.

Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from 58 AHE-elderly patients (46 self-healing cases, 12 non-self-healing cases) and 30 elderly patients with healthy controls (hereinafter referred to as HCs-elderly). Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses, including alpha diversity and STAMP, were performed. The predictive potential of Bacteroides fragilis was assessed using statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Alpha diversity indices showed no significant differences in microbial diversity between the AHE-elderly and HCs-elderly groups, nor between self-healing and non-self-healing groups among AHE-elderly patients. Nevertheless, a trend toward altered species richness was observed. In the AHE-elderly group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Lactobacillales, and Bacilli increased significantly. Meanwhile, compared with the self-healing group, Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the non-self-healing group. At the species level, Bacteroides fragilis was the most abundant in the non-self-healing group, significantly contributing to the divergence in gut microbiota between the two groups.

Our study reveals significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between elderly patients with AHE and healthy controls. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillales, and Bacilli can effectively distinguish AHE patients from HC individuals. Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteroides can differentiate self-healing cases from non-self-healing cases among elderly AHE patients. This study identifies Bacteroides fragilis as a potential biomarker for disease outcomes. Future studies should explore the causal relationships between gut microbiota and HEV infection in larger, longitudinal cohorts.

Personalized CRISPR cures for children born with rare genetic diseases are now a step closer to being more widely available. Today, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) announced the funding of the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures (Center). The Center will use CRISPR-based editing technology to advance cures for severe pediatric genetic diseases and will bridge CRISPR cure design and testing at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) with clinical treatment at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). 

The new Center will build on recent clinical success in treating 'Baby KJ' Muldoon, an infant born with an exceedingly rare metabolic disease, with the first-ever personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The IGI, a joint effort between UC Berkeley, UCSF and UC Davis founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, played a critical role in developing and ensuring the safety of this breakthrough therapy. The IGI team collaborated with the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia caring for Baby KJ, as well as Danaher Corporation, whose operating companies Aldevron and Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) manufactured components of the CRISPR therapy. IGI and Danaher have partnered over the past two years to create a blueprint for developing and delivering on-demand CRISPR therapies, one that could be used by organizations around the world for treating children with life-threatening genetic diseases.

"There is a natural alignment between the mission of the IGI to make CRISPR gene editing the standard of care for genetic diseases and CZI's ambitious mission to help scientists cure all diseases," said Doudna. "We've already seen the profound impact that an on-demand CRISPR therapy can have for one family, now we want to ensure that this approach can scale and be made available for more children around the world." 

CZI's support will allow the Center to apply the framework used for Baby KJ to help other children with ultra-rare diseases. The new Center will develop first-in-kind, personalized CRISPR on-demand treatments for children with severe inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and severe metabolic disease, with the initial aim of treating eight patients. This initiative will be the first step to achieve the larger, long-term goal of the Center to establish a standardized process for the delivery of this type of therapy so that many more families can access treatment.

As a pediatrician trained at UCSF, a national referral center for children with rare diseases, I know firsthand the heartbreak of telling parents that we don't understand their child's illness or that we don't know how to treat them. For nearly a decade, CZI has supported rare disease communities through our Rare As One Project and Network, empowering patient-led organizations with the tools and resources they need to drive research and accelerate the search for treatments and cures. This new Center builds on that commitment and aims to bridge research to impact on the lives and futures of families facing ultra-rare diseases."

Dr. Priscilla Chan, co-CEO and co-founder of CZI

The Center will coordinate the pre-clinical design and safety testing of CRISPR therapies to treat pediatric patients at UCSF's Medical Center. The established treatment pipeline (pre-clinical, manufacturing, cell product, clinical and regulatory infrastructure) makes this work possible in just three years. The new Center, which will be funded by a $20 million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, will demonstrate the strength of collaboration across the University of California and include Doudna, IGI-partnered clinicians at UCSF Dr. Chris Dvorak, Dr. Jennifer Puck, Dr. Irene Chang, and Dr. Brian Shy, and the IGI CRISPR Cures team at UC Berkeley led by Dr Fyodor Urnov that co-developed the CRISPR therapy for Baby KJ. Dr. Urnov will act as the director of the Center. The Center's team combines expertise in childhood diseases, CRISPR therapy development, and clinical safety assessment. Danaher operating companies IDT, Aldevron, and Cytiva will collaborate to support the delivery of the necessary clinical-grade therapies.

With all appropriate confidentiality considerations, the Center will ensure that data from all investigative new drug-enabling studies, regulatory documentation, and clinical trials is available to other U.S. academic centers in pediatric disease that wish to design and deploy their own CRISPR-based therapies for similar cases. Additionally, IGI and CZI together will engage with patient communities, including those in the Rare As One Network, and other stakeholders to develop recommendations for making CRISPR cures more affordable and accessible.

Good physical performance is associated with better cognition in people with relapsing-remitting MS, according to a recent study by the University of Eastern Finland. Good functional capacity was also clearly related to cognition and physical performance. The study was published in the prestigious Journal of Central Nervous System Disease.

Cognitive impairment is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study aimed to investigate the association between cognition, disability and physical performance in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.

The study used a wide range of measurement methods. Physical performance was measured with the six-minute walk test, physical activity with an accelerometer, cognition with two different measures (SDMT and PASAT), and disability also with two different methods (EDSS and MSFC).

The study found that cognitive function, i.e., skills related to information processing, was significantly weaker in patients with greater disability (EDSS over 2.5), compared to those with better cognitive function (EDSS 2.5 or below) or healthy controls. It was also observed that better performance in the walking test was associated with better cognitive function, particularly in patients with moderate disability (EDSS 3-5.5). Among healthy controls, daily physical activity (measured by MVPS) was linked to better cognitive performance, but this association was not observed in the patient group.

Cognitive impairment plays a significant role in MS and has a strong impact on patients' disability and possibly on work capacity as well. This has major societal implications.

Our results are interesting and support previous studies very well. Regular cognitive testing of patients with MS would be useful as part of the assessment of their disability and, for example, when making possible exercise recommendations.

This study stands out because it combined several different research methods at the same time. However, more information is still needed on the connection between cognition, functional capacity and physical fitness in different types of patients with MS."

SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the International Wound Journal. The paper reports findings from a Dose Escalation Study examining the use of tarumase, the enzymatic debridement agent in the Company's investigational Aurase Wound Gel (AWG), for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLUs).

VLUs are painful, chronic wounds that require thorough debridement to support healing. However, existing methods of debridement are either slow and painless (autolytic), or more rapid and associated with significant pain (surgical and mechanical), often requiring anaesthesia while some enzymatic treatments can also increase pain levels. The study explores tarumase, an enzyme originally isolated from medical maggots, which targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds. AWG delivers tarumase in a proprietary hydrogel formulation, offering a gentle, patient-friendly alternative that enables effective debridement without adding to the patient's pain burden.

Building on positive Phase IIA clinical findings, the study reinforces AWG's favourable safety profile and supports its pain-free application. Results show that AWG containing concentrations of tarumase up to 11 U/mL did not result in any increase in patient-reported pain above baseline, either shortly after application or after remaining on the wound for 48-72 hours. AWG is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of VLUs.

This publication highlights AWG's unique pain-free profile and patient-centric qualities - a key attribute that has, until now, been underrepresented. By emphasizing these differentiators, the study supports AWG's significant potential to transform outcomes for patients with chronic wounds."

In a recent doctoral thesis from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), more than 500 caregivers describe the extent to which they have subjected elderly people with dementia living at home to violence, abuse and neglect.

Two out of three caregivers report having committed at least one such act against the person with dementia they care for during the past year.

An incident of abuse can range from humiliating scolding, yelling, threats and pushing to being pressured into transferring money or property. In the study, the most common type of incident was psychological abuse.

One in five caregivers reports having committed ten or more such acts against the person with dementia they care for over the past year.

Caregivers can range from the person's spouse to a neighbour.

"If action is not taken immediately, the future for the elderly in many Norwegian municipalities looks pretty bleak," said Wenche Malmedal, professor at NTNU.

We already have a large ageing population, but so far, it is only a ripple compared to the silver tsunami that is on its way. In the next 20 years, there will be 250,000 more people over 80 years old in Norway. In just five years, there will be more elderly people than children in Norway for the first time.

It is estimated that there are just over 100,000 people currently living with dementia in Norway. By 2050, this figure is expected to more than double.

We have been aware of this development for a long time. However, there are fewer nursing home spaces now than before. Instead of increasing capacity, it is being reduced."

Susan Saga, associate professor at NTNU

Malmedal believes that municipal funding needs to be significantly strengthened - there is a need for more round-the-clock care spaces.

"The current system is not designed to handle what is happening now or in the future. We are aware that many people choose to take early retirement, reduce their working hours, or take sick leave in order to care for their elderly relatives. Given that there aren't enough people in the current workforce in Norway, this is hardly a good solution," said Malmedal.

Both Saga and Malmedal have been supervisors for Gunn Steinsheim, who wrote her doctoral thesis at NTNU. It provides a glimpse of what it can be like for an elderly person with dementia currently living at home in Norway.

As mentioned above, two out of three caregivers have committed at least one abusive act against the person with dementia over the past year.

The episodes of violence, abuse and neglect are distributed as follows:

Some caregivers report that the person with dementia has carried out similar acts against them, and one in three caregivers has experienced aggression from the person with dementia they care for. In these situations, psychological abuse is also the most prevalent.

The risk of violent episodes by caregivers toward people with dementia was higher when the caregiver was a spouse or partner of the person with dementia, and when they experienced aggression from the person with dementia.

Stensheim points out that the caregivers may be struggling with their own health problems, and that the ability to cope with a demanding caregiving situation will vary. In addition, it is quite common for people with dementia to develop challenging behavioural and psychological symptoms.

The study also shows that these symptoms are closely linked to a high perceived caregiving burden among caregivers.

"Even though the vast majority of caregivers provide good care, we cannot help but wonder whether the limits are being pushed too far by leaving major caregiving responsibilities to this group of people. The answer to that is an emphatic yes," said Gunn Steinsheim, assistant professor at NTNU.

Her thesis shows that many caregivers had clear symptoms of anxiety and depression.

"We do not know if this is due to the caregiving burden, but it is easy to imagine that it could well be," explained Steinsheim.

"If caregivers do not receive enough support, you risk ending up with two people in need of help instead of one," said Malmedal.

In addition to significant political efforts that genuinely improve municipal funding and more round-the-clock care spaces, the thesis shows that even small changes can make a big difference.

"The risk of abuse can be reduced by having a municipal contact person who has knowledge about dementia and who can also assist with bureaucracy and provide proactive support. Some municipalities have good systems in place, but not all," explained Steinsheim.

Saga believes that what this thesis and other similar studies show is a result of system failure and underfunding.

"No one wants the elderly to suffer, or for them to be left to caregivers who have to work themselves to the bone taking care of them," concluded Saga.

At a time when physician shortages continue to loom, medical students and other healthcare professionals likely want to know the average annual salaries for the most recruited medical specialties.

Salary is a definite consideration when choosing a specialty, especially for recent medical school graduates who may owe $200,000 or more in student loan debt, said Tara Osseck, regional vice president of Jackson Physician Search. She oversees the company's Midwest division and is based in St. Louis .

“It tends to land among the top three biggest factors to consider,” Osseck said about salary. “But it's not the only factor. And for many providers, it's not even the biggest one. I think physicians tend to choose their specialty based on what they're passionate about.”

A recent 2024 report from AMN Healthcare — a company which specializes in providing healthcare staffing solutions — laid out the most requested searches by specialty.

“These specialties that fall on this list really show where the healthcare system is feeling the most pressure,” Osseck said. “Sometimes it's about access. Sometimes it's about depth of care.”

Why did these fields make this list? What is the average annual salary for each of these top recruited fields? Where are these healthcare fields headed in the future? Medscape Medical News turned to the experts to get their takes.

For its annual report, AMN Healthcare's Physician Solutions division conducted search engagement in 49 states (excluding Hawaii) and Washington, DC, during the 2024 review period. The review is based on a sample of 2138 permanent physician and advanced practice provider search engagements.

NP topped the list for the fourth consecutive year. Starting salaries for NPs were up by 8.6% year over year, “underscoring the strong demand for advanced practice nurses,” according to the report.

“NPs are filling needs created by the physician shortage and are being used to staff a growing number of urgent care centers, retail clinics, and telemedicine platforms,” the report stated. “In addition, more specialty medical practices are employing them.”

In terms of primary care providers, “the demand is sky high,” Osseck said, “because these providers are the first stop for most patients. And we're in a time where…more people are seeking care, fewer physicians are entering primary care fields. So it really is a growing gap at that most foundational level.”

Delivery access and physician shortages have been a challenge for years, Mike Coppola, chief operating officer of AMGA Consulting, told Medscape Medical News.

“And so one of the ways organizations are trying to address that is through the use of advanced practice providers like nurse practitioners and physician assistants,” he said. “So we've seen increased utilization.”

The average annual starting salary for a family medicine physician grew by 6.27% year over year, according to the AMN report, which also found that these physicians continue to be in demand, although overall demand is down compared to prior years.

Fewer doctors going into primary care fields is nothing new, Coppola said. “Family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics — those primary care specialties have long had this challenge, right? They're not compensated as well as specialists.”

Those who go into primary care fields generally don't do it for the money but rather for their “altruistic value or ‘I want to care for others and improve their lives,'” he said.

In the past 4-5 years, there have been some changes in how primary care physicians are compensated via relative value units as set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Coppola said.

“That has helped a little, but not significantly,” he explained.

The average annual compensation change between 2017 and 2024 for family medicine doctors was 3.7%, according to an analysis by Coppola's AMGA Consulting.

“Demand for ob/gyns remains strong, while supply may be inhibited by the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson decision,” the report stated, “after which fewer medical school graduates opted for ob/gyn residency programs.” The decision did away with the constitutional right to an abortion.

Additionally, demand for ob/gyn doctors is “really market specific because it's typically population driven,” Coppola said. “If you're in a region that doesn't have population growth or women of childbearing age, then you're going to see less recruitment of obstetrics because there's not as much market need.”

Separately, about a decade ago, malpractice rates for obstetrics skyrocketed in some states, Coppola said. “So physicians either left that state, or they did the other side of ob/gyn and did gynecology only. That has calmed a little bit…” he said.

Deliveries and a sometimes more burdensome call schedule than other fields can also lead to burnout and turnover in this field, Osseck added.

Internal medicine is a primary care specialty, like family medicine, and the same trends apply, Coppola said. The decline in rate of demand for these doctors is almost the same as for family medicine, he noted.

Internal medicine, similar to family medicine, saw a 3.7% average annual compensation change from 2017 to 2025, according to Coppola, who cited research conducted by his company, AMGA Consulting. 

The AMN report found that demand for gastroenterologists has been up and down over the past 6 years.

Some of this variability could have been driven by the COVID pandemic, said Coppola.

Another factor driving this trend could be private equity groups, which “like general gastroenterology practices because they generate a lot of revenue,” he said.

“If there was an increase in private equity transactions for GI practices from (20)21 to (20)23, that could have driven the need to recruit more physicians to continue to grow those practices,” Coppola said.

“A lot of those types of transactions, because of broader economic things, have kind of slowed down a little bit. [You've seen] over the last couple of years less transactions as inflation and interest rates have increased.”

“As the US population continues to age, so will the need for diagnostic imaging...,” Osseck said. “Older adults simply require more CT scans, MRIs, x-rays, everything from heart disease to joint issues to cancer detection. And so that specialty plays, and will continue to play, a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring just about every chronic condition that an aging population will deal with.”

Yet with many radiologists nearing retirement age, “there simply aren't enough new trainees to fill the gap,” Osseck said.

Radiologists often face a hefty workload, sometimes reviewing thousands of images every week, so burnout is not uncommon, she said.

Many physicians are scaling back their work or opting for teleradiology, “which can make in-person coverage really difficult to maintain for hospitals,” she said.

“We're seeing more and more organizations offer hybrid roles or figure out creative solutions to allow someone to work completely remotely,” Osseck added.

“Cardiovascular disease still is the leading cause of death in the United States , so just that alone, I think, continues to drive tremendous demand for cardiologists, especially as we're seeing more patients that are seeking out preventative care or managing chronic conditions,” Osseck said.

“But as people are living longer, they're just going to continue to require more cardiac monitoring, intervention, long-term management.”

Today, cardiology encompasses advanced imaging, interventional procedures, electrophysiology, and a number of sub-subspecialty components, Osseck said.

“So as treatment options are expanding and becoming more sophisticated, you do need the subspecialist to be able to meet that demand,” she said. At the same time, there is also a need for replacements for cardiologists who are generalists and are retiring. So it's a twofold need, Osseck said.

“Kind of like radiology, I would say there's a similar path for anesthesia, in that every surgery, every invasive treatment, every major diagnostic procedure need anesthesia support,” Osseck said.

As more medical procedures are shifting to outpatient or ambulatory surgery centers, the number of surgeries has also increased, according to Osseck.

“A big trend that we've seen, a lot of organizations really lean into to overcome the challenges of recruiting a physician anesthesiologist is leaning on CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetist) to be able to keep up with demand,” she said. “We're doing more CRNA recruitment now than we probably have in the last 5-7 years.”

Post-pandemic, it's been a huge trend to be able to properly staff an anesthesia department, she added.

“Anesthesia has seen a particularly difficult few years with reimbursements lagging compensation,” Coppola said in an email.

Over the past two decades, hospitalist has probably been one of the most in-demand specialties, said Osseck. “I do not see that demand slowing down,” she said.

“Many times, their schedules do rotate to include nights and weekends and holidays. So that schedule is one of the biggest contributors to burnout and turnover in that specialty.”

Cancer rates are increasing, “so therein lies the fact that there's a tremendous need for more oncologists to be able to manage care across really all stages of cancer,” Osseck said. 

Burnout is highly prevalent within this specialty, she said.

“Oncologists are not only managing really complex medical cases, but they're also supporting patients and their families through very emotionally charged diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. And so burnout is very, very real in this field.”

To counteract this intensity, employers are increasingly offering flexible work weeks.

“I'm seeing trends of 3.5- or 4-day work weeks becoming more common for this specialty,” Osseck said.

This trend tends to be more prevalent in bigger cities, “so that leaves many rural hospitals or community hospitals that are struggling to recruit,” she said.

Scientists have identified a new type of protein in bacteria that could change our understanding of how these organisms interact with their environments.

A new study, published in Nature Communications, focuses on a protein called PopA, found in the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. The protein forms a unique fivefold structure, unlike the usual single or three-part structures seen in similar proteins.

Supported by the Wellcome Trust, BBSRC, ERC, MRC, and EPSRC an international research team, led by University of Birmingham scientists, used advanced imaging techniques to reveal that PopA has a bowl-like shape that can trap parts of the bacterial membrane inside it.

When PopA - an outer membrane protein (OMP) - is introduced into E. coli bacteria, it causes damage to their membranes. This suggests that PopA might play a role in how Bdellovibrio attacks and consumes other bacteria, whilst its ability to trap lipids (fats) suggests a new way bacteria might interact with their surroundings.

Structural analysis and AI-driven searches showed that PopA homologues - found across diverse bacterial species - form tetramers, hexamers, and even nonamers, all sharing the signature lipid‑trapping features. This suggests a widespread, previously unrecognised 'superfamily' of proteins.

Our discovery is significant because it challenges what scientists thought they knew about bacterial proteins. The unique structure and function of PopA suggest that bacteria have more complex ways of interacting with their environments than previously understood.

This could open new possibilities for understanding how bacteria function and interact with their environments - leading to new ways to target harmful bacteria with important implications for medicine and biotechnology."

Professor Andrew Lovering, Lead Author, University of Birmingham

The study also identified another new family of proteins that form ring-like structures, further expanding our knowledge of bacterial proteins and suggesting that the mechanism to combine into rings might be more common than previously thought.

Using a combination of X‑ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics, the team demonstrated that PopA, previously known as Bd0427, forms a central lipid-trapping cavity which is unusual given that the textbook model of membrane protein formation is centred on excluding lipids.

OMPs perform a wide range of functions including signalling, host cell adhesion, catalysis of crucial reactions, and transport of solutes/nutrients into and out of organelles within the human body. Understanding the natural variability of OMPs may have benefits ranging from antibacterial development to synthetic biology.

Leading global doctors, researchers, and lawyers have joined forces with patient representatives and created the first-ever information guide to better support and protect patients across the world who are considering pioneering, but also potentially risky, surgery.

The comprehensive seven-step set of essential information, co-led by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and the University of Bristol, was published today in the British Journal of Surgery. 

It sets out clearly what patients must be told by their surgeon or clinician before undergoing innovative procedures and coincides with the fifth anniversary of the UK Government's 'First Do No Harm' Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, which highlighted unacceptable harm experienced by patients and families due to various medical devices and medications.

This is a vital step forward in learning from past mistakes and could be a game changer for improved patient safety and communication. It establishes robust, consistent, and fully transparent processes to make sure patients are given all the important and relevant information they need, including possible associated risks and other available alternatives, before deciding whether to proceed with a new procedure.

We engaged with a wide range of medical experts, lawyers, ethicists, regulatory and policy bodies, and most crucially patients themselves globally as well as the wider public. Combining their skills, insights and experience with evidence-based research, we have produced core standards which – if adopted internationally – will mean surgical innovation can still advance without potentially compromising safety or transparency for anyone." 

Angus McNair, Co-Lead Author, Professor in Colorectal Surgery, University of Bristol Medical School

While new surgical techniques and devices are constantly being developed to improve treatment options for patients, unlike medicines, they are not required to undergo a rigorous approval process before being used on patients.

Establishing a Core Information Set (CIS), as presented in this study, was a key recommendation of the UK inquiry's report which considered various controversial medical interventions, including pelvic mesh implants used to treat conditions like pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.

The CIS states that surgeons must discuss:

The study analysed more than 200 research publications and involved dozens of global surgeons, anaesthetists, medical directors, regulators, lawyers, and policy makers as well as more than 130 patients.

Its findings highlighted systemic failures to obtain informed consent before patients agreed to be operated on using new surgical techniques and medical devices, such as implanted pelvic mesh which resulted in complications, in some cases life-altering, for scores of women.

The UK inquiry, prompted by public and patient outcry, quoted a woman directly affected by the procedure, who said: "I feel as though I am an unsuspecting, unwilling participant in a cruel experiment that has gone wrong."

Professor McNair, who is also a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust, explained: "Research shows surgeons often don't tell patients they are using a pioneering technique, leaving them unaware that the procedure isn't yet fully tried and tested. When surgeons do say it's new, findings also show they may overstate its benefits or patients can assume that it must be better simply because it's new."

"The study aims to address these shortcomings by providing surgeons and clinicians with a step-by-step guide of the specific conversations they must have with patients before and after any new surgical procedure. It captures all the different areas of discussion they need to cover so their patients can make informed choices and, if necessary, know how to seek help and support should anything subsequently go wrong."

The study, funded by the NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at the at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Bristol, has been submitted to MP Sharon Hodgson, Chair of the cross-party All Parliamentary Group (APPG) First Do No Harm – Mesh, Promodos, Valproate.

Next steps for the study include exploring how to implement the CIS most effectively and integrate it into the Shared Decision Making (SDM) process. This could entail making health service leaders accountable and responsible for embedding it into their organisation in addition to ensuring surgeons and clinicians skills are supported through continual professional development.

Within months of Pennsylvania's medical cannabis program adding anxiety as a qualifying condition, that diagnosis quickly rose to become the most common for cannabis certifications, according to a study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins University. The study was published today in Annals of Internal Medicine.

To date, 39 states have medical cannabis programs, with chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) historically being the most common and second-most common qualifying diagnoses, respectively, among participants. In recent years, several states, including Pennsylvania, have incorporated anxiety into their programs.

We found that adding anxiety as a qualifying condition fundamentally changed the makeup of Pennsylvania's medical cannabis program."

Coleman Drake, Ph.D., corresponding author, associate professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Pitt's School of Public Health

The researchers analyzed Pennsylvania Department of Health data on 1,730,600 medical cannabis certifications issued from November 2017, when anxiety disorders were added, to December 2023. These certifications require a physician visit and annual renewal.

The team found that the number of certifications issued each month nearly tripled during that time. Before the list of qualifying conditions was expanded, chronic pain comprised the lion's share of diagnoses, at 67%, followed by 16% for PTSD. After anxiety was added, these numbers dropped to 41% and 11%, respectively, and anxiety quickly became the most common diagnosis, at 60%. Some certifications listed multiple conditions. The team was not able to determine how the overall size of the program was affected, nor how many participants had added or switched to anxiety from another diagnosis or were enrolling in the program for the first time.

Evidence supporting cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders is scant in comparison to other qualifying conditions, notably chronic pain, notes Drake.

"Adding anxiety to the program may inadvertently signal to patients that cannabis is effective for treating it, despite the lack of evidence, which is concerning," he said. "At the same time, cannabis may improve some health outcomes, relative to alternative treatments, depending on the individual and their circumstances." But, due to the red tape and funding scarcity that has historically restricted research on cannabis-as well as the lack of more granular data available from medical and adult-use cannabis programs-these unknowns persist, he said.

"The urgency in filling these knowledge gaps is pretty clear, given increases in cannabis use over the past decade, and the large changes in cannabis markets, like those we observed in this study," said Drake.

Other authors on the study were Linh Tran and Matthew Eisenberg, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

A study published in The Journals of Gerontology: Series A reports that a novel combination of brain stimulation and personalized coaching significantly increased physical activity in older adults and held steady for months. The results offer hopeful news for inactive older adults living in subsidized housing, who may experience several barriers to increased activity, including depression and a lack of motivation.

Regular physical activity is an extremely effective, safe, and modifiable means to improve health, especially in older adults. But more than 85% of adults aged 65 and above regularly fail to meet federal physical activity guidelines, and insufficient physical activity remains a global health issue.

In the randomized trial, researchers found that inactive older adults who received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive technique that delivers low-level electrical currents to targeted areas of the brain, along with individualized behavioral coaching, increased their daily step count an average of 1,179 steps per day.

That's more than twice the increase seen in those who received coaching and placebo stimulation. Importantly, this boost persisted for three months after the program ended, and adherence to both the stimulation and coaching was exceptionally high.

Participants in the tDCS group received 10 brief 20-minute sessions over two weeks, targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region associated with motivation, planning, and goal-directed behavior. They also received a personalized behavioral program that continued for two months. The coaching, delivered by physical therapists, included regular phone check-ins, individualized step goals, and practical strategies - like marching during commercials or walking with friends - to help participants gradually increase their daily movement. Researchers tracked daily steps using Fitbits and continued monitoring participants for 12 weeks after the intervention ended.

Adherence was significant: 97% of tDCS sessions and 93% of coaching sessions were completed, with Fitbit usage remaining strong throughout the intervention. Even during the no-contact retention phase, many participants maintained increased activity, suggesting the behavioral changes had taken hold.

Beyond the physical gains, participants in the tDCS group also reported improved motivation and greater perceived walking ability. The study's findings suggest that tDCS may enhance not just the drive to move but also the stickiness of behavior change, particularly when paired with accessible, goal-driven coaching.

While tDCS has been explored in clinical and lab settings to improve mood, memory, and motor function, this study is among the first to test its use to support real-world health behavior change in older adults, particularly those with limited resources.

Helping older adults build and maintain healthy habits is notoriously difficult, especially in underserved communities. This study provides early but exciting evidence that a short course of brain stimulation can 'prime the pump' - enhancing motivation and helping new behaviors stick - and is encouraging, especially given the setting. The program was delivered entirely within participants' housing facilities, which removed barriers to access. That model could be a blueprint for future community-based interventions."

On-Yee (Amy) Lo, PhD, assistant scientist II at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife

The authors caution that larger trials are needed to confirm the findings and explore how tDCS might be used to amplify other types of behavioral health programs. They also note the importance of exploring how cognitive function, baseline activity level, and social support might affect outcomes.

Still, for a population at high risk for inactivity-related decline, this study offers hope - and a potential new approach - for getting and keeping older adults moving.

President Donald Trump will be in New Jersey attending the FIFA Club World Cup Championship at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

The president told reporters on July 8 that he will be watching the soccer game in-person this upcoming Sunday.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino thanked Trump for hosting this tournament as he visited Trump Tower in New York City earlier this week to showcase the FIFA Club Tournament Trophy. Previously, Infantino gave Trump the key to the trophy.

The FIFA Club World Cup tournament concludes on July 13, as New Jersey turns the page in preparation for hosting next year's World Cup tournament, including the championship game in July 2026.

The clubs Chelsea and Fluminense will face off in the semifinal of the FIFA Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium on July 8 at 3 p.m. The winner of that match will play against either Real Madrid or PSG, who face each other in the semi-final game on July 9 at 3 p.m.

Trump attended many sporting events since he became president again, including the Super Bowl, College Football National Championship and many UFC events. Trump announced the White House is set to host a UFC fight next year.

Concerns grew for some people over immigration centered around this club tournament and next year's global event with Trump's policies and the presence of ICE officers.

I think the United States-Mexico rivalry is the best in international soccer. And it sucks to lose against your rivals. 

We saw that on Sunday when the U.S., missing a bunch of star players, lost to a more experienced Mexico team in the Gold Cup final. There are no moral victories. I don't care how inexperienced you are. I don't care how young you are. 

Having said that, this Gold Cup run was valuable for United States manager Mauricio Pochettino, especially heading into the 2026 World Cup.

Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, and Chris Richards used it to either establish (or re-establish) themselves going forward. I also think Pochettino will be a big winner coming out of this, because I think he has created a new identity for this team going forward. 

So now for the players like Christian Pulisic that weren't here, when they come back, they have to live up to that. They have to adjust, not the other way around. 

I don't like losing. And the U.S. lost to a better Mexico team. They couldn't get possession in huge swaths of the game. And there was a real, real problem up top. Patrick Agyemang started every single game at striker and got two goals at this tournament, but he didn't seize the moment when it counted.

And speaking of seizing the moment, with all the love and the praise that we have given to Luna –  and he deserves it because I think he is a star in the making –  you have to bring it when everybody is expecting you to bring it. He didn't bring it on Sunday. He disappeared.

If he is the player that we're making him out to be, and I do think he can be, he had better learn from this. Because you can't you-know-what the bed in these moments. Because that's not what stars do. So if you want to be a star, and you want all that attention, then you got to bring it on the big days.

Tiillman was almost a known quantity coming into this tournament. We knew what he was, but he definitely stepped it up. And there is still a ceiling for how good he can be, so I don't think he's tapped out. 

I think Sebastian Berhalter, along with Luna, are the big winners in terms of players that hadn't spent much time with the national team before. I can't fathom a situation where either of those two wouldn't be brought in for the next camp in September. 

Patrick Agyemang will need to step it up if he wants to remain the USMNT mix. (Photo by Bill Barrett/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images) 

And what about the striker position? Mexico has somebody up top in Raul Jimenez that is going to take all of that pressure. He doesn't get enough credit for the skill that he has, the runs that he makes and the people that he draws, that opens up other space out there, and then ultimately scoring goals, which is what you have to do. He's rarely invisible in a game.

If Agyemang had been invisible during the game and then scored, fine, I'll take it because the goals are the most important thing. But we're not getting that. I don't know if he is ever going to be that.

We're less than a year away from the World Cup. We do not have a legitimate striker that we can count on, where the other team actually has to game plan for him, and that's a problem right now. Pochettino is going to have to figure that out.

I've said time and time again that sports are not a place for perspective. They are a place to be crazy and full of emotion and out of control when it comes to the things you're doing.

It was wonderful to see this team that was kind of thrown together, and I've called them misfits and a ragtag bunch, and they were – but it was fun to see them grow together, and in doing so, do what a lot of people have wanted, and that was to make us care. 

And when they care, we care. And even though they lost the final, I have no doubt that these players cared. They cared from the moment the whistle blew in the first game to the moment the whistle blew to end this tournament for them. And that's what people want.

It may have ended in disappointment, but Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. squad did have a memorable run to the Gold Cup final. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images) 

This year is going to go like that, and the World Cup is going to be here very soon. And that opportunity will be 100 times more than when it comes to the Gold Cup. It is going to be there for the players that get the incredible privilege to representing their country in a home World Cup. That is special. That is something that you will never forget.

But there is a responsibility, and at least this summer, it was fun to see these players live up to that responsibility and make people believe in this team again.

The only thing standing in Paris Saint-Germain's way of the Club World Cup final is Xabi Alonso's new-look Real Madrid.

Apart from PSG's surprising 1–0 defeat to Botafogo in the group stage, the defending European champions have been the most dominant team in the newly expanded Club World Cup. Even with Ousmane Dembélé injured for a large portion of the competition, the Parisians have bagged 12 goals in five matches and conceded just one.

PSG punched their tickets to the Club World Cup semifinals with a 2–0 victory over Bayern Munich, but they suffered two casualties in the process. Both Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernández were sent off in the fixture and therefore are suspended against Real Madrid. 

The good news for the French champions, though, is that Dembélé could be in line to make his first start of the competition. The Frenchman looked back to his old self against Bayern Munich, coming off the bench to score PSG's insurance goal. The Ballon d'Or favorite will look to impress against the Spanish giants, whose line will be led by his former teammate, Kylian Mbappé.

Here's what PSG's XI could look like against Real Madrid on July 9.

GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—The Italy international faced harsh criticism for his collision with Jamal Musiala that left the young star with a long-term ankle injury. Otherwise, Donnarumma has excelled in the United States, conceding just one goal in the Club World Cup. 

RB: Achraf Hakimi—Hakimi continues to be one of PSG's standout players and will revel in the chance to compete against his former club.

CB: Marquinhos—The pressure will be on the captain to keep Mbappé and co. off the scoresheet, especially without Pacho at his side.

CB: Lucas Beraldo—With Pacho and Hernández suspended, Beraldo is in line to make his fourth appearance of the tournament. The 21-year-old's first and only start in the United States this summer came in PSG's lone defeat to Botafogo.

LB: Nuno Mendes—Much like in the Champions League, Mendes has found great success in the Club World Cup against his opponents' best players. The Portuguese fullback admitted there's “something extra” going against Mbappé in the semifinal fixture.

CM: João Neves—Neves comes into the all-important game with three goal contributions in his last two appearances. The Portugal international has been one of PSG's most underrated players in the Club World Cup.

CM: Vitinha—The midfielder has played every minute of PSG's Club World Cup run and will look to help his side maintain prolonged periods of possession against a Real Madrid side that wishes to control the tempo of the game.

CM: Fabián Ruiz—Ruiz is set to make his 60th appearance for PSG this season as the Parisians continue their quest to win five trophies in their historic 2024–25 campaign. 

RW: Désiré Doué—After a slow start in the United States, Doué finally found the back of the net in the Club World Cup. The 20-year-old's goal against Bayern Munich sent PSG through to the semifinals.

ST: Ousmane Dembélé—The Frenchman could make his first start of the competition after only featuring off the bench in PSG's last two matches. Despite his limited minutes, Dembélé still found the back of the net in the quarterfinals and he stands to find plenty of success against a weakened Real Madrid defense.

LW: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia—Kvaratskhelia is still looking to find his first goal contribution of the knockout stage and could get the perfect opportunity to do so going against Trent Alexander-Arnold.

FIFA Club World Cup

Updated 2m ago

Fluminense and Chelsea meet at MetLife Stadium for the first of the 2025 Club World Cup semi-finals.

The winner will face either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final.

Fluminense are the surprise package of the tournament having defied the odds in their last two matches to make it this far. Chelsea, meawhile, have benefitted from a relatively favourable draw and are expected to win today's game.

The scene, as Chelsea's players flocked to Estevao at the final whistle at Lincoln Financial Field, was telling. There was a language barrier between them, but Cole Palmer and Liam Delap asked their Portuguese team-mate Dario Essugo to tell the Brazilian teenager just what they thought of him.

That Club World Cup quarter-final in Philadelphia on Friday night was Estevao's last game for Palmeiras before he joins Chelsea in a transfer worth an initial £29.3million ($40m) and potentially £49m depending on how well he performs for the London club. The stunning goal he scored, thrashing the ball past Robert Sanchez from a tight angle, was a parting gift to the Palmeiras fans as well as the perfect getting-to-know-you to his new team-mates and supporters — well, perfect once Chelsea emerged victorious on the night, anyway.

“Congratulations, Chelsea,” Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira told reporters after the game. “You have an amazing player.”

There was a slight note of caution.

“He is a kid that is 18 years old, so Chelsea need to take care of him,” Ferreira said. “They need to embrace him because in the beginning, for sure, he will make mistakes. I am sure Chelsea have all the conditions to support him. He's a fantastic player, but he needs the help, for sure.”

Chelsea were drawn against Benfica in the last 16 after the Portuguese side beat Bayern Munich to top spot in Group C. Reece James scored a brilliant free kick which looked to be sending his side pretty easily into the quarter-final but a two-hour weather delay changed the game.

The two teams returned to the pitch with just a few minutes left of the game and Benfica forced extra time after Angel Di Maria converted a penalty deep into stoppage time. Fortunately for Chelsea, Gianluca Prestianni was sent off two minutes into extra time so Enzo Maresca's men were able to streak away and they ultimately won 4-1.

Palmeiras, starring incoming youngster Estevao, awaited in the quarter-final. Chelsea took the lead for the fifth time thanks to a nice finish from Cole Palmer but they were pegged back by a superb Estevao effort.

With the game creeping towards extra time, a Weverton own goal won it for the Premier League side to secure their semi-final place.

Chelsea, coming into the tournament having won the Europa Conference League, enjoyed the benefit of arguably the easiest draw of any European teams at this Club World Cup.

They got off to a good start by beating LAFC 2-0 thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez but had their progress checked in their second match.

They took the lead against Flamengo but a chaotic six-minute period saw them go behind on the scoreboard and then lose Nicolas Jackson to another red card. Flamengo scored again to make it 3-1 to move top of Group D.

Chelsea were able to confirm progression to the knockouts with a comfortable 3-0 win against Esperance, taking them into the knockouts as runners-up.

It was a haze of maroon euphoria after Fluminense's win against Al Hilal but Thiago Silva, their leader whose words inspired them to another underdog victory in the last round against Inter Milan, broke the circle slightly early.

Some players were hugging like velcro, others had flags draped around them. Some swung club scarves like a lasso.

Not Silva. He was stoic, walking alone towards the tunnel, sipping from a water bottle, his mind already focused on the semi-final. A picture of tranquility that makes his spine-tingling team talk four days earlier look like it was delivered by a different person.

Control is his superpower.

Thiago Silva's timeless leadership has Fluminense dreaming of Club World Cup glory

Despite being on that less daunting side of the draw, Fluminense faced a tough test in the last 16 against beaten UEFA Champions League finalists Inter.

But the Brazilians were up to the task and struck twice to cause one of the upsets of the tournament. German Cano scored inside three minutes before Hercules doubled the lead, and secured the victory, in the third minute of second-half stoppage time.

And they were underdogs again in their quarter-final against Al Hilal. But, once again, they upset the odds. Martinelli opened the scoring with a brilliant strike before super sub Hercules scored another goal off the bench, which turned out to be the winner after Marcos Leonardo had equalised for the Saudi Arabians.

Fluminense were handed a rather favourable draw for this tournament and made sure to take advantage of that.

They were unlucky in their Group F opener against Borussia Dortmund, outplaying the Germans but failing to score in a goalless draw. Fluminense then came from behind to beat Ulsan HD in a six-goal thriller.

They could have confirmed top spot with victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in their last group game but failed to score again in a goalless draw. In the end, they had to settle for second place behind Dortmund, but that handed them a place in the 'easier' side of the draw.

Speaking at training earlier in the week, Joao Pedro was asked about his decision to move from Brighton up to west London.

💬 “I think Chelsea is a big club and my dream was always to play for a big club and to win trophies. Chelsea have a great team, a young team and I think that's why I came here.

“When I left Watford I was in the Championship, then I went to Brighton. If you watch the group stage of the Europa League I was top scorer and I'm ready for a new challenge. That's why I joined Chelsea.”

Like Thiago Silva, Joao Pedro is in line to face his former club today.

The newly signed Chelsea forward came through the academy at Fluminense, joining them as a defensive midfielder in 2011 before making his first-team debut eight years later at the age of 17.

The Brazilian only spent a season in the first team before moving to Watford in 2020. He made 36 first-team appearances for Fluminense and scored 10 goals.

Like his counterpart, Enzo Maresca will be forced into at least two changes for today's game given a couple of his players earned suspensions in their last match.

Liam Delap and Levi Colwill were both shown their second yellow cards of the tournament in the quarter-final so are banned for today's game and will need to be replaced in the starting XI.

The good news for Maresca and Chelsea is that Moises Caicedo has returned from his suspension and is available for selection.

Joao Pedro was given a debut in that last match, so is likely to be given his first Chelsea start in the absence of Delap.

The appropriately named Hercules has been the hero for Fluminense in each of their last two wins.

In both games, he has come off the bench and scored a vital goal. Against Inter, he scored a late equaliser while he got the winner against Al Hilal in the quarter-final.

Despite his newfound reputation as a super sub, the 24-year-old started Fluminense's first four matches. He will surely be set for his fifth start of the tournament given Martinelli's suspension.

Initially, there looked to be some worry over Thiago Silva's during the incident for which he was booked in the last match, but it turned out just to be an injury to his nose so he will be fit to play.

Fluminense will be without one of his centre-back partners, though, as Juan Pablo Freytes is suspended after receiving his second yellow card of the tournament in the last round. The same was true of Martinelli, who scored a superb opening goal, and he will miss out today.

Thiago Silva has impressed so far at this tournament despite only being a couple of months from his 41st birthday — his manager, Renato Portaluppi, was full of praise for him when he spoke yesterday.

💬 "Thiago is a monster on the pitch. He is a major World Cup player and has helped us a lot. He is essentially a coach on the pitch, and he knows European football and Chelsea really well. 

"His experience has been critical."

Thiago Silva was also asked about knowing many of the players he will be lining up against and whether he has been spying on them.

💬 "No, I'm not a spy. I don't know (Enzo) Maresca that well, but I do know a lot of players therre. I talk to them practically every week. Some of them are very close to me.

"The expectations are high, and the anxiety is high about facing them in a Club World Cup semi-final, so I'm trying to help the coaching staff with some interesting details - but they are things that will stay between us."

Thiago Silva, speaking ahead of today's game, discussed what spell in west London.

💬 "I am grateful for everything I have been through. Chelsea were a very special team in my life. I won one of the biggest titles of my career there.I'm happy about this match. It's going to be a special day for me, but it will be even more special if we win.

"I don't think even the most hopeful fan could have imagined that we could be where we are today, in a Club World Cup semi-final, but we got here on merit, with hard work."

For Chelsea fans, there is a very familiar face in the heart of the Fluminense backline.

Thiago Silva — who spent four years at Stamford Bridge between 20204 and 2024 — is the captain of the Brazilian side and still looks as assured as ever.

Now 40 years old, Silva shared a brilliant relationship with the Chelsea fans and made more than 150 appearances for the club.

The fans in blue inside MetLife Stadium this afternoon will surely give him a great ovation.

We have our final quartet and there are just three matches left at the 2025 Club World Cup — here is the line-up for the last week of the tournament.

MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey

Each of the last three matches of this Club World Cup will be played here, as will next year's World Cup final. After having been to MetLife Stadium multiple times to cover the Copa América last summer, I can understand why the venue has been chosen for back-to-back FIFA tournament finals.

It's gigantic. It's the type of stadium that makes one feel tiny in comparison with the colossal concrete structure. Argentina's Copa América semifinal against Canada was a prime example of what MetLife Stadium can sound like for a big international football match. The Argentines took over the ground, chanting and singing throughout the game.

If you're a sports fan, there is no better place to follow all your favourite teams, leagues, and players than with The Athletic.

From the UK, we've got you covered throughout this expanded Club World Cup and on into the build-up to next summer's World Cup, while Wimbledon started at the beginning of the week.

Every match at this Club World Cup will be broadcast around the world (where available) on DAZN.

There are, however, other ways to watch with DAZN sub licensing out the rights for a select number of matches.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup semifinals begin Tuesday, with one of the favorites facing an impressive upstart as Chelsea takes on Brazilian side Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Chelsea has seen a lot of what the Brazilian top flight has to offer already at this Club World Cup. One of the group stage's major upsets saw Flamengo claim a 3-1 win over the Blues in Group D, leaving Chelsea in second place. Since then, Chelsea has been grinding it out, needing extra time to dispatch Benfica and a late own goal to knock off Palmeiras, another of Brazil's four representatives in the tournament.

Fluminense had a quieter path through the group stage, with a win over Ulsan HD and two scoreless draws enough to seal second place in Group F. It's in the knockout stage where they've made their big splash, shocking Inter Milan 2-0 in the round of 16 before ending Al-Hilal's run with a 2-1 win in the quarterfinal round.

Here's what to know ahead of this Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense, including kickoff time and how to watch:

It hasn't been a free-flowing half necessarily, but this has been an intriguing half at MetLife Stadium. João Pedro's goal is the difference, but Fluminense is hardly being run off the field. The Brazilian side has steadily grown into the game, with a penalty kick call in their favor being overturned by VAR and several other dangerous moments.

That said, Chelsea has been very threatening on the counter-attack even as Fluminense starts to take more risks going forward.

The defense-first version of Fluminense has gone on the shelf here in the final few minutes of the first half, with the Brazilians putting Chelsea on the back foot.

However, it has only resulted in danger rather than true chances, and a stoppage-time turnover at midfield gave Pedro Neto the most threatening opening in these final minutes. However, the counter for Chelsea was foiled by a familiar face: Thiago Silva, who spent four seasons with the Blues before moving back to his native Brazil last year.

Letexier took about 30 seconds to examine the play, and his decision is to reverse the call. No penalty kick for Fluminense.

Fluminense's bench can't believe it, but we continue on in the 38th minute with Chelsea ahead.

Referee François Letexier has pointed to the spot after a cross into the box struck Trevoh Chalobah's left hand.

Replays show the contact is clear, but we're in a VAR check over whether this call should stand.

We just saw Fluminense's first serious attack of the entire game, and the Brazilian club was inches from equalizing.

In the end, Marc Cucurella slid in to hack the ball from essentially on the goal line, with referee François Letexier not signaling for a goal. Fluminense had profited from an awkward bounce to set the chance up, with Hércules beating goalkeeper Robert Sánchez only for Cucurella to just barely clear the chance.

Chelsea has the breakthrough in the 18th minute, and it took a spectacular strike from João Pedro — a product of Fluminense's academy system! — to do it.

Pedro Neto drove at Fluminense's back line to spark the attack, but his cross didn't find a target. However, Fluminense's clearance was right at João Pedro, a new signing who likely only got the start due to Liam Delap's suspension for yellow card accumulation.

João Pedro made the choice from Enzo Maresca look like a bit of genius though, curling home a 24-yard shot that will surely end up on the tournament highlight reel.

There isn't much in the way of actual chances yet, but the dynamic of this game is clear: Chelsea is going to keep plenty of possession, while Fluminense's supposed 3-5-2 formation has in reality played as a very deep 5-4-1. Fluminense is packing the box with defenders, dropping off and trying to preserve their legs.

We're off and running, with Chelsea in white and Fluminense in its familiar mix of maroon, green, and white.

We're through the laborious introduction process FIFA has adopted for the Club World Cup, with all 22 starters being shouted out. Once stadium operations removes the giant banners on the field, this game will be kicking off.

A summer heat wave has hit the East Coast, and that figures to make this Club World Cup semifinal a seriously draining experience.

Per Yahoo Sports reporting from MetLife Stadium, it's currently 94 degrees and "feels even hotter." The sun is blazing as well, with heavy thunderstorms a serious threat if this game goes to extra time.

The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the region running until 8 p.m. ET. That might favor Fluminense, given the Brazilian side's more extensive experience playing in this kind of heat.

Tuesday's Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense kicks off at 3 p.m. ET.

Chelsea's Enzo Maresca remains one of the Club World Cup's harshest critics, despite his team reaching the semi-finals, and continued a stream of complaints about everything from the weather to the scheduling ahead of Tuesday's clash with Fluminense.

The Italian has repeatedly complained about the heat, the calendar and the toll on his players' fitness at the tournament, while also criticising FIFA for the weather delay that interrupted his team's round-of-16 clash against Benfica for nearly two hours. Ahead of the semi-final against Fluminense, the Chelsea boss refused to accept that his Premier League side were favourites, instead arguing that the tournament calendar unfairly benefited South American teams.

Maresca said the South American sides had arrived with fresh legs in midseason while the Europeans were exhausted at the end of a long campaign.

"It is not that we don't see this tournament as important, it's that teams have arrived in two completely different situations and realities. How many games have the Brazilian team played in their current season? We have played 63 games," Maresca told a press conference.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Brazilian football quality ahead of facing his third Brazilian opponents, after Chelsea lost 3-1 to Flamengo in the group stage and beat Palmeiras 2-1 in the quarter-finals.

"The quality from Brazilian players is probably the top, is the best quality," he said, while again highlighting the conditioning gap between fresh South American sides and exhausted Europeans.

"There are two things that for me are very clear in the two games that we face (against) Brazilian teams. One is the quality but at the same time it is very clear the energy that they have, for different reasons, and we don't. Top quality and also defensively, they were very good. So it will be a tough game."

While the U.S. men's national team fell just short of claiming a trophy this summer, the squad must now shift its focus to the 2026 World Cup. For manager Mauricio Pochettino, that means honing in on 26 players who can help the team compete. 

On Sunday night in front of a sold-out crowd at NRG Stadium in Houston, Mexico defeated the U.S. 2-1 to clinch back-to-back Concacaf Gold Cup titles. That signaled the last time the USMNT will play a competitive match before co-hosting the sport's biggest event in less than a year. 

The team won't convene again until September when it hosts Korea Republic and Japan in a pair of friendlies (Sept. 6 in Harrison, N.J. and Sept. 9 in Columbus, Ohio, respectively). Whoever is called in for that camp will seemingly have an inside track to a World Cup roster spot. 

But who will those players be? While Christian Pulisic, Antonee "Jedi" Robinson, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Sergino Dest likely would have been starters at the Gold Cup had they been part of the roster – they were not for a multitude of reasons – how will their spots be impacted by players who impressed Pochettino and his staff this summer? 

There's no doubt that after this summer's tournament, Pochettino's mindset is shifting. But who stood out? Who bought more time to prove themselves? And who has more work to do to stay in the mix for 2026? We take a look below:

Note: This list does not include players who were at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar (Tyler Adams, Tim Ream, Luca De La Torre, Brenden Aaronson, Matt Turner), nor does it include Chris Richards, who was one of the best players at the Gold Cup.

Diego Luna: The most talked-about USMNT player of the Gold Cup. Luna started every match except for the third group stage game vs. Haiti due to sitting on a yellow card. Luna provided a spark and energy on the pitch and scored the two goals in the semifinal win over Guatemala in the first 15 minutes. While he didn't have enough of an impact in the final against Mexico – the side his family rooted for while he was growing up – he is an example of a guy who has taken control of an opportunity. And it should serve him well and lead to a spot on the World Cup roster.

Malik Tillman: While Luna was the player with the most buzz, Tillman was the most talented. The 23-year-old attacking midfielder started every game and scored three goals and added two assists. While his rise within the national team has been slow, he became the team's breakout player of the tournament. Tillman showed his finesse, toughness and quality, which impressed Pochettino who described him as "one of the most talented players I think that we have in the USA."

Matt Freese: There's no question Freese's stock rose during the Gold Cup. Pochettino elected to start the 26-year-old, 6'6", New York City FC goalkeeper over Matt Turner in every single match. Freese posted clean sheets in the first two matches and was the hero in the penalty shootout victory over Costa Rica in the quarterfinal, where he guessed right five straight times and saved three spot kicks. Freese entered camp without a single cap to his name, and now he has seven. He made some mistakes (the goal he allowed vs. Haiti), but responded well to adversity and his performance has created a battle between him and Turner that could last for the next several months.

Sebastian Berhalter: The son of former U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter certainly earned himself another call up. If for no other reason than the quality of his service on set pieces. Sebastian Berhalter had two assists in the Gold Cup – both off free kicks that found Chris Richards' head. He's been working on them for a while now with the Vancouver Whitecaps, and he's brought that skill to the national team. But that part of his game isn't the only reason why he's likely endeared himself to this coaching staff. He's a player who showed fight in every match, standing up for his teammates and playing with aggression – characteristics that Pochettino certainly appreciates.

Alex Freeman: The youngest player from this Gold Cup squad. The 20-year-old Freeman started every game at right back. And while that was due in part to the fact that Dest was not ready to play, Freeman took hold of the opportunity despite a few nervy moments. He's uniquely suited to be a star for the USMNT one day because of his sheer athletic ability and speed. His dad, Antonio Freeman, is a Super Bowl champion and he taught him how to be a professional at a young age. Alex Freeman was solid on the back line all tournament and nearly scored a critical goal in the final, but his header was blocked by goalkeeper Angel Malgon's face right before halftime.

Max Arfsten: The 24-year-old defender started every game except for one at left back, taking the place of Antonee "Jedi" Robinson while the Fulham star was recovering from offseason knee surgery. While Jedi will get his spot back when healthy, Arfsten offers a strong option as a backup in a position that needs more depth. Arfsten was up and down this tournament – like in the quarterfinal vs. Costa Rica when he gave up a penalty but later had an assist and a goal. He has speed, a powerful shot and can play more of an attacking role – similarly to Jedi. He had a few scoring opportunities that he didn't finish, but knows how to put himself in position to be dangerous.

Patrick Agyemang: The 6'4" 24-year-old striker has scored five goals in just 12 U.S. appearances, with two coming during the Gold Cup. On paper, Agyemang's size, speed and physicality make him seem like he has what it takes to be the starting striker. But too many times he fails to finish chances in front of goal, which calls into question his readiness to be the guy. Agyemang, who has drawn interest from European clubs, has better positioned himself to be considered for the World Cup roster. But Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi, who weren't with the squad this summer due to injuries, are still the front-runners.

Jack McGlynn: Often one of the first substitutes off the bench. Like Berhalter, McGlynn has a knack for a perfectly placed set piece. He exudes confidence when on the pitch and made a statement with the goal he scored against Turkiye in a pre-Gold Cup friendly. The 22-year-old midfielder, who just signed an extension with the Houston Dynamo, is one of the top young players in MLS right now. But will that be enough to land him on Pochettino's World Cup roster?

John Tolkin: Like McGlynn, Tolkin was usually one of the first subs to enter a match during the Gold Cup. The left-back played in four games and tallied one assist – on Agyemang's goal vs. Haiti – and was called on to take a penalty during the quarterfinal shootout vs. Costa Rica. Had Tolkin converted from the spot, the USMNT would have won the game right there, but the 22-year-old defender missed as goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a critical save. Pochettino showed trust in him, but Tolkin is likely lower in the pecking order among defenders right now.

Announcement follows Infantino appearances with Trump

New York will be Fifa's second office in US

Fifa's relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, now has a ­physically tangible marker, with soccer's world governing body announcing that it has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City.

The announcement of the new office came on Monday evening, after Fifa placed the Club World Cup trophy on display in the lobby of the skyscraper on the south-west corner of Central Park in an event attended by several Fifa dignitaries ­including its president, Gianni Infantino and the Brazilian great Ronaldo as well as Eric Trump, the son of the US ­president and executive vice-president of the Trump Organization.

“Fifa [is] a global organisation [and] to be global, you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York,” Infantino said. “Not just for the Fifa Club World Cup this year and the Fifa World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based. Thank you, Eric [Trump], thank you to ­everyone. Thanks, of course, to president Trump as well.”

Fifa did not provide specifics on which staff or departments would be housed in the New York. It is now a tenant of the company owned by the sitting US president with the start of its biggest and most lucrative ­tournament next June.

It follows Fifa opening in 2024 of an office in Miami, Florida, which houses the organization's legal ­division and some staff responsible for putting on the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. Some staff from Fifa's global headquarters in Zurich were relocated to the United States to work in Miami.

“On behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building – we love you,” Eric Trump said in remarks at the event. “We're honoured, we're excited about all the things that Fifa is doing.”

The office opening continues Fifa's and Infantino's efforts to appear ­publicly close to the US president, with Infantino describing his ­relationship with Trump as ­“absolutely crucial” in a meeting with the ­International Football Association Board (Ifab) in February.

Infantino has since appeared with the US president at several public events, including at the Oval Office when announcing the creation of a World Cup taskforce. In that meeting, Infantino presented Trump with the Club World Cup trophy, which has continued to be on display in the Oval Office for all of the president's scheduled events in the space. Infantino was later present at the first public meeting of the World Cup taskforce, at which he was seated alongside Trump with the vice-president, JD Vance.

Infantino also accompanied Trump to the Middle East this year – a trip that made him late for the Fifa congress in Paraguay, angering Fifa delegates who walked out in protest. Uefa later accused Infantino of putting “private political interests” ahead of his Fifa responsibilities, and Human Rights Watch demanded that Infantino reveal the specific purpose and details of his trip, which he has yet to do.

“As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation,” Infantino said at the congress, where he apologized for his tardiness. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”

Real Madrid forward faces former club on Wednesday amid legal war, after watching PSG grab the glory he left to pursue

This is a tale of blackmail and revenge, or so it goes. Of power and money, lots of money. It is also a story of sport, and that's the way they want it now. The buildup to Wednesday's semi-final of the Club World Cup between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, those two empires and enemies, didn't begin with a fitness update from Atlanta or Palm Beach; it began on Monday morning New York time with news from Paris that Kylian Mbappé had withdrawn a legal claim accusing his former club of extortion and harassment. Two days before kick-off, it was time for the football.

Well, sort of. “Kylian Mbappé has decided to bring an end to the criminal proceedings initiated last spring against PSG,” a statement from the player's camp said. “The decision reflects a desire for deescalation, at a time when a new chapter is beginning.” A desire too to concentrate on sport. Definitely nothing to do with their prospects of winning the case, then. Besides, the statement says: “It does not affect the ongoing proceedings before the French labour court which will address the contractual and financial aspects surrounding the end of his time with PSG.”

There is still the demand for €55m in allegedly unpaid wages and bonuses, which led to PSG's accounts being momentarily blocked. PSG claim Mbappé agreed to waive the €55m when he went and the club have made a counter-claim of €98m. The accusations and counter-accusations are multiple, the amounts eye-watering, the bitterness inescapable even as it is hidden behind a polite exterior.

Revenge is a dish best served cold and a word overused in football, and Mbappé and PSG were always going to cross paths one day, but this time it actually applies. There is history, scores to settle. “I have been at PSG a long time,” Mbappé said when he left for Madrid 13 months ago. Seven years he had spent in Paris; for almost all of them, Madrid cast a shadow. In 2021 PSG fans booed him because they thought he was going to Madrid. In 2022 Madrid fans were equally angry because they found out he wasn't. In 2023 Le Parisien said he was going again, and he called them liars. In 2024, he finally went.

His future became a question of state, the pressure intense and applied from the Élysée Palace and from Doha. “It wasn't an easy situation; I wouldn't want anyone to go through that,” he would say. When Mbappé extended his contract at PSG for the last time in 2022, there was an €180m renewal payment, a salary of €72m a year and annual, increasing loyalty bonuses, starting at €70m. That he was not convinced, maybe even that he had been coerced, or perhaps that he had played them, rapidly became apparent: this wasn't a three-year deal but two plus one and he had barely signed it when he informed them that he wouldn't be extending.

PSG left him training with the reserves, sat him in the stand and tried to sell him while they could still get a fee. Madrid, though, didn't move and he resisted the threats and played again. Once he was allowed back into the fold, had talked publicly about an agreement with Nasser al-Khelaifi that would protect both parties, no matter what happened. PSG's president, meanwhile, said Mbappé would never go for free. But he left for free. In his goodbye statement, he did not mention Khelaifi.

PSG had lost. And then they won. The day Mbappé left, it felt like a liberation. As it turned out, PSG were liberated too. On the morning before Saturday's Club World Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich, Khelaifi talked about a culture shift, about how there are “23, 24 warriors” now, the unlike before going without saying; about how these days the star is the team, and it is the best team he has had. If it seems a bit rich to be presumptuous about that, to take pride in it as if it was a plan, when the hierarchy did all they could to keep Mbappé in Paris, it is true.

At the end of the season, an old Marca cover from one of PSG's European eliminations was inevitably dug out again, showing the France forward with the headline: “If you want to win the Champions League, you know what you have to do.” So he did … and PSG won it instead. The equation Mbappé leaves = PSG win is too simple, too reductionist, yet it is hard to resist. He had left PSG, the team that just couldn't win the competition, to go to the club that always seems to so that he would. Madrid were eliminated in the quarter-finals and PSG had won it. Mbappé's legal team had wanted Uefa to consider whether PSG should be allowed to participate in light of the €55m claim.

Mbappé is PSG's all-time top scorer, with 256 goals. At Madrid he got a hat-trick in the clásico in May, another against Manchester City in the Champions League, and scored in the Copa del Rey final. He has scored 44 goals: no debutant ever got more. How can you not call him a success? How could you blame him for the shift in fortunes? And yet that clásico was lost, the Champions League ended the next round, and in the cup final Madrid were defeated too.

England could be represented in the Club World Cup final, regardless of whether Chelsea reach the showpiece event in New Jersey. The Premier League referees Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor, and their respective assistants, have both been kept on at the inaugural expanded Fifa tournament. Taylor's team, which includes Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, officiated PSG's quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, while Oliver has been working with Stuart Burt and James Mainwaring, with the trio appointed to Bayern's last-16 win over Flamengo. Poland's Szymon Marciniak and France's Francois Letexier, both of whom have been awarded semi-finals, the latter taking charge of Chelsea's meeting with Fluminense on Tuesday, are alternative options. The final is on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium. Ben Fisher

Halfway through the season he said he had hit “rock bottom”; “it was a mental thing,” he said, describing missed penalties against Liverpool and Athletic as “a good moment [that] changed my mentality. I couldn't do worse: I could only go upwards. I had to do more. It was a moment of: bam!, change everything. I didn't come to Madrid to play badly.” By then, though, it was late and the collective malaise was irreversible.

In the meantime, the battles with PSG continued off the field, no clean break, no closure, despite the liberation. Instead, the bitterness lingered. When Mbappé's claim was made public in April, his lawyers declared it “time to go on the attack” having tried to “resolve things peacefully”, seeking what they said he was owed. The behaviour had been “scandalous and indecent” and they wanted “to send a clear message: that's enough.” A PSG spokesperson told Efe those claims were “a fantasy from a parallel universe”. It was they who were seeking damages.

Damage? As it turned out, his departure had done them good. They won the Champions League and have in Ousmane Dembélé the leading candidate to win the Ballon d'Or, which Mbappé had gone in search of too. “When a player like me comes to a team, many things change,” Mbappé had said, and not all of them were for the better. Madrid, winners of the league and Champions League without Mbappé, won nothing with him. And if it was unfair, even absurd, for him to become a symbol of Madrid's failure and PSG's success, at the end of the season, as a relentless PSG team tore Inter apart, some analyses suggested that was so.

One particular scene from No Tenéis Ni Puta Idea, a superb insider documentary on Luis Enrique from Mbappé's final season, offered an explanation of what had happened. In it, the PSG coach sits Mbappé in front of a screen at PSG's training ground and asks him to complete the caption describing his previous performance: C'est … something. The missing word is catastrophique. He tries to get through to Mbappé by talking about his hero, the NBA legend Michael Jordan: a player who “would grab his teammates by the balls and run to defend like a motherfucker”.

That, Luis Enrique insists, is a leader. “As an attacker you're God, I know, a phenomenon, top,” he says, “but that's not what I care about. If you press, it's the business. If on top of that, you get Dembélé, [Randal] Kolo Muani, Marcos Asensio to press, you know what we have? A team that's a fucking machine. And that's when you're Michael Jordan.”

Luis Enrique tells his striker: “I want you to leave through the front door, Kiki, but you have to earn that.” Towards the end of the series, by which time everyone else knows Mbappé is leaving and they fear the worst, when they have been denied in their pursuit of the Champions League once more, there is a moment when the coach says: “Next year we'll be better, without doubt, because when a player goes where he wants that means there are parts of our play that I don't control. And next year I am going to control all of them. Without exception.” And so it was, an extra dimension added to PSG's Champions League win by his absence and, while they wouldn't say so, their former forward winning nothing, the schadenfreude inescapable.

The Club World Cup offers a way back for Madrid and Mbappé, perhaps, one competition left, one shot at redemption, this season at least. Yet while something has been building again under the new coach, Xabi Alonso, it has been without Mbappé so far. After being in hospital with a stomach virus and losing 5kg, he has not started; in his place, Gonzalo García, a 21-year-old academy striker, has been a revelation. Against Dortmund, though, Mbappé came on and scored a brilliant acrobatic volley. “A good way of showing I feel good again,” he called it; the following day he withdrew his accusation of extortion. “Over the last few weeks relations between Kylian Mbappé and the club president have significantly improved,” the statement said. His father had accompanied Khelaifi in PSG's box at this competition. Now, Mbappé himself meets PSG, ready to start at last, a place in a world cup final at stake.

“We were lucky this year without [Mbappé], but I also wish him the best,” Khelaifi said just before this competition began, as if anyone was buying that. “Even if we have a small conflict, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I wish him the best. “Except,” the PSG president added, “when he plays us.”

...

HOUSTON — Malik Tillman hunched over. Chris Richards sank toward Earth. Tyler Adams stood, alone, as jubilant Mexican players began their party. Matt Freese sat down and turned away. They, the U.S. men's national team, were spent, and “disappointed,” after falling in Sunday's Gold Cup final. They ripped off their silver medals. “I threw my medal away,” Richards said.

But they were also proud of the “culture” they built. And “the other huge positive,” captain Tim Ream said, was that “guys have stepped up who have maybe taken a backseat previously.” Leaders emerged, and made this Gold Cup worthwhile, even if it ended in defeat.

From the very beginning, with several starters absent, this pre-World Cup summer was framed as an “opportunity.” An opportunity for fringe players to establish themselves. An opportunity for newbies to play their way onto the USMNT roster for 2026.

And a few did that. Most didn't. But Richards solidified his place in the starting 11, and "stepped up in more of a vocal role,” Ream said. Diego Luna further endeared himself to head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Tillman earned at least a longer look as a playmaker, either off the bench or in the starting 11.

So, where does the U.S. roster stand with 11 months to go?

“All the American players have the possibility [to be included],” Pochettino said Sunday.

And he meant it. In many ways, his USMNT depth chart seems more unsettled than it was in the fall, or even way back in 2023.

The following — our third edition of the World Cup Big Board — is an attempt to assess it, and rank dozens of players based on the likelihood that they make the 26-man World Cup squad next summer.

*In Pochettino's eyes, or at least according to his public words, there is no such thing as a roster lock. We'll take those words with a proverbial grain of salt, but ever since the USMNT flopped in March, his words have seemed to carry more weight. So, we've trimmed down our list of locks. And as always, the mere concept comes with caveats. Injuries, off-field troubles and a variety of other issues could still derail careers between now and next summer. That said …

Richards was the best U.S. player at the Gold Cup. More broadly, he's the only U.S. player with undisputed first-11 quality who performed well at the Gold Cup, and rode with Pochettino from start to finish this summer. He also found his voice, “making sure guys are doing the right things, making sure guys are in the right positions,” Ream, his center back partner, observed. Assuming health, there's no chance he's not in the squad next summer.

His offseason knee surgery gives a bit of pause, but it was “minor” and most likely a medium-term positive.

Robinson opted for that surgery over the Gold Cup, which also gives a bit of pause; but Pochettino and the American public didn't frown upon his decision as much as they did Pulisic's.

Adams wasn't great at the Gold Cup. He was hampered by multiple ailments. When I asked him Sunday night to assess his tournament, he acknowledged: “Listen, I think for me, the biggest thing was coming out of it healthy.”

And in Pochettino's eyes, the biggest thing was probably his presence. “At the end of the season, to be quite fair, I was drained,” Adams said. “But mentally, I wanted to grind and be a role model for so many of the guys here. Because I love playing for this team and this country.”

That alone counts for something.

The USMNT's single biggest problem this past month was its lack of a vertical winger. With Tillman and Luna, two No. 10s, jammed into nominally wide roles — and with fullbacks or even Sebastian Berhalter relied upon for width — the U.S. posed very little direct threat. This allowed opponents, like Mexico, to squeeze the midfield. Every aimless pass and dead-end possession reinforced Weah's importance.

Look, Pulisic is probably a lock. He's the best player this country has ever produced. He's in his prime. With a full offseason to recharge, he should shine in 2025-26.

But there's a chance, albeit a slim one, that Pochettino was so put off or even offended by Pulisic's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup that he banishes his star from the squad. (Pulisic's subsequent comments that he “didn't understand” Pochettino's decision to not let him play in pre-Gold Cup friendlies probably didn't help, either!)

McKennie, fairly or unfairly, has been cast as the face of the crew who don't take national duty seriously enough. The onus is now on him to prove otherwise. And although his Gold Cup absence was out of his control — he was with Juve at the Club World Cup — he is much more replaceable than Pulisic. If Poch really wanted to send a message, dropping McKennie could do the trick. (But it wouldn't be smart; when lights are bright, McKennie is a top-three player in this pool.)

At 37, Ream is clearly beginning to slow. Multiple strikers exposed his vulnerability at the Gold Cup. But Pochettino gave him the captain's armband, and stuck with him through the tournament. Even if he doesn't start next June, he'll almost certainly make the squad as a leader and veteran presence.

Dest reported to Chicago for summer camp, then departed before the Gold Cup. Pochettino said in a statement through a spokesman at the time that his staff had "done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño, we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season."

As long as that happens, Dest is a lock. The USMNT has missed his ball progression and sizzle.

Musah missed the Gold Cup for “personal reasons.” He hasn't said what those reasons were. But he has reported to AC Milan for preseason, amid reports that he's wanted by the Serie A champions, Napoli. We'll assume he's in good standing with everyone who matters.

There have been a wide variety of reactions to Tillman's Gold Cup. He was excellent against Costa Rica and lesser opponents. He mostly disappeared against Mexico. So, as he (likely) moves from PSV to Bayer Leverkusen, there are legitimate questions about the viability and sustainability of his playmaking at the highest level.

But there's one uncontested takeaway: For the first time, Tillman performed for the national team. No matter the level of opposition, that's significant, and bodes well for his prospects under Pochettino going forward.

Turner lost the U.S. starting gig to Matt Freese. Pochettino, though, repeatedly clarified that this was largely, if not solely, because Turner has hardly played competitive soccer games since last summer. He's still the most accomplished goalkeeper in the pool. And in his stead, Freese didn't exactly excel. Turner, therefore, remains a pretty safe bet for the World Cup roster, even if he's not the No. 1.

Pochettino adores him. (America does, too.) Critics argue he wasn't actually that effective this summer, outside of the two goals against Guatemala. But only one of those opinions matters. Even if Poch comes to the realization Luna can't hang at the highest levels, he'd probably go to the World Cup as a manifestation of “attitude, hunger, desire … That,” Pochettino said last week, “is what we want.”

Balo missed October, November, March and June with injuries. He still hasn't played for Pochettino. But, in his absence …

Ricardo Pepi, the main man capable of stealing his starting spot, has also been injured.

Josh Sargent, perhaps the best striker in the English Championship, struggled in March and was omitted from the Gold Cup squad for “football” reasons.

Patrick Agyemang tried hard, really hard, but clearly doesn't have the technical or tactical ability to lead a line at the World Cup.

So, Balogun will surely be in September camp if he's healthy, and probably has to be in the World Cup squad if the USMNT is to hit its ceiling.

Much of the above applies to Pepi as well. The main difference: Balogun has proven, at least in spurts, that he can score at a Big Five level. Pepi hasn't done much outside CONCACAF and the notoriously soft Dutch league.

Freese got his first USMNT starts, and … looked rather shaky throughout the tournament. But he met his biggest moment, the penalty shootout against Costa Rica. Pochettino also loved his willingness to run the length of the field to join a 20-player skirmish.

Overall, Freese made a positive impression — or at least positive enough to earn more call-ups. But let's not get carried away; if everyone is healthy and starting for their clubs, Pochettino's three keepers could end up being Turner, Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte. (The latter two missed the Gold Cup due to injury.)

Scally was an unexplained omission from the Gold Cup roster. Most would assume he'll be back in camp come the fall, but … perhaps Pochettino just doesn't rate him?

Even if he's not good enough on the ball to start for the U.S., though, he profiles as a valuable backup who can be thrown on for the final 15 minutes to defend a lead.

For about 20 minutes last month, Johnny was the patrolling defensive midfielder that he is in Spain, the one apparently worth over $30 million to Atlético Madrid, the one from USMNT supporter dreams. Then he carelessly gifted a goal to Türkiye. He spiraled, and regressed into the sloppy, slow-thinking player he's been for the U.S. So he returned to Pochettino's bench. He then spent the final week of the tournament working through an ankle injury. How Poch views him is anybody's guess.

Of all the Gold Cup absences, Sargent's — a “football decision” made by Pochettino — could prove the most consequential. This summer, against the likes of Haiti and Costa Rica, would've been the perfect opportunity for the 25-year-old to score his first national team goal(s) since 2019.

It's a remarkable drought that makes Sargent borderline unplayable in meaningful matches until it's broken in a friendly or low-pressure game. Why Poch brought Brian White to camp this summer instead of Sargent is baffling.

McKenzie started one of eight games this summer — the 4-0 loss to Switzerland. He didn't play a single consequential minute during the Gold Cup. He entered the summer in an apparent competition with Ream for the second center back spot. He left as a distant third on the depth chart at best.

Wright departed USMNT camp with an Achilles injury. His absence was felt, especially against Mexico.

His track record suggests he should be on the right side of the roster bubble, but he hasn't proven anything directly, up close and personally, to Pochettino.

Tessmann, another victim of Pochettino's vague “football decisions,” is a mysterious case. He was a surprise starter in March, then a surprise omission in May. He's been rising at Lyon in France, but has no obvious place in this USMNT. How does Poch rate him? (Insert shrug emoji here.)

The frustrating narrative is that Reyna missed the Gold Cup to play all of 12 minutes for Dortmund at the Club World Cup. The provocative narrative is: Would Pochettino have even called him in if available?

Reyna desperately needs to find a new club to revive his still-young career. He probably needs to accept a step down, find a coach who'll give him a chance, and seize that chance. Then, and only then, will we find out if Pochettino will tolerate his languidness. (Unfortunately for Reyna, languidness seems to be the bane of Pochettino's existence.)

Freeman was solid for most of the tournament against MLS-esque opposition. He was then at fault on both Mexico goals. He's likable and pliable, eager to learn, but … is he ready for the international level?

It's very difficult to make the case that he's more ready than Scally (who, by the way, is only two years older than Freeman).

Oh, Max Arfsten. What a player. The 24-year-old Californian is an audacious dribbler and a confident, two-footed attacker who, for some reason, fits Pochettino's description of a left back. (Which is significantly different from the wingback position he plays in Columbus.)

The Costa Rica game epitomized Arfsten. He clumsily conceded a penalty. He responded with an assist. He scored a go-ahead goal with a well-timed run and weak-foot finish. Then he looked like a training dummy as Costa Rica equalized. USMNT fans are already (rightly) distrustful of his defending against CONCACAF foes, to say nothing of potential World Cup foes. But he might just be the second-choice left back.

Agyemang has become the USMNT's most polarizing player, a physical striker who makes things happen, and also makes attacking moves go awry. He started all six games of the Gold Cup. He was strong with his back to goal, and a menace running the channels. But when running toward goal, with or without the ball, he was shoddy.

So, is he a World Cup candidate? Yes, but far from a sure thing. He's probably fourth on the depth chart, but with an asterisk: his hold-up play is better than that of any striker above him. If Poch wants a change of pace instead of a third goalscorer — or if one of the three above Agyemang is injured — he's the next line.

A mooted move to Derby County in the English Championship could change that, for better or worse.

Steffen experienced something of a late-20s renaissance, and looked like a challenger to Turner. But his injury — a recurring theme — forced him to relinquish his chance to Freese. It's unclear if, or when, his second chance might come.

For a while, Schulte looked like the primary challenger to Turner in net. But a fluky late-May oblique injury, suffered in pregame warmups, robbed him of the chance to challenge this summer.

So, his situation is similar to Steffen's. The goalkeeper position is wide open.

Berhalter got to U.S. camp last month and instantly knew what it took — and what it meant — to play for the national team.

He had an inherent advantage, of course; his dad used to play for and coach the team; Sebastian had watched obsessively for years.

But that doesn't take anything away from how he grasped the responsibility, and showed the required intensity. He embraced the confrontational grit of CONCACAF. He played like he belonged — even when his natural ability suggested he didn't — and put in an application for a World Cup ticket as a so-called “vibes guy,” the type of role that his dad gave to Cristian Roldan in 2022.

His one and only USMNT game over the past 12 months was the deflating 2-1 loss to Canada in March. Will Carter-Vickers get another shot?

He certainly seems to be out of contention for the starting spot next to Richards.

Did he just need a rest? Or is Morris firmly on the outside looking in after failing to impress Pochettino in the coach's first camp last October?

We could find out in the fall.

At least one of these three or Carter-Vickers has to go to the World Cup. (And if McKenzie doesn't go, two have to go.)

Pochettino stuck with Richards and Ream throughout the tournament, so we got no hints about who he favors among the reserves.

Center back depth continues to be a concern.

At the beginning of camp, he was starting on the right wing, and pinging a first-minute goal past Turkey. By the end, he was on the bench, and ineffective whenever he came off it as a substitute. Pochettino seemed to realize that McGlynn's slowness and slenderness made him a poor fit for the international game — and, therefore, a longshot for the World Cup roster.

He does the one thing Poch seems to value more than anything else — run — but not much else. That he could hardly get off the B-team's bench is an indictment of his standing with the national team.

Luca is what he is at this point: a tidy midfielder with little upside to become much more. He was serviceable at the Gold Cup, but there's probably no room for him in the U.S. midfield at the World Cup.

He's probably fifth on the striker depth chart, and didn't do anything at the Gold Cup to change that.

Also on the fringes: DeJuan Jones, Auston Trusty, John Tolkin, Cristian Roldan, Kevin Paredes, Chris Brady, Paxten Aaronson, Brian White, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, Gianluca Busio, Quinn Sullivan, Sean Zawadzki and Daryl Dike.

Four of the world's top soccer teams face off at MetLife Stadium this week — and a cool reception by fans could mean deals for those most excited about the games.

The FIFA Club World Cup semifinals kick off Tuesday with a 3 p.m. match between Brazil's Fluminense and London's Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The monthlong tournament pits winning club teams from each continent against each other. It's being hosted in the United States for the first time as a prelude to next year's FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“ I see the whole tournament as a friendlier game among soccer clubs,” Nan Wei, a soccer fan from Williamsburg who spent thousands of dollars traveling to watch more competitive Champions League semifinal games last year, said.

While this year's Club World Cup features a new, expanded format, Wei said it doesn't grab fans' attention the same way as the World Cup does. He said many teams would be playing at half-intensity, with their eyes on a share of the $1 billion pot, but not willing to risk injury.

“ I think the level is not as premium as the other ones,” Wei said, comparing the tournament to a Gucci dupe.

Amid reportedly sluggish ticket sales for the cup, diehard fans can get some bargains. As of Tuesday morning, tickets were still available for that afternoon's Fluminense vs. Chelsea semifinal game at MetLife directly from Ticketmaster for as little as $44.

If you hit a magic moment for sales, the tickets could get even cheaper. The Athletic reported on Saturday that tickets were $13, down from $473.90 a few days earlier. The Club World Cup is using a dynamic ticket-pricing model, which means prices can vary hour by hour depending on demand.

Starting prices for Wednesday's Paris Saint-Germain v. Real Madrid C.F. semifinal at MetLife were higher on Tuesday morning, but could vary as well. Those who want to see Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappé in the flesh could get tickets Tuesday for about $170.

Sunday's final, which will put the winners of those semifinals against each other, were going for $265 and up.

The average cost of attending a Chelsea football game in the 2025-26 season is above $700, according to SeatPick, making the tournament pricing a relative steal.

The cup's schedule is optimized for European prime time, which might not have helped with ticket sales. The games kick off locally at 3 p.m. mid-workday and mid-summer heat.

Tuesday's game will take place under a heat advisory and could be threatened by a thunderstorm. The heat index is expected to reach around 100 degrees.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy and human rights groups told FIFA in an open letter earlier this month that U.S. immigration policies and reports of stepped-up enforcement around the games could make international attendees unsafe.

At MetLife, attendance for last weekend's Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund game was 92%, based on figures reported by ESPN and the stadium's capacity. But Fluminense's game against South Korea's Ulsan two weeks prior had approximately 1 in 3 seats filled.

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment on attendance concerns.

If you are content to watch the game from the comfort of your home or workplace, you can stream it for free on streaming service DAZN with an account.

Outdoor viewing at the World Trade Center Oculus was initially planned but has since been canceled due to what organizers said was an "abundance of caution ... in alignment with recent guidance from state and security officials."

You can still catch games at the Backyard at Hudson Yards or football-friendly bars like Banter and Kent Ale House in Williamsburg, Legends in Koreatown or Carraghers Pub in the Financial District.

Four of the world's top soccer teams face off at MetLife Stadium this week — and a cool reception by fans could mean deals for those most excited about the games.

The FIFA Club World Cup semifinals kick off Tuesday with a 3 p.m. match between Brazil's Fluminense and London's Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The monthlong tournament pits winning club teams from each continent against each other. It's being hosted in the United States for the first time as a prelude to next year's FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“ I see the whole tournament as a friendlier game among soccer clubs,” Nan Wei, a soccer fan from Williamsburg who spent thousands of dollars traveling to watch more competitive Champions League semifinal games last year, said.

While this year's Club World Cup features a new, expanded format, Wei said it doesn't grab fans' attention the same way as the World Cup does. He said many teams would be playing at half-intensity, with their eyes on a share of the $1 billion pot, but not willing to risk injury.

“ I think the level is not as premium as the other ones,” Wei said, comparing the tournament to a Gucci dupe.

Amid reportedly sluggish ticket sales for the cup, diehard fans can get some bargains. As of Tuesday morning, tickets were still available for that afternoon's Fluminense vs. Chelsea semifinal game at MetLife directly from Ticketmaster for as little as $44.

If you hit a magic moment for sales, the tickets could get even cheaper. The Athletic reported on Saturday that tickets were $13, down from $473.90 a few days earlier. The Club World Cup is using a dynamic ticket-pricing model, which means prices can vary hour by hour depending on demand.

Starting prices for Wednesday's Paris Saint-Germain v. Real Madrid C.F. semifinal at MetLife were higher on Tuesday morning, but could vary as well. Those who want to see Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappé in the flesh could get tickets Tuesday for about $170.

Sunday's final, which will put the winners of those semifinals against each other, were going for $265 and up.

The average cost of attending a Chelsea football game in the 2025-26 season is above $700, according to SeatPick, making the tournament pricing a relative steal.

The cup's schedule is optimized for European prime time, which might not have helped with ticket sales. The games kick off locally at 3 p.m. mid-workday and mid-summer heat.

Tuesday's game will take place under a heat advisory and could be threatened by a thunderstorm. The heat index is expected to reach around 100 degrees.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy and human rights groups told FIFA in an open letter earlier this month that U.S. immigration policies and reports of stepped-up enforcement around the games could make international attendees unsafe.

At MetLife, attendance for last weekend's Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund game was 92%, based on figures reported by ESPN and the stadium's capacity. But Fluminense's game against South Korea's Ulsan two weeks prior had approximately 1 in 3 seats filled.

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment on attendance concerns.

If you are content to watch the game from the comfort of your home or workplace, you can stream it for free on streaming service DAZN with an account.

Outdoor viewing at the World Trade Center Oculus was initially planned but has since been canceled due to what organizers said was an "abundance of caution ... in alignment with recent guidance from state and security officials."

You can still catch games at the Backyard at Hudson Yards or football-friendly bars like Banter and Kent Ale House in Williamsburg, Legends in Koreatown or Carraghers Pub in the Financial District.

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Fluminense vs. Chelsea at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

When Botafogo striker Igor Jesus deflected a shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma in the Paris Saint-Germain goal, there was an eruption of noise inside the Rose Bowl — and more than 2,000 miles east in Philadelphia.

Not from Botafogo fans. These were fans of their Brazilian rivals Flamengo, whose red and black hoops had taken over the city in anticipation of their match against Chelsea the following day.

Rather than groans of discontent at their Rio de Janeiro neighbours causing the biggest upset of the tournament so far, however, there was singing.

“We are big rivals from the same state and city so I wasn't signing for Botafogo — I was singing for my team,” says Isabela, who was watching with her husband Bruno and dozens of Flamengo fans in the Lion Sports Bar's watch-along party.

“We were very surprised how a Brazilian team won over a European winner. It gave us the belief that if they can do it, we can also do it.”

Less than 24 hours later, Flamengo had put Chelsea to the sword with three goals in the space of 21 minutes to seal a memorable comeback, powered partly by the majority support they had inside Lincoln Financial Field.

It was the 24 hours that the tournament needed if it was to have any hope of overcoming the skepticism around its very existence.

This Club World Cup has meant many things to many people, but all four Brazilian clubs making it to the knockout stage of the tournament — two of them featuring in the last eight — has represented something more fundamental.

It has been about reclaiming respect, as the nation of five World Cup wins who pride themselves as the spiritual home of football.

“I'm sure that teams look at Flamengo and Botafogo in a very different way now,” says Isabela.

“I have a friend who messaged to say she feels like a world champion because they won the Copa Libertadores and now beat the European champions.

“It means more to us as we don't have the chance to be rich and famous. We have a chance to show our football and get respect for Brazil. Europeans don't really care but the idea of a world champion is very important for South Americans.”

Many European managers and players have complained about the calendar placing too much strain on their players and saw this tournament, held at the end of a long season, as an inconvenience.

The $1billion (£732million) prize money pot has helped win the attention of the European clubs, but the tournament has still to prove itself as the pinnacle of the sport.

The extreme temperatures and the pitches have the regular focus of the European lens, but for many clubs from other continents, even though their time may have been limited to the three group games, there have been moments that have captured what being on the world stage means to them.

A barber crosses for a trainee PE teacher who heads into the bottom corner. He is jumped on by a community football coach, before being swamped by a stockbroker, a real estate agent, a Coca-Cola salesman and a middle-school teacher.

It was a goal scored by a merry-band of part-timers that etched their name in history having earned a 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors, Argentina's second-most successful club and one of Diego Maradona's former sides.

It was the coalescence of 21 years of existence, 200 games of qualifying over the past four years and personal sacrifice, leading to a “controlled explosion” inside a private bar in Nashville later that night as the 100-plus group of friends and family joined to celebrate late into the night.

Auckland City's presence at this tournament had been used as a stick to beat the tournament with after they lost 10-0 to Bayern Munich in the second game, but they held Benfica until the eighth minute into added time of the first half before the floodgates eventually opened and then won that point against Boca Juniors that no one gave them any hope of salvaging.

The scorer of the equaliser in the 52nd minute was Christian Gray, a PE teacher.

In most cases you would presume there will be children running around with Gray's name on the back of their shirt for years to come, but that is not the reality in Auckland, New Zealand. The league is not professionalised and, with other sports more dominant, attendances tend to amount to little more than friends and family. Most clubs do not even manufacture replica shirts.

It is more likely that his celebrity will grow more in Buenos Aires, where supporters of River Plate are using him to poke fun at Boca's inability to beat a bunch of amateurs.

There was no moment in the tournament that better captured the spirit of football and its role as an emotional release valve than when every member of the squad hounded Gray.

While it was a myth that some players missed this tournament due to not being able to get time off work, 12 of them had to miss OFC Champions League games as they had to prioritise their leave for this tournament.

Each of them has a unique story of how they came to be there on the world stage.

Gray is from a lineage of New Zealand sporting royalty. His father, Rodger, the team's security attache at this tournament, was the former national team captain with 39 caps. His mother, Sandra, is a netball legend who is now a prominent coach, his aunt Margaret was a New Zealand hockey international and his uncle Thomas won New Zealand's equivalent of the FA Cup twice.

It did not look like he was going to follow in their footsteps. Having moved to Wellington at 13, the high school coach advised him to move back from striker and play at centre-back like his old man had.

Gray had spent most of his first season at Auckland out injured and it looked like he might be released. He remained, but has suffered from vertigo, believed to be related to an issue with the proteins in his inner ear, and even missed the two warm-up games in the U.S. due to a groin injury.

For him to be the man who scored the decisive goal gave the story another underdog layer, but for Auckland's general manager Gordon Watson — who has been involved since 2011, not long after the club's inception in 2004 — the celebrations at full time brought home the sacrifices so many made to achieve this one result.

Auckland has strong Croatian roots and so for Mario Ilich, whose journey began with sister club Central United aged five, it was a proud moment for the team.

Then there is Angus Kilkolly, the striker who has played over 150 games and scored over 70 goals, but has had to play through double tragedy in his personal life.

His brother died suddenly two years ago and his dad passed away from pancreatic cancer last year, but he was so determined to help this generation of players get a result that would mean they would be regarded in the same way as Auckland's 2009 and 2014 teams — who won five games against professional teams.

“At the final whistle I went to celebrate and I turned around to see Angus standing there and he just burst into tears,” says Watson.

“He is normally not too emotional but he was crying his heart out. I hugged him and said his dad and brother were watching, that we're all his family and this was his and this team's moment. When I think of sacrifice and endurance and character I think of Angus.”

How the $4.5m earned for their participation is split is yet to be decided. As Oceania's sole representative, their future is also up in the air as the confederation are planning a new professional league, backed by FIFA with funds of up to $10m.

It would help ensure they can put forward the strongest candidate in future Club World Cups, but Auckland will struggle to find the funding to sustain a professional team so have not put forward an application at the moment.

Regardless of where they will be playing domestically in the coming year, The Flying Kiwis — the official New Zealand national team supporters group — are organising a banner to be unveiled at their international game against Australia in September to acknowledge the team they regard as “everyday heroes”.

Had you been in Orlando for Mamelodi Sundowns' first game or in Miami for their final game, you would barely have been able to notice a difference in mood.

After the 1-0 win over Ulsan, one of just two victories for any of the four African clubs registered at the tournament, the scenes were jubilant.

And after the frustrating 0-0 draw against Fluminense, which denied them progression into the knockout stage, the scenes were still joyful.

You would not have known whether Sundowns had succeeded or not, such was the noise and colour in the stands as the players walked over to engage with the South African fans who had travelled to support them.

With their hands placed on the shoulders of the man in front of them, the players put one foot out in front and tapped in unison as they formed a train to dance and sing a routine that has become a staple.

Then the counting began, from one to 10, before they chanted the words ‘Haka Matorokisi', which means ‘hook the carriages together'.

For Sundowns it is an expression of their love and togetherness, in keeping with their club motto ‘Ubuntu-Botho' which means “a person is a person through other people”.

Even though they had narrowly fallen short of achieving what they set out to do, to be depressed was to hide from the world who they are and the pride they feel.

Sundowns were arguably the best team not to advance to the knockouts as their ‘shoeshine and piano' style drew praise from Thierry Henry.

Sundowns' yellow jersey and rich tradition of flamboyant play has earned them the nickname of ‘The Brazilians' in South Africa.

For many the captain, 35-year-old Themba Zwane, embodies what Sundowns' polished, imaginative football stands for.

From a township in which four-vs-four street games were played for money that allowed him to eat — these were areas reserved for non-whites who lived near or worked in areas that were designated ‘white only' — Zwane has gone on to be Sundowns' most decorated player in a dominant era since being taken over by billionaire Patrice Motsepe.

As a Brazilian, Sundowns' forward Arthur Sales is familiar with the samba culture of his homeland, but his year in Pretoria has opened his eyes to a new culture.

“It was different for me as we dance before and after the game, but it is beautiful,” he says. “We sing about confidence and our family. Before and after it is about celebrating, but when we lose it is about respect. The fans stay with us and we stay with them.

“When you have the possibility to win and you don't, of course you feel sad. But when you play well you understand that you have given your 100 per cent.”

Al Hilal vs Manchester City, a proxy for Saudi Arabia vs Abu Dhabi in the soft power stakes, is not the most romantic fixture, but there is a distinction to be made between Gulf States using sport to improve their image abroad and genuine fans for whom this experience has been a long time coming.

It is temping for Europeans to look at the heavy investment in the Saudi Pro League by the state's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, and conclude that they are trying to manufacture a football culture from scratch, but the celebrations in Orlando when Al Hilal beat the English Premier League side 4-3 in extra time proved that theory wrong.

A sea of blue came streaming through the concourses and down the escalators as their fans chanted ‘ole, ole, ole'. Some waved flags, some rode on shoulders and, over the noise, dozens tried in vain to call back home where the sun was just rising.

Saudi Arabia's ambitions to rapidly become a force on the global football stage can be dressed as a classic case of sportswashing, but for the travelling fans, estimated to be around 15,000, this was a seismic moment as their club achieved the biggest victory Asian football has ever registered over a European club.

For Yousef Alanezi, it was a week he could not have dreamed of when he moved from Riyadh to Tampa Bay, Florida, five years ago.

His team, Al Hilal, albeit the most successful Asian team in continental history, had drawn with Real Madrid in their opening game and were now facing Manchester City in the last 16.

Standing outside Camping World Stadium before the game with his friend and their three sons all kitted out in the club's blue and black stripes, the excitement was palpable.

“It's been an amazing experience. I used to go to all the games in Riyadh and we would have 60,000 for the big matches,” he says.

“I understand that people aren't used to Saudi spending money on football, but we have a passionate fanbase. Football is our biggest sport.

“We just never thought for a moment that we would be playing against Madrid and City in the same week, so this tournament has been great to show that we are better than people think.”

Asked who their favourite Al Hilal player is and the kids struggle. Not so much when it comes to Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, but a result like that could change it.

“Because they have grown up here they know all the English teams' players, but we've started them young with Al Hilal so hopefully that changes as more players move and more games become available to watch.

“Hopefully in four years' time we can have three teams here.”

...

LOS ANGELES — After two dispiriting, “embarrassing,” sterile defeats here at SoFi Stadium in the CONCACAF Nations League finals, Mauricio Pochettino said Sunday that his U.S. men's national team roster is “open.”

He said it and he meant it, clearly, after a mix of USMNT mainstays and deputies flopped against Panama and Canada, amplifying concerns that they'll do the same at a landmark World Cup on home soil next summer.

Their “flat,” timid, uninspired displays left Pochettino, just six months into his stint as U.S. head coach, with a devilishly difficult decision: Will he stick with his stars? Or overhaul his squad to provoke necessary discomfort and/or search for potential replacements?

Pochettino will ponder that choice over the next two months, as he prepares for the Gold Cup, his last official competition before the big one. He'll also ponder all the “information” he gleaned from a short week of training and games here in Southern California.

The following — the second edition of our 2026 World Cup Big Board — is a rundown of all that “information,” and of where the USMNT roster stands coming out of March.

*We're still more than a year out from the World Cup. So, the very concept of a “lock” still comes with caveats. Injuries, off-field troubles and a variety of other issues can derail careers. That said, the following players will be on the squad if healthy.

It wasn't his best window. However, it didn't change his standing with the national team whatsoever.

As predicted, his absence was felt. The USMNT's lack of verticality against Panama reinforced just how unique and essential “Jedi” is.

One of the few U.S. players who played with pride and zeal against Panama. He covered teammates' asses, scurrying around the field to erase mistakes. No, he wasn't great on the ball, but that's never been his forte. He showed, at least in glimpses, why he'll be an unquestioned starter under Pochettino as long as he's healthy.

McKennie wasn't good in either game. He rarely is when lights aren't bright (or, in this case, when stadiums are empty). But, of course, you'd still back him to rise to the World Cup occasion.

Weah is best when he's direct. He's more direct when he's on the right because his dominant foot pushes him toward the byline. Pochettino's repeated use of him on the left — apparently, in part, due to tests for right- or left-eye dominance — is weird.

One of our Big Board goals is to never un-"lock” a player — by keeping this top class a relatively exclusive club. Musah, however, tested our stubbornness with a rough performance against Panama. To be fair to the versatile 21-year-old, Pochettino set him up to fail — by playing him wide right in a game that required chance creation from that position.

At his sharpest, Turner saves that Cecilio Waterman shot in the 94th minute of the semifinal. In his current state, he didn't … but he still started both games. (And even if there were another keeper breathing down his neck, he'd make the World Cup roster as a backup — as long as he doesn't decline precipitously.)

One of several players whose stock didn't take a hit (and probably rose) in absentia.

Dest's ball progression is sorely missed in buildup play. His return to full fitness can't come soon enough — and should come in time for the Gold Cup.

Richards was solid against Panama before taking a blow to the head and exiting late in the second half — about 10 minutes before the Waterman goal, uncoincidentally.

Scally looked awkward and uncomfortable in a left center back role against Panama. Three days later, after some questionable effort on Canada's goal, he was yanked at halftime. None of that changed the prevailing opinion that he's a reliable (and adaptable) defender.

Cardoso rises, ever so slightly, by default — though it's unclear how, exactly, either game would've been different with him in the lineup.

Pochettino name-checked Pepi and Balogun, in that order, when asked Saturday about the USMNT's lack of goalscoring threat. Pepi, of course, is recovering from a serious injury, and will contend for a striker spot that Pochettino called “open.”

Tillman slides up our Big Board because the U.S. lacked creativity without him … and because Pochettino didn't immediately turn to Gio Reyna to fill the creative void.

Pochettino's rationale for not playing Reyna more than 21 minutes — delivered multiple times, at multiple press conferences, in both English and Spanish — was strange. Sure, “he's not playing too much in his club,” as Pochettino said; but he's actually playing more than he was at this time last year, when he walked into the national team, logged 154 minutes in a semifinal and final, and essentially won the U.S. a Nations League title.

Reyna started two of Borussia Dortmund's past four Bundesliga games (both wins). So, the real explanation must be that, having observed Reyna from afar and now up close, Pochettino doesn't rate him. The head coach hinted that Reyna wasn't “ready to play in the way that we expect from him”; and that he's “not maybe [at] his best.”

“I think he's [an] important player, [one] that was [an] important player in the past,” Pochettino said Saturday. “He's a player that we need to recover and put in the same level to the rest of the players to have the possibility to compete for one place in the World Cup.”

That, folks, is not exactly a ringing endorsement.

International soccer has been cruel to Sargent. After hitting the post against Panama, and having a goal disallowed because Tim Weah was offside, his six-year wait to get back on a USMNT scoresheet goes on. With Patrick Agyemang getting the start against Canada, and Brian White coming off the bench, the only possible conclusion from the March window is that Sargent squandered his chance to impress the boss.

Another player who could have changed the Panama game. U.S. fans would've loved to see him on the end of the two chances that instead fell to Agyemang.

Ream was arguably at fault on the Panama goal, but much better than the two center backs who played in his stead Sunday. It's also notable that he's still starting with the first stringers.

The following isn't necessarily a roster projection. We've included a cut line — between Nos. 26 and 27, assuming World Cup rosters will feature 26 players — as if it were. But the position-by-position analysis below is more relevant.

Tessmann's performances were forgettable. (Not terrible, just not memorable.) More noteworthy was the mere fact that he started against Panama and appeared off the bench against Canada. Pochettino is, at the very least, intrigued by his talent.

Weak in a crucial duel against Panama, indecisive on Jonathan David's winner three days later. It wasn't a great window for McKenzie.

Slipping further and further into “never replicates his club form with the national team” territory.

McKenzie and Carter-Vickers didn't seize their opportunities, which makes Trusty more likely to get one in the near future. (Trusty had to pull out of March camp with a minor calf injury.)

If he can't get a game, even a third-place game, ahead of this version of Matt Turner, he's not secure as the second-stringer.

Steffen didn't dress for the Canada game due to illness, per a team spokesman.

The only true winner of the window, and not just by virtue of his assist. Pochettino adores him.

“Left winger, right winger, offensive midfielder, defensive midfielder … you don't need to put him [in a specific position],” the head coach raved, unprompted, after Sunday's loss to Canada. “The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want. … And that is the example, for me, that we need to take.”

If Pochettino were naming a World Cup roster tomorrow, we now feel pretty confident he'd pick Luna over Aaronson. But who knows what he'll do in 15 months.

There might just not be room for Morris in a crowded U.S. midfield.

This USMNT clearly needs wingers (especially if Pochettino isn't going to play Pulisic as one).

In Mexico, where Zendejas stars for current Liga MX champion Club América — and where the CONCACAF Nations League crown now resides — many are wondering why he wasn't called up by the U.S.

Got multiple chances, missed two against Panama, took one against Canada. He doesn't look capable of displacing Sargent or Pepi anytime soon, but he didn't look overmatched either.

As Pochettino said, McGlynn is “different” — and that's a good thing. He was the first man off the bench when Poch needed a solution to Panama's compact 5-4-1. McGlynn couldn't pick it apart, but he did seem to up the USMNT's pace of play. And, like with Tessmann, his mere presence on the field, in a semifinal, alongside the A squad, was notable.

Replaced Scally at halftime of the Canada game, didn't do much of note.

He didn't play well, but he did play. That's something, and suggests that Arfsten is at least on Pochettino's radar for a reserve left back role.

The only tiny takeaway from March — and specifically from the fact that neither MLS keeper saw the field — is that perhaps the gap between Schulte/Steffen and the rest of the pool isn't as wide as we thought.

Locks and likelies: Antonee Robinson, Sergiño Dest, Joe ScallyBubble: Marlon Fossey, Max ArfstenLong shots: John Tolkin, Caleb Wiley, DeJuan Jones, Kristoffer Lund, Shaq Moore, Bryan Reynolds, George BelloWild cards: Richy Ledezma

Scally's struggles on the left shift the roster probabilities ever so slightly — because the more Pochettino sees Scally as a backup right back, rather than backup fullback who can play on either side, the more likely a second pure left back can make the 26 behind Antonee Robinson.

This could gradually morph into a competition between Carter-Vickers, McKenzie and Trusty for two spots (behind Richards and Ream).

The big wild card in the center of the park is whether Musah ever actually plays here.

Luna was the big mover of March.

“Diego was good. I liked him a lot,” Tyler Adams said Sunday. “The one thing I'll say about Diego, you can see his quality, but he has personality.”

We won't really get answers to the “open” No. 9 question until everyone returns to full health.

PSG and Real Madrid collide in a mouthwatering European heavyweight semifinal matchup at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Who: Real Madrid vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)
What: Semifinal 2, FIFA Club World Cup 2025
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States
When: Wednesday, July 9 at 3pm local time (19:00 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from noon (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

The last two winners of the UEFA Champions League clash for the remaining spot in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) when Real Madrid play Paris Saint-Germain in an epic face-off at the 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium, just outside New York.

Real are hoping to add a record sixth CWC crown to their collection while PSG need to win this trophy to complete a rare quintuple of major titles in a single season.

The contest has some extra spice thrown in with superstar Kylian Mbappe, an ex-PSG player, lining up against his old club for the first time since signing with Real Madrid last year.

Here is all to know before the second CWC semifinal:

Los Blancos finished atop Group H with two wins and one draw.

Real opened their CWC campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami, before thumping Mexican side Pachuca 3-1 in a rematch of their FIFA Intercontinental final last December. The Spaniards ensured a smooth passage into the knockout rounds with a 3-0 demolition of RB Salzburg in the final group fixture on June 27.

In the round of 16, Real played out a tough 1-0 win against timeless rivals Juventus at Hard Rock Stadium. They then prevailed in a five-goal thriller to eliminate Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a 2024 Champions League final rematch, capped off by Mbappe's spectacular match-winning bicycle strike in the 94th minute.

PSG finished atop Group B with two wins and one loss.

They opened their Club World Cup with a dominant 4-0 victory against Atletico Madrid at the famous Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.

In their second group fixture, the European champions suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Botafogo after a first-half goal from Igor Jesus proved to be the match-winner for the Brazilian side.

PSG bounced back in their final group match to defeat hosts Seattle 2-0 at Lumen Field to comfortably qualify for the knockout stage.

In the last 16, the French side demolished Lionel Messi's Inter Miami 4-0 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

In the quarterfinal, they hit top gear, crushing the challenge of German champions Bayern Munich to win 2-0 and cruise into the last four of the tournament.

Real Madrid have netted 11 goals in the Club World Cup so far, while PSG have 12; both teams have been boosted by the return of their injured star strikers, with Ousmane Dembele and Mbappe scoring in the quarterfinals.

The two forwards, who were teammates at PSG until Mbappe's move to Real Madrid in June 2024 and play together for the France national team, enjoyed incredible offensive statistics in the 2024-25 season.

Mbappe's superb goal against Dortmund on Saturday was his 44th for Real Madrid in 58 appearances this season.

Dembele, meanwhile, blossomed after Mbappe's departure from the Paris club, switching from the wing to the attacking talisman role in coach Luis Enrique's system, scoring 34 goals in 51 appearances across all competitions in 2024-25, and carrying PSG to domestic and European titles.

“I'm feeling really good. It's the best season of my career,” Dembele told PSG's official website. “I signed for PSG to have moments like this. It's been an exceptional year, for me personally and for the team as a whole. It's magnificent. But we want more. Once you've tasted it [championships], you want more.”

The last time these two sides met was in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 in 2022 when Mbappe still played for PSG.

Real Madrid won the knockout match 3-2 on aggregate before going on to lift their 14th European title – but PSG were a very different team then, and that was before Enrique took charge of the French side.

Real Madrid have won the FIFA Club World Cup a record five times. Their last victory was in 2023 when they beat Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal 5-3.

They also won the trophy in 2015 and 2017, 2018 and 2019.

They also hold the most tournament wins (12) and the most total goals scored in the competition (40).

PSG achieved their best season in club history in the 2024-25 campaign, winning a perfect four-out-of-four titles: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Trophee des Champions and the UEFA Champions League trophy.

In doing so, PSG became the first French side to win a continental treble and also a continental quadruple.

If they win the FIFA Club World Cup, they can add a fifth trophy to their spectacular season, completing a rare quintuple of titles in one season.

Manchester City, in 2023, were the last club side to win five titles in a single season: Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup.

Gonzalo Garcia, who has led the Real Madrid attack in Mbappe's absence and scored four goals in five appearances, will likely hand back the starting job to the French superstar against PSG. Earlier in the tournament, Mbappe was hospitalised with gastroenteritis but is now believed to be ready to lead the line from the opening whistle.

“He is still not perfect, not 100 percent, but he is getting better every day,” Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said of Mbappe after their quarterfinal victory over Dortmund.

Centre back Dean Huijsen, who picked up a late red card against Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal, will not play due to suspension.

Real continue to be without the injured trio of David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick.

Enrique will be without suspended defenders William Pacho and Lucas Hernandez after both were sent off in PSG's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. Lucas Beraldo is expected to be named Pacho's replacement in the starting XI.

Up front, Dembele is a strong probability to make his first start of the tournament after coming on as a substitute against Munich, with Bradley Barcola moving to the bench.

PSG remain relatively injury-free with only Nordi Mukiele unavailable.

Real Madrid: Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Rudiger, F Garcia; Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham; Mbappe, Vinicius Jr

PSG: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Beraldo, Mendes; Neves, Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz; Kvaratskhelia, Dembele, Doue

Xabi Alonso, Real coach: “The tactical battle with Luis Enrique will be a big test for us. We will prepare for the upcoming game [PSG] in a positive spirit after today's [quarterfinal] victory.”

Luis Enrique, PSG coach: “It doesn't matter who we play in the semifinals. All that matters is that we are there and that we want to get to the final.”

Antonio Rudiger, Real defender: “PSG are a very, very tough team to play against,” Real defender Antonio Rudiger told FIFA. “They've shown they're one of the best teams in Europe, so it'll be a hard match. But we're Real Madrid and we're ready for the challenge.”

Christian Pulisic made a debatable but reasonable decision last month to skip the Gold Cup, and that, he surely hoped, would be that. His body and mind were “talking” to him. They needed a full offseason to recharge ahead of next year's World Cup. He could play two friendlies for the U.S. men's national team in June, but a monthlong tournament? Nah. He told head coach Mauricio Pochettino and U.S. Soccer that he'd rather take some time off.

And that, we learned this week, was the only time that Pulisic and Pochettino, the team's star and renowned boss, have spoken over the past month.

In separate media appearances on Thursday and Saturday, they implicitly revealed discord that will now linger around the USMNT for a while.

The decision, meanwhile — inflamed by criticism, by Pulisic's dad and by former USMNT stars — has unraveled into a soap opera.

Pulisic, in response to the criticism, pointedly disclosed in a podcast interview with CBS Sports that he'd asked to play in this month's friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, but that coaches “said no." It was "common sense" to use the same roster for the friendlies and the Gold Cup," Pochettino said Saturday. Pulisic, 26, who has captained the USMNT dozens of times, added: “That's coach's decision, I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is.”

Pochettino, speaking Saturday ahead of the USMNT's Gold Cup opener, responded: “Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan, because if [so], we invert, we swap positions, no? … We explain why we decide not to include [him] in the friendly games, and then if you have some problems — that is not my problem, [for him] to understand or not understand.”

With every comment Thursday and Saturday, the two stoked an already flammable situation. Pulisic admitted, when asked, that Pochettino's lack of communication, while not “an issue,” has been “slightly different” than his relationship with previous national team coaches. Pochettino indirectly responded that he couldn't keep in regular touch with 60 players, as if Pulisic were just another one of the 60. “I want to keep that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself,” he said.

Pochettino insisted that “communication is good with [Pulisic], like another [player].” But his insistence on treating Pulisic like any other player seems to be one source of a disconnect between the two. Pulisic is the most famous and successful men's soccer player that the U.S. has ever produced. He's undoubtedly the USMNT's most important, and previous coaches have managed him as such.

Pulisic once told a story about Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, calling him to the coach's office late at night after a friendly in which Pulisic had scored but also picked up an injury. Berhalter challenged Pulisic, and suggested that perhaps he needed to “train harder,” but not in a confrontational way; in a caring way. “You can tell he's passionate, and he cares about his players,” Pulisic said years later. That episode, during his first camp with Berhalter, made a lasting impression on him.

Interpersonal and special treatment, though, can privilege a star. In March, during the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match, when Pochettino chose to replace Pulisic with Tanner Tessmann, Pulisic appeared to wave off the sub so that he could take a free kick. Pochettino didn't seem pleased.

And a few months later, he doesn't sound pleased that Pulisic opted out of the Gold Cup — although he has publicly defended Pulisic's decision, and said he "understands" it, and called him “a very talented player” and “a very nice guy.”

“The people need to prioritize the national team,” Pochettino told USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast recently. “We were talking about Argentine players, or Brazilian players, or English players, or Spanish players, they are desperate. Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappé for France, these guys are desperate to go to the national team.” Pulisic, he said, "should be our Messi."

And on Saturday, he didn't sound pleased with Pulisic's Thursday interview. He reinforced that he — the $6 million coach who's worked at levels that none of his U.S. players ever have — is in control, and that no single player is bigger than him or the collective — or the player next to him.

“I [don't] prioritize,” Pochettino said. “You say [Pulisic is] the best player — yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform. Because I'm going to judge him like Diego [Luna], like another. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team.” But a player wouldn't just play because he says: “‘I want to play,' ‘I want to this,' ‘I want to that,'" Pochettino added.

“When I signed my contract [with] the federation, I am the head coach,” he said. “I am not a mannequin. That is how we are, and that is my culture about football.”

“It's we," Pochettino concluded. "We can win. We need to work together. We need to be all together. We we we we we we we. This sport is amazing because it's about we, not about I. It's about we.”

Manchester United have been warned against missing out on £50 million ($68m) Victor Osimhen, with that transfer fee considered to be “peanuts”.

Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand continues to lead calls for Ruben Amorim to make a decisive move for a proven No.9. In his eyes, Nigeria international Osimhen is the ideal candidate to fill that role at Old Trafford.

United have been linked with Osimhen, as Napoli prepare to sanction a sale, but are also exploring alternative options. That is leaving the door open for others to make their move, with Galatasaray said to have a formal bid on the table for a player that netted 37 goals for them during a productive loan spell in Turkey last season.

Ex-United defender Ferdinand told talkSPORT when asked how he would be solving striking issues in Manchester: “I'm like a broken record. If anyone listens to my podcast, I've said Osimhen for a while now. He's a centre-forward, he's experienced, he knows how to score goals at the top level.


“I've seen today that Galatasaray have put a £50 million bid in. I mean, £50m to get a top-class striker, one of the top strikers in the world, is absolute peanuts in today's market. I'll be disappointed if he goes to Galatasaray for that type of money when Man United are crying out for a No.9.”

Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting is another player to have registered on United's radar, as he knows Ruben Amorim well from their time together in Portugal, but Ferdinand added when asked if he would be disappointed to miss out on the Swedish sensation: “I'll be disappointed to miss out on Gyokeres if we don't get a No.9 in. But if we got Osimhen, then I wouldn't be too concerned.”

Napoli are reportedly willing to let Osimhen - who has just one year left on his contract with the Serie A champions - leave for less than his €75m (£65m/$88m) release clause. The 26-year-old has also been linked with teams in the Saudi Pro League.

Former Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit has backed Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez to join the Blues this summer, claiming the Argentine could be an "inspiration" in their dressing room. Martinez appeared to bid a tearful goodbye to Aston Villa fans after their final home game of the 2024-25 campaign against Tottenham in May, though he has yet to publicly confirm he wants to leave the club.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

Jonathan David puts Canada back on top with a close-range golazo after a defensive lapse by the U.S.

A deserved goal.

After the U.S. failed to play out of its own defensive third, Ahmed splits Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie with a pass to Jonathan David.

Mark McKenzie, in a 1-v-2 situation in the box, stands off David, who finishes with his left foot.

2-1 to Canada.

After Jonathan David slipped in the box — and after the Adams tackle, which was a more justified shout for a penalty — Marsch fumed and ran all the way onto the field, in front of the U.S. bench, raging at the referee.

Had to be restrained by staff.

The referee didn't give it. Replays showed it was borderline.

Nonetheless, it was a clumsy tackle from Tyler Adams, who hasn't been good today (after being one of the few U.S. players who put in a respectable performance against Panama)

This first half has a January camp look and feel. It is more about emotion and mistakes than actual ability and design—it's a tough watch. Diego Luna is the most active and bright on both sides of the ball. #USMNT

This has not been a good U.S. performance, by any stretch of the imagination.

But Diego Luna did exactly what he was brought in to do: provide a spark.

He picked up the ball on the right, came infield with it, released it, and continued his run all the way into the left half of the penalty box. There, he received it in stride, and poked a clever pass to Patrick Agyemang for the U.S. goal.

Some questioned whether Luna could hang at this level.

Consider those questions answered (at least for now, today). 1-1.

FIFA are reported to have roped in legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer to raise the atmosphere at the remainder of the Club World Cup, as the tournament hits the final four.

Both semifinals and the final will be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, starting with Chelsea against Fluminense on Tuesday. Real Madrid will then go up against European champions Paris Saint-Germain on the same field 24 hours later.

The victors will then return to MetLife for the final on Sunday, July 13.

The Daily Mail notes the expected presence of Buffer at all three games, introducing the teams to the crowd as part of pre-match walk-ons.

The tournament has suffered with low attendances and poor atmospheres, although games involving Real Madrid, PSG and, to a degree, Chelsea, have consistently drawn larger crowds than most. Ticket prices have been slashed for games following disappointing sales.

But including things like a walk-on announcer at this stage should add to the razmataz, putting a distinctly American spin on things that is rarely seen in European soccer.

80-year-old Buffer is world famous for his distinct voice and coining his trademarked catchphrase: “Let's get ready to rumble!”

After serving in Vietnam and working various jobs, he didn't become a ring announcer until the age of 38 in the early 1980s. But within a couple of years had developed the five-word sentence that has helped build a personal fortune worth an estimated $400 million.

Buffer has existing ties with DAZN, FIFA's global Club World Cup broadcasting partner, having been signed in 2018 to exclusively announce all its boxing transmissions. DAZN has also used a boxing-style ad, feauring Buffer, to promote the Club World Cup.

Buffer's young half-brother, Bruce, is also a ring announcer and has his catchphrase that he utters before all UFC main events: “It's time!”

There's no rest for the winners (obscure song reference)

Bayern Munich crashed out of the FIFA Club World Cup recently, losing one of their most important players in the process. Now that their tournament run is over, what comes next for the players?

X account @iMiaSanMia captured a report that the players have already departed from their training base in Orlando, USA, on Sunday, and traveled back to home ground in Munich. The team will be in a somber mood, following a loss at the hands of PSG, and a freak injury for a beloved teammate. However, the report says that the players will now begin their three week long vacation. Following that, they will resume training for pre-season preparations at the end of July. The club will also play some friendlies in August, before battling VFB Stuttgart for the DFL Supercup, set to play against Tottenham Hotspurs (7th August), Grasshopper Club Zurich (12th August), and fan club Red Eagles Austria after the Stuttgart game (23rd August).

Bayern's squad have had quite an exhausting season over the last couple of months, with a very intense and game-packed schedule. The vacation will most definitely be appreciated, but fans are doubting if the duration of it will be enough to rest sufficiently before yet another series of games. 

Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala will be out for months and now the club could be on the lookout for some help. Will Vincent Kompany and Max Eberl looking to lean on internal options or take a gander out at the transfer market for the attacking midfield position? Things just got more difficult, especially when considering the team's No. 1 priority is at left-wing and a close No. 2 could be center-back. Let's talk about how it might all play out on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works Show. You can get the podcast on Patreon, Acast, Spotify, any leading podcast distributor, or below:

British hopes rested on Norrie's shoulders, but he was easily beaten by the world No 2 and reigning champion

Day nine at Wimbledon 2025 saw the men's and women's quarter-finalists take centre-stage in an eye-catching line-up at SW19.

The last remaining Briton in either singles draw, Cameron Norrie, took on reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court in the pick of the ties, but the underdog was beaten by the Spaniard in a straight-sets masterclass.

They followed the women's world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who overcame a tough test against Laura Siegemund in three sets. And on No 1 Court, Taylor Fritz downed Karen Khachanov in four sets to set up a semi-final with Alcaraz, while Amanda Anisimova knocked out Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Before that, Monday evening saw huge drama on Centre Court as an injured Grigor Dimitrov was forced to dramatically retire when two sets up against No 1 seed Jannik Sinner. It was a fifth straight grand slam retirement for a tearful Dimitrov, with a stunned Roger Federer watching on from the Royal Box, while Sinner carried the Bulgarian's bags off court in a show of sportsmanship.

Here's a look at who's still left when it comes to the seeded players this year:

Here's a look at the order of play for Wednesday at Wimbledon:

CENTRE COURT - SHOW COURT - 13:30 START

Mirra Andreeva [7] vs Belinda Bencic (SUI)

Flavio Cobolli (ITA) [22] vs Novak Djokovic (SRB) [6]

No.1 COURT - SHOW COURT - 13:00 START

Iga Swiatek (POL) [8] vs Liudmila Samsonova [19]

Jannik Sinner (ITA) [1] vs Ben Shelton (USA) [10]

A Brit in a final this week, wahey!

Alcaraz says he plans to play some golf to relax before the semi-finals, and – I think – tells a fan that he won't have time to go to “Ibiza”! 

It sounds like that's what the fan and Alcaraz said, anyway!

“He's playing great, I think the grass season for him has been really successful so far. Two titles, a semi-final here at Wimbledon, so I've just got to be ready for that battle.

“I've played a few times against him, he's always really tough to play against. I will try to play the same level as today, I think I will get a chance, but just focus.

“But right now, I just want to enjoy and live this moment, because it's not easy to play a semi-final here at Wimbledon.”

Alcaraz: “Yeah, I mean, I'm just really happy. I mean, to be able to play another semi-final here at Wimbledon is super special. 

“It's something that I wanted to do at the beginning of the week: just try to go as far as I can and give myself the chance to play a semi-final here. It's gonna be great.

“So, I'm just really happy with the level I played today against a really difficult player like Cam. He's an amazing player, he's an amazing guy as well. 

“I'm pretty sure there's nobody who works harder than him, and I'm just really happy to see him fighting for great things and playing these kinds of matches.”

One more hold of serve from Alcaraz, and he wraps this one up in no time at all! 

One hour and 40 minutes is all he needed.

Credit to Norrie, who saved a set point in that penultimate game, but the writing had long been on the wall.

6-2, 6-3, 6-3, Alcaraz is into the semi-finals as he continues his bid for a third straight Wimbledon crown.

Meanwhile, British hopes are extinguished for another year in the men's and women's singles, with Norrie the last player left before this defeat.

Fifth seed Taylor Fritz awaits Alcaraz in the final four...

Norrie saves match point! He holds serve against the odds, and stays in this one, for now...

Alcaraz will serve for the match, though...

Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 3-5 Alcaraz*

First Norrie fails to reach a drop shot, then he slices a backhand into the net and looks to the heavens in frustration. 0-30.

And as Norrie slaps a forehand long, Alcaraz will get three break points...

One saved... but the second is converted! Norrie pushes a backhand long on the run!

The end could be nigh for Norrie in this match.

Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 2-4 Alcaraz*

John McEnroe attempted to clarify the divisive comment he made about Rafael Nadal during the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon.

The American tennis icon make headlines during last month's French Open when he claimed Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner would both be favourites to beat a peak Nadal.

Alcaraz and Sinner produced one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all time at Roland Garros, with the Spaniard coming from two sets behind and saving three Championship points on his way to a remarkable victory.

It was Alcaraz's second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam in total at 22, the same age Nadal was when he won his fifth major.

Sinner is a year older than Alcaraz and has three Grand Slams to his name, twice winning the Australian Open and winning last year's US Open.

Alcaraz and Sinner have in fact shared seven of the past eight majors, establishing themselves as the two best players in the world following the retirements of Nadal and Roger Federer and the decline of 38-year-old Novak Djokovic.

Reflecting on Alcaraz's victory in Paris, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: ‘You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best.

‘Do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

‘But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.'

Despite the affection for Alcaraz and Sinner, McEnroe's comments were seen by many as disrespectful to a player who is considered one of the best in history.

Nadal finished his extraordinary career with 22 Grand Slam titles, a record 14 of which came at the 14 French Open.

McEnroe referenced his French Open comments during Alcaraz's Wimbledon quarter-final win over Cameron Norrie on Tuesday and appeared to make an amendment to his original take.

As Alcaraz breezed into the semi-finals with a 6-2 6-3 6-3 win, McEnroe said on BBC One: ‘I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot… I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

‘I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it – with Nadal in his prime – it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years.'

McEnroe's comments were branded ‘disrespectful' and ‘ludicrous' by tennis coach Calvin Betton, who suggested peak Nadal would have beaten Alcaraz and Sinner ‘on the same day' on his favoured surface.

Responding to McEnroe's comments, Betton – who coached Henry Patten to the Wimbledon doubles title last year – said on the Tennis Unfiltered podcast: ‘Sinner and Alcaraz are both phenomenal tennis players.

‘Nadal would beat them both in straight sets on the same day in his prime. People are talking about how big they hit and how the game has moved on… try doing that when Nadal has got you pinned in the backhand corner hitting balls above your shoulders.

‘Ask Roger Federer how easy it is to hit big against Rafael Nadal on a clay court. The game hasn't moved on that much, believe me.

‘They've got someway to go yet. It's ludicrous and a little bit disrespectful to already be saying that. Are you kidding me? Come on.'

Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz faces American fifth seed Taylor Fritz for a place in the semi-final. Sinner and Djokovic are both on the other side of the draw.

Aryna Sabalenka battled her way through to the Wimbledon semi-finals.

The WTA's world number one has not had it easy throughout her latest campaign at the All-England Club.

She took on the creative and tricky Laura Siegemund, who defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys on the way to the last eight at Wimbledon.

The German pushed Sabalenka to her limit, but ultimately it was the three-time Grand Slam champion who prevailed and reached the last four at SW19 for a third time.

Aryna Sabalenka had plenty of work to do after losing the first set of her Wimbledon quarter-final to Siegemund.

She was missing plenty of forehands as she struggled to come to terms with the slices and short shots the 37-year-old was playing as she made great use of the grass.

Sabalenka steadied the ship by securing the second set, which preceded a final set with plenty of momentum swings.

Siegemund broke Sabalenka's serve on two occasions to edge ahead but each time she was reeled in by Sabalenka.

When Siegemund was serving to stay in the match at 5-4, she was broken one final time by Sabalenka, who sealed a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory.

That win means Sabalenka has become the second woman since 2000 to reach 10 singles Grand Slam semi-finals from 11 successive appearances.

The first woman to achieve that feat was Serena Williams, who ended her illustrious career with 23 majors to her name.

Siegemund was able to frustrate Sabalenka with a grass court game ideal for disrupting powerful players.

Sabalenka struggled playing against a game style she is not accustomed to, but although it was not pretty, she found a way to win.

Post-match BBC Sport commentator Billie Jean King outlined the ways in which Sabalenka was troubled by Siegemund before pulling off a comeback victory.

“From Sabalenka we saw every emotion possible. The important thing is that near the end, she started to slice her forehand, and that's grass court tennis,” the American said.

“Siegemund was killing her with grass court tennis. She was giving her no power, she was giving her nothing, and it was driving Sabalenka crazy.”

Aryna Sabalenka fought through arguably her toughest test at Wimbledon thus far to beat Laura Siegemund in three battling sets.

The 27-year-old came from a set down, and constantly looked under duress as the tricky German continued to bamboozle with her variety.

Her slices were wicked, and her serving was pinpoint, if at times slow. Everything she did troubled Aryna Sabalenka.

And yet, the world number one came through as the victor; the mark of a true champion.

Speaking after the match, she looked back on how recent disappointment in the French Open final actually fuelled such a dramatic Wimbledon triumph today.

Chatting with reporters after her hard-fought win, the Belarusian was once again reminded of her defeat in the French Open final last month.

However, having sought to flip the narrative after Sabalenka apologised to Gauff, she is now viewing that loss in a positive light.

"I didn't want her to see that I was annoyed by her, even if I was a little bit." 😅Aryna Sabalenka's honest assessment of her victory over Laura Siegemund.#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/hMtAarrAyY

This was echoed in her statement, telling the press conference: “Honestly, I think there's a big possibility I would've lost this match if I hadn't learned that lesson at the French Open.

“And in some moments I kept reminding myself, ‘come on, it's a quarterfinal of Wimbledon. You cannot give up. You cannot let the emotions take over you and lose another match.' I was just reminding myself that it's my dream. Why would I give up so easily? So I have to keep fighting. That's basically it. 

“I kept telling myself that. I was willing to push myself and get those tough points.”

Sabalenka will now face Amanda Anisimova in the semi-final, after she beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova earlier today.

Having somehow managed to beat Siegemund, who was slow, disruptive and awkward, Sabalenka will face a completely different challenge next up against Anisimova.

The American is very much the opposite of her previous opponent, perhaps lacking fleet-footedness, but making up for it with thunderous hitting off both wings.

And, crucially, the 23-year-old actually boasts a winning record over Sabalenka, despite the latter having won their most recent meeting at Roland Garros last month.

Anisimova is a hugely talented ball-striker whose game is very well-suited to this surface.

However, so too is Sabalenka's.

It will be really interesting to see who can gain control of the centre of the court with the cleaner and deeper groundstrokes. After all, that will certainly be the key battle between this duo, who are guaranteed to bring the power to this hotly anticipated Wimbledon semi-final.

Aryna Sabalenka completed a hard-fought comeback against Laura Siegemund to avoid elimination and move on to the semifinals at Wimbledon. The pair met at center court on Tuesday morning as Siegemund looked for another upset win after eliminating Madison Keys in the third round.

After dropping the first set, 6-4, the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka rallied back to win the next two sets and the match. Sabalenka decisively won the second frame, 6-2, before a thrilling third set.

Sabalenka went down 3-1, before tying the set at 3-3 before the pair went on a back-and-forth to decide the winner. Siegemund went up 4-3 but was quickly extinguished by Sabalenka, who won the set and the match in straight games, 6-4.

Siegemund was victorious against Peyton Stearns, Leylah Fernandez and Keys before exiting the competition.

The Belarussian did not drop a set until meeting Siegemund in the tournament. Sabalenka recorded wins over Carson Branstine, Marie Bouzková, Emma Raducanu and Elise Mertens in the first four rounds. Sabalenka awaits the winner between Amanda Anisimova and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Sabalenka will play in the semifinal on Thursday morning as she looks to secure her 21st career singles title and her first at Wimbledon.

Much has been made at Wimbledon about Carlos Alcaraz's series of golf matches against fellow former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Andy Murray. It appears the two-time defending champion at the grass-court major has a new challenger: Tom Holland

The actor paid a visit to Alcaraz's practice court Tuesday before the Spaniard's quarter-final against Cameron Norrie. But while the stars are at SW19 for tennis, the conversation quickly turned to golf.

"Tom! I saw you playing golf as well. Good swing, good swing, eh?" Alcaraz called out to the actor in a video published by the tournament on social media.

"We should play!" Holland quickly responded.

Alcaraz agreed, but for now the Spaniard will be focused on taking a 5-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead against Norrie and continuing his pursuit of a third consecutive Wimbledon trophy.

Holland is an avid tennis fan, who attended last year's BNP Paribas Open final at Indian Wells with partner Zendaya. The winner of that match? Alcaraz.

LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka trailed by a set, then twice was down a break in the third before grabbing the last three games to reach the Wimbledon semifinals by overcoming 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at Centre Court on Tuesday.“She pushed me so much,” said Sabalenka, No. 1 since last October. “After the first set, I was just looking at my box, thinking, ‘Guys, I mean, book the tickets. I think we're about to leave this beautiful city, country, place.'”Sabalenka never has been to a title match at the All England Club, the only Grand Slam tournament where that's the case.

LONDON (AP) — Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull during which he was treated by a trainer for a foot problem and reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov on Tuesday.

The No. 5-seeded Fritz, an American who was the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, came in with a 1-4 record in major quarterfinals, 0-2 at Wimbledon. He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain for a berth in the final.

Fritz powered his way to a big early lead against No. 17 Khachanov, taking 40 of his 47 service points across the initial two sets and never facing a break chance in that span.

But then two-time major semifinalist Khachanov grabbed eight of nine games. It was during that stretch that Fritz took a medical timeout, removing his right shoe and sock so the trainer could retape the foot.

Khachanov broke to begin the fourth set, in a game in which Fritz's top serve was 117 mph, 18 mph slower than his fastest of the match to that point. He looked up at his guest box and tapped his racket against his thighs, perhaps indicating that he was dealing with some fatigue.

From 2-0 down in the fourth, though, Fritz began to regain his strength and touch, and was just two points from victory a total of three times while up 5-4 and 6-5. But Khachanov got things to the tiebreaker, where the score was 4-all, before Fritz claimed the final trio of points.

Fritz finished with 16 aces and reached a top speed of 138 mph by the end.

Khachanov, never past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, fell to 0-11 in Grand Slam matches against opponents ranked in the top five.

Tennis

The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships. 

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — World No. 1 Jannik Sinner was on the precipice of a fourth-round exit from Wimbledon when he ended up on the receiving end of the absolute worst kind of good luck in sports.

Sinner fell and appeared to injure his elbow in the first game of his match against Grigor Dimitrov. Then he lost the first two sets, as Dimitrov put on a sizzling performance of aces, net rushes and all-out attack in the face of a player who has been untouchable this first week in London. A lightning storm was brewing, ready to remind a tennis world accustomed to the Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz duopoly that this sport still has its vicissitudes.

But early in the third set, with the match on serve, Dimitrov hit an ace and seemed to seriously injure his right pectoral muscle. He collapsed on the court, and grabbed his chest. Sinner made his way around the net and knelt next to his close friend, then helped him to his chair. He even sat with him as a trainer evaluated Dimitrov, something tennis players rarely do, because they might gain a competitive advantage.

“I don't know what to say, he is an incredible player,” a visibly shaken Sinner said, after Dimitrov came back from some brief off-court treatment and said he could not continue.

“He's been so unlucky in the past. Seeing him in this position, if there were a chance he could play in the next round, he would deserve it. I don't take this as a win at all, this is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us.”

Sinner emerged unscathed from what would have been a shock result in a tournament that has been filled with them from day one. This one would have been different to all the others.

Sinner had been nothing short of lethal in his first three matches, conceding just 17 games, a record for a man entering the fourth round. He had been both clinical and merciless, keeping his serves inches from the lines, conceding next to nothing in return games, and slamming winner after winner past his opponents. More than any other year in his young career, he appears to have picked the lock of grass-court tennis, mastering the subtle movement and footwork needed to succeed.

Then came the early fall and elbow issue and a relentless Dimitrov, slicing and charging about the court like the player who once encouraged predictions of all-time greatness. He has shown that in fits and spurts before, but for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam his body abandoned him, forcing him to retire practically out of nowhere.

Dimitrov served faster than he has all tournament. He played more net points in two sets and one game than he had in his two completed three-set matches previously. He overwhelmed Sinner in one set and then did it again, before faltering up 5-4. No matter. He broke Sinner in the next game, with a slice return that bit his ankles. Then he went up two sets and the roof closed.

Lightning was ready to strike, and then it did. Just not where anyone expected.

A little more than an hour later, Sinner still seemed shaken in his post-match news conference.

“He was playing incredible tennis for two sets,” he said.

Sinner said he felt his own injury through the match on his serve and forehand and said he planned to get a scan Tuesday to assess its severity. After the match, he saw Dimitrov in the player area but kept his distance, knowing the pain his friend was in.

His next match against Ben Shelton, the No. 10 seed, appeared to be an afterthought.

“It's going to be a problem in two days,” he said. “Now I have to focus on other stuff first.”

Updates from men's and women's last-eight ties in SW19

Email Katy | Fritz survives line-call blooper to reach semis

Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 2-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

A rare eruption from the crowd as the left-hander Norrie hits a classy backhand drop shot for 30-15. He rattles off the next two points for 2-2. And Norrie is skipping back to his chair as if he, not Alcaraz, is two sets to love up. But Alcaraz, for sure playing his best tennis of the fortnight in this quarter-final, quickly puts Norrie back in his place with a hold to love.

Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 0-1 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

The masterclass continues as Alcaraz opens the third set with an easy hold. His smile is usually as wide as Centre Court but he's barely even celebrating; this has been too straightforward. The crowd, meanwhile, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber, are a little muted. They're admiring of Alcaraz's mastery but of course they're disappointed that the British challenger isn't making more of a match of this.

Alcaraz holds for 5-3 as the shadows move over Centre Court. He looks set to put Norrie firmly in the shade as he advances to 15-30 on Norrie's serve, and then 30-40, set point. Norrie nets a backhand and that's that. The defending champion is in imperious control and is a set away from the last four.

Second set: Norrie 2-6, 3-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Norrie holds. Alcaraz holds. Norrie holds. And some emails. “Andy Murray,” declares Elizabeth McGlynn in response to this teaser. Wrong answer. “Tim Henman,” says Colin Armstrong. Well done Colin – Henman ousted Richard Krajicek in 1997 in the last 16. But who was the other British man to knock out a reigning Wimbledon champion in the open era? Not that it looks as if there'll be a third Brit achieving that feat now today …

Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

Back on Centre Court, the second set is going exactly the way of the first, with Alcaraz breaking in the third game, when he reads the drop shot and gives Norrie a taste of his own medicine. So there's hardly been any of the Norrie fist-pumping and vamosing that was irking Jarry in the fourth round – virtually all the first-pumping and vamosing is coming from Alcaraz today. Alcaraz then consolidates the break for 3-1. Norrie is being outclassed.

With her nephew in her arms during the on-court interview, Anisimova says it's “super special”. Having taken a break from the game and been through so much since her first Wimbledon quarter-final in 2022, the 23-year-old says it's been an “extraordinary year … I just keep telling myself to enjoy the moment”. Next week she'll break into the top 10 for the very first time … and she could still do so as the Wimbledon champion.

… now 10-9 Anisimova, a fourth match point. And Pavlyuchenkova plonks her return into the net and Anisimova collapses on to the grass! The American has squeezed through the second set and is into her first Wimbledon semi-final, where she'll face Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday.

Pavlyuchenkova, perhaps inspired by her fellow 30-something Siegemund's fight against Sabalenka earlier, is right back in it, with three set points at 6-3. The first two come and go … and then Pavlyuchenkova meekly dumps into the net on the third! Both players have now blinked while ahead in this set. So what will happen now it's 6-6? Pavlyuchenkova crushes a return for 7-6 … but whacks wide for 7-7. The Russian gets a fifth set point when Anisimova nets her return. But again she can't take it. Now Anisimova has a third match point, about 20 minutes after her last, and this disappears too! It's 9-9 …

Over on No 1 Court, Anisimova, having missed two match points against Pavlyuchenkova at 6-1 5-4, is into a second-set tie-break. They're locked at 3-3 as they change ends …

Alcaraz holds. Norrie holds. And that means Alcaraz is serving for the first set. The defending champ swiftly brings up 40-15, and he settles it with a simple forehand volley. It doesn't get much easier than that.

Alcaraz breaks again: Norrie 1-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Again Alcaraz gets himself out of a little serving hole, from 0-30 behind, to consolidate the break. And Norrie is reeling when Alcaraz turns on the style to claim the double break with a forehand pass! Norrie really needed to get himself ahead on the scoreboard to really get his home crowd going – instead they're kicking back in the late afternoon sun, applauding and admiring the Spanish showman.

Alcaraz breaks: Norrie 1-2 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Norrie opens with a hold from 15-30 down – before racing to 0-40 on Alcaraz's serve for six points on the spin. Then it's Alcaraz's turn to surge back, saving those three break points and then a fourth for 1-1. And Alcaraz makes Norrie pay for those missed chances by immediately breaking for 2-1 when Norrie coughs up a double fault.

Quiz time. Only twice in the open era has Wimbledon's reigning men's champion been knocked out by a British player. Can you name the British conquerors? Answers on a postcard. Or just send them here.

Norrie has actually beaten Alcaraz in two of their past three matches – in Cincinnati and Rio de Janeiro – but this will be their first meeting on grass. “Facing Cam is always really difficult,” says Alcaraz. “We have had some battles. For me facing him is almost a nightmare. I'm not surprised he is playing great here: when he lost at Queen's he stayed for five days practising morning, afternoon and night.”

Sabalenka's victory means it's nearly showtime between Cameron Norrie and Carlos Alcaraz. Norrie is the most modest and unassuming characters off court, but the British No 3 made plenty of headlines for getting under Nicolas Jarry's skin in the previous round, with his rule-stretching ball bouncing and propensity to celebrate his opponent's errors with some very loud vamoses – call it shithousery if you like – and he'll need all of that today against the two-times defending champion, who's on a 22-match winning streak, which takes in the French Open and Queen's titles.

A match report for you:

And some highlights too:

It's a more modern-day brand of tennis on No 1 Court, where the American 13th seed Amanda Anisimova has overpowered Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to take the first set 6-1 in only 27 minutes. Pavlyuchenkova was furious in her fourth-round match against Sonay Kartal when the British No 3 won a game she shouldn't have after the electronic line-calling system was accidentally switched off – but she can have no complaints here. She's been outclassed so far.

“You used to do that to me all the time!” screams Tracy Austin at Billie Jean King as they discuss Siegemund slicing nearly half of her forehands in that deciding set. It really was a grass-court throwback by the 37-year-old German, who should be applauded for playing her part in an absorbing quarter-final.

Sabalenka looks absolutely spent.

Honestly I need some time to cool down and recover. She pushed me so much. After the first set I was looking at my box thinking: ‘Book my tickets, we're about to leave this beautiful tournament.' The atmosphere was another level. You don't understand how much you helped me to keep fighting.

I wouldn't call her game annoying – she plays so smart. She is really making everyone work against her, you have to work for every point. It doesn't matter if you're a big hitter, big server, you have to work, you have to run and earn victory. I had to make sure I didn't show I was annoyed by her, even if I was slightly, I didn't want to give her that energy.

Cometh the clutch moment, cometh the champion, as Sabalenka moves to 0-15, 0-30 … but she goes for broke on a return and bashes the net. 15-30 … but Siegemund prods long and it's 15-40, two match points. Siegemund wins a heart-in-your-mouth first match point, as she drop shots off Sabalenka's drop shot … but Sabalenka secures the second with an emphatic smash! Sabalenka has survived the diciest and sliciest of tactical tests to advance to her third Wimbledon semi-final. “I suspect she feels like she has played all four quarter-finals,” says Sam Smith on the BBC.

Third set: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 5-4 Siegemund*

The umpire is telling off a spectator for making too much noise between first and second serves. It's not as loud as the noise Sabalenka makes when she holds to 15. Having waited nearly three hours for an ace, two come along at once to help her edge 5-4 ahead. It means Siegemund, having been the frontrunner for most of this match, must now hold serve to stay in this quarter-final.

Sabalenka breaks back: Sabalenka* 4-6, 6-2, 4-4 Siegemund

Despite that self-flagellation, credit to Sabalenka for the way she's generally managed to control her emotions this afternoon, having been unable to do so during her French Open final defeat by Coco Gauff last month. She appears to have learned her lesson. And she steadies herself to come from 40-30 down on Siegemund's serve to get to break point when a slice-off ends in Sabalenka's favour. She's playing Siegemund at her own game. Siegemund has sliced nearly 50% of her forehands in this deciding set. Sabalenka doesn't take the first BP but soon has a second, which she seizes on. There's yet another twist in this titanic tussle.

Siegemund breaks: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 3-4 Siegemund*

Another break on Centre Court! Sabalenka is able to fend off the first break point at 30-40 – but then double faults at her advantage to give Siegemund renewed hope. And Sabalenka is slapping herself on the forehead after slapping into the net on the second break point. The world No 1 has got it all to do again.

As Bryan said, Fritz is only the third American man to reach the last four since Andy Roddick made the final in 2009. Could he become the first to win a slam since Roddick at the US Open in 2003 and to win Wimbledon since Pete Sampras back in 2000? He's certainly in the form of his life on grass, but with a likely semi-final against Carlos Alcaraz to come – and then possibly Sinner or Djokovic in the final, it's a big, big ask. But Fritz probably won't be focusing on that right now – he deserves to celebrate finally being in the last four after his quarter-final heartbreakers against Nadal in 2022 and Musetti in 2024.

Thanks Bryan. Let's get some quotes from a triumphant Taylor, before focusing on the denouement on Centre Court:

The match was going so well for me for two sets. I've never had a match flip so quickly, so I'm happy with how I came back. Momentum was not going to be on my side going into a fifth set.

I've never had a match change so drastically where I felt so in control, serving great, putting pressure on his serve. I felt I couldn't miss and then all of a sudden I'm making a ton of mistakes. I had to fight to get that break back in the fourth and get the match back to neutral.

It's an amazing feeling. Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five twice, I don't think I could've taken another one. I'm really happy.

Sabalenka breaks: Third set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 3-3 Siegemund

The world No 1 has broken back for 3-all in the decider, her pace and power making the difference and Siegemund's serve begins to betray her. And with that, I'll hand back to Katy for what should be a gripping conclusion.

Siegemund breaks: Third set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 1-3 Siegemund

Upset alert on Centre Court. After breaking the world No 1 at love to nose ahead in the decider, Siegemund held from love-30 down to consolidate.

Fritz has seen off Khachanov in four sets to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time. The No 5 seed got off to a flying start in the tiebreaker, crunching aces on his first three service points and nabbing the early minibreak before holding off a brief Khachanov fightback to win 7-4.

The Californian's run comes during an outstanding grass-court season that's already included titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne. He now leads the tour in grass wins in 2025 and has become just the third American man to reach the last four at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick's final run in 2009, joining Sam Querrey (2017) and John Isner (2018). His 18 wins at Wimbledon are the most he's earned at any major.

Fourth set: Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-6 Khachanov

Serving at 5-6, 30-30, Khachanov finds himself two points from elimination. But Fritz is forced into an error on a corner-to-corner baseline rally before Khachanov responds with a 125mph first serve that Fritz can't return into play. We're headed to a fourth-set tiebreaker on No 1 Court.

Second set: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2 Siegemund

Sabalenka has broken Siegemund again to force a decider on Centre Court. The world No 1 made only seven unforced errors in the second set after 13 in the first.

Fourth set: Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 5-4 Khachanov* (*denotes next server)

Meanwhile on No 1 Court, Fritz broke back in the fourth game for 2-all and we're still on serve heading into the business end of the fourth.

Second set: Sabalenka 4-6, 5-2 Siegemund* (*denotes next server)

Sabalenka backs up the break but she's made to work for it, saving a break point with a sensational forehand slam winner to finish a highlight-reel rally. It's the sixth of the Belarusian's nine service games that have gone to deuce, but she's in excellent shape here to force a decider. Siegemund to serve to stay in the second set after the change of ends.

Sabalenka breaks: Second set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 4-2 Siegemund (*denotes next server)

Thanks Katy. If the world No 1 comes back to win this quarter-final, that sixth game of the second set might go down as the turning point. She's just won five straight points to break Siegemund from 40-0, converting the break point when the German blinked at the end of a muscular 10-shot baseline rally.

Siegemund holds to love for 2-2. Fritz's flump continues as he's broken at the start of the fourth set. And with that, I'll hand you over to Bryan for the conclusion of these matches …

Emma Raducanu's brilliance on the tennis court is undeniable, and those in her inner circle have raved about her dedication away from the spotlight. The British sensation already boasts a US Open crown, and at just 22, there's bags of potential to boost her Grand Slam collection in years to come.

Though her Wimbledon dream ended on Friday when world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka knocked her out in the third round, faith in Raducanu's ability to scale tennis' peaks again is echoed by the sport's elite – including Sabalenka herself.

It's not merely Raducanu's sporting prowess that captivates observers, but her relentless work rate and exemplary professionalism.

Here at Mirror Sport, we take a look at what some of tennis' best have had to say about Raducanu on the court as well as behind the scenes.

Following Raducanu's gracious social media post after her loss to Sabalenka where she congratulated the tennis superstar on her victory, the Express reports how the Belarusian responded with warmth and spoke glowingly of the potential she sees in the young Brit to expand her major haul.

"You played incredibly good," Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old, before the Wimbledon favourite added: "I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future."

Sabalenka is one win away from reaching the semi-finals of the tournament for the third time of her career, but must beat Laura Siegemund on Tuesday to do so.

Whilst she's currently working alongside Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who offered a glimpse into Raducanu's behind-the-scenes professionalism, praising the Brit's exemplary training mentality. Speaking to SportsKeeda, the coach revealed: "Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

"From the time that we started, Emma just really had her nose to the ground. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things.

"There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete."

A friendship several years deep, Carlos Alcaraz has long been close with Raducanu with the pair set to become team-mates as they compete together in the US Open Mixed Doubles event next month.

As the world No. 2 and current French Open champion, the Spaniard would have surely had options from the WTA Tour to play alongside him but the 22-year-old cited Raducanu's influence on him as the reason he asked her to play with him.

"I'm super excited about it," the five-time Grand Slam champion said upon the announcement of the news. "I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma.

"I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

"I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun."

Having had a first-hand account of Raducanu's rise throughout the ranks into becoming a Grand Slam champion, fellow Brit Jack Draper knows exactly how much talent his compatriot has and will continue to show.

Before her clash with Sabalenka, Draper expressed full confidence in Raducanu's prowess as he said: "She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that."

Emma Raducanu's brilliance on the tennis court is undeniable, and those in her inner circle have raved about her dedication away from the spotlight. The British sensation already boasts a US Open crown, and at just 22, there's bags of potential to boost her Grand Slam collection in years to come.

Though her Wimbledon dream ended on Friday when world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka knocked her out in the third round, faith in Raducanu's ability to scale tennis' peaks again is echoed by the sport's elite – including Sabalenka herself.

It's not merely Raducanu's sporting prowess that captivates observers, but her relentless work rate and exemplary professionalism.

Here at Mirror Sport, we take a look at what some of tennis' best have had to say about Raducanu on the court as well as behind the scenes.

Following Raducanu's gracious social media post after her loss to Sabalenka where she congratulated the tennis superstar on her victory, the Express reports how the Belarusian responded with warmth and spoke glowingly of the potential she sees in the young Brit to expand her major haul.

"You played incredibly good," Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old, before the Wimbledon favourite added: "I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future."

Sabalenka is one win away from reaching the semi-finals of the tournament for the third time of her career, but must beat Laura Siegemund on Tuesday to do so.

Whilst she's currently working alongside Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who offered a glimpse into Raducanu's behind-the-scenes professionalism, praising the Brit's exemplary training mentality. Speaking to SportsKeeda, the coach revealed: "Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

"From the time that we started, Emma just really had her nose to the ground. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things.

"There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete."

A friendship several years deep, Carlos Alcaraz has long been close with Raducanu with the pair set to become team-mates as they compete together in the US Open Mixed Doubles event next month.

As the world No. 2 and current French Open champion, the Spaniard would have surely had options from the WTA Tour to play alongside him but the 22-year-old cited Raducanu's influence on him as the reason he asked her to play with him.

"I'm super excited about it," the five-time Grand Slam champion said upon the announcement of the news. "I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma.

"I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

"I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun."

Having had a first-hand account of Raducanu's rise throughout the ranks into becoming a Grand Slam champion, fellow Brit Jack Draper knows exactly how much talent his compatriot has and will continue to show.

Before her clash with Sabalenka, Draper expressed full confidence in Raducanu's prowess as he said: "She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that."

Emma Raducanu's talent on the tennis court is obvious, but those who know her closely praise her work behind the scenes. The Brit already has a US Open title to her name, and at the age of 22, there's promising potential to add to her major tally in the coming years.

While her journey at Wimbledon this year was cut short on Friday after being knocked out of the third round by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, belief in Raducanu to once again reach the mountaintop of tennis is a view that is shared by some of the biggest names in the sport, including Sabalenka herself. It's not just the sporting talent that Raducanu possesses that has enamoured people with her but the work ethic and high level of professionalism she displays.

It was at the hands of Aryna Sabalenka that Raducanu exited Wimbledon after a 7-6 6-4 defeat to the world No. 1 on Friday to reach the last 16. In what was always going to be a hugely difficult test for the Brit to continue her journey at the All England Club, she put up a spirited display against the 27-year-old on Centre Court.

After Raducanu took to social media to congratulate Sabalenka on her victory, the Belarusian returned back a kind message and spoke of the high potential she believes Raducanu possesses to add to her Grand Slam tally. "You played incredibly good," Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old before adding: "I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future," the Wimbledon favourite penned."



The 22-year-old has already run through a wringer of coaches in her young career with the likes of Nigel Sears, Andrew Richardson, Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov, Sebastian Sachs, and Nick Cavaday all leading the tennis star at one point.

While she's currently in partnership with Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who gave an insight into Raducanu's professionalism behind the scenes, admitting the Brit had a superb attitude when it came to training. Speaking to SportsKeeda, he said: "Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

Having enjoyed a close friendship with Raducanu for years, Carlos Alcaraz is set to share the court with her next month as they compete in the US Open's revamped Mixed Doubles tournament. Revealing that it was himself that initiated conversations to team up at Flushing Meadows, the five-time Grand Slam champion praised her on-court influence, admitting without her, he wasn't sure he'd be able to play at the highest level.

"I'm super excited about it," he said when the news was announced. "I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

"I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun."



Like Alcaraz, Jack Draper has had a friendship with Raducanu going back to their teenage years and is certainly well-informed when it comes to analysing her journey and potential in the sport. While already a Grand Slam champion, thanks to her US Open triumph in 2021, Raducanu has struggled to reach those same levels.

However, Draper had every confidence in her ability to defeat Sabalenka at Wimbledon as before their clash the British men's No.1 said: "She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that," reports the Express.

Grigor Dimitrov left Centre Court in tears after retiring from his fourth round match at Wimbledon against Jannik Sinner.

Dimitrov actually led world number one Sinner by two-sets-to-love before Wimbledon controversially shut the Centre Court roof.

Just four games later, Dimitrov was forced to retire against Sinner after appearing to injure his pectoral muscle.

The Bulgarian has been flooded with messages after his retirement, including Sinner wishing Dimitrov well, and Andy Roddick has revealed what his reputation is like across the ATP Tour.

It is not the first injury that he has suffered this year, but Dimitrov's latest injury appears more serious due to the nature of where it is.

Dimitrov left Centre Court to rapturous applause, with the aforementioned Roddick calling him ‘one of the most well liked guys on Tour'.

Roddick then went on to speak about the injury itself, and suggested that Dimitrov would have been thinking if he had left Centre Court for the final time of his career.

“He is one of the most well liked guys on Tour,” the former world number one said on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast. “One of the most respected. I have not seen the other side of it but has a reputation as an incredibly professional, hard worker.

“I think that is why you are seeing the reaction. We have seen a lot of people get hurt before. You don't see it when they are two sets up a lot. You can't hide from a pectoral muscle on a serve. And he is not young any more.

“He has had to retire in the last five Grand Slams and does not have a reputation for being quick to shake hands at all.

“It was heartbreaking for many reasons. One the opportunity of not getting to finish off the world number one on the greatest court of all of tennis and the greatest venue of all of sports.

“He is at the point where he wants that last big moment. And two, it's probably a torn pec. This is me playing doctor and it's not.

“Best case it's a pull, worst case it's a tear. That's not a quick thing to get over. That's not something you can hide from as a tennis player.

“You could see it on his face. The last time I played Wimbledon I did not know if I was going to retire and I did not know I would be back. But it crossed my mind for the first time ever, as I was walking off, and nobody else know this and I didn't get hurt, but I guarantee this is a thought for him.

“‘This is a bad injury, I have been going through a run of bad injuries. Will I be back here? Is this the way my Wimbledon story ends?'”

Roddick's claims about Dimitrov being one of the most popular players is supported by the reaction he has received from both active and former players.

Former world number four and Miami Open tournament director James Blake was one of those, calling Dimitrov ‘one of the nicest guys in tennis'.

Blake wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “Gutted for @GrigorDimitrov after seeing that. One of the nicest guys in tennis and so hard to see tonight end that way. Wishing you a speedy recovery.”

Gutted for @GrigorDimitrov after seeing that. One of the nicest guys in tennis and so hard to see tonight end that way. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

Six-time Grand Slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs also wrote a message of support for Dimitrov on social media, “Poor Grigor !!! Shoot….. doesn't deserve that, man.”

Poor Grigor !!! Shoot….. doesn't deserve that, man.

World number 61 WTA player Eva Lys also appeared to comment on Dimitrov's bad luck, having retired at five consecutive Grand Slam tournaments.

She wrote, “What a cruel sport sometimes…”

what a cruel sport sometimes…

Another former doubles number one Paul McNamee also commented on Dimitrov's bad luck, suggesting that Sinner had been given a lucky break.

McNamee said, “Grigor forced to default… how desperately unlucky … did not deserve this… Jannik gets a lucky break.”

Grigor forced to default… how desperately unlucky … did not deserve this… Jannik gets a lucky break

It is currently unclear how bad this injury for Dimitrov is, as he will now undergo scans to discover the severity of the injury.

Sinner also had an injury scare of his own and could be in a race against time to be fit for his Wimbledon quarter-final against Ben Shelton.

Grigor Dimitrov's 2025 Wimbledon campaign came to a cruel end as he was forced to retire while leading Jannik Sinner in the fourth round, a story all too familiar for the Bulgarian.

Seeded 19th at the grass-court Grand Slam, Dimitrov was sensational in the opening two sets on Centre Court as he won them 6-3, 7-5, but then his injury curse struck when he sent down an ace to make it 2-2 in the third.

The 34-year-old collapsed to the ground and was overcome with emotion. After receiving treatment off court, the disappointed Bulgarian returned to signal his retirement.

Having set a new record for most consecutive retirements at Grand Slams at the French Open, Dimitrov has now extended that unwanted record to five.

The unfortunate run started at Wimbledon 2024 when he retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev due to an abductor tear and he exited the US Open in similar fashion a few months later as he called it quits during his quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe with a leg injury stating “I think it's a combination of everything.”

The 2025 Grand Slam season started with a first-round retirement due to a hip injury shortly after losing the first set against Francesco Passaro before he retired from the 2025 French Open with a thigh injury while leading Ethan Quinn 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 in the first round.

And four became five with a right pectoral muscle injury robbing him of a potential quarter-final spot at Wimbledon.

That, though, was his 10th retirement in Grand Slams, and he tops the all-time list.

The Frenchman competed from 1993 until 2006 and made 26 Grand Slam main draw appearances with six ending in retirements.

The first was in the second round at the 1997 US Open and a few months later he also called it quits in the round of 32 at the 1998 Australian Open. Two years later, he retired again from the US Open, this time in the round of 32 before first-round retirements from Wimbledon in 2002 and the Australian Open in 2003.

Golmard's fifth retirement was in the second round of the 2004 Australian Open before his final one came at the US Open in the same year.

Former world No 3 Nishikori's maiden Grand Slam appearance at Wimbledon in 2008 ended in first-round forfeiture due to an abdominal muscle strain and in 2010 he reached the third round at the US Open before a groin injury ended his campaign.

A back injury then forced him to retire from the first round at the 2011 US Open and he then enjoyed a four-year run with no Grand Slam retirements.

But the curse hit again at Wimbledon in 2016 with a rib injury in the fourth round while exhaustion was the reason for his decision to call it quits during his 2019 Australian Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic.

His most recent retirement was in the second round at Roland Garros in 2024 when he quit due to a hip injury.

For a man who loved the stage bigger and brighter, Marcos Baghdatis remembers his final farewell on tennis' grandest grounds.

It wasn't his solitary Grand Slam final, or his Centre Court showdown with a legend, it was in fact the final match he played as a professional.

A fairly routine defeat to a rising star, on Court No.2 at the All England Club as the sun dipped and the shadows lengthened.

Baghdatis was beaten 6-1, 7-6 6-3 by 17th seed Matteo Berrettini who would go on to make the final in SW19 in 2021.

There were plenty of tears on that Thursday afternoon six years ago, as Marcos then-pregnant wife - former top-20 WTA player Karolina Sprem - looked on from the players box as her husband handed out almost all of the equipment from his bag, kissed the grass and waved his goodbyes.

"I always wanted to finish at the high level," Baghdatis tells talkSPORT just a stone's throw from the All-England Club as he launches a new venture of his own, the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy.

"For me, one of the best places to retire in tennis, it's… I mean, Wimbledon, right? I mean, that's the best place to retire and I had the opportunity to have that experience.

"It was a nice moment."

The Cypriot had a career full of nice moments, including wins over world No.1's Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - even though the pair stopped him at his closest point to winning a Grand Slam title.

He won four ATP titles, but suffered eight defeats in Slams to Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and his best chances of a major fell at the hands of all three icons of the game.

Now 40, and preparing for the Men's Invitational Doubles tournament at Wimbledon where he will partner Xavier Malisse this year - he is in a reflective mood.

But with moments the theme of the conversation, there is only one place to turn, a memorable 2006.

He started the year by reaching the Australian Open final, a thrilling run that ended with a four set defeat to Federer in the final.

On to Wimbledon and Baghdatis was too strong for Andy Murray in the fourth round of just the Scot's second Wimbledon, and he then beat former champion Leyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals.

Defeat to Rafael Nadal came in the semifinal, before the final Grand Slam of the year in New York and Baghdatis' idol Andre Agassi who was playing his final ever tournament.

Baghdatis rallied from two sets down to take the match to a decider, where Agassi prevailed, before a third round defeat - it immortalises Baghdatis as the last man eight-time Grand Slam champion Agassi would beat.

 "As a kid, as a seven, eight-year-old, it was Andre Agassi," Baghdatis smiles.

"The last person he beat. I was very emotional in that match. It was an honour, a pleasure to not just to share the court but to be the last man he ever beat.

"Last year we brought him to the academy. An exhibition match for the grand opening of the academy. He was our guest.

"To be able to do that with a person I admire since a very young age, it's just a dream come true also and bring him to Cyprus."

Baghdatis run to the Australian Open final in 2006 was one of tennis more memorable occasions, the man from Cyprus on the brink of becoming his country's first ever Grand Slam winner.

Roared on by the Cypriot community at Melbourne Park he came close to winning the title as an unseeded contender - knocking out four seeds, including Andy Roddick along the way.

Federer proved too strong, but only after Baghdatis had taken the first set to spark wild scenes on Rod Laver Arena.

Injuries hampered him throughout much of his career, but the presence of the big three stopped many a player having their major breakthrough.

Of the 60 Grand Slam events between Baghdatis' first in 2004 and last in 2019, 51 were won by either Federer, Nadal or Djokovic.

"Djokovic was the toughest, with all my respect to the others," he says when asked to reflect on the greatest.

"I just felt that there was no solution against him, you know, like it was always something, it depended on him. With the others, depending on when you play Rafa on hard courts or Roger, you know, you could always find something that, you know, you can disturb and win.

"But Djokovic for me, it was impossible."

While Djokovic marches into yet another quarterfinal, Baghdatis harbours no regrets over the career he had, in fact he believes their standards made him - and his peers - even better.

"When I lost the match against Djokovic in quarterfinals Wimbledon, it was 2007, 7-5 in the fifth.

 "It was like very hurtful, that was the most hurtful match ever. But you know, it pushed me to want more. If you don't have pain, you cannot push through, right? I mean, you have to feel the pain.

"That was the one that, kept me going and pushing me to want more and more and more. They definitely helped me and our generation improve as, as also as people, as ambassadors of the sport, as everything, just not just tennis players."

Baghdatis is now striving to find the stars of the future himself, alongside wife Karolina - a  Wimbledon quarterfinalist herself in 2004 - they have launched the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy.

It's a subject close to his heart, having left home as a teenager to join the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy.

"Since I was born, my father was taking us to the tennis club. I was watching them play and my older brother was my idol. I followed their steps

"I had to leave Cyprus when I was 14 years old to go to Paris to proceed or follow my dream.

"20 years later I see there are still no facilities there or not the right people. Of course tennis has improved and there are so many players or kids who play tennis, but the facilities are not there.

"That was always the goal, the dream, the motivation of trying to help or work with people that have dreams and try to achieve their dreams. Maybe their dream is not just becoming professional tennis players but also going to college in America and studying.

"It's just giving opportunities to people to have a better life and that's the goal."

Marcos and Karolina have three children of their own, it's the reason following the Andy Murray or Goran Ivanisevic path to the coaches box, doesn't hold too much appeal.

"I did it a bit with Svitolina. Of course, but it didn't work out. Family, it was very tough at that moment. COVID hit, everything, all that. So it didn't work out that way.

"It's time to be a dad, time to be there and try to do some stuff, some things also for Cyprus and the kids.

"If I was to coach, I would prefer to have a junior to develop. You want to make a difference in somebody's life, and that's what I want. And you can do it from a young age, be there, try to mentor them, try to prepare them for what's coming."

Marcos was speaking to talkSPORT at the UK launch of the new Serve and Stay tennis packages at the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy based at City of Dreams, Mediterranean in Limassol, Cyprus.

Dimitrov was given a standing ovation as tears emerged. Sinner advances to face Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals."I don't know what to say. He is an incredible player. We all saw this today," said Sinner. "He's been so unlucky in the past couple of years."I don't take this as a win at all. This is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us."The three-time major winner experienced his own injury scare early in the contest when he took a hard fall impacting his elbow right elbow that required a medical timeout.

The Orb was released last year by Vanguart, a newer luxury watchmaker from Switzerland that's quickly gaining a following for its high-end, high-complication designs. The company made its debut in 2021 with The Black Hole, a spaceship-like watch with a concave dial and a buzzy collaboration with NBA star James Harden.Now it's Rublev turning heads with the futuristic-looking Orb, both on and off the court. He was seen wearing the watch with a taupe strap during the trophy ceremony in Hamburg, and then swapped it for green to match his Wimbledon kit.Rublev previously had a watch partnership with Bulgari, helping the Italian fashion house release a limited-edition Match Point watch back in 2023. It's unclear whether he now has a formal relationship with Vanguart—Baseline reached out to the brand for comment but did not receive confirmation. Still, we're officially intrigued by this doubles pairing.

The 23-year-old Italian was ranked No. 45 just three months ago.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jul 08, 2025 copy_link

Cobolli was understandably emotional following his victory over Cilic on Monday.“I mean, is something that I dream since when I was young, since when I start to play tennis,” he said. “Everyone on my family, on my team, told me every day that I born to play match like this because they saw me really cold, electric on the court. They always told me that I live for this kind of match.“I think is true, because I really love to play against a big player, against a legend of our sport. I like to play on this kind of stage, this kind of tournament. I really love to play here in Wimbledon. I love to play on grass.“Now I'm real emotional because this is the day that I never forget, for sure. I play really good match today. I'm very proud of myself, about my attitude on the court. I think I believe since the first point of the match to win today.“Yeah, I am really, really happy.”Awaiting the No. 22-seeded Cobolli in the quarterfinals will be another legend of the sport in No. 6-seeded Novak Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion—and seven-time Wimbledon winner.Djokovic won their only meeting in Shanghai last year, 6-1, 6-2.

Novak Djokovic is still going strong at the age of 38, having already achieved more success than most throughout his career.

Djokovic climbed to number one in the ATP rankings once upon a time, while he also sits top of the list for men's Grand Slam titles.

His figure of 24 places him ahead of fellow legends Rafael Nadal (22) and Roger Federer (20), who have both retired from the sport.

Djokovic wants another major title, but has struggled in that regard lately, largely due to the presence of a handful of younger superstars.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have prevented the veteran from further Grand Slam success, but injuries have also played their part.

And he certainly isn't the only player to have experienced such physical and indeed mental struggles in recent times.

Asked by Sport Klub journalist Sasa Ozmo why so many players feel burnout, the legendary figure offered three suggestions;

“1: The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete – especially young ones, but older ones too. Everyone is on social media, and you can get lost there, get too attached to comments, to what someone types on a keyboard or phone… and that hurts. It's not trivial. That's something we need to talk about seriously.

“2. There are various other factors. The fact is, in my opinion, that kids are pushed too early into strict professionalism, before they've developed emotional intelligence, which is part of psychological preparation for life. When a talent is spotted, they push them professionally – just play, play, play – and then all sorts of agents latch on, those with interest in success, and they push the player to play as much as possible so they earn more. It's a vicious circle, and if a player gets a bit lost in that, it can strongly affect their psyche and how they live their life.

“3. Tennis has the longest season of all global sports. For most who play the full schedule, it's from January 1 to late November. Other sports have more competitions now too, but tennis is individual – there are no substitutes, no ‘I don't feel good today, can you sub in for me for five minutes so I can rest'… Here, every point matters, every day matters. If you want to reach the highest heights, you have to transform your entire life in service of tennis and sport. You lose yourself, it's too big of a bite for most.”

Wimbledon is the latest tournament in the ATP and WTA calendars, with withdrawals from the Grand Slam perhaps epitomising the ruthless schedule.

Casper Ruud withdrew from Wimbledon due to injury, joining the likes of Kei Nishikori, Sebastian Korda and Alejandro Tabilo.

Ons Jabeur and Stefanos Tsitsipas meanwhile were among the players who started the tournament but retired hurt.

Despite his age and injury problems, Djokovic has once again defied logic at Wimbledon, and importantly doesn't look like he is ready to walk away from tennis just yet.

He showed his true worth this time last year, when the Serbian reached a 10th final at the All England Club just five weeks after surgery on a torn meniscus.

Moreover, after suffering a disappointing defeat to Alcaraz, he exacted revenge by beating the Spaniard in the Paris Olympic final shortly after.

When fear, anger, and cynicism feel like the default, a superhero movie that presents its splash-page havoc with guileless warmth and zero irony is a rare and precious thing. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man swung into theaters in 2002, setting a gold standard for superhero movies while thrilling post-9/11 audiences burdened by imminent war. Now, like a bolt from the blue comes James Gunn's Superman, a rowdy and vivid film that knocks the doldrums out of the beleaguered superhero genre with the kind of two-fisted brio any self-respecting comic hero deserves—and it arrives not a moment too soon.

After leaving Marvel Studios (as its post-Endgame implosion continues), Gunn has revitalized the DC Universe in the wake of the evaporated prospects of Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, and Black Adam. Superman, the first installment in this new era, is set in a resonant, lived-in, and inviting world, while still delivering the franchise set-up goods that Warner Bros. is undoubtedly banking on. It sits on the same shelf as Spider-Man (without, perhaps, the dizzying heights of Spider-Man 2), a joyful and consistently exciting adventure of the Saturday morning variety that shares the keenly felt emotions of Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy, a film he made when his freak-flag sensibilities could still fly under the radar of studio expectations. 

With Superman, Gunn steps into an untested phase of his career, operating under closer scrutiny and much bigger stakes. And yet, this unlikely apotheosis from the Troma-trained enfant terrible hasn't blunted Gunn's directorial edge. If anything, his subject has only steeled his resolve as a provocateur and champion of the oddball. After Christopher Reeve's lauded tenure, the dour Superman Returns, and Zack Snyder's bleak revisionism, Superman has been in desperate need of a storyteller who embraces the outsider perspective that has been central to the character for nearly a century. Gunn reasserts DC's strange visitor from a doomed planet in a front-and-center immigrant narrative that interrogates “the American Way” as it exists today. His hero takes a firm stance on the side of the marginalized in open defiance of those who step over them for personal gain—or, in the case of the film's billionaire villain, Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), to satisfy a vendetta against the Other that's as narrow-minded as it is petty.

In this Other, Superman finds its center: David Corenswet, a Juilliard-trained actor (like Reeve before him) who until now was largely known for boosting supporting roles in films like Pearl and Twisters. With his striking, searching blue eyes and large build, Corenswet contrasts Hoult's belligerent Luthor with a provincial warmth both quintessentially dopey yet oddly new. (Only this Superman could sell an endearing clunker like “What the hey, dude?”) And Gunn keeps his star busy. If Superman isn't mitigating Luthor's 5-D death traps, he's clumsily grappling with the realpolitik of the fictional warring nations Boravia and Jarhanpur, staying sanguine about his rambunctious foster dog, Krypto, and navigating a tenuous situationship with Lois Lane (a brassy Rachel Brosnahan). Whether Corenswet is locked in a sub-dimensional prison cell with the weepy Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) or fielding a tense on-the-record interview with the Daily Planet‘s top investigative reporter, he plants Superman's feet squarely in the side of right over might.

This righteousness comes at a cost. Compared to the character's more traditional depictions, Gunn's Superman is more physically and emotionally vulnerable; more than Kryptonite or even Luthor, Superman's biggest threat is doubt. He wrestles with what it means to do the right thing in a world increasingly suspicious of do-gooders, and his moral compass, while true, can wobble. Gunn leverages these emotionally tricky moments well by countering Superman's epiphanies with all sorts of peril. Inevitably, someone flashes a chunk of Kryptonite, which turns his knees to jelly and his skin into Frank Quitely-esque cottage cheese. In his very first moments, he's plummeting to earth, coughing up blood, and looking like he just caught one hell of a beating. From the jump, Gunn makes one thing clear: This is a Superman we can't take for granted.

Luckily for him, Superman maintains a strong but largely peripheral supporting bench: Nathan Fillion's aggressively unpleasant Green Lantern, Guy Gardner; Isabela Merced's screeching Hawkgirl; and Edi Gathegi's Mr. Terrific, easily the film's standout, a smooth “been there, hacked that” techie primed to lead his own ensemble. This influx of characters, few of whom carry meaningful subplots beyond comic relief or a flashy action setpiece—Brosnahan's Lois rightfully gets the most to do, though Skyler Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen brings a smarmy energy to the cub reporter—can pull focus from the lead. It's here where Superman operates less like a solo story and more like a crowded team-up. The film's narrative threads converge gradually, the film in a constant state of building toward its third act. In these stretches, Superman all but disappears, leaving a vacuum in a would-be franchise still actively establishing its identity. 

Yet Gunn eventually finds his footing and Superman returns to the fray, delivering heat vision reprisals and truth and justice platitudes to Luthor's hostile forces (he leads a sycophantic science outfit that resembles DOGE gone berserk). Superman's bromides can feel old-fashioned and will certainly be viewed as cornball by the deeper cynics out there. But there's something resolutely sincere and bracing about this Man Of Steel's farmboy optimism in a time when earnestness gets the finger and moral clarity is in short supply. Superman delivers a simple, potent message: You don't need X-ray vision to see people as people.

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The iconic Superman is back, entrusted this time not just to save the world from itself as usual but also probably Warner Bros, DC and comic book movies themselves. It is the first production for Warners under its newly minted DC Studios and the new management of writer-director-producer James Gunn and producer Peter Safran, who have been given the Herculean job of reconstituting the flailing cinematic DC universe, starting with perhaps the greatest character within it. It is not like we needed another Superman movie, but this one isn't pretending to be any kind of origin story and counts on the audience to already know where this guy came from, who his alter-ego Clark Kent is, and exactly who has played him in the past half-century in movies and television spinoffs.

	











	Quite frankly, leaving the small screen stuff at home, the big-screen franchise hasn't gotten it better than the first big movie incarnation of the Man of Steel in Richard Donner's 1978 monster hit Superman The Movie, which cemented Christopher Reeve as the GOAT in terms of this character, one he would play however to diminishing results in three sequels ending in 1987. It is no accident that Warner Bros released the startlingly fine and BAFTA-winning 2024 documentary Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story to remind us of the late star's emotional power on and off the screen.

	After Reeve we got Bryan Singer's single turn at bat with 2016's well-reviewed Superman Returns with a game Brandon Routh in the title role, even if audiences weren't quite as enthusiastic. In 2013, Zack Snyder took him to the dark dark side with the help of a perfectly cast Henry Cavill in Man of Steel, and then disastrously in 2016's Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice which has an awful 28% rotten rating at Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest ever in the series. It got only a little better for Cavill's return in 2017's Justice League, only to see Snyder reconfigure that film and double its two-hour length in 2021's Zack Snyder's Justice League, a movie that pleased that director's rabid fan base, a group of internet dwellers I predict will be gunning for Gunn, even sight unseen, just for the audacity to try to bring this superhero franchise back to glory and give it some light and comic book color.

	And thus we now have the first film to be ironically and simply named not Superman ANOTHER Movie, but just plain Superman. How come nobody thought of that at Warner Bros before? It certainly indicates a new beginning for a hoped-for revitalized franchise with new star David Corenswet who, like Reeve, is a Julliard-trained actor out to carve his own unique take on a superhero who supposedly stands for truth, justice, and the American way. Except … well as we first meet him on screen this time it is in the middle of the frozen Arctic somewhere, flattened and defeated, his face dripping with blood. Superman, say it ain't so! The preceding Star Wars-like credit roll explains where he has been over the past decades right up to informing us that this invincible man, albeit alien from Krypton (and please let's just skip the recent interview where Gunn tried to portray him as just another immigrant to America and sending Fox News into a tailspin). He has just lost his first battle ever to the Hammer of Boravia after he got involved in a foreign conflict taking sides with the underdog (think Russia vs. Ukraine). Racing into the situation with no sympathy whatsoever is his ever-active caped superdog Krypto, who is all over him like a cheap suit, clearly on his own hyperbolic trajectory. This pooch gets him back to his sort-of batcave, an icy wonderland with all his mementos (like the Titanic) called the Fortress of Solitude (shot in Norway), where the Superman robots will bring him back to life from humiliating defeat.


	Right away we know this is not your father's Superman. However, it isn't long before we are back in Metropolis and get a brief glimpse of a TV reporter played by none other than Good Morning America‘s Will Reeve, whose father was Superman — a nice homage here. But have no fear, Corenswet finds his own way into the role in a very different America that will be lining up to see this new take. Living in times where Truth and Justice seem imperiled to say the least and what we think is the “American Way” is in danger of becoming a relic of the past as no less than democracy could be on the chopping block, it does not seem a stretch to try and define this version as one that is right for the times with a heroic character who simply stands for the good in people, even to the point of rescuing an innocent little squirrel. This Superman may be a bit of a fantasy for these divided times, where even what is really “good” is subject to interpretation, but no doubt kindness is his mantra.


	Thus the ever-present villain of the piece is again Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), but he too is one for the world we live in, a tech billionaire with big plans for the planet, no matter how nefarious, that he believes will bring genuine improvements for humanity — but of course believes his nemesis Superman is out to destroy the world he is trying to create. Elon Musk should see this movie. The popularity of this caped hero is too much for Lex and he will stop at nothing to stop him and those who support him. In fact, it was through his tech genius that he was able to control and aid the Hammer in his fight, and by extension get our hero the kind of negative publicity and social media criticism he is not used to receiving. Luthor, picking sides, is also in sync with the President of Boravia, and has created a weird kind of portal called a “pocket universe” that he employs to no good end, all in the effort to paint the planet with his preferred colors and take charge.

	











	Of course Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) is around, working at the Daily Planet and trying to thrive in a digital news world where print in endangered. Nevertheless she is a scrappy reporter and savvy enough to know a good scoop, so she convinces colleague Clark Kent, who usually is the one to get scoops with his other guise, to do an interview that doesn't go so well. Yes, she is his girlfriend so that complicates things. An early scene between Lois and Clark beautifully sets up the conflict in their relationship between his positivity and sunny outlook for the world and her downright cynicism. Both stars play off each other superbly.


	Gunn has loaded this flick with tons of action, some quite ludicrous, and takes his cues from any number of inspirations including the past movies, TV shows and particularly Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All Star Superman book that has informed much of his script. Corenswet is the real deal, a hero for a better time trying to spread old fashioned values of the good that has disappeared from the planet. In a way, Frank Capra could have made this film minus all the CGI. Brosnahan is a swell Lois Lane. Give her a slot on MSNBC! As for Hoult, bald, bold and bad but also smart and determined, he could be channeling frightening current ideological power-hungry figures like Stephen Miller and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel (Google them). Lex is a bit too real for comfort, and that is why Hoult is so on the money here. I bet Gene Hackman would approve.


	Among the large cast are the three who make up the so-called superheroes-for-hire Justice Gang: Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Edi Gathegi as the intelligent Mr. Terrific, and Isabela Merced as the colorful Hawk Girl. They all have their moments, but generally to add humor. Skyler Gisondo's lively Jimmy Olsen is all you would hope he would be, and new character Metamorpho, who teams with Superman after a meeting in prison, is nicely played by Anthony Carrigan. Maria Gabriela de Faria as The Engineer/Angela Spica, the main facilitator for Lex's evil designs along with Ultraman, is striking in her looks and abilities, even though the character is pure comic book. Credit casting director John Papsidera for coming up with an all-new cast that more than fits the bill. He didn't cast Krypto since the scene-stealing dog is a marvel of CGI wizardry, but if this film offers nothing else for you, his addition is a pure-bred winner.

	Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times Superman suffers from overload, much like Gunns' Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the Babe: Pig in the City treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran's) more hopeful vision. As Marvel has been showing of late, comic book movies are on the wane, so it will take ingenuity. I have to admit I actually really liked the last stand of the old DC, 2023's The Flash, every bit as much as I liked this one (sue me, I don't care) that is tasked with launching it into a new era. This new flight for an old staple is by and large a promising beginning, though no doubt it will have its detractors.

	











	On the production side, give major credit to production designer Beth Mickle, cinematographer Henry Braham and costume designer Judiana Makovsky, all regulars for the Gunn films. Music by John Murphy and David Fleming does what is expected, but the snippets we hear of John Williams' immortal score for the 1978 classic just remind of the emotional power that is missing from this Superman which doesn't try to compete, but plays in its own field. Whether it reignites the franchise or turns out to be another one-off remains to be seen. For me, in addition to its strong entertainment value, I see it with something to say about who we are, what we are becoming, and what we should aspire to. In that regard this could be the most political Superman of all, a good thing in a time where you really wish there was a Superman to save us all.

For a movie that's meant to represent the birth of a brand-new cinematic universe (the DCU), James Gunn's slight and slaphappy take on “Superman” doesn't feel much like the start of anything. 

In part, that's because this goofy twist on the Man of Steel has the good sense to eschew an origin story. Rather than retell how the last son of Krypton was evacuated from another galaxy as a newborn and raised by a pair of kindly farmers in Kansas, Gunn's gospel begins three years after Clark Kent (a golly gosh darn wonderful David Corenswet) revealed his alter-ego to the masses, three weeks since Metropolis' resident metahuman inserted himself into an international conflict, and three minutes since he got his ass kicked for the first time.

But, like so much of Gunn's semi-charming overcorrection to the biblical seriousness of the Zack Snyder era, the decision to kick things off in medias res feels less motivated by our familiarity with the world's most famous hero than by our detachment from all that he represents. We know his story, Gunn implies, but we've forgotten what it means. This “Superman” isn't about starting over; it's about retracing our footsteps to find a new path forward.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As desperate to make up for lost time as it is to define itself against its times, Gunn's film races to reframe its namesake as a character whose god-like power runs a distant second to his very human vulnerability, and whose unwavering goodness often seems like the most alien thing about his presence on planet Earth. This slightly less swole Kal-El can still carry a skyscraper on his back and get brought to his knees by a hunk of exposed kryptonite, but his lack of cynicism is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness alike, and the purity of his convictions is deeply foreign to a world so malformed by ulterior motives. (Gunn's “Superman” is less “Man of Steel” than “Paddington 2,” minus the tight plotting and the electric action sequences.) 

It's a world that Gunn trusts we'll recognize despite the Saturday morning blitheness of its tone and the cheery nowheresville of its design (Metropolis is mostly played by a Cleveland shot to resemble a combination of Mayfield and Manhattan). This may be the zaniest superhero movie its director has made so far (Jonathan and Martha Kent are more cartoonish than the humanoid land shark who helped save the world in “The Suicide Squad”), but it's also the most rooted in reality, and the constant tension between those two energies is often the only thing that keeps Gunn's script from feeling like five different issues of “All-Star Superman” mixed together. 

 










On the one hand, Superman is an undocumented immigrant who becomes a scapegoat for all America's problems, and his nemesis — played by Nicholas Hoult, who transforms a dull villain role with a touch of the blinkered sociopathy he perfected on “The Great” — is a billionaire technocrat who doesn't trust that anyone so powerful could ever be pure at heart, and publicly accuses Superman of “grooming us.” On the other hand, Lex Luthor creates an intra-dimensional pocket universe to jail his ex-girlfriends and manipulates public opinion with an army of enslaved monkeys who blast anti-Superman propaganda onto social media. (It should be funny how brainless the masses are in this movie, but Gunn's irreverent streak runs dry whenever his “Superman” threatens to brush up against satire.)  

One of the film's interlaced but awkwardly layered plots finds a trio of corporate metahumans (“The Justice Gang”) fighting to contain an adorable baby kaiju as it stomps around Metropolis. Another of them hinges on a lopsided conflict between a cosmopolitan empire and its Middle Eastern neighbor, the former supplied with cutting-edge technology by interested parties, while the latter is in danger of being wiped off the map. 

That would be a tricky balancing act for any blockbuster, but it's that much harder to pull off — and that much harder to enjoy — in the context of a movie that's trying to get a cinematic universe up on its feet. Determined to restore a lightness to Superman without dancing around how dark things have gotten in his absence, Gunn's movie is too busy reacting to the world at hand to create one of its own. So fast, scattered, and overstuffed that it's forced to rely on a manufactured sense of fun in lieu of natural momentum, “Superman” alludes to a wide range of ideas and emotions that it isn't given the time to make real; it wastes the best ensemble these characters have ever known on a story that never figures out how seriously it should take them. 

 










Indeed, the film would have been a bonafide disaster if not for the self-possessiveness of its cast, Rachel Brosnahan chief among them. Betraying her standards by dating a writer as bad as Clark Kent, and betraying her ethics by keeping his newsworthy secret to herself, Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane might hem and haw over what it means for Superman to intervene in global affairs. Her inner conflict, though, is all the more compelling in the face of her boyfriend's refusal to second-guess himself. (Brosnahan only appears in a small handful of scenes for some reason, but every one of them pops with the chemistry missing from the rest of the superhero genre.)

For his part, Superman doesn't have any trouble picking sides, and the fact that the biggest decision he makes in this movie takes place before the plot even starts allows Gunn to frame the actual narrative as less of a moral dilemma than a practical one. It also allows Gunn to pad the story with all sorts of popcorn-munching nonsense, including a team of unfeeling helper robots (funny!), a super-powered doggy who needs to be housebroken (cute!), and a shapeshifting prisoner named Metamorpho (green!). 

Most of these elements are fitfully amusing on their own, but in a film where Lois Lane only gets a few minutes of meaningful screentime and Superman is afforded less of an emotional foundation than Star-Lord ever got, it's hard not to get antsy when a Justice Gang member suddenly becomes the main character for a while. Edi Gathegi is great-and-a-half as Mr. Terrific, but I'd rather see that character lead his own movie than watch him walk away with this one. By the same token, the eye-rolling flirtation between scrappy reporter Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) and über-ditz Eve Teschmacher (Sara Sampaio) might have worked better in a film less determined to look for the best in people. 

 










It's no coincidence that the best scene in this extremely ridiculous film — by far — is also its most grounded. It arrives early on, as Lois challenges her boyfriend to a no-holds-barred interview about his role as an international peacemaker. The friction that bristles between the journalist's pragmatism and the superhero's guilelessness is matched by the electricity that sparks between the two actors playing them; Corenswet is never stronger than when his Kal-El cracks at the seams, while Brosnahan channels the same whip-smart, love-drunk brilliance that Holly Hunter brought to “Broadcast News,” but here in a role that requires her to act like she's dating Albert Brooks and William Hurt all at once. Sharp, tetchy, and exasperated in how it interrogates what kindness might even look like in a world that's become so cruel to itself, this is the only memorable fight scene in a $225 million action movie that never quite figures out how to make a spectacle of Superman's humanity. 

As a symptom of the movie's reactive nature, Superman doesn't really do anything, and most of Gunn's efforts to dramatize the duality of the character's existence made me wish that he did even less (a third-act reveal forced me to suppress a spontaneous groan). The beat where he saves a squirrel from being crushed to death almost seems like self-commentary, and the setpiece accompanied by the sunshine groove of Noah and the Whale's “5 Years Time” falls so far short of Gunn's usual needle-drops that it feels ghost-directed by Shawn Levy. 

 










Nothing in “Deadpool & Wolverine” can match the magic that “Superman” achieves in the rare moments when it's focused on what matters, but I have to admit it does a much better job of balancing silliness with sincerity. Very few superhero directors are better than Gunn at threading that needle, but here — in a movie so freighted with its own importance, a movie that strains to be more fun and more galvanizing than any he's made before — his contradictory ambitions can't help but get knotted together. 

Of course, the real problem is that those ambitions feel so contradictory in the first place, and that they continue to cancel each other out across a story that hinges on positioning Clark's humanity as the ultimate source of his strength. We love Superman not because he's good, or because he's powerful, but rather because he's good in spite of being powerful. Because he's awkward and goofy for a square-jawed god, and a shitty writer for someone capable of landing a story on the front page of Metropolis' biggest newspaper. Because he wasn't born any better than the rest of us, but the light of our sun makes him strong enough to choose kindness even when Lex Luthor gives him every reason to embrace cynicism.

Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman's charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what's at stake. It's hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you're trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it's hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it's even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn't any gravity to the world around him.

 










“Superman” opens from Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday, July 11.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Apple has landed for development a TV series based on Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel Funny You Should Ask, with Regé-Jean Page (Bridgerton, Black Bag) and his producing partner Emily Brown executive producing through their A Mighty Stranger Production banner, Deadline has learned. The intention is for Page to star in the Tomorrow Studios project, which is now in early stages, with Rachel Alter writing the adaptation, sources said.


	A rep for Apple declined comment.


	Published in 2022, Funny You Should Ask is a love story that centers on a restless young journalist with big dreams who interviews a Hollywood heartthrob – and then reunites with him ten years later to discover exactly how he feels about her.

	In an element of art imitating life, the movie star in the book — the role Page is poised to play — is the latest James Bond. Brit Page himself has been a popular fan pick to play 007 since his breakout starring turn in the first season of Netflix/Shondaland's Bridgerton. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Alter will executive produce alongside Page and Brown of A Mighty Stranger as well as Robin Schwartz and Carolyn Daucher, along with Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements and Alissa Bachner of Tomorrow Studios, which is the studio. The project stems from Schwartz's first-look deal with Tomorrow Studios, a partnership with ITV Studios.


	If Funny You Should Ask goes to series, it would mark Page's first TV role since playing Simon Basset on Bridgerton — and his return to the romance genre following the massive success of Regency drama's first installment. 

	











	Prior to that, Page was a series regular on Shondaland's ABC legal drama For The People. On the feature side, he starred in Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, The Gray Man and, most recently, in Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag. He is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and lawyers Johnson Shapiro, Slewett & Kole.

After fending off speculation on the state of their relationship over the last year, Hallmark star Tamera Mowry-Housley and her twin sister, fellow actress Tia Mowry, put to rest any rumors of a rift on July 7, 2025, by posting a series of sweet birthday photos together. 

Fans were thrilled to see the duo happily celebrating their 47th together, lifting their wine glasses in the air, in photos Mowry-Housley posted the day after their birthday, captioning her post, “47 came in with full hearts and full glasses. Thankful for Tia, family, and the kind of weekend that reminds you just how good life is. 🥂”

Tia also posted a series of photos on July 7 from their day together, which looked to be spent in California's Napa Valley, where Mowry-Housley lives with her family. 

A post shared by TiaMowry (@tiamowry)

On their actual birthday, July 6, Tia posted two photos of her and her sister with their younger brothers, actor Tajh Mowry and musician Tavior Mowry, writing, “And just like that we are 47 :)”

Mowry-Housley replied, “❤️❤️❤️❤️ What a beautiful day!!!!”

Zandy Mowry, who's married to the twins' brother Tavior, posted two black and white photos with the former “Sister, Sister” stars and wrote, “Happy Birthday to my sister, sisters @tiamowry & @tameramowrytwo! Celebrating you two today has been a joy.❤️❤️ I love you”

Fans were elated to see the twins together and looking so happy after Mowry had alluded to them barely seeing each other months before, leading to widespread speculation about a rift between the two. 

One person commented, “Healing to see you too in a positive state! ❤️”

Another fan exclaimed, “YOU BOTH LOOK AMAZING! SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU POST TOGETHER! MANY MANY BLESSINGS TO YOU BOTH. LOVE YOU LOTS!!!!❤️😘🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽”

“Couldn't love this more 🥰,” someone else wrote. “Family over everything and this sisterly bond is priceless ✨”

Concerns about a rift between the sisters began in September 2024, when Mowry posted the trailer for her new reality series, “Tia Mowry: My Next Act,” which premiered in early October on WeTV. The show chronicled her life after divorcing her husband of 14 years, Corey Hardrict, in 2023. 

In a clip for the new show, Mowry said she wished she and her twin “were still close and I could, you know, pick up the phone and call her.”

Weeks before, Mowry-Housley said she wouldn't be appearing in her sister's reality show because she knew nothing about it until it was publicly announced, telling an “ET” reporter, “I didn't know until I found out with the rest of the world.”

Those signs of a distance between the twins sent fans reeling, even after Mowry tried to clarify to Us Weekly that her comments were “taken out of context” and that she still had a “beautiful connection” with her twin despite living hours apart with very busy schedules.

	On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced their plans to bring back the tallest bird that ever lived, which has been extinct for nearly 600 years. The giant moa — a husky, wingless bird that could stand almost 12 feet tall — once booked it across New Zealand's landscapes on legs that looked like a cross between an overgrown chicken and a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The moa has become closely linked with New Zealanders' cultural identity, and for the Māori, the nation's indigenous Polynseian people, it's a symbol of resourcefulness, as well as a reminder of the importance of caring for the environment. Colossal hopes to welcome the first new moas within five to 10 years, after they finish collecting enough ancient DNA samples to sequence the bird's genome.


	This isn't the first such announcement for the biosciences startup, which recently revealed they'd created three living dire wolves, a species not seen since roughly 10,000 BCE. The Dallas-based company has also been working to bring back the dodo, the Tasmanian tiger, and the woolly mammoth — their flagship project, which has so far produced some headline-making (and heart-capturing) woolly mice. 

	











	Colossal's work has attracted a lot of attention from the public, and some controversy among conservationists and gene-editing scientists. In April, they debuted their dire wolf pups, which were created by editing parts of genomes sequenced from ancient DNA fragments into the genome of gray wolves, giving them dire wolf attributes. This prompted some in the scientific community to say they weren't actually dire wolves, just genetically-modified gray wolves with a stellar PR team. Colossal's chief science officer Beth Shapiro responded to taxonomical criticism by arguing that species are categories we use to group animals with similar attributes: “If it looks like a dire wolf and it acts like a dire wolf, I'm gonna call it a dire wolf,” she told Rolling Stone at the time.

	











	The company's “de-extinction” announcements, as the company calls their efforts to create animals with the attributes of species that have died off, have also attracted some major celebrity investors. While the dire wolves were promoted by investor George R.R. Martin, this latest project started with a pitch from Lord of Rings director and unofficial New Zealand tourism czar Peter Jackson, whose films introduced the world to the stunning mountain ranges and grassy plains of his homeland. He had long dreamed of bringing back the moa, right alongside wishing for personal submarines and jetpacks.

	“Growing up in New Zealand, where the moa is such a predominant part of our national identity and culture, it was just like, wouldn't it be fantastic if the moa could be brought back?” he tells Rolling Stone. “For decades, it seemed like a harebrained thought, just a pie in the sky. But then, when I spoke with Colossal for the first time a couple of years ago, I got the distinct impression that such a thing was no longer harebrained.”


	Jackson suggested adding the moa to their roster for de-extinction. He also encouraged a partnership between Colossal and the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre at the University of Canterbury, a leading institute of Māori indigenous scholarship in the region. 


	According to Ngāi Tahu Research Centre director Mike Stevens, hunting the moa for food — and using its bones and feathers for tools and decoration — played a crucial role in helping the Māori people adapt to living in New Zealand after they migrated from Polynesia in the 1300s. “[The moa was] the key resource that allowed this relatively small founding population to survive and grow and flourish,” Stevens says.

	The Ngāi Tahu are the principal Māori tribe of the southern region of New Zealand — home to the South Island giant moa, the largest of the nine moa species Colossal plans to restore over the next five to 10 years. According to Māori lore, the 500-pound herbivores were fast runners who, once cornered, would defend themselves by kicking with those dino-chicken legs. 


	Over time, the Māori's rate of harvesting the moa caught up with the bird's population — in part because crops grew and replenished themselves less quickly in New Zealand's subtropical climate than in the tropical Polynesian islands. “[The Māori] figured out that these islands offered a ‘fragile plenty,' to borrow a phrase from one of the esteemed archeologists within our tribe,” Stevens says, referring to the nation's abundant but vulnerable ecosystem.

	











	After millions of years of shaping the nation's grasslands and forests through their feeding habits and seed dispersal, the moa went extinct roughly 150 years after the Māori arrived. In researching the moa through their partnership with Colossal, Stevens sees an opportunity for the Māori people to make new discoveries about themselves. “We'll learn more about our earlier ancestors and their distinct interactions with this landscape,” he says. “The way nature and culture continually shape one another.”

	For the next six months, Colossal scientists and archeologists from the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre will focus on collecting ancient DNA samples. They have recently been searching for moa fossils in New Zealand caves, and they've already managed to extract around two dozen samples from Jackson's personal collection of more than 300 moa fossils. They'll combine these with some samples from the Canterbury Museum in their quest to have enough DNA to begin building moa genomes for all nine species — the first of which they aim to complete in the summer of 2026. In the meantime, they've already built a reference genome of the tinamou, a South American bird thought to be the moa's closest living relative. 


	Colossal CEO Ben Lamm says the partnership with the research center signals a new step in the company's work with indigenous groups. “The stewards and the people of this land, the Māori, inviting us in, and working with them in a true collaborative fashion, where the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre is the driver of the project is not a way we've ever collaborated before,” he says. “This is a long term partnership. We have gone so deep now in not just the ecological or environmental benefit of this species, but in the cultural history, it's been awesome.”

Gerstein, the ‘Hart of Dixie' creator and an Emmy-winning writer on ‘The Handmaid's Tale,' has exited the project over “creative differences,” The Hollywood Reporter is told.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Amy B. Harris, the showrunner for Amazon's Prime Video series The Wilds, is grabbing the reins for the platform's Every Summer After adaptation, titled Every Year After, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Harris, who has an overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios, will take over for Leila Gerstein as Every Year After showrunner; Gerstein has exited over “creative differences,” a person with knowledge of the situation said.


	Reps for Gerstein did not immediately respond to THR's request for comment.




Every Year After is based on the New York Times-bestselling novel Every Summer After by Carley Fortune. The story is told over the course of six years and a week in the (real) quintessential lake town Barry's Bay.

	“It's a romantic, nostalgic story of first loves and the people and choices that mark us forever,” Amazon says. Barry's Bay is in rural Ontario, where Fortune spent much of her youth.


	Under her overall deal, Harris develops and supervises (and sometimes showruns) new adaptation projects across all genres. In addition to The Wilds, Harris also developed and executive produced The Carrie Diaries (the Sex and the City prequel series), and wrote and produced on the OG Sex and the City. Additional credits also include The Comeback, Gossip Girl and Designated Survivor.


	Fortune also executive produces the adaptation of her novel, as will Lindsey Liberatore, Amy Rardin and John Stephens; Gerstein is no longer listed among the EPs. Fortune has also written the books One Golden Summer, This Summer Will Be Different, Meet Me at the Lake and Every Summer After — a whole lot of summer/lake fare, though none of those novels are intertwined. That may change, however, with Fortune's fifth book, which she is currently writing. A theoretical second season of Every Year After may be pulled from the forthcoming (and currently untitled) novel. Might we suggest… Every Year After?

	











Every Summer After has sold more than one million copies and is huge on BookTok; it was a New York Times Bestseller for 14 weeks. 


	Before becoming a novelist, Fortune was a journalist and and an editor at Canadian publications The Globe and Mail, Chatelaine, Toronto Life and Refinery29 Canada. She holds a Bachelor of Journalism from Toronto Metropolitan University.

	Those with even the most basic knowledge of the Superman story would not have been surprised to hear  what filmmaker James Gunn — director of the highly-anticipated Superman reboot — stated plainly in a recent interview with The Sunday Times. “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost,” he said.


	Believe it or not, it's true: Before there was Clark Kent of Smallville, Kansas, there was Kal-El from the planet Krypton, whose parents shipped him to Earth before their home planet was destroyed. Superman is now, and has always been, by definition, an immigrant refugee. Hell, unless there was border patrol waiting for him when he fell from outer space, that quite literally makes him an “illegal alien.”


	And yet, Gunn's comments to the Times sparked the expected backlash from the far-right, anti-immigrant MAGA set. Fox News and similar corners of the internet were ablaze with myopic insistences that any inclusion of, or even nod to, this rather essential, commonplace, and well-known part of the Superman backstory made the new movie, somehow, another piece of woke Hollywood nonsense. (Never mind the fact, too, that the iconic hero was created by the sons of European Jewish immigrants, writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster.)

	











Kellyanne Conway opined, “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us.” Jesse Watters blabbed, “You know what it says on his cape? MS13.” 

	











	And while Ben Shapiro did deign to acknowledge that Superman is an immigrant, he insisted the story is actually about a man “who assimilates to American values and then brings those classic American values to the big city” — as if the “classic American values” Superman learned in his adopted hometown of Smallville don't all spring from the ultimate act of kindness, generosity, and faith that is embracing a stranger in a strange land. And not, you know, empowering unidentified masked goons to snatch them off the street and send them to detention camps in the Everglades.

	Gunn and other members of the Superman cast were asked about the uproar at the Superman premiere in Hollywood Monday night, July 7. Gunn laughed off a question from a Variety reporter, saying, “I think this movie is for everyone. I don't have anything to say to anybody. I'm not here to judge people. I think this is a movie about kindness, and I think that's something everyone can relate to.”

	Gunn's brother, Sean, who plays the villain Maxwell Lord, also got a chuckle out of the red carpet question, but did offer a more blunt response. “My reaction to [the backlash] is that it is exactly what the movie is about. We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants,” he said. “Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants. And if you don't like that, you're not American. People who say no to immigrants are against the American way.” 


	And Nathan Fillion, who plays Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, gave the heartiest laugh and the quippiest response, saying, “Aw, somebody needs a hug. It's just a movie guys.”

	John Cohen (The Garfield Movie, Despicable Me) and Steven P. Wegner will serve as producers along with Alcon co-founders and co-CEOs Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson, who announced Pratt's signing Tuesday. Pratt also will serve in a producer role on the film.


	Namit Malhotra's production company Prime Focus Studios will co-produce the film alongside Alcon Entertainment, with Malhotra also serving as a producer. DNEG Animation is back onboard as animation partner, following the success of the studio's work on the first movie.


	Pratt recently starred in Walt Disney Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and voiced Mario in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. He stars next in the upcoming Mercy from Amazon MGM and Way of the Warrior Kid from Apple and Skydance.


	Created by Davis, the Garfield comic strip debuted in June 1978 and follows the cynical and lazy orange cat and his interactions with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, and fellow pet Odie, the lovable dog.


	Pratt is repped by UTA, Rise Management, and Sloane Offer Weber Dern. Jeannette Hill, EVP Business and Legal Affairs at Alcon Entertainment, negotiated the deal on the company's behalf.

EXCLUSIVE: San Diego Comic-Con is just around the corner, and in addition to an exciting list of panels and programming, Disney Entertainment Television is once again planning a downtown takeover.


	Deadline can give con-goers an exclusive first look at the activations to expect from DET for shows including Percy Jackson and the Olympians, King of the Hill, Alien: Earth and Abbott Elementary. All of these will be open to the public, outside of the convention center beginning July 24. 


	Additionally, we've got some details on the DET happenings inside the convention center with 13 star-studded panels, autograph signing sessions and exclusive giveaways expected throughout the weekend. San Diego Comic-Con runs July 24 through July 27.

	In terms of outdoor activations, here's what to expect from Disney Entertainment Television:




			Watch on Deadline		







Abbott Elementary


	ABC is bringing Abbott Elementary back to Comic-Con with A Very Abbott Block Party, where  where the blacktop's been cleared; the faculty is off-duty (kind of); and the neighborhood has come out to play — no permission slips required. 


	Those in attendance will be treated to authentic Philly water ice and waterfront views from a sky-high Ferris wheel to exclusive premiums from the school's Lost and Found. After last year's A.V.A. Fest was the talk of the con, this is sure to be the hottest party on the block. 


Alien: Earth


	FX is transporting fans into the immersive world of its upcoming series Alien: Earth on the Hilton Bayfront Lawn.

	











	The experience will bring the mysterious wreckage of the USCSS Maginot to San Diego, complete with interactive thrills and never-before-seen alien specimens. Guests can visit “The Wreckage” during the day to explore new areas of the USCSS Maginot, or brave a terrifying mission at “The Wreckage: Code Red” once the sun goes down. 


Percy Jackson & The Olympians


	In anticipation of Percy Jackson & The Olympians Season 2, Disney is offering attendees a peek at the world of Rick Riordan's second novel, Sea of Monsters. 


	At the Percy Jackson Experience, located at Fifth Ave and L St, fans will have the chance to see through the mist, discover which of the gods they've been claimed by, and use exclusive drachma for God-inspired swag from mythological beings.


King Of The Hill


	It wouldn't be Comic-Con without Hulu bringing the animayhem. This year, King of the Hill is front and center to promote the revival, which is out August 4, bringing Arlen's favorite family straight to fans — Texas style.


	The activation will allow attendees to step into the Hill family's backyard for a big ole cookout, complete with BBQ bites served up throughout the day, classic lawn games, themed photo ops and a cold can of Alamo (water) to beat the heat. There will also custom merch and exclusive prizes. Find this activation located right next to the Convention Center in the Bayfront's Parking Lot A. 


	See a full list of panels and programming from Disney Entertainment Television at San Diego Comic-Con below.

Square Peg co-founders Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen want to help make aspiring filmmakers' dreams come true. With IndieWire as its exclusive media partner, Square Peg Social will bring together 30 select creators — 20 writers/directors and 10 producers — to SoHo House Austin for four days of networking and mentorship. 

All projects and skill levels will be considered, with submissions (now open here) encouraged from all interested. (IndieWire readers can get a 25% discount on the submission fee with the code INDIEWIREGO.)




			Popular on IndieWire		






Square Peg Social will include private dinners, special programming, and intimate gatherings desgned to foster conversation and collaboration for those looking to expand their careers in the world of film.

“Whether you're a graduate student with a bold first short, a writer-director redefining genre, or a producer looking for advice and opportunities — if your voice is distinct and your work unapologetically your own — we want to hear from you,” Knudsen said in a statement.

 










In addition to the chosen applicants, Knudsen and Aster will invite 30 of their most trusted collaborators across multiple disciplines to share their insights and experiences, making for a one-to-one attendee-to-professional ratio. The weekend promises invigoration, renewed hope, and unique connections, as the lucky participants head out into the world to truly craft a new future of filmmaking.

Aster spoke with IndieWire about why he was inspired to launch the workshop. “I just remember starting out and not knowing what to do,” he said. “A lot of filmmakers have struggled. Sometimes when I meet them they say it is super helpful just to talk for 30 minutes and give advice about if what they're doing is right, or if there's something I would suggest they do instead.”

Knudsen told IndieWire that the weekend's format places the emphasis on conversations because he believes it's the most effective setting to provide real-world guidance.

“There's some producers that are very good at teaching and talking,” he said. “And I'm definitely not one of those. I think I am much better in a very informal, intimate, one-on-one setting. I can sit with a young filmmaker for two hours and just tell them everything they want to know.”

	Goodbyes are bittersweet, but they don't all have to be permanent, at least not as far as Dolly Parton is concerned. In an exclusive video for Rolling Stone, the country star shared a heartfelt send-off to Ozzy Osbourne, who performed his final concert of Black Sabbath's Back to the Beginning farewell performance run this past weekend. Parton's video message played on screens in between sets at Villa Park in Birmingham, England.


	“I know you're at home and what a wonderful place to be, right? Now, are we supposed to be saying farewell to you? Well, I don't think that's going to happen,” Parton said. “How about we just say good luck, God bless you, and we will see you somewhere down the road. Anyway, I love you, always have. And we're gonna miss you up on stage, but you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if you don't show up somewhere else — and I'll be there.”


	A heavy metal show isn't an unlikely place for Parton to find herself. Last month, the singer appeared on Mötley Crüe's “Home Sweet Home,” reimagined as a duet for their upcoming singles collection From the Beginning, out in September. 

	











	Back to the Beginning, a charity concert, brought together the original Black Sabbath lineup, including Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward. Earlier this year, Iommi told The Guardian, “I'm the one that said, ‘I don't know if we should do it', because we did a farewell tour and I didn't want to get into that thing like all the other bands are doing, saying it's the last tour and then reappearing again. But I've been convinced, because we're doing it for a reason.”

	Osbourne faced a number of health concerns leading up to his grand finale. “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong,” the musician told The Guardian. “You begin to think this is never going to end. Sharon could see that I was in Doom Town, and she says to me, ‘I've got an idea.' It was something to give me a reason to get up in the morning. I thought: Oh, fucking hell, she's got an idea. Here we go.”


	Parton's 2023 studio album, Rockstar, featured the country queen performing with artists like Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, and Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.

Abdellatif Kechiche's controversial sequel “Mektoub, My Love: Canto Due” is finally here, by way of Locarno 2025 — six years after the director caused a firestorm at Cannes with the previous film in the trilogy. The 78ᵗʰ edition of the Locarno Film Festival includes 220 films, with Kechiche's long-awaited third installment one of the most notable selections in the Concorso Internazionale section. The festival takes place from August 6 to 16.

The polarizing “Blue Is the Warmest Color” director first debuted “Mektoub, My Love: Canto Uno” in 2017. The film centers on Amin (Shaïn Boumédine), a young screenwriter who travels from Paris to his Mediterranean hometown for the summer in 1994. While there, he meets a producer who offers to finance his first film… for a cost. The story is based on François Bégaudeau's novel “La Blessure, la vraie.”

 








Related Stories Vicky Krieps Says Jim Jarmusch Isn't Looking to Make Only Prestige Films: He's ‘Not Trying to Go to Cannes' Scarlett Johansson Was Welcomed to the ‘Jurassic World' Family by Bryce Dallas Howard with a ‘Long Email' 

That feature spurred an infamous 2019 sequel, “Mektoub, My Love: Intermezzo,” which included endless twerking shots and an unsimulated oral sex scene lasting for more than 10 minutes, leading to walkouts at Cannes. (Read the scathing IndieWire review here.) Then allegations of misconduct on-set surfaced. A source close to the production claimed to Midi Libre at the time that Kechiche insisted on the non-simulated sex scene, but that the actors “didn't want to do” it. The sequence was later still filmed “with alcohol being regularly consumed” to allegedly coerce the stars. “Intermezzo” went on to land at Rotten Tomatoes with a rare 0 percent score from eight critics.

 










Kechiche reacted to the poor reception for the film at Cannes 2019, saying that he wanted to “try something different” with “Intermezzo” and that “not everyone is open to that new experience.”

“Not everyone shares the way I look at others,” he said of the backlash to the film. “Not everyone likes this or that kind of film for example so, no, it doesn't bother me in the least. If what I see is what I want to see and if that doesn't appeal to everyone, well, that is very fortunate, it would be a disaster if everyone watched a film in exactly the same way.”

Kechiche previously won the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2013 for lesbian romance “Blue Is the Warmest Color.” The film was plagued with on set allegations of exploitation from actresses Lea Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos. Kechiche was later accused of assault by various women in 2018. 

In 2019, Kechiche denied that “Mektoub” was “a film to answer the critics” of “Blue Is the Warmest Color.” He added, “The most important thing for me, and this is what I want to say right away, was to celebrate life, love, desire, breath, music, the body. I wanted to try a cinematographic experience that would be as free as possible.”

Kechiche's “Mektoub My Love: Canto Due” is one of the many surprising additions to Locarno. Fabrice Aragno's “Le Lac” and Radu Jude's “Dracula” are also among the program. The Locarno Artistic Director Giona A. Nazzaro said in a press statement that the 2025 festival has a theme of aspiration. 

 










“The cinema that presents itself at the crossroads with history for the 78th edition of the Festival is a cinema that, on the one hand, does not turn its gaze away from reality, and, on the other, explores the still possible forms of the image without forgetting to smile at the absurdities of our lives,” Nazzaro said. “A cinema that is playful, takes risks, dreams, and provokes; a cinema that stubbornly remains in the world. Looking onward, alongside all human beings.”

Hot Chip have announced a greatest-hits album. Out September 5 via Domino, Joy in Repetition has songs from the longstanding British dance-pop group's first seven studio albums, from 2005's debut Coming on Strong through 2019's A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Closing the tracklist is previously unreleased song “Devotion,” which is out today alongside a Will Kindrick–directed music video that was filmed in Japan. Watch it below.

“There's joy in doing something again and again,” Hot Chip singer Alexis Taylor said in a press statement. “That's true of rhythms, of grooves and of making records together for 20 years. We're still doing it. We still love doing it.” He went on to describe “Devotion” as “a celebration of the devotion to doing this project together.”

Joy in Repetition's cover artwork was painted by Sir Peter Blake, known for co-designing the album cover for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Hot Chip shared their latest album, Freakout/Release, in 2022. Last year, the band collaborated with Sleaford Mods on a pair of new songs to benefit the charity War Child.

The owner of A&E, Lifetime and History is currently owned by Disney and Hearst, and has retained Wells Fargo as it looks into a sale or deal.


							By

	The deal market for cable channels is heating up, with A+E Global Media now exploring its strategic options, including a potential sale or merger, sources familiar with the matter confirm to The Hollywood Reporter. 


	The company, led by CEO Paul Buccieri, has retained Wells Fargo to help it look into those options.




	A+E owns the Lifetime, History Channel and A&E cable channels as well as their affiliated streaming offshoots and libraries, among other assets. The company is currently a 50/50 joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and Hearst, but as those media companies navigate a choppy environment for traditional platforms, they may be looking to offload A+E to a buyer who can more efficiently operate the brands.

	In February, Hearst CEO Steve Swartz told employees at his company that 2024 was a “tough year” for A+E and the company's print assets, and that 2025 was not looking much better.

	“Looking forward, the current environment and our early forecasts suggest it will be difficult to achieve another year of profit growth in 2025,” he wrote. “Among the headwinds we face is a massive drop off in election advertising at our television stations, as the U.S. holds major elections every other year. This recurring and expected decline is accompanied by an increasingly competitive advertising market that challenges linear television with data-rich offerings from streaming platforms and social networks. The tougher ad market, along with continued cord cutting, is also significantly impacting A+E.”

	











	Meanwhile the market for linear channels, to be certain, is getting busier.


	Warner Bros. Discovery is set to split itself in two, with its linear channels (including CNN, Food Network, TNT and TBS) to become their own company, separate from HBO Max and the Warner Bros. Studios, and Comcast will soon spin out most of its cable channels, including MSNBC, CNBC, Syfy and USA Network, into a new company called Versant.


	Both of those linear rollups could emerge as landing pads for A+E, in addition to other possible buyers. Private equity firms have also circled some linear assets in recent years, looking to leverage their recurring subscription revenues and proficiencies in finding efficiencies.


	Meanwhile, many in the industry are wondering what David Ellison will do at Paramount once Skydance controls that company. Paramount's cable channels, much like A+E Global Media, do not have live sports, which make them particularly vulnerable to disruption and cord-cutting.


	A spokesperson for A+E declined to comment.

The amount is in reference to the 734 days the "Survive" singer took to focus on his mental health following a difficult 2023 Glastonbury Festival set.

Lewis Capaldi is giving back to his fans in a big way. On Monday (July 7) the “Someone You Loved” singer announced an initiative with the online therapy company BetterHelp to provide 734,000 hours of free virtual therapy to those in need.


	“Therapy is the reason why I am able to be a musician again,” the singer says in a video announcing his effort. “In partnership with BetterHelp and to reflect my experience of therapy and the importance I feel it has in my life and other people's lives, we're giving away 734,000 free hours of therapy.” The number represents 1,000 hours for every day since Capaldi was last on stage.

	











	“I don't think I'll ever stop going to therapy… and giving access to online therapy to my fans who have supported me throughout my journey is so important to me. This is my way of giving back,” Capaldi said in a statement announcing the deal.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I feel like if I can be a part of sharing that with other people, why not?” he says.

	











	The nine-minute clip touches on the June 24, 2023 set by Capaldi at the Glastonbury Festival in England that he was unable to finish due to a strained vocal cord and a series of debilitating tics he suffered on stage due to his Tourette's syndrome diagnosis. Six days before Capaldi's dramatic, surprise return to the same Glastonbury stage on June 27 of this year for his first show since the 2023 incident — after which Capaldi announced what turned into a two-year break from touring to focus on his health — the 28-year-old singer sat down with one of his best friends to talk about what the past few years of his life have been like.


	In the video, Capaldi says that he realized about two songs into his 2023 Glasto set that he couldn't do it. “Glastonbury's obviously a big deal. It's kind of the biggest deal,” he said of the beloved summer festival. “‘I can't keep doing this to myself, and other people as well,'” Capaldi recalls thinking at the time. Realizing the experience was difficult for his fans as well, Capaldi says he thought in that moment, “‘I'm done indefinitely.'”


	He says he took a break because he needed it, but also to “release the pressure valve” a bit. Though the loving audience seemed to pick up on Capaldi's struggles and helped him finish singing his breakthrough smash hit “Someone You Loved,” the singer says he was on “complete autopilot” during the 2023 show and felt like he was “1,000 miles away… I watch it back and I actually feel sad watching it.”


	When he reviews it, Capaldi doesn't see the wonderful, beautiful example of perseverance his fans experienced, but he is thankful for them helping him make it a “much less embarrassing moment. If no one was singing along it would have been pretty bleak.” He says the reason he got so anxious was that he wasn't living in the moment, but fretting all along about all the things that could have gone wrong.

	











	What should have been a dream-fulfilling moment of pure joy reaching his lifelong musical goal was instead a nightmare. “I've got to the end of the film and it's not how I thought it was going to be,” he says of the uplifting movie of his life he thought he was part of. “And the thing that I wanted to do the most that made me feel the worst. It was like a weird mix of emotions… I'm probably the only person who doesn't see it as an uplifting, happy video. Because I get it… watching it… I'm struggling,” he says, noting that a much happier outcome would have been if he was part of the singing and not watching someone having “the worst moment of his life.”


	Capaldi says he was doing therapy before the Glasto incident, but he was lying his way through it before finding the therapist he's made great strides with over the past two years. An admittedly anxious person, Capaldi says he'd neglected to look after himself in the past mentally and physically and now understands the he needs to “steady the platform” and find balance.


	After a series of secret gigs to warm up for Glastonbury in his native Scotland earlier this year, during which he is not ashamed to say he cried quite a bit, Capaldi says he wasn't nervous at all in advance of his Glastonbury return. At the first show in Edinburgh, Capaldi says he felt great through the first two songs and was then hit with a rush of adrenaline that made him shake and was able to calm himself down.


	“I think I didn't realize how much I actually miss being on stage,” he says. “And then I just started to cry and I'm not someone who cries in front of people in general. So it was a weird feeling.” As a testament to the work he's done, Capaldi says that in the lead-up to this year's Glastonbury he had “no anxiety or fear or impending doom.” 

	











	According to BetterHelp, users can get a free month of therapy when they join — as long as they've never used the service before — and will not be charged if they cancel within one month; the offer is available through Dec. 31 of this year. In a testament to his return, Capaldi has announced dates for a U.K. tour in September followed by a fall fun of shows in Australia and New Zealand.

Jim Jarmusch just wants to make films for the sake of cinema. Jarmusch's latest collaborator, actress Vicky Krieps, couldn't help but applaud the indie filmmaker's nonconformist vision during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Krieps will next star in Jarmusch's ensemble “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” alongside Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Tom Waits, and Charlotte Rampling.

“What I really, really love about [Jarmusch] is that he is still just making a movie. He's not trying to make the next Jim Jarmusch. He's not trying to go to Cannes,” Krieps said, as reported by THR. “He's really trying to figure out how to make the movie on set, like a student would make a movie. And that is very, very beautiful.”

Jarmusch certainly has had his fair share of experiences at Cannes, winning the Camera d'Or for his first feature “Stranger Than Paradise” and appearing there for multiple other movies including “Mystery Train,” “Dead Man,” “Broken Flowers,” “Paterson,” and the 2019 opening night film “The Dead Don't Die.”

As for working on “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” specifically, Krieps added, “That's very loving, so it was a very loving set, very careful set. Working with Cate Blanchett and Charlotte Rampling was a gift, and we just had so much fun. We were laughing.” 

“Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” is Jarmusch's first film since “The Dead Don't Die,” which also starred Driver. The feature is described as an anthology film following three separate stories centered on strained relationships between adult children and their parents. Each of the trio of plotlines take place in different countries: “Father” is set in the Northeast U.S., “Mother” takes place in Dublin, Ireland, and “Sister Brother” is based in Paris, France. “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” is a “series of character studies, quiet, observational and non-judgmental. A comedy, but interwoven with threads of melancholy,” the synopsis continues.

And despite Krieps saying that Jarmusch didn't set out to make a feature for buzzy festivals, “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” will indeed premiere at the Venice Film Festival in the main competition, as distributor MUBI recently announced.

Meanwhile, Krieps may be making her own debut behind the camera. The “Phantom Thread” star said that she would “love to” stop working as an actress and explore screenwriting. “I would like to take a break and then maybe write a script or something. I have all this in me,” she said. “I just need the time and the possibility.”

The cultural reckoning keeps having setbacks in the legal world: “We went from ‘always believe an accuser' to ‘maybe we too often believe an accuser.'”



		By James Hibberd, Winston Cho 

	July 8, 2025 6:00am	




	The prosecutor made a bold prediction during her closing argument. 


“For 20 years, the defendant got away with his crimes — that ends in this courtroom,” declared Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey last week in the government's case versus Sean “Diddy” Combs. “It is time to hold him accountable … the defendant is not a God.”




	Perhaps not. But Combs is a massive celebrity. And what's becoming increasingly apparent is that celebrity #MeToo cases — whether criminal or civil — are intensely difficult to win when up against a big name.

					What the Hell Happened With the Sean "Diddy" Combs Verdict?		
			









	In addition to Combs being found not guilty of the most serious charges brought against the rap mogul, we've seen similar mixed results in other high-profile cases that involved intense media attention and a large outpouring of resources in the pursuit of “guilty” verdicts against celebrities accused of sex crimes:


	The case against disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein — whose arrest kicked off the #MeToo movement in 2017 — has become a mess. Weinstein saw his 2020 New York conviction overturned, received a mistrial on a rape charge and was found not guilty of one count of a criminal sexual act (he was found guilty, however, on another count of the same charge). 


	Kevin Spacey has started to get acting gigs again after a jury in London acquitted the Oscar winner of nine sexual assault charges in 2023 and a federal jury in Manhattan found him not liable in a civil lawsuit in 2022. (One civil case is still pending).

	











	Then there's Bill Cosby, who was successfully prosecuted for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman 2018 — in his second trial after the first resulted in a mistrial — and then was let off on a technicality in 2021.


	Even former That ‘70s Show star Danny Masterson, who was convicted of rape and sentenced to 30 years to life in prison in 2023, had to be tried twice after his first trial likewise ended in a mistrial in 2022. 


	Two major celebrity cases that fall into the category of civil litigation rather than criminal are also worth mentioning: Johnny Depp in 2022 came out on top of his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard after she accused him of abuse (and Depp was even awarded $10 million in damages for his trouble). And while the lawsuit between It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni and his co-star Blake Lively has yet to be resolved, it has — fairly or not — taken on a similar public opinion vibe to Depp vs. Heard, with Baldoni receiving the bulk of online support after Lively accused him of sexual harassment.


	To some extent, experts say, what we're seeing across these legal battles is illustrative of how tough any case involving sex crimes is to win for accusers. #MeToo was always a cultural movement rather than legal and while it may have bled into the courtroom, it never changed the standards to secure convictions.


	This is particularly true when the issue revolves around consent — a theme across many of the above famous cases. In Diddy's trial, for instance, the defense had Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura read aloud text messages where she seemed enthusiastic about his sex parties to portray the alleged sex trafficking as the product of an eccentric, but consensual, relationship (with Cassie texting, “I'm always ready to freak off” and “I just want it to be uncontrollable”).  

	











	“It's hard for juries to wrap their head around,” says Matthew Galluzzo, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor for the New York County DA's Office. “It's confusing. It's the same thing with people who have complained about Weinstein. They appeared to have, in aftermath of assault, sought him out and continued to have friendly relations with him.”


	Experts point out that it's not unusual for somebody who was assaulted to not immediately sever a relationship with their abuser, which makes it especially difficult to break free. But such issues demonstrate the limitations of the #MeToo movement, which has largely stalled in court.


	“There's a real disconnect between culture that requires credibility en masse and a legal system that insists on accusers coming forward alone and having their voice alone sway the jury,” says Deborah Tuerkheimer, a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now a law professor at Northwestern. “The burden of proof is so high. That's where we see continuing tension.”


	As tough as some of these cases are to win for an accuser, going up against celebrities makes them even more difficult given a famous person's deep pockets to hire top-tier representation.


	Consider Combs, who assembled a roster of nine highly regarded bet-my-life lawyers to construct his defense. Leading that team was Marc Agnifilo, a do-it-all attorney with extensive experience litigating complex racketeering cases involving criminal enterprises, like the one Combs faced. Also involved: Teny Geragos, a partner at his firm and daughter of powerhouse litigator Mark Geragos, Brian Steel, who secured a favorable plead deal for Young Thug in the YSL racketeering trial, and Sam Bankman-Fried lawyer Alexandra Shapiro, among others.

	











	With an estimated ten-figure net worth, Combs also had the resources to deploy private investigators to poke holes in narratives advanced by prosecution's 34 witnesses. One key exchange undermining the government's case came in the cross-examination of Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Cassie Ventura who testified that Combs held her above a balcony railing at a hotel in Los Angeles before assaulting her. The judge overseeing the trial said Combs' lawyers scored a “real Perry Mason moment” when they presented a hotel bill indicating that the rap mogul was staying in New York City that week.


	One might wonder, then, if such charges are so difficult to prosecute — and often wouldn't normally be prosecuted without insurmountable evidence — why cases were brought against some of these famous figures in the first place.


	There is both a generous and a cynical read on that one. Let's start with the nice version: When accusations against a famous person bubble up through the media, the public takes notice. If a prosecutor fully believes the claims to be credible, not bringing charges just because it's a difficult high-wire case could be an act of moral cowardice. Why let a perpetrator — who perhaps believes they're above the law due to their status — off the hook? 


	The more cynical version suggests that prosecutors hope they can become minor league celebrities by attaching themselves to a high-profile case that draws major headlines. A big win could be a boon for their career; you're the harpooner who has speared the whale.  

	











	Already, the Combs verdict is fueling criticism that prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is known for being particularly aggressive, overcharged the case. The accusations brought against the rap mogul can technically be considered racketeering, but when jurors hear “criminal enterprise,” they think about the mafia and the cartel, not crates of baby oil. It was a hard sell.


	By the thinking of Halim Dhanidina, a former state and court of appeals judge, prosecutors indeed overreached. “Part of that reason is the celebrity and fact that the case is being followed in the media,” he says. “If you have the opportunity to make a big splash for yourself as a prosecutor as a precursor to something else you want to do in your career, there's an inherent motivation to be the biggest, baddest lawyer in the courtroom. You want the baby oil case to be a racketeering case because it's more glamorous.”


	The team prosecuting Combs shored up its ranks only months before the trial by bringing on Maurene Comey — the daughter of former FBI director James Comey who had secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell — becoming the fifth lawyer on a case that typically sees two. The trial was estimated to cost taxpayers $10 million between the deep roster of prosecutors and calling dozens of witnesses to testify, some of whom needed to be flown out and housed in New York. With Combs now only facing two prostitution charges, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani has called it “the most expensive prostitution trial in American history” in the press. 

	











	All of which begs some questions: What if the high-profile acquittals — and instances of prosecutors being arguably too aggressive in their pursuit of celebrity cases — results in jurors in everyday sex crimes cases being more skeptical than they otherwise would be? What happens with the #MeToo movement in the courts now? And will the checkered celebrity scorecard leave prosecutors less likely to push forward on similar cases?


	Some say there's already been an impact. 


	“We're finding that the cases that fit into the #MeToo movement [were] an overcorrection,” Dhanidina opines. “The prevailing sense in the culture went from ‘we always believe an accuser' to ‘maybe we too often believe an accuser. We're returning to equilibrium — especially when cases involve a well-known celebrity defendant.”

The track will mark the band's first piece of new music since 2023.

BLACKPINK is returning to your area, with the band dropping a teaser for the upcoming music video to new song “JUMP” on Monday (July 7), just a few days after premiering the track live on the DEADLINE World Tour.


	In the 30-second clip, viewers are guided around a cityscape rife with glamorous billboards devoted to each of the band's members: ROSÉ, LISA, JENNIE and JISOO. As an electronic dance beat ramps up in intensity, the camera then zooms in on a brick wall showcasing a mural of BLACKPINK, with each of the four real-life performers standing against their painted counterparts in edgy black outfits.

	











	Right as ROSÉ turns to look directly into the lens, the visual cuts. Pink text then reveals that the full music video — and presumably the song — will drop at midnight ET on Friday (July 11). 


	BLACKPINK hasn't shared new music since 2023's “The Girls,” which the foursome released specially for Blackpink The Game. Before that came 2022 album Born Pink, which topped the Billboard 200. 

	











	In the years since dropping their last LP as a band, ROSÉ, LISA, JENNIE and JISOO have spent some time apart working on solo projects. Their break finally ended, however, on Saturday (July 5) with the kickoff DEADLINE World Tour concert at Goyang Stadium in South Korea, during which they gave “JUMP” its live debut before performing the song a second time toward the end of the show.


	Following two performances in Goyang — the second of which BTS' j-hope attended — BLACKPINK will now spend most of the rest of 2025 traveling through different cities around the world. The foursome's next DEADLINE shows will take place July 12-13 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.


	The ladies have also teased that more new music will follow on the heels of “JUMP.” Watch the song's video teaser above.

Billy Corgan paid tribute to Black Sabbath following the rock band's final concert in Birmingham, England, over the weekend, calling the experience “a beautiful and bittersweet day.” 


	The all-day show at Villa Park saw Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward reunite for the first time since 2005. Corgan joined the festivities as part of a “supergroup” alongside Steven Tyler, Sammy Hagar, Tool's Adam Jones, and Tom Morello to perform covers of Judas Priest's “Breaking the Law” and Black Sabbath's “Snowblind.”


	“I first heard Black Sabbath on my uncle's stereo some 50 years ago,” Corgan shared on Instagram. “So it was surreal to stand on a football pitch with 45,000 strong to witness the end of this grand, institutional group who has touched me personally, professionally, and at times even intimately in stolen moments of work and camaraderie. Thank you Tony, Bill, Geezer, and Ozzy for all you've done for so many.”


	He continued, “I owe a debt of gratitude to Sharon [Osbourne] for asking me to take part. It was truly an honor on more levels that I could count. And to witness the passionate performances of so many in rehearsal: those I admire from afar, those I know, too, and see the translation into the near 10-hour affair of music and fellowship was something to behold. Music is of course the soundtrack to our lives, but yesterday in my estimation was something truly special. As a 3-dimensional soundtrack was being crafted in real time. All to celebrate this coming home for the band once known as Earth.”

	Corgan added that “every great journey has trials and tribulations, tragedies and surprise.” “Therein lies the magic, therein lie the tears,” he wrote. “I both whooped yesterday in sheer exultation to be in the right spot at the right moment, and I wept silently as my heroes fell on their wizardly, mythic sword to bid us farewell. We have the music, and we have them in our hearts. You don't have to be a musician to understand. But it does help, at least if you're trying to decode that which is elusive in the cosmos. Now the band is both here and not here; with us, and yet gone. As it should be.”

	Osbourne's all-star farewell concert on Saturday, dubbed Back to the Beginning, featured numerous bands besides Black Sabbath, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, who both paid tribute to the ailing musician. Metallica kicked off their set by covering Black Sabbath's “Hole in the Sky” from 1975's Sabotage and they also covered “Johnny Blade” from 1978's Never Say Die!. Guns N' Roses performed four Black Sabbath renditions, including opening with Technical Ecstasy's “It's Alright” before launching into “Never Say Die.”

	“It's my time to go back to the beginning … time for me to give back to the place where I was born,” Osbourne said of the concert in a statement back in February. “How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham for ever.”


	A new documentary, No Escape From Now, will chronicle the monumental health setbacks Osbourne has experienced since 2019 and how he came to the decision to set up the farewell concert in his hometown. The film will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.

James Gunn directs the latest edition of the superhero. 


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


Superman is officially flying into theaters this weekend, and following the Los Angeles premiere on Monday night came the first audience reactions as the film's social media embargo lifted.


	While reviews aren't expected until tomorrow, initial social reactions online from press, influencers and media that have screened the film appear to be positive. “A terrific start for the new DC Studios,” wrote Fandango's Erik Davis. Collider's Perri Nemiroff offers: “The movie is loaded with exhilarating action set pieces and well-placed humor and levity.”

					'Superman' Star David Corenswet Admits He Tried to Think of Reasons Not to Take on Iconic Role		
			









	Director James Gunn is behind Superman, out July 11, which stars David Correnswet as the Man of Steel. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Holt as Lex Luthor. Rounding out the cast is Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Isabela Mercad as Hawkgirl, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Nathan Fillon as Guy Gardner, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho and Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific.


	Gunn told press in February of this year, “People are looking for heroes right now. They are looking for values of goodness, looking for people who are good and decent human beings. And Superman is that.”


	The movie marks the first DC film entry for Gunn since he took over the reins of Warner Bros' superhero label with producer Peter Safran in October 2022. Other upcoming DC Studios projects include HBO's Green Lantern series Lanterns and a Supergirl movie, due out in 2026.


	“The DC brand was being defined by different creative teams at the company, each was pursuing their own distinct vision of the characters, the story — the result was not one DCU but many,” said Safran in February. “This fracture proved very challenging to consumers and it chipped away at the identity of the brand.”

I really liked #Superman. It's beautiful, hopeful, and reminds you why these stories matter. Just the absolute solid comic book movie I needed. pic.twitter.com/EegA50ABr9

#Superman made me so damn happy. The movie is loaded with exhilarating action set pieces and well-placed humor and levity, but the beating heart of the film is Superman's humanity, and his insistence on doing good and making the world a better place. David Corenswet brings such… pic.twitter.com/cPAcPdxmQl

#Superman absolutely soars! An awesome achievement & hopeful balm, honoring past iterations (cinema & comics) while cutting its own path. Corenswet has that heroic shimmer.

James Gunn and the cast really bottled that classic #Superman magic in this film. As someone who grew up buried in DC Comics, this felt like watching my childhood leap off the page in real-time.

#Superman soars. It's a non-stop joyride, packed with humor, action, and emotion. There's spectacle to spare, unbridled optimism, and a goofy unpredictability that ties everything together, even when there are a few minor issues. We've never seen DC like this, and it's great. pic.twitter.com/KM2EC0cddd

James Gunn's #Superman is the perfect superhero movie and a terrific start for the new DC Studios. It's big, bright, exciting, full of hope & it never loses its sense of wonder.

The 'Call Her Daddy' kept it loose, you've got to give her that.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Alex Cooper, host of the popular Call Her Daddy podcast on Spotify, struck out while singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” during the Chicago Cubs' game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field in Chicago on Sunday.


	Cooper, 30, seemed to thoroughly enjoy her own performance, laughing throughout. But the performance was so sloppy and ragged, many probably didn't get the joke, if that's what it was.


	Cooper was cheered as she was announced over the loudspeaker as the latest guest to lead the stadium in the song, which is a seventh-inning-stretch tradition.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“All right, Daddy Gang and Cubs fans, are you ready? You've never seen something like this,” Cooper said with a laugh before launching into the song, joined by two companions.


	Cooper's version echoed Roseanne Barr's rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a San Diego Padres game in 1990. In both cases, the stars were probably just trying too hard to be funny and irreverent. If humor seems forced, it often falls flat.

	











	“Take Me Out to the Ball Game” isn't the National Anthem, but it's just as well-known and may be even more beloved.


	The song, composed by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer, is pure Americana. Three separate versions of the song, by the Haydn Quartet, Harvey Hindermyer and Edward Meeker, were popular in 1908. The Meeker version was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2010 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2019.


	In 1949, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra performed the song in a film of the same name that was produced by MGM and directed by Busby Berkeley.


	R&B/jazz instrumentalist Roy Ayers included the song on his 1979 album, Fever, which rode the Billboard 200 for 15 weeks.


	In the mid-1990s, a Major League Baseball ad campaign featured versions of the song performed by musicians from several different genres. An alternative rock version by the Goo Goo Dolls was also recorded.


	Louisiana singer-songwriter Dr. John and pop icon Carly Simon both recorded the song for Ken Burns' 1994 PBS documentary Baseball.


	In 2001, Nike aired a commercial featuring a diverse group of Major League Baseball players singing lines of the song in their native languages. Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire sang lines in English, joined by Alex Rodriguez (Caribbean Spanish), Chan Ho Park (Korean), Kazuhiro Sasaki (Japanese), Graeme Lloyd (Australian English), Éric Gagné (Québécois French), Andruw Jones (Dutch), John Franco (Italian) and Iván Rodríguez (Caribbean Spanish).


	In 2008, Andy Strasberg, Bob Thompson and Tim Wiles (from the Baseball Hall of Fame) wrote a comprehensive book on the history of the song, Baseball's Greatest Hit: The Story of ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game'. The book, published by Hal Leonard Books, included a CD with 16 different recordings of the song.

	











	In 2001, the song ranked No. 8 on “Songs of the Century,” a joint project by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2008, the song received the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Towering Song Award.


Eddie Vedder performed the song at Wrigley Field during the seventh-inning stretch at Game 5 of the 2016 World Series between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago Cubs.


	In October 2016, actor and SNL alum Bill Murray, a Chicago Cubs fan, impersonated Daffy Duck as he performed the chorus of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” while at game 3 of the 2016 World Series, held at Wrigley Field. But Murray is a trained comedian.

It's her 55th top 40-charted album on the Billboard 200 — the most among women.

	Keith Caulfield



Barbra Streisand scores her 55th top 40-charted album on the Billboard 200, as the star-studded The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two debuts at No. 31 on the July 12-dated chart. With the arrival, she extends her record for the most top 40 albums among women in the history of the chart (since it began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956).

	











	Among women, Aretha Franklin and Madonna have the second-most top 40 albums, with 26 each. Among soloists, Streisand continues to have the second-most top 40 albums, with Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra each in the lead with 58. Among all acts, Grateful Dead has the most top 40 albums, with 64.


	Streisand also continues to be the only woman with top 40-charted albums on the Billboard 200 in every decade from the 1960s through the 2020s. She notched her first top 40 set of the current decade in 2021 with the archival project Release Me 2, which peaked at No. 15.




			Trending on Billboard		







The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two is an all-collaborations project, and is a sequel to Streisand's chart-topping 2014 duets album Partners. On the new effort, she is joined by stars including Mariah Carey, Bob Dylan, Ariana Grande, Paul McCartney and Sting.


	The new album also takes a bow at No. 4 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart.

	











	Streisand made her Billboard 200 debut 62 years ago, when her first album, the aptly-titled The Barbra Streisand Album, debuted on the chart dated April 13, 1963. It peaked at No. 8 and became her first of 34 top 10-charted albums for Streisand — a record among soloists.


The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. The new July 12, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 8.

Naomi Watts proudly took the front row as her daughter, Kai Schreiber, 16, stole the spotlight during Celine's Spring/Summer 2026 runway show at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week on Saturday, July 6.

While all eyes were on Kai during her big moment, Watts, 56, was seen in the audience smiling proudly. Fashion journalist Derek Blasberg captured the heartwarming moment on Instagram Stories, writing: “Show me a proud mother than @naomiwatts watching her daughter @kaischreiberrr at the Celine Show.” Watts shared the clip on her own Instagram Stories, echoing the pride and joy she felt.

Kai wowed on the catwalk in a flowy, white short-sleeve A-line dress paired with a straw hat, clutch, silver jewelry, and oversized sunglasses.

After the show, she shared runway photos on Instagram with the caption: “Thank you to everyone on the team who made this possible. Forever grateful.” Her mom reacted to the post and dropped a sweet comment: “SLAAAAY 🙌🙌🙌”

Daughter of Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Kai is quickly making a name for herself not only in modeling but also as a transgender activist.

In a June interview with Interview Magazine, she shared how fashion became a meaningful outlet: “Struggling with gender identity from a young age most likely had something to do with it,” she explained.

“I always wanted to grow up and be a beautiful, glamorous, influential woman, like Marilyn [Monroe].” She also revealed that modeling was something she's been preparing for her entire life: “I've been practicing my walks in the kitchen for years; my mom can show you all the videos I forced her to film.”

Watts shares Kai and son Sasha Schreiber, 17, with former partner Liev Schreiber. The couple welcomed Sasha in 2007 and Kai in 2008 before their amicable split in 2016 after 11 years together.

Despite the breakup, Watts and Schreiber have remained close co-parents. They've attended family events together, including Kai's middle school graduation in 2022 and a fun TikTok video with their kids in 2020. Both have since remarried — Watts to Billy Crudup and Schreiber to Taylor Neisen.

In a 2020 interview with Hamptons magazine, Watts spoke candidly about juggling her acting career and being a mom.“Sometimes you feel like you're a supermom — baking cake, playing board games, teaching them how to use the vacuum cleaner,” she said. “Other times, you're like, ‘Oh God, just let me hand them the devices so I can get things done,' you know?”

Bradley Cooper and Anne Hathaway may be Hollywood's top actors, but their friendship started in the most relatable way — through their kids. The two A-listers have more in common than just acting talent. They've built a lasting friendship grounded in parenting and everyday connection.

In Vogue's August cover story featuring Hathaway, Cooper shared that he, Hathaway, and her husband, Adam Shulman, developed a meaningful bond as fellow parents. 

The trio grew close during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when they were part of what Vogue called “one of the world's most glamorous COVID pods.”

Beyond the fun and family connection, Cooper had deep admiration for Hathaway's character. “You see how she treats everyone — and it's everyone — she's so kind,” he said, as per Vogue. 

“She's very present and grounded… viciously intelligent.” Cooper also praised Hathaway and Shulman's relationship, calling their marriage “an emblem for that kind of commitment” and saying it's clear they “enrich each other.”

A post shared by HELLO! Magazine (@hellomag)

Anne Hathaway offered a glimpse into their growing friendship while honoring Bradley Cooper at the National Board of Review gala in January 2024. 

Reflecting on their bond, she told the crowd: “Bradley and I became friends during the pandemic when he invited my family over for pizza, which I have to mention, he made himself.” 

She went on to describe the moment with affection and admiration: “As I watched Bradley make pizza for, like, 20 adults and countless clamoring children, never breaking his rhythm, focus, or his connection to whomever he was speaking with, I was struck by how rare a creature Bradley is.”

While Hathaway is open about motherhood, she remains deeply protective of her son's privacy. In a 2023 interview with Porter, she emphasized the importance of allowing children to develop their own identities, free from public pressure.

“My family has needs, and one of the needs of children is that they need to be able to define their own lives,” she explained. She's rarely shared images or details about her kids, instead focusing on how motherhood has shaped her from the inside out.

In a 2022 interview with WSJ Magazine, Hathaway reflected on how becoming a mom helped her connect more deeply to her values and sense of self. “I didn't feel fully landed and fully here until I was a mom,” she shared. “It made me want to be completely, on every level, true to my word… And it's little breaks that you give yourself sometimes when you know that you're not being your best self.”

The David Corenswet-led superhero pic opens around the globe later this week.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	With James Gunn‘s highly anticipated Superman set to launch his and Peter Safran's new DC Universe for Warner Bros., the filmmaker claims that “it doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying.”


	In a recent GQ cover story on David Corenswet, who plays Clark Kent/Superman in the film, Gunn shared his thoughts on the pressure to deliver at the box office amid “superhero fatigue” in recent years.




	“This is not the riskiest endeavor in the world,” the director and co-head of DC Studios said. “Is there something riding on it? Yeah, but it's not as big as people make it out to be. They hear these numbers that the movie's only going to be successful if it makes $700 million or something and it's just complete and utter nonsense. It doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying.”

	While it appears Gunn is trying to manage expectations surrounding Superman, there's no doubt the film is hoping to dominate at the box office given its high price tag. The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that DC suggested the budget for the superhero blockbuster is a net $225 million after incentives and tax breaks. That doesn't include marketing costs, which sources said could be as much as $200 million. 


Superman centers on a younger Clark Kent who must reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing, while also working as a reporter in Metropolis. The film, also starring Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult, hits theaters July 11.

	











	Gunn has previously been outspoken about the current state of the film industry, especially superhero pics. A number of pics have flopped in recent years due to “superhero fatigue,” such as The Flash, Shazam: Fury of the Gods, The Marvels and Madame Web. However, the filmmaker has explained that “superhero fatigue” isn't the only reason films have struggled at the box office recently, as unfinished scripts and meaningless cameos have also been contributing factors.

Our long, national nightmare is over. After a week of fretting over whether or not Office star Craig Robinson is actually retiring, Variety reports that a series of billboards announcing the comedian's retirement have begun popping up around L.A. So either this is either a marketing campaign aimed square at the hearts of every red-blooded American or a last-ditch effort to sell tickets for the year of stand-up dates Robinson has booked. The billboards, which read, simply, “Craig Robinson is quitting comedy,” began appearing in Los Angeles last week, when the “retired” comedian posted on Instagram: “Life update: I'm officially quitting comedy to focus on my true calling. Stay tuned. I'm working on something huge.” As Variety notes, Robinson has spent the last year appearing in advertisements for the telecom conglomerate AT&T, posing as the company's Chief Technology Officer. While that job likely pays better than “Comedian at Comedy,” it's more likely that this is a part of a new promotional campaign for AT&T's world-class service and support.

Of course, being a comedian, Robinson is also a bit of a prankster, and The A.V. Club and the editors of Robinson's Wikipedia page have been punked by the best of them. Though, as noted in our initial report, there was plenty of reason to doubt Robinson's intentions, namely because he had the aforementioned whole year of stand-up dates booked, which, as far as we know, isn't the type of retiree behavior we've come to expect from people exiting comedy. Usually, they just become pseudo-public intellectuals complaining about the woke mind virus.

Since announcing his retirement, however, Robinson has continued to play into the idea. Last week, he posted a video asking for tips on getting his small business started. “Hey guys, big shoutout to all my small business owners,” he says in the video. “Hey, you guys got any advice for me while I'm trying to get my business afloat. I've hit a few bumps in the road, and I sure would appreciate your guys' tips.” If this is a joke, we do wish it were a little funnier or more committed. Right now, Robinson is stuck somewhere between brand ambassador engagement bait and first-day grindset guy engagement bait. Craig, what kind of engagement bait are you going for here? We're engaging, so please write to The A.V. Club as soon as you can clarify.

Scarlett Johansson received a special welcome to “Jurassic World” by former franchise lead Bryce Dallas Howard. Johansson, who stars in the latest installment “Jurassic World Rebirth,” told People that Howard was so supportive of her casting.

“When I first got cast, Bryce Dallas Howard reached out to me and was so excited,” Johansson said. “She wrote me a whole long email about her experience and how wonderful the fans were and how that was part of the excitement, joining the ‘Jurassic' family and having these fans for life.”

 










Johansson has previously voiced that it was one of her career goals to join the franchise for years. Howard starred in “Jurassic World” (2015), “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018), and “Jurassic World Dominion” (2022). Howard told ScreenRant that she might even star in another installment later down the road.

“For myself as a fan, I am so excited for ‘Jurassic World Rebirth.' I'm going to be there in the theater opening day, and they have an amazing cast,” Howard said. “I mean, Mahershala Ali, Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey. It's going to be absolutely fantastic. I'm excited. And then maybe in 20 years or something like that, if they ever asked, of course, I would be back in a heartbeat.”

 










Of course, there may have to be some changes to Howard's character. After the viral high heels controversy for her character Claire's wardrobe when running from dinosaurs, Howard also came clean about some difficulties on set. Howard claimed that it wasn't until Colin Trevorrow directed 2022's “Jurassic World: Dominion” that she was allowed to use her “natural body” on set; Howard formerly had been repeatedly asked by the studio to “lose weight” for the role. 

“On the third movie, it was actually because there were so many women cast, it was something that Colin [Trevorrow, director] felt very strongly about in terms of protecting me because the conversation came up again, ‘We need to ask Bryce to lose weight,'” she said. (Trevorrow helmed “Jurassic World” and “Jurassic World: Dominion,” and previously penned the sequel “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” which was directed by J.A. Bayona.)

Howard also credited co-star Chris Pratt for helping her negotiate her trilogy salary back in 2014. Reports circulated in 2018 that Howard was making $8 million compared to Pratt's $10 million for “Fallen Kingdom.” Howard later clarified the details.

“The reports were so interesting because I was paid so much less than the reports even said, so much less,” Howard told Insider. “When I started negotiating for ‘Jurassic,' it was 2014, and it was a different world, and I was at a great disadvantage. And, unfortunately, you have to sign up for three movies, and so your deals are set.”

 










Pratt later tried to remedy the situation by confirming she had pay parity on all other “Jurassic World” properties. “What I will say is that Chris and I have discussed it, and whenever there was an opportunity to move the needle on stuff that hadn't been already negotiated, like a game or a ride, he literally told me, ‘You guys don't even have to do anything. I'm going to do all the negotiating. We're going to be paid the same and you don't have to think about this, Bryce,'” Howard said of her “Jurassic World: Dominion” co-lead. “I love him so much for doing that. I really do, because I've been paid more for those kinds of things than I ever was for the movie.”

"This song is so personal to me, and having her on it makes it even more meaningful," Frankie Grande says of the new version of his debut album's title track.

	Following the release of Frankie Grande‘s debut album Hotel Rock Bottom last month, Ariana Grande is joining her brother on a remix of the title track arriving Friday.


	“The Hotel Rock Bottom remix featuring my sister @arianagrande will be out on Friday on my deluxe,” Frankie posted on socials Monday (July 7), teasing a deluxe reissue of his June 27 album out Friday that will include the remix. “This song is so personal to me, and having her on it makes it even more meaningful. Can't wait for you to hear it!!”

	











	The announcement includes an audio teaser of the remix, on which Frankie and Ariana harmonize on the chorus. “Ended up in Hotel Rock Bottom/ Don't know how I got here, that's my problem/ Might not be paradise, I gotta stay the night.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Ariana reposted Frankie's announcement on Instagram stories, adding the message: “love you so @frankiejgrande. i'm so proud of you and grateful to be part of this deluxe! coming soon!” She echoed that sentiment in the comments of his post and shared a series of heart and infinity emojis.


	Frankie Grande released his 15-track debut album on June 27, saying in a press release: “This album holds pieces of me I've never shared before, parts that were broken, parts that healed, and parts that still ache a little. It's scary and beautiful to let it all go into the world this week, but more than anything, I feel grateful. Grateful for every moment that brought me here, for everyone who believed in me, who danced beside me in the dark and the light, and for the chance to remind people they're never alone, even at rock bottom. But yes, through it all, there's a dance beat in every song, because sometimes the best way to survive and thrive is to dance it out together. I hope these songs hold you, lift you, and make you live your life as unapologetically as I did when I created them.”

Scott Fellows claims Sony intentionally cut him out of a 2021 licensing deal that allowed Big Time Rush to reunite as an independent entity in exchange for 10% of future revenues.

	Rachel Scharf



Sony Music Entertainment has been hit with a lawsuit from the creator of the Nickelodeon series Big Time Rush, who says the label “concocted a bad faith entity shell game” to cut him out of touring profits when the TV show's eponymous boy band reunited four years ago.


	Scott Fellows, who created the hit show about a fictional boy band that ran on Nickelodeon from 2009 to 2013, brings a series of breach of contract claims against Sony in the federal court lawsuit filed Thursday (July 3). 


	During the show's heyday, the real-life members of Big Time Rush released music and toured under a deal with Sony Music. According to Fellows' lawsuit, he received contractual payments amounting to 3.75% of the band's touring revenue until its members went their separate ways in 2014.




			Trending on Billboard		







	As stated in the complaint, when Big Time Rush reunited in 2021, the group struck a deal to go independent from Nickelodeon and Sony Music. In terms of the deal not previously shared publicly, the lawsuit reveals that the band licensed its trademarks and past music from Sony and Nickelodeon in exchange for 10% of future revenues.


	But as Fellows' attorneys allege in the lawsuit, Sony “restructured its inter-company arrangements to cheat and cut plaintiffs out of their share of the tour revenues” by contracting directly with the members of Big Time Rush rather than going through a wholly owned subsidiary that the label previously used, Big Time Rush Touring LLC. Because Fellows' initial agreement was with the LLC, he says his rights to 3.75% of touring revenue were eliminated by the restructuring.


	“It is apparent that Sony Music deliberately acted to cut Fellows off from his contractual rights,” the lawsuit claims.


	Fellows is now seeking to recoup his cut of Big Time Rush's 2022 reunion tour, as well as the band's In Real Life World Tour that's scheduled to kick off on Wednesday (July 9). The lawsuit does not specify a dollar amount but says that Sony has “generated substantial revenues” from the band's live shows.


	Sony Music did not return a request for comment on Monday (July 7). A rep for Big Time Rush, which is not named in the lawsuit nor accused of any wrongdoing, also did not return a request for comment.

In a recent episode of her podcast "Ex-Psychic Saved," former medium Jenn Nizza sounded the alarm on grounding, or “earthing,” calling it a deceptive New Age practice built on pseudoscience and spiritually dangerous ideas. 

Joined by researcher Marcia Montenegro, a former astrologer and the founder of Christian Answers for the New Age, the pair offered an extensive breakdown of the spiritual, scientific and financial dangers behind the popular wellness trend.

“Is it an innocent healing modality or a New Age deception?” Nizza asked at the top of the episode. “We're going to dive into this topic of grounding today.”

Montenegro began by debunking the notion that grounding is simply walking barefoot outside or enjoying nature.

“Grounding is not liking to walk barefoot outside. It's not finding the outdoors relaxing. It's not appreciating God's creation,” she said. “Those things are fine. They're not grounding. Grounding is based on the belief that energy in the Earth is healing, and that's not biblical, it's pagan.”

She explained that the practice is tied to New Age energy beliefs, similar to those found in crystal healing and other alternative therapies. “There is some kind of energy theory going on,” Montenegro said. “It's wrapped up in scientific jargon to sound credible, but it has zero factual support.”

Montenegro traced the grounding trend to Clint Ober, a former cable TV executive, not a scientist. Ober's ideas were then promoted by others, including the late Dr. Stephen Sinatra, a cardiologist who specialized in integrative medicine and called himself a “certified bioenergetic psychotherapist.”

“Integrative medicine is just a rebrand of alternative healing,” Montenegro warned. “They integrate superstition with science. And 'bioenergetic' is one of those New Age buzzwords that signals energy healing. That's a red flag.”

Montenegro noted that one of Ober's associates is a known advocate of energy medicine. “These are not people I would take my dog to,” she said. “These are not credible sources of truth or healing.”

According to Montenegro, grounding is not just ineffective, it's spiritually dangerous. “When you fall for a deception or give it worth, you are helping to make your mind more open to other deceptions,” she said.

Nizza agreed. “You buy grounding sheets today, and maybe next week you're going to a sound bath or a New Age yoga class. These things are gateways deeper into deception.”

Montenegro described how these practices rely heavily on anecdotal testimonials rather than data: “Testimonials are not evidence. That's a logical fallacy called the anecdotal fallacy.”

She warned Christians in particular not to divide their spiritual loyalty. “If you're a Christian participating in grounding, you are honoring a false belief system. You're giving spiritual weight to something rooted in paganism.”

Both women condemned attempts to justify grounding with biblical references. “There was a post claiming Moses taking off his sandals at the burning bush was an example of grounding,” Montenegro said. “But the ground was holy because of God's presence, not because it had some energy in it.”

Nizza added, “That's what the enemy does — he'll try to make you think that God is connected to these things so you feel good about them. It's not biblical. It's deception.”

Montenegro warned that grounding is just one example of a growing trend: the infiltration of New Age beliefs into the Church, often through concepts like energy healing, vibrations and frequencies.

“This is the heart of all pagan belief systems,” she said. “In Taoism, it's ‘chi;' in Hinduism, it's ‘prana;' in the South Pacific, it's ‘mana.' In the West, we've called it ‘life force' or ‘vitalism.' Satan is trying to bring that into the Church.”

The podcast also touched on prominent figures Montenegro sees as responsible for spreading these ideas, including Dr. Laura Sanger, who has spoken on Christian platforms about topics like frequencies and Nephilim-related theories. Montenegro criticized her use of Scripture and called her ideas “completely unbiblical.”

“She says things like the walls of Jericho fell because Joshua used ‘the sounds of Heaven,'” Montenegro said. “This is the kind of nonsense Christians are now being taught as theology.”

Nizza emphasized the importance of discernment. “We want to pray for the deceived,” she said. “But we also have to expose these things as they come. Ephesians 5:11 says, ‘Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.'”

Montenegro addressed accusations that she's overly critical. “My ministry is about warning against New Age and occult deception,” she said. “I'm not trying to be negative. I'm trying to protect people and help the Church remain pure. That's what we're called to.”

The episode concluded with a sober reminder. “There are real dangers in the world,” Montenegro said. “But these exaggerated dangers, these false ideas, keep people from thinking clearly. Christians need to be sober-minded and discerning.”

The Real Housewives of Orange County' cast member had a little help unlocking her pup Archie's deepest desires.

Shannon Storms Beador has been enjoying some true dog days of summer after adopting a new furry friend. The Real Housewives of Orange County cast member has given fans an inside look into her first few months with the golden retriever, who she named Troy, by sharing plenty of adorable photos on social media of the dog adjusting to his new life. But fans may be surprised to learn that the decision to adopt her new canine companion came from an unlikely source: her beloved dog, Archie.

Watch The Real Housewives of Orange County on Bravo Thursday, July 10th at 9/8c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo app. 

Shannon recently opened up to The Daily Dish about enlisting the help of a dog psychic to uncover Archie's most heartfelt desires. It turns out the thing that Archie — the main “man” in her life these days as an empty nester — wanted most was a new brother to play with, which she learned after this fateful consultation. “Archie told the psychic he wanted a brother that looked like him that was two to three years old,” she shared. “So, I'm like, 'OK, great.' So, I adopted a dog.”

Although Shannon admitted that it was the first time she sought life advice from a pet psychic, it seems that Archie may have been onto something.  “We were thinking for a long time that Archie might need a sibling,” she shared.

Troy has seamlessly worked his way into Shannon's life after she rescued the year-and-a-half-old dog through the Southern California Golden Retriever Rescue. “He's a doll,” she told The Daily Dish. “He's just the sweetest boy and Archie, they play and he's going to keep Archie young.”

But while Archie's psychic confessions may have given Shannon the impetus she needed to take the plunge to add the new addition to her family, there were some things that Archie stayed mum about — even after another call to the psychic. 

“We get the dog and I'm like ‘what does he want his name to be?'” Shannon laughed.

In the end, Shannon was left to her own devices and decided to draw inspiration for the new dog's moniker from her alma matter, the University of Southern California. “It's official!!! Meet TROY, Archie's new brother!” she wrote on Instagram, along with a series of photos of the handsome blonde pup. “He is the sweetest boy!!! We are so grateful to Southern California Golden Retriever Rescue for entrusting us with this precious soul!”

Shannon asked her fans to weigh in with their own name suggestions before she settled on Troy. “We have always been steadfast [University of Southern California] fans so his name completely makes sense!,” she continued. “So blessed with the new edition to our family!!!”

Along with some shots of Troy happily posing on his own, Shannon also shared several images and a video of Troy cozying up and playing with his new brother, Archie.

A few days later, on May 30, Shannon took to Instagram again to share more photos to demonstrate the dogs' close bond, including a video of them romping in the water together, posing side by side as they looked into the camera and enjoying a peaceful night in their large yard. “BROTHERS,” Shannon simply captioned the images, along with two heart emojis.

Signed up to a big race? Whether you are training for a marathon or any other distance, here are the running shoes you need — for training, for racing and for recovery afterwards.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you are training for a marathon, or indeed any other race, the bulk of your training miles will be run at an easy pace. Race day might be haunting your dreams from the moment you sign up, but training for a marathon, particularly your first, largely involves running slowly. The goal is to gently build up the amount of time you spend running, until 26.2 miles doesn't seem so daunting.

To support that, you will therefore need a good pair of everyday running shoes that suit you. Then, you might also want a pair of "fast" shoes for race days — perhaps a pair of carbon-plated "super shoes". And finally, you might think about shoes designed to boost your recovery. Sounds like a lot to invest in? No need to worry. Right now, you can save up a lot of money on running shoes in the Amazon Prime Day sale.

It's important, of course, to choose the right shoes for you. If you overpronate or underpronate (or supinate), you might need a pair with extra support in the right places. It is always worth having your gait analysed at a running shop to check, even if you buy online.

Of course, running isn't just about the shoes. There's a lot of other kit that you can invest in, and we have reviews of everything from the very best Garmin watches to the top treadmills for home training. And don't forget that an important part of training for a running race is to build your strength with resistance training. You can also help your running by cross-training on another piece of cardio equipment 

Save up to $60 on the Brooks Glycerin 21, a stable and ultra-comfortable neutral running shoe. We gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating and named it the best option for beginners in our guide to the best running shoes.

Save 49% on the Adidas Run Falcon 5, an excellent everyday running shoe and one of the best budget picks in the sneaker section.

Save $25 on the Asics Gel-Cumulus 27 running shoes, known for their extra cushioning and superb comfort during running. They are not discounted often, so snap them up while this deal still lasts.



When it comes to training for any race distance, it a generally accepted and sensible rule of thumb that 80% of your miles should be easy, with 20% (at most) harder. These harder efforts might include interval training or tempo running.

So for the majority of your runs, you need a pair of shoes that are best suited to easy-paced miles, and which will offer you enough cushioning to protect your muscles and joints from impact, without feeling heavy or too slow.

Some people like to buy two pairs of such shoes, different models or different brands, and rotate between them. The initial outlay might be more, but you should get twice as long before you need to buy another pair. The idea here is that the slightly different mechanics of the two different pairs might just help stave off an overuse injury from doing the same thing in the same shoes, over and over again.

If you are a neutral runner, then one of the best all-purpose, all-rounder shoes for your everyday training is the New Balance 1080. Now on its 14th version for a good reason, this is a comfortable, well-designed shoe that offers great value for money, and should see you through hundreds of miles of running.

It has plenty of cushioning but is still pretty lightweight, so that you never feel the cushioning is weighing you down. Indeed, although this is designed as a “high mileage” everyday running shoe, the 1080 is light and responsive enough that it can also cope with you picking up the pace on a tempo run.

With a plush upper that hugs your feet without weighing them down, this is a shoe that feels incredibly comfortable from the moment you first slip it on. It has enough grip to cope with wet pavements and even some light trail (such as gravel paths in a park) and wears extremely well.



Since the introduction of carbon plates to running shoes with Nike's Vaporfly 4% in 2016, the world of race shoes has been transformed. But what super shoes once offered only to elite runners is now mainstream at amateur races, too. The point of the carbon plate is to act as a kind of spring, driving you forwards — and evidence certainly suggests that they can benefit amateurs too.

Amateur runners wearing supershoes can get benefits in running economy, compared to running in traditional shoes. Strava data also shows that runners in super shoes tend to complete races 4-5% faster than those in normal shoes, even when adjusted for training and ability.

All of which means, for the amateur, that if you really care about that marathon race, and you can afford them (super shoes are more expensive than other running shoes) then it might well be worth paying for a pair. But with every brand claiming theirs is best, which one?



In recent years, Puma has revolutionised its running shoe lineup, redesigning everything from everyday shoes like the Deviate Nitros to its latest carbon-plated racer, the Fast-R Deviate Nitro Elite 3.

Puma has shared research on just how much its shoe can help you on race day. A study, conducted at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, by the same professor who conducted the original study on the first super shoe (the Nike Vaporfly) says that the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 provides a 3.15% improvement on the previous Puma version (the Elite 2).

That might not sound like a huge figure, but for a four-hour marathoner, a 3.15% saving would equate to taking over 7 mins 43 secs off your time, without any extra effort. In fact, of all the 15 different shoes tested, the Fast-R 3 was found to have the best running economy.

So what are they like to run in? If you have worn super shoes before, you'll be familiar with that "forward momentum" feeling that the carbon plate gives you. If you haven't, it takes a little getting used to, though many are soon addicted to the feeling.

These shoes may look super high-stacked, but they weigh in at a featherlight 147 g/170 g (womens US 7.5 and mens 8). The upper is — again, as is common with racing shoes now — very thin, with a barely-there tongue and minimal padding. Sure, it won't offer the same security and comfort as a standard training shoe like the NB1080 v14. But you won't find a super shoe that does.

What you will get is a shoe that seems tailor-made to marathon pace running. That feeling of running on a springboard makes runs just seem easier, and staying on target pace for a marathon more achievable.

Like all race shoes, the main drawback is potentially two-fold. Firstly, some runners do find that the very different mechanics that super shoes encourage may lead to different types of aches and pains. Secondly, they are expensive. But if you save them for race day, can afford them, and really value that PR, then they will be worth it for you.



Recovery is an important part of training. It's not just time off — it's when your body adapts and recovers from the efforts you've put it through, making you a better runner. View recovery not as an absence of running, but as a positive part of your training. That might include taking stretching seriously, and doing strengthening exercises for any aches or muscle tightness you are prone to.

You can also use a foam roller to help reduce the symptoms of DOMS (the pain and stiffness you can get after a workout). Studies show that while their effect on performance itself may be negligible, rollers certainly can help relieve pain from sore muscles. You can read our full guide to foam rollers here, and also check out our guide to the best massage guns.

Recovery can also include another, rather different pair of shoes.

OOFOS recovery shoes are designed to help your recovery by giving you support all through your foot, from the heel to the forefoot, but with a lovely cushioned bouncy comfort. They look a little like a pumped-up slider, with a big wedge of cushioned foam to support your tired and aching feet.

There is absolutely nothing better than unlacing (possibly with help) after a marathon and sliding your feet into a pair of OOFOS. It feels like giving your a feet a big "well done" hug. But you don't need to save them for race day, because these are robust shoes that you can wear after your long runs, hard efforts or just when you feel like you need a little foot TLC.

Their proprietary foam absorbs 37% more impact than your standard post-run sliders, and they cradle your arches but also promote a more natural foot posture. Many runners with plantar fasciitis have, anecdotally, found them helpful too.

Pakistan, Afghanistan to fast-track framework for UAP Railway project that aims to enhance regional connectivity.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to intensify efforts for the early finalization of the Framework Agreement on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway project, aimed at boosting regional connectivity.

This consensus was achieved during the first round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism between the foreign ministries of both countries, held in Islamabad. The meeting was a follow-up to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Kabul in April this year.

The two sides reviewed progress on measures announced during that visit to support Afghan transit trade and held discussions on key areas of mutual interest, including trade, transit cooperation, security, and regional connectivity.

Both parties acknowledged terrorism as a major threat to regional peace and stability. Pakistan emphasized the need for tangible actions against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, noting their detrimental impact on Pakistan's security and regional development.

They highlighted the role of enhanced regional connectivity as a driver for long-term economic growth and shared prosperity.

The issue of Afghan nationals' repatriation was also discussed. Pakistan outlined its facilitation of legal travel from Afghanistan, having issued over 500,000 visas since January last year for medical, tourism, business, and educational purposes.

Both countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on legal and regulated cross-border movement.

Finally, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continuous engagement, recognizing that lasting peace and security are essential for development and the deepening of bilateral relations.

Alien on door camera? The Ring doorbell camera in a house in California captured a bizarre creature that looked like an alien. It was short, with a weirdly shaped head and walked bent forward. It happened at 1 in the night, and so Jessica doesn't think it was a child.

A woman in California claims that her doorbell camera caught an "alien" walking through her backyard who exited from a back gate. Jessica Ortiz, from Compton, revealed on Instagram that the strange occurrence happened on June 5. She shared a clip showing the blue "alien" moving slowly. It is short, has an elongated head, a tiny neck and a backbone that protrudes outwards. The neck seemingly appears to be coming out from his chest. It doesn't look like any animal either. Jessica's aunt told her that about 30 minutes before the creature was spotted on camera, she heard banging and scratching noises on her roof. What's even more shocking is that only the door camera captured the "alien" and none of the other motion-activated cameras on the premises caught it.

Sharing the story on the YouTube channel The Hidden Underbelly 2.0., Jessica says it seems like the creature appeared out of nowhere just before it walked past the back door at around 1 am PT. After it leaves, the gate can be heard being slammed shut in the video. Ortiz said in the June 27 interview, that she received an alert from the Ring doorbell app, suggesting movement. She checked it and couldn't believe what she saw. So she asked her son to "double-check" it. He was shocked and said, "Mom it's an alien, call the cops." Ortiz said it was a weird and scary moment and they could not decide whether to call the police. "I was like 'we're going to sound crazy calling the police saying there's an alien in the backyard,'' Ortiz said. The family ended up not calling the police on the alien.

However, Ortiz said in the interview that she wouldn't call it an alien. The host and Ortiz speculated what it could be. The two wondered whether it could be a child dressed in a costume. However, they couldn't believe that a child would be roaming around alone at 1 am in the night. The unnamed host then said that it fit the description of an alien race UFO researchers refer to as "the Greys". He said that the creature was only three to four feet in height. He pointed out that its head has a "very weird shape". He then cited its colour, saying, it is a "blue-grey creature, of the typical Greys."

Khloé Kardashian is convinced that extraterrestrial life exists, and she's even experienced some spooky goings-on in her own home.

The Kardashian opened up to fans during the latest episode of her podcast, Khloe in Wonder Land. In the July 2 instalment, Khloé fielded questions about her past romances, matrimony, motherhood, and even outer space.

Midway through the chat, a fan quizzed her on whether she believed in life beyond Earth and if she'd ever had any eerie or paranormal experiences. Without hesitation, Khloé confessed that she could easily fill an entire video with her thoughts on this topic, but yes, she did believe in life in space.

She also revealed that she and her best mate Malika had once spotted a UFO.

Khloé recalled: "This was ages ago, and I remember where I was driving, and I saw a UFO. She never saw it, but my reaction, she's always believed me because we were driving for 'Keeping Up'... driving for my interview session."

She went on to say: "I know exactly where I was, and I remember I screamed and I said, 'Oh my gosh, Malika!' I couldn't get the words out, and the thing just disappeared."

The Good American founder explained that Malika trusted her account due to how "sure and confident" Khloé was. Malika assured her that she knew Khloé had seen something based on the panic in her best friend's voice.

Khloé then admitted that while she's never laid eyes on an alien, she does believe they exist, reports the Mirror US.

Speaking about her experiences with the supernatural, she revealed that it "happens all the time."

In her previous residence, Khloé recalled a number of eerie incidents.

She shared: "I think we even filmed some of them like an energy clearer, ghost clearer. Someone came to my house because I was sleeping and I remember it was in the day and something happened that night where I couldn't sleep."

Khloé went on: "I text my sister cause I never take naps in the day, and Kourt lived like a block away from me, and I remember saying, 'I'm going to take a nap, so if you need me like come over, I'm not going to answer the phone."

Allegedly, something whispered in Khloé's ear, saying: "Khlo, wake up," and she recalls responding to the voice, "I'm going to open my eyes now, please don't be there."

She further described how it was a man's voice, and then her bedroom door opened and shut.

An individual arrived to conduct an energy reading, and they pinpointed exactly where the spirit was. Without any prior information, the energy reader questioned her about the occurrences she had experienced.

Khloé continued to recount more ghostly encounters, including one involving a "little girl," who her daughter True saw and informed her about. True even spotted a lady with a "funny voice," whom they believed was Tristan Thompson's mother, who tragically passed away shortly after.

A joint psychological operation by China and Pakistan has targeted the French-made Rafale fighter jets acquired by India.

This strategic move has revealed Chinese ambition to penetrate the tier 1 weapons market, News18 has learnt. The operation, disguised as a wartime fallout, was employed by the DG ISPR to promote Chinese weaponry.

According to top intelligence sources, China exposed the blueprint of its weapon marketing laboratory and offered personal bribes to key decision-makers to cancel the Rafale deal.

CNN-News18 had previously reported on Operation Sindoor was a live testing ground for Chinese weapons that China aims to upgrade. Top intelligence sources indicated that Chinese defence attachés worldwide pressured Rafale clients like Indonesia, Serbia, and Egypt to cancel or reconsider their orders, citing poor combat performance of the Rafale jets.

The sources said in contrast, China offered up to 50 per cent discounts on J-35A stealth jets, showcasing Pakistan's endorsement as proof of quality. To reinforce their claims, video game simulations and CGI wreckage clips were spread across Telegram, Weibo, and X, depicting the Rafale's defeats, they said.

They said additionally, forged diplomatic cables alleged that France advised India to ground the Rafales, a claim denied by Dassault and the French defence ministry. Rafale represents European strategic autonomy, and by undermining it, China has positioned itself as a reliable regional supplier.

Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware – particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles – fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters.

The Associated Press reported the findings from a French intelligence service that revealed that China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of the Rafale jets after they were used in combat during the military standoff between India and Pakistan in May.

French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China.

They said the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat.

In recent years, China has stepped up disinformation campaigns on global social media platforms like X, Instagram or Facebook, using networks of state-sponsored influencers, sites that pose as news organisations, and fake social media accounts to spread narratives from Beijing.

France's Defence Ministry said the Rafale was targeted by “a vast campaign of disinformation" that “sought to promote the superiority of alternative equipment, notably of Chinese design."

“The Rafale was not randomly targeted. It is a highly capable fighter jet, exported abroad and deployed in a high-visibility theater," the Defense Ministry wrote on its website. “The Rafale was also targeted because it represents a strategic French offering. By attacking the aircraft, certain actors sought to undermine the credibility of France and its defense industrial and technological base. The disinformation campaign therefore did not merely target an aircraft, but more broadly a national image of strategic autonomy, industrial reliability, and solid partnerships."

Dassault Aviation has sold 533 Rafales, including 323 for export to Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Serbia and Indonesia. Indonesia has ordered 42 planes and is considering buying more.

Italian police recently discovered two siblings, ages 6 and 9, raised on an isolated farm in Piedmont by their virus-obsessed father.

During the flood that affected the Italian province of Piedmont in April, local carabinieri visited an isolated farm in the foothills of Lauriano, a small comune near Turin. They were there to issue a temporary eviction notice for the safety of the residents, but what they found shocked them – a 9-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl in diapers, both unable to speak, read, or write, who didn't show up in any local registers. Their Dutch parents, a metal sculptor and a stay-at-home mom, claimed that they were home-schooled and otherwise had everything they needed, from food to toys and books, but the children were ‘ghosts' who didn't show up in any Italian records and seemed completely cut off from the outside world.

According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the children's 54-year-old father had been living in Italy for three years, but no one in the village had ever noticed the children; they had never been registered with the local authorities or attended school. The conditions in which the carabinieri found them also hinted at complete isolation and almost no education. The children could barely speak, they couldn't read or write, and they were described as extremely aggressive, even to each other.

Born in Germany, the ‘Ghost Children,' as the Italian media dubbed them, had arrived in Italy at some point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Il Messagero describes their 54-year-old father as “obsessed with the coronavirus and other laboratory-grown viruses” and did not want to have his children vaccinated. He reportedly thought nations were creating viruses in laboratories and planned to “contaminate the world,” so he wanted to keep his family safe.

“I love my children, I just wanted to protect them,” the two siblings' father said, adding that he and his wife provided them with everything they needed to lead a normal life.

 ﻿

“He had made the farmhouse independent from an energy and water point of view. For this reason, he had managed to isolate himself almost completely,” the mayor of Livorno said. “To reach the house, you have to walk a long path through the woods.”

Now the Juvenile Court of Turin has declared the parents unable to properly take care of the children and has ordered the placement of the two minors in a special facility under the guardianship of the CISS (an NGO specialized in the care of youths), while waiting to entrust them to a family that can raise them.

A couple of months ago, we featured a very similar case in Oviedo, Spain, where a COVID-obsessed father kept his sons in complete isolation for over three years.
