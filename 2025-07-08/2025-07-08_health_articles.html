                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brain metastases from ovarian cancer (BMFOC) are rare but associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) in managing patients with BMFOC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 22 patients with BMFOC who were treated with GKSRS between January 2015 and May 2019. A total of 70 brain metastases were treated, with each patient having between one and nine metastatic tumors. The mean peripheral dose was 16 Gy (range, 7–20 Gy), and the mean isodose curve was 54.6% (range, 45–80%). At 12 months post-GKSRS, 68 metastatic tumors were assessed: 32 (47.1%) showed complete response, 20 (29.4%) had partial response, 14 (20.6%) remained stable, and two (2.9%) progressed, leading to a tumor control rate of 97.1%. No acute or chronic toxicity was observed. The findings of this study indicate that GKSRS may serve as an effective treatment modality for selected BMFOC patients, offering high intracranial tumor control rates. The data indicate that GKSRS is generally well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects observed in this study. While GKSRS may be a valuable option for managing BMFOC, treatment decisions should be individualized, taking into account factors such as tumor burden, extracranial disease status, performance status, and patient preferences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Parse Biosciences, an innovator in single-cell sequencing, are collaborating on a new treatment to help unvaccinated measles victims, as the U.S. measles outbreak has now reached its highest case count in 30 years. The researchers are hoping to create a single cell "atlas" that will lead to new antibody therapies against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), according to James Crowe, Jr., MD, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Antibody Therapeutics (VCAT), Using technology that can sequence more than 10 million cells in a single run, researchers will scan the landscape of plasmablasts - the first antibody-producing, B-type immune cells that respond to MMR infection - with a goal to rapidly identify cells generating the most potent, neutralizing antibodies. "By sequencing and mapping tens of millions of B-cell receptor sequences, we can uncover the most potent antibody lineages, accelerating antibody discovery and informing vaccine design," he said. "These insights give us a critical edge in responding to both emerging infectious threats and optimizing existing immunization strategies." During an outbreak of measles, for example, antibodies could be used quickly to limit the spread of infection through close contacts who are not immunized or lack the ability to mount a sufficient immune response to the vaccine, explained Robert Carnahan, PhD, associate VCAT director. Through this work, we will not only better understand how antibodies work to prevent and limit infection post-infection and post-vaccination, but we also hope to discover protective antibodies that could be developed for use in situations where a vaccine is of limited value, for example, in immunocompromised individuals."

May Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has implemented the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone® program, joining more than 300 health care institutions nationwide to help better identify, evaluate, and treat patients who experience an osteoporosis- or low bone density-related fractures. According to the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation, up to 50 percent of all women and 25 percent of men over 50 will sustain a fragility fracture at some point in their lives. Through the Own the Bone® program and its national web-based quality improvement registry, Mount Sinai now offers a fracture liaison service to help document, track, and benchmark care of fragility fracture patients. Through the service, a care coordinator such as a nurse or physician's assistant will ensure that fragility fracture patients are identified, evaluated, and treated according to their specific needs. The Own the Bone program is a tremendous opportunity to better service our patients with a more individualized approach to fracture care. The department is proud to add yet another means of providing superior orthopedic care to our community by offering an extraordinary, personalized experience for individuals suffering from fragility fractures." "Wellness, independence, and quality of life are so closely tied to bone health, and unfortunately osteoporosis is often not appropriately addressed," Own the Bone Program Coordinator Phoebe Ke, PA-C, MHA, CCD, said. "We have a wonderful opportunity to help patients work towards bone health and prevent fractures through our Own the Bone program, and I am honored to be part of our patients' bone health journeys."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gut dysbiosis has been reported in severe liver diseases. However, information on the impact of hepatitis E virus infection on the gut microbiota, and the association between enteric microbiota disturbances and acute hepatitis E (AHE), is limited, particularly in elderly patients with AHE (AHE-elderly). Our objective was to characterize the AHE-specific microbiome in elderly patients and evaluate its association with clinical outcomes. Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from 58 AHE-elderly patients (46 self-healing cases, 12 non-self-healing cases) and 30 elderly patients with healthy controls (hereinafter referred to as HCs-elderly). Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses, including alpha diversity and STAMP, were performed. The predictive potential of Bacteroides fragilis was assessed using statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. Alpha diversity indices showed no significant differences in microbial diversity between the AHE-elderly and HCs-elderly groups, nor between self-healing and non-self-healing groups among AHE-elderly patients. Nevertheless, a trend toward altered species richness was observed. Our study reveals significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between elderly patients with AHE and healthy controls. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillales, and Bacilli can effectively distinguish AHE patients from HC individuals. This study identifies Bacteroides fragilis as a potential biomarker for disease outcomes. Future studies should explore the causal relationships between gut microbiota and HEV infection in larger, longitudinal cohorts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personalized CRISPR cures for children born with rare genetic diseases are now a step closer to being more widely available. The Center will use CRISPR-based editing technology to advance cures for severe pediatric genetic diseases and will bridge CRISPR cure design and testing at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) with clinical treatment at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The new Center will build on recent clinical success in treating 'Baby KJ' Muldoon, an infant born with an exceedingly rare metabolic disease, with the first-ever personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The IGI, a joint effort between UC Berkeley, UCSF and UC Davis founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, played a critical role in developing and ensuring the safety of this breakthrough therapy. IGI and Danaher have partnered over the past two years to create a blueprint for developing and delivering on-demand CRISPR therapies, one that could be used by organizations around the world for treating children with life-threatening genetic diseases. "There is a natural alignment between the mission of the IGI to make CRISPR gene editing the standard of care for genetic diseases and CZI's ambitious mission to help scientists cure all diseases," said Doudna. "We've already seen the profound impact that an on-demand CRISPR therapy can have for one family, now we want to ensure that this approach can scale and be made available for more children around the world." CZI's support will allow the Center to apply the framework used for Baby KJ to help other children with ultra-rare diseases. The new Center will develop first-in-kind, personalized CRISPR on-demand treatments for children with severe inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and severe metabolic disease, with the initial aim of treating eight patients. As a pediatrician trained at UCSF, a national referral center for children with rare diseases, I know firsthand the heartbreak of telling parents that we don't understand their child's illness or that we don't know how to treat them. This new Center builds on that commitment and aims to bridge research to impact on the lives and futures of families facing ultra-rare diseases." The Center will coordinate the pre-clinical design and safety testing of CRISPR therapies to treat pediatric patients at UCSF's Medical Center. The established treatment pipeline (pre-clinical, manufacturing, cell product, clinical and regulatory infrastructure) makes this work possible in just three years. The Center's team combines expertise in childhood diseases, CRISPR therapy development, and clinical safety assessment. With all appropriate confidentiality considerations, the Center will ensure that data from all investigative new drug-enabling studies, regulatory documentation, and clinical trials is available to other U.S. academic centers in pediatric disease that wish to design and deploy their own CRISPR-based therapies for similar cases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Good physical performance is associated with better cognition in people with relapsing-remitting MS, according to a recent study by the University of Eastern Finland. Good functional capacity was also clearly related to cognition and physical performance. Cognitive impairment is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study used a wide range of measurement methods. The study found that cognitive function, i.e., skills related to information processing, was significantly weaker in patients with greater disability (EDSS over 2.5), compared to those with better cognitive function (EDSS 2.5 or below) or healthy controls. It was also observed that better performance in the walking test was associated with better cognitive function, particularly in patients with moderate disability (EDSS 3-5.5). Among healthy controls, daily physical activity (measured by MVPS) was linked to better cognitive performance, but this association was not observed in the patient group. Cognitive impairment plays a significant role in MS and has a strong impact on patients' disability and possibly on work capacity as well. Our results are interesting and support previous studies very well. This study stands out because it combined several different research methods at the same time. However, more information is still needed on the connection between cognition, functional capacity and physical fitness in different types of patients with MS."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VLUs are painful, chronic wounds that require thorough debridement to support healing. The study explores tarumase, an enzyme originally isolated from medical maggots, which targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds. AWG delivers tarumase in a proprietary hydrogel formulation, offering a gentle, patient-friendly alternative that enables effective debridement without adding to the patient's pain burden. Building on positive Phase IIA clinical findings, the study reinforces AWG's favourable safety profile and supports its pain-free application. Results show that AWG containing concentrations of tarumase up to 11 U/mL did not result in any increase in patient-reported pain above baseline, either shortly after application or after remaining on the wound for 48-72 hours. AWG is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of VLUs. This publication highlights AWG's unique pain-free profile and patient-centric qualities - a key attribute that has, until now, been underrepresented. By emphasizing these differentiators, the study supports AWG's significant potential to transform outcomes for patients with chronic wounds."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent doctoral thesis from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), more than 500 caregivers describe the extent to which they have subjected elderly people with dementia living at home to violence, abuse and neglect. Two out of three caregivers report having committed at least one such act against the person with dementia they care for during the past year. An incident of abuse can range from humiliating scolding, yelling, threats and pushing to being pressured into transferring money or property. Caregivers can range from the person's spouse to a neighbour. We already have a large ageing population, but so far, it is only a ripple compared to the silver tsunami that is on its way. It is estimated that there are just over 100,000 people currently living with dementia in Norway. We have been aware of this development for a long time. However, there are fewer nursing home spaces now than before. Malmedal believes that municipal funding needs to be significantly strengthened - there is a need for more round-the-clock care spaces. We are aware that many people choose to take early retirement, reduce their working hours, or take sick leave in order to care for their elderly relatives. Both Saga and Malmedal have been supervisors for Gunn Steinsheim, who wrote her doctoral thesis at NTNU. As mentioned above, two out of three caregivers have committed at least one abusive act against the person with dementia over the past year. The episodes of violence, abuse and neglect are distributed as follows: Some caregivers report that the person with dementia has carried out similar acts against them, and one in three caregivers has experienced aggression from the person with dementia they care for. In these situations, psychological abuse is also the most prevalent. Stensheim points out that the caregivers may be struggling with their own health problems, and that the ability to cope with a demanding caregiving situation will vary. In addition, it is quite common for people with dementia to develop challenging behavioural and psychological symptoms. The study also shows that these symptoms are closely linked to a high perceived caregiving burden among caregivers. "Even though the vast majority of caregivers provide good care, we cannot help but wonder whether the limits are being pushed too far by leaving major caregiving responsibilities to this group of people. The answer to that is an emphatic yes," said Gunn Steinsheim, assistant professor at NTNU. Her thesis shows that many caregivers had clear symptoms of anxiety and depression. "We do not know if this is due to the caregiving burden, but it is easy to imagine that it could well be," explained Steinsheim. In addition to significant political efforts that genuinely improve municipal funding and more round-the-clock care spaces, the thesis shows that even small changes can make a big difference. "The risk of abuse can be reduced by having a municipal contact person who has knowledge about dementia and who can also assist with bureaucracy and provide proactive support. Some municipalities have good systems in place, but not all," explained Steinsheim.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a time when physician shortages continue to loom, medical students and other healthcare professionals likely want to know the average annual salaries for the most recruited medical specialties. Salary is a definite consideration when choosing a specialty, especially for recent medical school graduates who may owe $200,000 or more in student loan debt, said Tara Osseck, regional vice president of Jackson Physician Search. She oversees the company's Midwest division and is based in St. Louis . And for many providers, it's not even the biggest one. I think physicians tend to choose their specialty based on what they're passionate about.” A recent 2024 report from AMN Healthcare — a company which specializes in providing healthcare staffing solutions — laid out the most requested searches by specialty. What is the average annual salary for each of these top recruited fields? For its annual report, AMN Healthcare's Physician Solutions division conducted search engagement in 49 states (excluding Hawaii) and Washington, DC, during the 2024 review period. The review is based on a sample of 2138 permanent physician and advanced practice provider search engagements. Starting salaries for NPs were up by 8.6% year over year, “underscoring the strong demand for advanced practice nurses,” according to the report. “NPs are filling needs created by the physician shortage and are being used to staff a growing number of urgent care centers, retail clinics, and telemedicine platforms,” the report stated. In terms of primary care providers, “the demand is sky high,” Osseck said, “because these providers are the first stop for most patients. So it really is a growing gap at that most foundational level.” Delivery access and physician shortages have been a challenge for years, Mike Coppola, chief operating officer of AMGA Consulting, told Medscape Medical News. “And so one of the ways organizations are trying to address that is through the use of advanced practice providers like nurse practitioners and physician assistants,” he said. The average annual starting salary for a family medicine physician grew by 6.27% year over year, according to the AMN report, which also found that these physicians continue to be in demand, although overall demand is down compared to prior years. Fewer doctors going into primary care fields is nothing new, Coppola said. In the past 4-5 years, there have been some changes in how primary care physicians are compensated via relative value units as set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Coppola said. “That has helped a little, but not significantly,” he explained. The average annual compensation change between 2017 and 2024 for family medicine doctors was 3.7%, according to an analysis by Coppola's AMGA Consulting. Additionally, demand for ob/gyn doctors is “really market specific because it's typically population driven,” Coppola said. “If you're in a region that doesn't have population growth or women of childbearing age, then you're going to see less recruitment of obstetrics because there's not as much market need.” Separately, about a decade ago, malpractice rates for obstetrics skyrocketed in some states, Coppola said. Some of this variability could have been driven by the COVID pandemic, said Coppola. Another factor driving this trend could be private equity groups, which “like general gastroenterology practices because they generate a lot of revenue,” he said. [You've seen] over the last couple of years less transactions as inflation and interest rates have increased.” Yet with many radiologists nearing retirement age, “there simply aren't enough new trainees to fill the gap,” Osseck said. Radiologists often face a hefty workload, sometimes reviewing thousands of images every week, so burnout is not uncommon, she said. Many physicians are scaling back their work or opting for teleradiology, “which can make in-person coverage really difficult to maintain for hospitals,” she said. “We're seeing more and more organizations offer hybrid roles or figure out creative solutions to allow someone to work completely remotely,” Osseck added. “Cardiovascular disease still is the leading cause of death in the United States , so just that alone, I think, continues to drive tremendous demand for cardiologists, especially as we're seeing more patients that are seeking out preventative care or managing chronic conditions,” Osseck said. Today, cardiology encompasses advanced imaging, interventional procedures, electrophysiology, and a number of sub-subspecialty components, Osseck said. “So as treatment options are expanding and becoming more sophisticated, you do need the subspecialist to be able to meet that demand,” she said. “A big trend that we've seen, a lot of organizations really lean into to overcome the challenges of recruiting a physician anesthesiologist is leaning on CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetist) to be able to keep up with demand,” she said. “Anesthesia has seen a particularly difficult few years with reimbursements lagging compensation,” Coppola said in an email. “I do not see that demand slowing down,” she said. Cancer rates are increasing, “so therein lies the fact that there's a tremendous need for more oncologists to be able to manage care across really all stages of cancer,” Osseck said. “Oncologists are not only managing really complex medical cases, but they're also supporting patients and their families through very emotionally charged diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. To counteract this intensity, employers are increasingly offering flexible work weeks. “I'm seeing trends of 3.5- or 4-day work weeks becoming more common for this specialty,” Osseck said. This trend tends to be more prevalent in bigger cities, “so that leaves many rural hospitals or community hospitals that are struggling to recruit,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have identified a new type of protein in bacteria that could change our understanding of how these organisms interact with their environments. A new study, published in Nature Communications, focuses on a protein called PopA, found in the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. Supported by the Wellcome Trust, BBSRC, ERC, MRC, and EPSRC an international research team, led by University of Birmingham scientists, used advanced imaging techniques to reveal that PopA has a bowl-like shape that can trap parts of the bacterial membrane inside it. When PopA - an outer membrane protein (OMP) - is introduced into E. coli bacteria, it causes damage to their membranes. This suggests that PopA might play a role in how Bdellovibrio attacks and consumes other bacteria, whilst its ability to trap lipids (fats) suggests a new way bacteria might interact with their surroundings. Structural analysis and AI-driven searches showed that PopA homologues - found across diverse bacterial species - form tetramers, hexamers, and even nonamers, all sharing the signature lipid‑trapping features. This suggests a widespread, previously unrecognised 'superfamily' of proteins. Our discovery is significant because it challenges what scientists thought they knew about bacterial proteins. The unique structure and function of PopA suggest that bacteria have more complex ways of interacting with their environments than previously understood. This could open new possibilities for understanding how bacteria function and interact with their environments - leading to new ways to target harmful bacteria with important implications for medicine and biotechnology." Professor Andrew Lovering, Lead Author, University of Birmingham The study also identified another new family of proteins that form ring-like structures, further expanding our knowledge of bacterial proteins and suggesting that the mechanism to combine into rings might be more common than previously thought. Using a combination of X‑ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics, the team demonstrated that PopA, previously known as Bd0427, forms a central lipid-trapping cavity which is unusual given that the textbook model of membrane protein formation is centred on excluding lipids. Understanding the natural variability of OMPs may have benefits ranging from antibacterial development to synthetic biology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sets out clearly what patients must be told by their surgeon or clinician before undergoing innovative procedures and coincides with the fifth anniversary of the UK Government's 'First Do No Harm' Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, which highlighted unacceptable harm experienced by patients and families due to various medical devices and medications. It establishes robust, consistent, and fully transparent processes to make sure patients are given all the important and relevant information they need, including possible associated risks and other available alternatives, before deciding whether to proceed with a new procedure. We engaged with a wide range of medical experts, lawyers, ethicists, regulatory and policy bodies, and most crucially patients themselves globally as well as the wider public. Combining their skills, insights and experience with evidence-based research, we have produced core standards which – if adopted internationally – will mean surgical innovation can still advance without potentially compromising safety or transparency for anyone." Angus McNair, Co-Lead Author, Professor in Colorectal Surgery, University of Bristol Medical School While new surgical techniques and devices are constantly being developed to improve treatment options for patients, unlike medicines, they are not required to undergo a rigorous approval process before being used on patients. Establishing a Core Information Set (CIS), as presented in this study, was a key recommendation of the UK inquiry's report which considered various controversial medical interventions, including pelvic mesh implants used to treat conditions like pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. The study analysed more than 200 research publications and involved dozens of global surgeons, anaesthetists, medical directors, regulators, lawyers, and policy makers as well as more than 130 patients. Its findings highlighted systemic failures to obtain informed consent before patients agreed to be operated on using new surgical techniques and medical devices, such as implanted pelvic mesh which resulted in complications, in some cases life-altering, for scores of women. The UK inquiry, prompted by public and patient outcry, quoted a woman directly affected by the procedure, who said: "I feel as though I am an unsuspecting, unwilling participant in a cruel experiment that has gone wrong." Professor McNair, who is also a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust, explained: "Research shows surgeons often don't tell patients they are using a pioneering technique, leaving them unaware that the procedure isn't yet fully tried and tested. "The study aims to address these shortcomings by providing surgeons and clinicians with a step-by-step guide of the specific conversations they must have with patients before and after any new surgical procedure. It captures all the different areas of discussion they need to cover so their patients can make informed choices and, if necessary, know how to seek help and support should anything subsequently go wrong." This could entail making health service leaders accountable and responsible for embedding it into their organisation in addition to ensuring surgeons and clinicians skills are supported through continual professional development.
