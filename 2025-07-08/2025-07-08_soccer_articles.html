President Donald Trump will be in New Jersey attending the FIFA Club World Cup Championship at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

The president told reporters on July 8 that he will be watching the soccer game in-person this upcoming Sunday.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino thanked Trump for hosting this tournament as he visited Trump Tower in New York City earlier this week to showcase the FIFA Club Tournament Trophy. Previously, Infantino gave Trump the key to the trophy.

The FIFA Club World Cup tournament concludes on July 13, as New Jersey turns the page in preparation for hosting next year's World Cup tournament, including the championship game in July 2026.

The clubs Chelsea and Fluminense will face off in the semifinal of the FIFA Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium on July 8 at 3 p.m. The winner of that match will play against either Real Madrid or PSG, who face each other in the semi-final game on July 9 at 3 p.m.

Trump attended many sporting events since he became president again, including the Super Bowl, College Football National Championship and many UFC events. Trump announced the White House is set to host a UFC fight next year.

Concerns grew for some people over immigration centered around this club tournament and next year's global event with Trump's policies and the presence of ICE officers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it sucks to lose against your rivals. We saw that on Sunday when the U.S., missing a bunch of star players, lost to a more experienced Mexico team in the Gold Cup final. I don't care how inexperienced you are. I don't care how young you are. Having said that, this Gold Cup run was valuable for United States manager Mauricio Pochettino, especially heading into the 2026 World Cup. Chris Richards and Malik Tillman made the most of their Gold Cup appearances. Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, and Chris Richards used it to either establish (or re-establish) themselves going forward. I also think Pochettino will be a big winner coming out of this, because I think he has created a new identity for this team going forward. So now for the players like Christian Pulisic that weren't here, when they come back, they have to live up to that. They have to adjust, not the other way around. And the U.S. lost to a better Mexico team. They couldn't get possession in huge swaths of the game. Patrick Agyemang started every single game at striker and got two goals at this tournament, but he didn't seize the moment when it counted. And speaking of seizing the moment, with all the love and the praise that we have given to Luna –  and he deserves it because I think he is a star in the making –  you have to bring it when everybody is expecting you to bring it. He didn't bring it on Sunday. Because you can't you-know-what the bed in these moments. It was quiet Gold Cup final for Diego Luna after a series of spectacular games heading into it. Tiillman was almost a known quantity coming into this tournament. And there is still a ceiling for how good he can be, so I don't think he's tapped out. I think Sebastian Berhalter, along with Luna, are the big winners in terms of players that hadn't spent much time with the national team before. I can't fathom a situation where either of those two wouldn't be brought in for the next camp in September. He doesn't get enough credit for the skill that he has, the runs that he makes and the people that he draws, that opens up other space out there, and then ultimately scoring goals, which is what you have to do. I don't know if he is ever going to be that. We're less than a year away from the World Cup. We do not have a legitimate striker that we can count on, where the other team actually has to game plan for him, and that's a problem right now. They are a place to be crazy and full of emotion and out of control when it comes to the things you're doing. It was wonderful to see this team that was kind of thrown together, and I've called them misfits and a ragtag bunch, and they were – but it was fun to see them grow together, and in doing so, do what a lot of people have wanted, and that was to make us care. And even though they lost the final, I have no doubt that these players cared. It may have ended in disappointment, but Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. squad did have a memorable run to the Gold Cup final. This year is going to go like that, and the World Cup is going to be here very soon. And that opportunity will be 100 times more than when it comes to the Gold Cup. It is going to be there for the players that get the incredible privilege to representing their country in a home World Cup. But there is a responsibility, and at least this summer, it was fun to see these players live up to that responsibility and make people believe in this team again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The only thing standing in Paris Saint-Germain's way of the Club World Cup final is Xabi Alonso's new-look Real Madrid. Even with Ousmane Dembélé injured for a large portion of the competition, the Parisians have bagged 12 goals in five matches and conceded just one. PSG punched their tickets to the Club World Cup semifinals with a 2–0 victory over Bayern Munich, but they suffered two casualties in the process. Both Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernández were sent off in the fixture and therefore are suspended against Real Madrid. The Frenchman looked back to his old self against Bayern Munich, coming off the bench to score PSG's insurance goal. The Ballon d'Or favorite will look to impress against the Spanish giants, whose line will be led by his former teammate, Kylian Mbappé. Here's what PSG's XI could look like against Real Madrid on July 9. GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—The Italy international faced harsh criticism for his collision with Jamal Musiala that left the young star with a long-term ankle injury. RB: Achraf Hakimi—Hakimi continues to be one of PSG's standout players and will revel in the chance to compete against his former club. CB: Marquinhos—The pressure will be on the captain to keep Mbappé and co. off the scoresheet, especially without Pacho at his side. CB: Lucas Beraldo—With Pacho and Hernández suspended, Beraldo is in line to make his fourth appearance of the tournament. LB: Nuno Mendes—Much like in the Champions League, Mendes has found great success in the Club World Cup against his opponents' best players. CM: João Neves—Neves comes into the all-important game with three goal contributions in his last two appearances. CM: Vitinha—The midfielder has played every minute of PSG's Club World Cup run and will look to help his side maintain prolonged periods of possession against a Real Madrid side that wishes to control the tempo of the game. CM: Fabián Ruiz—Ruiz is set to make his 60th appearance for PSG this season as the Parisians continue their quest to win five trophies in their historic 2024–25 campaign. ST: Ousmane Dembélé—The Frenchman could make his first start of the competition after only featuring off the bench in PSG's last two matches. LW: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia—Kvaratskhelia is still looking to find his first goal contribution of the knockout stage and could get the perfect opportunity to do so going against Trent Alexander-Arnold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The winner will face either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final. Chelsea, meawhile, have benefitted from a relatively favourable draw and are expected to win today's game. There was a language barrier between them, but Cole Palmer and Liam Delap asked their Portuguese team-mate Dario Essugo to tell the Brazilian teenager just what they thought of him. That Club World Cup quarter-final in Philadelphia on Friday night was Estevao's last game for Palmeiras before he joins Chelsea in a transfer worth an initial £29.3million ($40m) and potentially £49m depending on how well he performs for the London club. “Congratulations, Chelsea,” Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira told reporters after the game. “They need to embrace him because in the beginning, for sure, he will make mistakes. I am sure Chelsea have all the conditions to support him. Chelsea, Estevao and the race for Brazil's best: ‘Stockpiling', smart or both? Chelsea were drawn against Benfica in the last 16 after the Portuguese side beat Bayern Munich to top spot in Group C. Reece James scored a brilliant free kick which looked to be sending his side pretty easily into the quarter-final but a two-hour weather delay changed the game. The two teams returned to the pitch with just a few minutes left of the game and Benfica forced extra time after Angel Di Maria converted a penalty deep into stoppage time. Fortunately for Chelsea, Gianluca Prestianni was sent off two minutes into extra time so Enzo Maresca's men were able to streak away and they ultimately won 4-1. Palmeiras, starring incoming youngster Estevao, awaited in the quarter-final. Chelsea took the lead for the fifth time thanks to a nice finish from Cole Palmer but they were pegged back by a superb Estevao effort. With the game creeping towards extra time, a Weverton own goal won it for the Premier League side to secure their semi-final place. They got off to a good start by beating LAFC 2-0 thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez but had their progress checked in their second match. They took the lead against Flamengo but a chaotic six-minute period saw them go behind on the scoreboard and then lose Nicolas Jackson to another red card. Chelsea were able to confirm progression to the knockouts with a comfortable 3-0 win against Esperance, taking them into the knockouts as runners-up. It was a haze of maroon euphoria after Fluminense's win against Al Hilal but Thiago Silva, their leader whose words inspired them to another underdog victory in the last round against Inter Milan, broke the circle slightly early. Some players were hugging like velcro, others had flags draped around them. He was stoic, walking alone towards the tunnel, sipping from a water bottle, his mind already focused on the semi-final. A picture of tranquility that makes his spine-tingling team talk four days earlier look like it was delivered by a different person. Thiago Silva's timeless leadership has Fluminense dreaming of Club World Cup glory Despite being on that less daunting side of the draw, Fluminense faced a tough test in the last 16 against beaten UEFA Champions League finalists Inter. And they were underdogs again in their quarter-final against Al Hilal. Fluminense were handed a rather favourable draw for this tournament and made sure to take advantage of that. They were unlucky in their Group F opener against Borussia Dortmund, outplaying the Germans but failing to score in a goalless draw. Fluminense then came from behind to beat Ulsan HD in a six-goal thriller. They could have confirmed top spot with victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in their last group game but failed to score again in a goalless draw. Speaking at training earlier in the week, Joao Pedro was asked about his decision to move from Brighton up to west London. 💬 “I think Chelsea is a big club and my dream was always to play for a big club and to win trophies. If you watch the group stage of the Europa League I was top scorer and I'm ready for a new challenge. Like Thiago Silva, Joao Pedro is in line to face his former club today. He made 36 first-team appearances for Fluminense and scored 10 goals. Like his counterpart, Enzo Maresca will be forced into at least two changes for today's game given a couple of his players earned suspensions in their last match. Liam Delap and Levi Colwill were both shown their second yellow cards of the tournament in the quarter-final so are banned for today's game and will need to be replaced in the starting XI. The good news for Maresca and Chelsea is that Moises Caicedo has returned from his suspension and is available for selection. Joao Pedro was given a debut in that last match, so is likely to be given his first Chelsea start in the absence of Delap. In both games, he has come off the bench and scored a vital goal. Despite his newfound reputation as a super sub, the 24-year-old started Fluminense's first four matches. He will surely be set for his fifth start of the tournament given Martinelli's suspension. Fluminense will be without one of his centre-back partners, though, as Juan Pablo Freytes is suspended after receiving his second yellow card of the tournament in the last round. The same was true of Martinelli, who scored a superb opening goal, and he will miss out today. Thiago Silva has impressed so far at this tournament despite only being a couple of months from his 41st birthday — his manager, Renato Portaluppi, was full of praise for him when he spoke yesterday. Thiago Silva was also asked about knowing many of the players he will be lining up against and whether he has been spying on them. "The expectations are high, and the anxiety is high about facing them in a Club World Cup semi-final, so I'm trying to help the coaching staff with some interesting details - but they are things that will stay between us." Thiago Silva, speaking ahead of today's game, discussed what spell in west London. Chelsea were a very special team in my life. It's going to be a special day for me, but it will be even more special if we win. "I don't think even the most hopeful fan could have imagined that we could be where we are today, in a Club World Cup semi-final, but we got here on merit, with hard work." Thiago Silva — who spent four years at Stamford Bridge between 20204 and 2024 — is the captain of the Brazilian side and still looks as assured as ever. Now 40 years old, Silva shared a brilliant relationship with the Chelsea fans and made more than 150 appearances for the club. The fans in blue inside MetLife Stadium this afternoon will surely give him a great ovation. Each of the last three matches of this Club World Cup will be played here, as will next year's World Cup final. After having been to MetLife Stadium multiple times to cover the Copa América last summer, I can understand why the venue has been chosen for back-to-back FIFA tournament finals. Argentina's Copa América semifinal against Canada was a prime example of what MetLife Stadium can sound like for a big international football match. If you're a sports fan, there is no better place to follow all your favourite teams, leagues, and players than with The Athletic. Elsewhere, the F1 season is well into its European swing and there is Open Championship golf just a couple of weeks away. We have the lot covered and much more, so make sure you're fully informed with access to our full experience. There are, however, other ways to watch with DAZN sub licensing out the rights for a select number of matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup semifinals begin Tuesday, with one of the favorites facing an impressive upstart as Chelsea takes on Brazilian side Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Chelsea has seen a lot of what the Brazilian top flight has to offer already at this Club World Cup. One of the group stage's major upsets saw Flamengo claim a 3-1 win over the Blues in Group D, leaving Chelsea in second place. Since then, Chelsea has been grinding it out, needing extra time to dispatch Benfica and a late own goal to knock off Palmeiras, another of Brazil's four representatives in the tournament. Fluminense had a quieter path through the group stage, with a win over Ulsan HD and two scoreless draws enough to seal second place in Group F. It's in the knockout stage where they've made their big splash, shocking Inter Milan 2-0 in the round of 16 before ending Al-Hilal's run with a 2-1 win in the quarterfinal round. Here's what to know ahead of this Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense, including kickoff time and how to watch: It hasn't been a free-flowing half necessarily, but this has been an intriguing half at MetLife Stadium. The Brazilian side has steadily grown into the game, with a penalty kick call in their favor being overturned by VAR and several other dangerous moments. That said, Chelsea has been very threatening on the counter-attack even as Fluminense starts to take more risks going forward. However, it has only resulted in danger rather than true chances, and a stoppage-time turnover at midfield gave Pedro Neto the most threatening opening in these final minutes. However, the counter for Chelsea was foiled by a familiar face: Thiago Silva, who spent four seasons with the Blues before moving back to his native Brazil last year. Fluminense's bench can't believe it, but we continue on in the 38th minute with Chelsea ahead. Replays show the contact is clear, but we're in a VAR check over whether this call should stand. Fluminense had profited from an awkward bounce to set the chance up, with Hércules beating goalkeeper Robert Sánchez only for Cucurella to just barely clear the chance. Chelsea has the breakthrough in the 18th minute, and it took a spectacular strike from João Pedro — a product of Fluminense's academy system! Pedro Neto drove at Fluminense's back line to spark the attack, but his cross didn't find a target. However, Fluminense's clearance was right at João Pedro, a new signing who likely only got the start due to Liam Delap's suspension for yellow card accumulation. João Pedro made the choice from Enzo Maresca look like a bit of genius though, curling home a 24-yard shot that will surely end up on the tournament highlight reel. There isn't much in the way of actual chances yet, but the dynamic of this game is clear: Chelsea is going to keep plenty of possession, while Fluminense's supposed 3-5-2 formation has in reality played as a very deep 5-4-1. Fluminense is packing the box with defenders, dropping off and trying to preserve their legs. We're through the laborious introduction process FIFA has adopted for the Club World Cup, with all 22 starters being shouted out. A summer heat wave has hit the East Coast, and that figures to make this Club World Cup semifinal a seriously draining experience. Per Yahoo Sports reporting from MetLife Stadium, it's currently 94 degrees and "feels even hotter." The sun is blazing as well, with heavy thunderstorms a serious threat if this game goes to extra time. That might favor Fluminense, given the Brazilian side's more extensive experience playing in this kind of heat. Tuesday's Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense kicks off at 3 p.m. "It is not that we don't see this tournament as important, it's that teams have arrived in two completely different situations and realities. How many games have the Brazilian team played in their current season? We have played 63 games," Maresca told a press conference. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Brazilian football quality ahead of facing his third Brazilian opponents, after Chelsea lost 3-1 to Flamengo in the group stage and beat Palmeiras 2-1 in the quarter-finals. "There are two things that for me are very clear in the two games that we face (against) Brazilian teams. Top quality and also defensively, they were very good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York will be Fifa's second office in US Fifa's relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, now has a ­physically tangible marker, with soccer's world governing body announcing that it has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City. “Not just for the Fifa Club World Cup this year and the Fifa World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based. Thanks, of course, to president Trump as well.” Fifa did not provide specifics on which staff or departments would be housed in the New York. It follows Fifa opening in 2024 of an office in Miami, Florida, which houses the organization's legal ­division and some staff responsible for putting on the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. “On behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building – we love you,” Eric Trump said in remarks at the event. The office opening continues Fifa's and Infantino's efforts to appear ­publicly close to the US president, with Infantino describing his ­relationship with Trump as ­“absolutely crucial” in a meeting with the ­International Football Association Board (Ifab) in February. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Infantino also accompanied Trump to the Middle East this year – a trip that made him late for the Fifa congress in Paraguay, angering Fifa delegates who walked out in protest. Uefa later accused Infantino of putting “private political interests” ahead of his Fifa responsibilities, and Human Rights Watch demanded that Infantino reveal the specific purpose and details of his trip, which he has yet to do.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Adams stood, alone, as jubilant Mexican players began their party. They, the U.S. men's national team, were spent, and “disappointed,” after falling in Sunday's Gold Cup final. And “the other huge positive,” captain Tim Ream said, was that “guys have stepped up who have maybe taken a backseat previously.” Leaders emerged, and made this Gold Cup worthwhile, even if it ended in defeat. From the very beginning, with several starters absent, this pre-World Cup summer was framed as an “opportunity.” An opportunity for fringe players to establish themselves. But Richards solidified his place in the starting 11, and "stepped up in more of a vocal role,” Ream said. Diego Luna further endeared himself to head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Tillman earned at least a longer look as a playmaker, either off the bench or in the starting 11. So, where does the U.S. roster stand with 11 months to go? *In Pochettino's eyes, or at least according to his public words, there is no such thing as a roster lock. We'll take those words with a proverbial grain of salt, but ever since the USMNT flopped in March, his words have seemed to carry more weight. So, we've trimmed down our list of locks. And as always, the mere concept comes with caveats. Injuries, off-field troubles and a variety of other issues could still derail careers between now and next summer. More broadly, he's the only U.S. player with undisputed first-11 quality who performed well at the Gold Cup, and rode with Pochettino from start to finish this summer. He also found his voice, “making sure guys are doing the right things, making sure guys are in the right positions,” Ream, his center back partner, observed. Assuming health, there's no chance he's not in the squad next summer. His offseason knee surgery gives a bit of pause, but it was “minor” and most likely a medium-term positive. Robinson opted for that surgery over the Gold Cup, which also gives a bit of pause; but Pochettino and the American public didn't frown upon his decision as much as they did Pulisic's. Adams wasn't great at the Gold Cup. When I asked him Sunday night to assess his tournament, he acknowledged: “Listen, I think for me, the biggest thing was coming out of it healthy.” And in Pochettino's eyes, the biggest thing was probably his presence. “But mentally, I wanted to grind and be a role model for so many of the guys here. The USMNT's single biggest problem this past month was its lack of a vertical winger. 10s, jammed into nominally wide roles — and with fullbacks or even Sebastian Berhalter relied upon for width — the U.S. posed very little direct threat. This allowed opponents, like Mexico, to squeeze the midfield. Every aimless pass and dead-end possession reinforced Weah's importance. He's the best player this country has ever produced. With a full offseason to recharge, he should shine in 2025-26. But there's a chance, albeit a slim one, that Pochettino was so put off or even offended by Pulisic's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup that he banishes his star from the squad. (Pulisic's subsequent comments that he “didn't understand” Pochettino's decision to not let him play in pre-Gold Cup friendlies probably didn't help, either!) McKennie, fairly or unfairly, has been cast as the face of the crew who don't take national duty seriously enough. The onus is now on him to prove otherwise. And although his Gold Cup absence was out of his control — he was with Juve at the Club World Cup — he is much more replaceable than Pulisic. If Poch really wanted to send a message, dropping McKennie could do the trick. (But it wouldn't be smart; when lights are bright, McKennie is a top-three player in this pool.) Multiple strikers exposed his vulnerability at the Gold Cup. Even if he doesn't start next June, he'll almost certainly make the squad as a leader and veteran presence. Dest reported to Chicago for summer camp, then departed before the Gold Cup. Pochettino said in a statement through a spokesman at the time that his staff had "done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño, we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season." The USMNT has missed his ball progression and sizzle. Musah missed the Gold Cup for “personal reasons.” He hasn't said what those reasons were. But he has reported to AC Milan for preseason, amid reports that he's wanted by the Serie A champions, Napoli. We'll assume he's in good standing with everyone who matters. There have been a wide variety of reactions to Tillman's Gold Cup. He was excellent against Costa Rica and lesser opponents. So, as he (likely) moves from PSV to Bayer Leverkusen, there are legitimate questions about the viability and sustainability of his playmaking at the highest level. No matter the level of opposition, that's significant, and bodes well for his prospects under Pochettino going forward. Turner lost the U.S. starting gig to Matt Freese. Pochettino, though, repeatedly clarified that this was largely, if not solely, because Turner has hardly played competitive soccer games since last summer. And in his stead, Freese didn't exactly excel. Critics argue he wasn't actually that effective this summer, outside of the two goals against Guatemala. Even if Poch comes to the realization Luna can't hang at the highest levels, he'd probably go to the World Cup as a manifestation of “attitude, hunger, desire … That,” Pochettino said last week, “is what we want.” Balo missed October, November, March and June with injuries. Ricardo Pepi, the main man capable of stealing his starting spot, has also been injured. Patrick Agyemang tried hard, really hard, but clearly doesn't have the technical or tactical ability to lead a line at the World Cup. So, Balogun will surely be in September camp if he's healthy, and probably has to be in the World Cup squad if the USMNT is to hit its ceiling. Much of the above applies to Pepi as well. The main difference: Balogun has proven, at least in spurts, that he can score at a Big Five level. Pepi hasn't done much outside CONCACAF and the notoriously soft Dutch league. Freese got his first USMNT starts, and … looked rather shaky throughout the tournament. But he met his biggest moment, the penalty shootout against Costa Rica. But let's not get carried away; if everyone is healthy and starting for their clubs, Pochettino's three keepers could end up being Turner, Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte. Scally was an unexplained omission from the Gold Cup roster. Most would assume he'll be back in camp come the fall, but … perhaps Pochettino just doesn't rate him? Even if he's not good enough on the ball to start for the U.S., though, he profiles as a valuable backup who can be thrown on for the final 15 minutes to defend a lead. For about 20 minutes last month, Johnny was the patrolling defensive midfielder that he is in Spain, the one apparently worth over $30 million to Atlético Madrid, the one from USMNT supporter dreams. Then he carelessly gifted a goal to Türkiye. Of all the Gold Cup absences, Sargent's — a “football decision” made by Pochettino — could prove the most consequential. It's a remarkable drought that makes Sargent borderline unplayable in meaningful matches until it's broken in a friendly or low-pressure game. Why Poch brought Brian White to camp this summer instead of Sargent is baffling. McKenzie started one of eight games this summer — the 4-0 loss to Switzerland. He didn't play a single consequential minute during the Gold Cup. He left as a distant third on the depth chart at best. Wright departed USMNT camp with an Achilles injury. His track record suggests he should be on the right side of the roster bubble, but he hasn't proven anything directly, up close and personally, to Pochettino. Tessmann, another victim of Pochettino's vague “football decisions,” is a mysterious case. The provocative narrative is: Would Pochettino have even called him in if available? (Unfortunately for Reyna, languidness seems to be the bane of Pochettino's existence.) Freeman was solid for most of the tournament against MLS-esque opposition. He was then at fault on both Mexico goals. It's very difficult to make the case that he's more ready than Scally (who, by the way, is only two years older than Freeman). The 24-year-old Californian is an audacious dribbler and a confident, two-footed attacker who, for some reason, fits Pochettino's description of a left back. (Which is significantly different from the wingback position he plays in Columbus.) Then he looked like a training dummy as Costa Rica equalized. USMNT fans are already (rightly) distrustful of his defending against CONCACAF foes, to say nothing of potential World Cup foes. But he might just be the second-choice left back. Agyemang has become the USMNT's most polarizing player, a physical striker who makes things happen, and also makes attacking moves go awry. He started all six games of the Gold Cup. He was strong with his back to goal, and a menace running the channels. But when running toward goal, with or without the ball, he was shoddy. He's probably fourth on the depth chart, but with an asterisk: his hold-up play is better than that of any striker above him. A mooted move to Derby County in the English Championship could change that, for better or worse. It's unclear if, or when, his second chance might come. For a while, Schulte looked like the primary challenger to Turner in net. But a fluky late-May oblique injury, suffered in pregame warmups, robbed him of the chance to challenge this summer. Berhalter got to U.S. camp last month and instantly knew what it took — and what it meant — to play for the national team. He had an inherent advantage, of course; his dad used to play for and coach the team; Sebastian had watched obsessively for years. But that doesn't take anything away from how he grasped the responsibility, and showed the required intensity. He played like he belonged — even when his natural ability suggested he didn't — and put in an application for a World Cup ticket as a so-called “vibes guy,” the type of role that his dad gave to Cristian Roldan in 2022. His one and only USMNT game over the past 12 months was the deflating 2-1 loss to Canada in March. Or is Morris firmly on the outside looking in after failing to impress Pochettino in the coach's first camp last October? Pochettino stuck with Richards and Ream throughout the tournament, so we got no hints about who he favors among the reserves. Center back depth continues to be a concern. At the beginning of camp, he was starting on the right wing, and pinging a first-minute goal past Turkey. By the end, he was on the bench, and ineffective whenever he came off it as a substitute. Pochettino seemed to realize that McGlynn's slowness and slenderness made him a poor fit for the international game — and, therefore, a longshot for the World Cup roster. That he could hardly get off the B-team's bench is an indictment of his standing with the national team. He's probably fifth on the striker depth chart, and didn't do anything at the Gold Cup to change that. Also on the fringes: DeJuan Jones, Auston Trusty, John Tolkin, Cristian Roldan, Kevin Paredes, Chris Brady, Paxten Aaronson, Brian White, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, Gianluca Busio, Quinn Sullivan, Sean Zawadzki and Daryl Dike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four of the world's top soccer teams face off at MetLife Stadium this week — and a cool reception by fans could mean deals for those most excited about the games. The FIFA Club World Cup semifinals kick off Tuesday with a 3 p.m. match between Brazil's Fluminense and London's Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. “ I see the whole tournament as a friendlier game among soccer clubs,” Nan Wei, a soccer fan from Williamsburg who spent thousands of dollars traveling to watch more competitive Champions League semifinal games last year, said. While this year's Club World Cup features a new, expanded format, Wei said it doesn't grab fans' attention the same way as the World Cup does. He said many teams would be playing at half-intensity, with their eyes on a share of the $1 billion pot, but not willing to risk injury. Amid reportedly sluggish ticket sales for the cup, diehard fans can get some bargains. If you hit a magic moment for sales, the tickets could get even cheaper. The Athletic reported on Saturday that tickets were $13, down from $473.90 a few days earlier. semifinal at MetLife were higher on Tuesday morning, but could vary as well. Those who want to see Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappé in the flesh could get tickets Tuesday for about $170. Sunday's final, which will put the winners of those semifinals against each other, were going for $265 and up. The cup's schedule is optimized for European prime time, which might not have helped with ticket sales. The games kick off locally at 3 p.m. mid-workday and mid-summer heat. Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy and human rights groups told FIFA in an open letter earlier this month that U.S. immigration policies and reports of stepped-up enforcement around the games could make international attendees unsafe. At MetLife, attendance for last weekend's Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund game was 92%, based on figures reported by ESPN and the stadium's capacity. But Fluminense's game against South Korea's Ulsan two weeks prior had approximately 1 in 3 seats filled. FIFA did not respond to a request for comment on attendance concerns. If you are content to watch the game from the comfort of your home or workplace, you can stream it for free on streaming service DAZN with an account. Outdoor viewing at the World Trade Center Oculus was initially planned but has since been canceled due to what organizers said was an "abundance of caution ... in alignment with recent guidance from state and security officials."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PSG and Real Madrid collide in a mouthwatering European heavyweight semifinal matchup at the FIFA Club World Cup. Who: Real Madrid vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) What: Semifinal 2, FIFA Club World Cup 2025 Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States When: Wednesday, July 9 at 3pm local time (19:00 GMT) How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from noon (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream. The contest has some extra spice thrown in with superstar Kylian Mbappe, an ex-PSG player, lining up against his old club for the first time since signing with Real Madrid last year. Here is all to know before the second CWC semifinal: Los Blancos finished atop Group H with two wins and one draw. Real opened their CWC campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami, before thumping Mexican side Pachuca 3-1 in a rematch of their FIFA Intercontinental final last December. In the round of 16, Real played out a tough 1-0 win against timeless rivals Juventus at Hard Rock Stadium. PSG finished atop Group B with two wins and one loss. They opened their Club World Cup with a dominant 4-0 victory against Atletico Madrid at the famous Rose Bowl in Los Angeles. Real Madrid have netted 11 goals in the Club World Cup so far, while PSG have 12; both teams have been boosted by the return of their injured star strikers, with Ousmane Dembele and Mbappe scoring in the quarterfinals. Mbappe's superb goal against Dortmund on Saturday was his 44th for Real Madrid in 58 appearances this season. Dembele, meanwhile, blossomed after Mbappe's departure from the Paris club, switching from the wing to the attacking talisman role in coach Luis Enrique's system, scoring 34 goals in 51 appearances across all competitions in 2024-25, and carrying PSG to domestic and European titles. It's the best season of my career,” Dembele told PSG's official website. Real Madrid won the knockout match 3-2 on aggregate before going on to lift their 14th European title – but PSG were a very different team then, and that was before Enrique took charge of the French side. Real Madrid have won the FIFA Club World Cup a record five times. Their last victory was in 2023 when they beat Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal 5-3. PSG achieved their best season in club history in the 2024-25 campaign, winning a perfect four-out-of-four titles: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Trophee des Champions and the UEFA Champions League trophy. If they win the FIFA Club World Cup, they can add a fifth trophy to their spectacular season, completing a rare quintuple of titles in one season. “He is still not perfect, not 100 percent, but he is getting better every day,” Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said of Mbappe after their quarterfinal victory over Dortmund. Centre back Dean Huijsen, who picked up a late red card against Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal, will not play due to suspension. Real continue to be without the injured trio of David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick. Enrique will be without suspended defenders William Pacho and Lucas Hernandez after both were sent off in PSG's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. Lucas Beraldo is expected to be named Pacho's replacement in the starting XI. Up front, Dembele is a strong probability to make his first start of the tournament after coming on as a substitute against Munich, with Bradley Barcola moving to the bench.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's no rest for the winners (obscure song reference) Bayern Munich crashed out of the FIFA Club World Cup recently, losing one of their most important players in the process. Now that their tournament run is over, what comes next for the players? X account @iMiaSanMia captured a report that the players have already departed from their training base in Orlando, USA, on Sunday, and traveled back to home ground in Munich. However, the report says that the players will now begin their three week long vacation. Following that, they will resume training for pre-season preparations at the end of July. The club will also play some friendlies in August, before battling VFB Stuttgart for the DFL Supercup, set to play against Tottenham Hotspurs (7th August), Grasshopper Club Zurich (12th August), and fan club Red Eagles Austria after the Stuttgart game (23rd August). Bayern's squad have had quite an exhausting season over the last couple of months, with a very intense and game-packed schedule. The vacation will most definitely be appreciated, but fans are doubting if the duration of it will be enough to rest sufficiently before yet another series of games. Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala will be out for months and now the club could be on the lookout for some help. Will Vincent Kompany and Max Eberl looking to lean on internal options or take a gander out at the transfer market for the attacking midfield position? Things just got more difficult, especially when considering the team's No. 1 priority is at left-wing and a close No. Let's talk about how it might all play out on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works Show.
