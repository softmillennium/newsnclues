Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses at a Ray Ban store in London.

Meta Plaforms Inc. bought a minority stake in the world's largest eye-wear maker EssilorLuxottica SA, a deal that increases the US tech giant's financial commitment to the fast-growing smart glasses industry, according to people familiar with the matter.

Facebook parent Meta acquired just under 3% of Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, a stake worth around €3 billion ($3.5 billion) at the current market price, said the people, who asked not to be identified because deliberations are private. Menlo Park, California-based Meta is considering further investment that could build the stake to around 5% over time, the people added, though those plans could still change.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Transportation Security Administration plans to let many travelers leave their shoes on at U.S. airport checkpoints, ending a roughly 20-year-old rule, according to people familiar with the matter. Most passengers have been required to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints since 2006. The TSA at the time said it put the requirement for shoe removal or explosives screening because of "intelligence pointing to a continuing threat." That came after Richard Reid, who became known as the "shoe bomber," tried and failed to ignite explosive material in his shoe on a Paris to Miami flight in December 2001. Travelers enrolled in the TSA's PreCheck program can already leave their shoes on and keep their laptops and similar electronics in their bags when going through airport checkpoints. The agency declined to comment on the change and said that it and the Department of Homeland Security "are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture. Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels." The news was reported earlier by Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer who writes the Gate Access newsletter. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla CEO Elon Musk told Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives to "Shut up" on Tuesday after the analyst offered three recommendations to the electric vehicle company's board in a post on X. Ives has been one of the most bullish Tesla observers on Wall Street. But on Tuesday, Ives took to X with critical remarks about Musk's political activity after the world's richest person said over the weekend that he was creating a new political party called the America Party to challenge Republican candidates who voted for the spending bill that was backed by President Donald Trump. Ives called for Tesla's board to create a new pay package for Musk that would get him 25% voting control and clear a path to merge with xAI, establish "guardrails" for how much time Musk has to spend at Tesla, and provide "oversight on political endeavors." Ives published a lengthier note with other analysts from his firm headlined, "The Tesla board MUST Act and Create Ground Rules For Musk; Soap Opera Must End." In an email to CNBC, Ives wrote, "Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board." Musk's historic 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion and has since gone up in value, was voided last year by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla's board members had lacked independence from Musk and failed to properly negotiate at arm's length with the CEO. Tesla has appealed that case to the Delaware state Supreme Court and is trying to determine what Musk's next pay package should entail. Ives isn't the only Tesla bull to criticize Musk's continued political activism. Analysts at William Blair downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold from a buy on Monday, because of Musk's political plans and rhetoric as well as the negative impacts that the spending bill passed by Congress could have on Tesla's margins and EV sales. Trump supporter James Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria Partners, said Saturday that his firm postponed the listing of an exchange-traded fund, the Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF, that would invest in the EV company's shares and options. He began his post on X saying, "Elon has gone too far." "I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO," Fishback wrote. Musk said Saturday that he has formed the America Party, which he claimed will give Americans "back your freedom." Tesla's stock is now down about 25% this year, badly underperforming U.S. indexes and by far the worst performance among tech's megacaps. His official work with the administration wrapped up at the end of May, and his exit preceded a public spat between Musk and Trump over the spending bill and other matters. Musk, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm and investor relations representative Travis Axelrod didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose up to 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. "very soon." "They're going to be tariffs at very high rate, like 200%," Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. But he suggested that those levies would not go into effect immediately, saying he will "give people about a year, year and a half." "We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together," Trump said, apparently referring to drugmakers. "With pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, those studies are being completed at the end of the month, and so the president will then set his policies then, and I'm going to let him wait to decide how he's going to do it," Lutnick said. The president has repeatedly threatened and then changed course on tariff proposals, so there's no guarantee he will set pharmaceutical tariffs at the 200% rate. Pharmaceutical stocks were largely unchanged following Trump's comments. It is Trump's most significant comment on pharmaceutical-specific tariffs since April, when his administration initiated a so-called Section 232 investigation on those products. That legal authority allows the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the impact of imports on national security. Those planned tariffs would deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have pushed back and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter investments in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, putting patients at risk. The industry is already navigating the fallout from Trump's drug pricing policies, which drugmakers argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development. Trump has said tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and others are already putting more money into the U.S. after domestic drug manufacturing has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A top White House economic advisor on Tuesday likened the odds that President Donald Trump's tariffs will lead to higher prices to those of a meteorite striking earth. But "there's just no evidence thus far of it happening," Miran said. Anchor Melissa Lee noted that Miran was equating tariff price increases with extremely rare events. "I don't mean to be dismissive," he replied. "All I mean to say is that prediction is difficult, and we should always speak in terms of odds and possibilities." "I don't have a crystal ball telling me the future and neither does anyone else," he said. Miran also promoted a new report from his White House council, which highlighted the fact that prices of imported goods had fallen between December of last year and May, despite fears that Trump's tariffs would hike prices. Trump did not announce his "reciprocal" tariff agenda until April. And he has twice extended the deadline he set for countries to reach bilateral trade deals with the U.S. and avoid these highest rates. While prices some individual goods have already risen as a result of tariffs, Trump's policies have yet to spur the overall inflation that businesses and consumers feared. Many economists say they still expect to see prices increase in the coming months. And they point to multiple reasons why those higher prices have not yet appeared. One is the fact that Trump has repeatedly delayed implementing many of his most severe "liberation day" tariffs. A second is the delay between tariffs and their real world price impact, while a third factor is the stockpiling that many companies did earlier this year. "I mean, sure, eventually, you know, a meteor is going to strike or whatever. But we've been waiting many months now and that evidence has just not emerged." The White House report analyzed two inflation gauges: the Personal Consumption expenditure Price Index, or PCE, which is followed by financial markets, and the widely tracked Consumer Price Index, or CPI. "The results clearly show the price of imported components declining, starting in March, while overall prices were close to unchanged or increased slightly," the report concluded.

Dangote Industries Ltd. expects Africa's biggest refinery to rely totally on Nigerian crude by the end of the year, a move that would replace hundreds of thousands of barrels a day of imported oil.

The plant owned by Aliko Dangote, the continent's richest person, received about half of its crude in June from local producers who will be able to sell more to the facility as their foreign supply obligations end, according to Devakumar Edwin, vice president at Dangote Industries, who oversees the 650,000 barrel-a-day plant outside Lagos.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first time Antara Dave applied for a job at Microsoft, her dream company, she was rejected. But a year later she landed the role after picking up experience the company had said she was missing. Dave joined Microsoft in 2022 and is now a senior product designer who leads user experience for AI tools. Dave, who was working as a data analyst at Home Depot at the time, moved into a role within her company that would get her the experience she needed to land the Microsoft job. "There was a one-hour interview where I presented my work to a bunch of people on the team, around 20 people. They also asked me questions about my project to understand how I made those design decisions," she said. "They wanted to learn how I approach and think about problems." Dave said her undergraduate and master's degrees helped her develop the critical thinking skills needed to be a good product designer. She also said the nearly seven years she spent at Home Depot in different roles helped her ultimately land the job at Microsoft. In addition to having a résumé that shows the impacts of your work and standing out in the interview, Dave said anyone who wants to work as a designer at Microsoft should be very familiar with AI tools and vibe-coding, or using an AI chatbot to produce code.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its artificial intelligence platform helps corporate legal teams handle routine matters. It ultimately wants to build a network of "AI-augmented" legal professionals who perform work for clients, particularly large enterprises, at a lower cost than Big Law rates. "We believe AI is the future of labor," said Omar Haroun, a former lawyer and Eudia's founder and chief executive. "Not in a dystopian way, but more augmented humans who are ready to completely change the work that's being done." Founded just under two years ago, Eudia already tops $10 million in annual recurring revenue across dozens of clients and, Haroun said, is on track to hit $20 million by the end of the year. The investment had just one major condition: Eudia would get $30 million up front and the other $75 million as it found other companies to buy. Typically, young startups raise small amounts of venture capital to keep the lights on while they crank on building and selling a product, and then they raise bigger rounds of funding as their revenue scales. They might direct some of that investment toward buying other companies — to access new markets, secure talent, or take out a competitor. Eudia benefits from a different strategy taking hold in startup land. The firm and others have been buying mature businesses or consolidating multiple competitors into a single company. The hope is that the merged company can operate more efficiently by combining costs or applying technology to automate tasks and make more informed decisions. In Eudia's case, General Catalyst trusted a battle-tested founder with its cash. Before Eudia, Haroun started a company focused on surfacing sensitive information within large datasets, which proved particularly relevant in legal contexts. Haroun founded Eudia on the belief that legal teams deserve better than what most white-shoe law firms offer. Traditionally, companies would save their thorniest matters for their outside counsel to solve, Haroun said, but as the demands on legal teams have increased, they've sent more work (and money) out the door. Eudia aims to help clients perform more work in-house. Its platform ingests everything from existing contracts, policies, and playbooks to past precedents and billing data to build a centralized "legal brain" for each customer. From that foundation, the company says its custom agents — software that can carry out tasks autonomously — can speed up tasks like manually redlining contracts and running compliance checks. With its recent acquisition of Johnson Hana, Eudia says it can offer hands-on support for more complex matters. Haroun said more details about integrating Johnson Hana, including brand strategy, would be announced in September at the Augmented Intelligence Summit, Eudia's invite-only gathering of legal leaders. Eudia screened nearly a hundred potential partners before, Haroun said, choosing Johnson Hana for its sterling reputation and blue-chip client roster. Johnson Hana already handles legal work for Airbnb, X, OpenAI, Stripe, and Citibank, said Dan Fox, the company's cofounder and chief executive. "This is a business model that looks to make lawyers better," Fox said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump signed his "big beautiful" tax and spending bill into law on July 4, codifying a slew of changes to the tax system, healthcare, and education. One specific student-loan change in the bill places new caps on the amount of loans students can borrow for graduate school, including medical and law school. Is Trump's spending bill affecting your decision to pursue an advanced degree, like medical or law? Those caps mean many students won't be able to borrow enough to cover the full price of graduate or professional school. The Association of American Medical Colleges found that the median cost for four years of public medical school was $286,454 for the class of 2024, with that amount rising to just over $390,000 at a private school. "Eliminating or restricting these critical programs would undermine the future physician workforce and ultimately make it harder for patients in communities nationwide to get the care they need," AAMC's president and CEO, David Skorton, said in a statement. Sara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, told Business Insider that she expects these new caps to worsen doctor shortages and "shut off pathways to these important jobs for students from low income families." Some students might also turn toward private student loans with higher interest rates, Partridge said. "Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. The parent PLUS program, which previously allowed parents to borrower up to the full cost of attendance, still exists, but the bill places a $65,000 lifetime cap on parents borrowing for their kids' educations. It eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two new options. The first option is a standard repayment plan with a payment period ranging from 10 to 25 years, based on the borrower's original balance. The second option is a new plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which sets borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which the bill eliminated. The SAVE plan would have reduced payments on undergraduate loans from 10% to 5% of a borrower's discretionary income. "A truly beautiful bill for the American people," she said.
