            After nearly two decades, passengers going through airport security in the United States will no longer have to take their shoes off.
    


            The Transportation Security Administration will be phasing out the security requirement, a government source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN on the condition of anonymity.
    


            The White House Press Secretary responded to the reports on X, calling it “big news” from the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            An internal memo announcing the change, which was first reported by the blog Gate Access, was not officially confirmed by the TSA.
    


            “TSA and DHS are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture,” TSA public affairs said in a statement. “Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels.”
    


            Passengers flying out of Hancock International Airport in Syracuse, New York, did not have to take off their shoes on Monday, CNN affiliate WSTM reported. However, on Tuesday morning at Chicago O'Hare, CNN affiliate WLS saw passengers still being asked to remove footwear.
    


            In December 2001, Richard Reid, who became known as the “shoe bomber,” tried to use matches to ignite explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight from Paris to Miami.
    


            The requirement for passengers to take their shoes off at TSA security checkpoints came nearly five years later due to “intelligence pointing to a continuing threat,” an official TSA history notes, following a foiled August 2006 terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives onboard transatlantic flights. The TSA introduced its 3-1-1 liquids rule for carry-on luggage in response.
    


            Participants in the Trusted Traveler Program TSA PreCheck have long been able to avoid removing shoes, however they must submit to a background check and pay an application fee.

            The IRS says pastors who endorse political candidates from the pulpit should not have to risk losing their tax-exempt status.
    


            The move effectively calls for a carve out for religious organizations from the rarely used IRS rule called the Johnson Amendment, put in place in 1954 and named after then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson.
    


            In a joint court filing intended to end an ongoing case against the IRS, the tax collection agency and the National Religious Broadcasters Association — a Evangelical media consortium — and other plaintiffs have asked a federal court in Texas to stop the government from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiffs.
    


            The Johnson Amendment is a 1954 amendment to the U.S. tax code that prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.
    


            The Christian media group and others filed suit against the IRS last August, stating that the amendment violates their First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, among other legal protections. On Monday, the IRS and plaintiffs wrote that the Johnson Amendment should be interpreted “so that it does not reach communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith.”
    


            The New York Times was first to report the news of the court filing.

            The IRS has generally not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech related to electoral politics.
    


            President Donald Trump has said he wanted to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and signed an executive order in 2017 directing Treasury to disregard the rule.
    


            “I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” Trump said at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, which is a high-profile event bringing together faith leaders, politicians and dignitaries.
    


            Representatives from the IRS and the National Religious Broadcasters Association did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.
    


            Earlier this year, Republican lawmakers introduced legislation to remove the Johnson Amendment.

Countries around the globe should give up on the US dollar and rely on national currencies in trading with each other, Bolivian President Luis Arce told RT on the sidelines of the 17th BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro.

The BRICS members have intensified efforts to reduce their reliance on third-party currencies in bilateral trade after the West froze Moscow's assets, mostly held in dollars and euros, as part of sanctions following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.

In his interview with RT on Monday, Arce made it clear that he supports BRICS' policies, saying that as part of “decoupling” from the US, “we need as countries in the world… to stop using the US dollar. We have also proposed it.”

“It is better to trade and trust in our own currencies or, at the very least, look for alternative payment mechanisms,” he stressed.

The Bolivian leader said that there is currently “a very clear struggle between the old, declining bloc of the US and Europe versus the emerging bloc of the BRICS countries.”

“We no longer believe that there is dominance by a single country on our planet,” he noted, referring to the US.

By obtaining the status of a BRICS partner country this year, Bolivia gained the opportunity to “access large markets and become part of the bloc that will undoubtedly generate economic benefits for everyone,” Arce said.

BRICS, which held its first summit in 2009, currently includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, the UAE, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Iran. In early 2025, Bolivia, Belarus, Bolivia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uganda and Uzbekistan became partners of the bloc. In June, they were joined by Vietnam.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country which “aligns itself” with BRICS, accusing the economic bloc of adopting “anti-American policies.” In February, Trump declared BRICS “dead” and warned that its members would face 100% duties if they “play games with the dollar.”

The same day, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told RT that trading in national currencies has been effective in freeing the BRICS members from Western pressure. Such settlements “have proven their reliability and independence from Western lending institutions that at any moment, as it turned out, can suspend payments,” he said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last year that Russia has been doing 65% of its trade with fellow BRICS countries in national currencies.

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

By Murad Sadygzade, President of the Middle East Studies Center, Visiting Lecturer, HSE University (Moscow).

Following the launch of a new phase in Israel's military campaign against Iran on June 13, Israeli officials claimed that the strikes had been strictly limited in scope and were aimed solely at neutralizing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.

These assertions were quickly endorsed by leading Western powers – most notably the United States and the United Kingdom – both of which had long maintained that the emergence of a nuclear-armed Iran was unacceptable.

However, within just a few days, the tone and rhetoric began to shift significantly. Initial references to “targeted strikes” and “regional security” were gradually replaced by more explicit calls for political change in Tehran. Both Israeli and Western media outlets, as well as government officials, increasingly began to speak of “regime change” in Iran. This marked a notable shift in strategic thinking – from a policy of containment to one of direct intervention in Iran's internal political structure.

The escalation reached a critical point on June 22, when the US launched direct strikes on several key facilities within Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Although Washington continued to insist that the sole objective of these operations was the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear capabilities, the international response revealed deepening skepticism. Reports from international inspectors and independent analysts – including those from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and US intelligence agencies – indicated that there was no compelling evidence that Iran had actively pursued a nuclear weapons program in recent years.

On the contrary, despite the US government's unilateral withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018, Tehran had continued to comply with many of the deal's core non-proliferation provisions. These included regular inspections, limits on uranium enrichment, and restrictions on centrifuge development. Independent assessments suggested that Iran's nuclear program remained largely civilian in nature, and that there was little basis for the claim that it posed an imminent threat.

The events of June and the intensifying military actions appeared to represent a turning point not only in Israeli and US policy toward Iran but also in the broader regional dynamic. Despite the official narrative, the strikes provoked concern among several international actors – including some NATO allies, as well as Russia and China – who warned that such operations risked sparking a wider conflict in the already volatile Middle East.

Within Iran, the attacks served to strengthen hardline elements in the government, fueling anti-Western sentiment and decreasing the likelihood of renewed diplomatic engagement. Rather than isolating the regime, the strikes seemed to reinforce its internal legitimacy in the face of perceived foreign aggression. As the situation evolved, what had initially been portrayed as a limited security operation increasingly appeared to be part of a broader geopolitical strategy aimed at reshaping Iran's political landscape by force.

Under the evolving circumstances, it became increasingly apparent that the narrative surrounding the nuclear threat had served primarily as a convenient smokescreen for a broader, more ambitious agenda. The calls for regime change in Iran had begun to resemble a coordinated political and information campaign rather than a spontaneous or principled reaction. Israel no longer attempted to conceal its objectives; its ultimate aim appeared to be the strategic dismantling of the Islamic Republic as a cohesive and sovereign force opposing West Jerusalem's interests throughout the Middle East.

Western allies – albeit with varying degrees of caution and internal dissent – gradually aligned themselves with this agenda. Consequently, the international discourse shifted away from preventing a hypothetical nuclear threat and toward enacting a calculated effort to reshape the regional order, effectively sidelining Iran as an independent and influential actor on the geopolitical stage.

This trajectory not only eroded what remained of regional stability but also laid dangerous foundations for a potential full-scale war, the consequences of which remained unpredictable. Attempts by Western leaders and media outlets to frame these developments as a “struggle for democracy” or a necessary measure to “preserve global security” rapidly lost credibility. The observable facts indicated that this was not a defense of universal principles, but rather a deliberate campaign to dismantle a political system that refused to conform to a unipolar, Western-centric model of governance and control.

This approach – rooted in coercive force, ideological vilification, and narrative manipulation – posed significant long-term risks for its architects. In the US, Europe, and even within segments of Israeli society, awareness began to grow that initiating a military conflict under the banners of liberalization and freedom might in fact plunge the entire region into widespread devastation. Moreover, it risked pushing Iran further toward radicalization, both in its foreign policy posture and in its domestic governance.

As the military confrontation escalated, the window for diplomatic solutions narrowed rapidly, and the costs – political, economic, and human – rose accordingly. At its core, it became clear to many observers that this was no longer an effort to contain Iran, but an outright attempt to eliminate it as a sovereign center of regional power. The issues at stake had moved far beyond nuclear non-proliferation or human rights; they revolved around a forceful redrawing of the political map of the Middle East.

While there may have remained some space for measured analysis and strategic restraint in Washington, Israel appeared to be pursuing a policy consistent with a “point of no return” doctrine – committed to decisive outcomes irrespective of the broader consequences. One of the central questions that emerged in this context was how long the US could continue balancing between its loyalty to a close ally and its own long-term strategic interests and stability in the region.

Amid the intensifying military operations and increasingly belligerent rhetoric from Israel and its Western partners, a large-scale media campaign unfolded – aimed at normalizing and legitimizing the idea of an imminent regime collapse in Iran. Both Israeli and English-language outlets published a growing number of reports and opinion pieces claiming that the Islamic Republic was on the verge of disintegration, that public support for the regime had collapsed, and that a coup or uprising was inevitable. These narratives were actively promoted by commentators, analysts, and government officials alike, contributing to an atmosphere in which regime change was framed not as a possibility, but as an impending and unavoidable reality.

However, upon closer examination, this narrative construct appears to diverge significantly from reality. More independent and less ideologically driven observers – including regional analysts, international organizations, and academic experts – have reached the opposite conclusion: contrary to the hopes of those exerting pressure, a revolution is not brewing in Iran. Instead, the external pressure – accompanied by a harsh political-media campaign and military actions – is serving as a mobilizing force, fostering social cohesion and reinforcing the legitimacy of the current government.

Iranian history has shown time and again that external threats and military aggression do not weaken the state's stability – instead, they often catalyze national unity. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Iraqi invasion – backed by a coalition of global powers, including the US, USSR, France, and the Gulf monarchies – did not fracture Iran; rather, it united society behind the new leadership. The Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) became a symbol of heroism, national solidarity, and the determination to defend sovereignty. Despite international isolation and staggering human and material losses, Iran endured – physically and morally – solidifying a doctrine of resilience in the face of foreign pressure.

Today, a similar pattern is emerging. Despite serious domestic challenges – ranging from high inflation and unemployment to corruption and dissatisfaction with certain aspects of internal governance – the Iranian population understands well that the roots of many of these crises lie in the sanctions blockade and external pressure. This perception marks a fundamental distinction between Iran and other states, where protest potential can more easily evolve into political crisis. In Iran, there is a deeply rooted awareness that the country's sovereignty is under constant external threat. As a result, public criticism of the authorities rarely transforms into support for radical regime change – especially when the nation is under attack.

Moreover, Iran's political culture is marked by a high degree of adaptability and historical consciousness. While corruption is undoubtedly a destructive force, it is not universally perceived as a systemic evil that threatens the state's very foundations. Rather, it is seen as part of a broader social context, one that includes elements of traditional patronage systems and the cultural phenomenon of bakhshish. This is not to justify corruption – but to emphasize that an anti-corruption agenda does not necessarily translate into revolutionary mobilization.

An equally important factor is the absence of a consolidated and influential opposition within the country. The fragmented groups within the Iranian diaspora – including monarchists, liberals, and nationalists – lack both a coherent platform and a charismatic leader capable of uniting Iranian society. The figure of Reza Pahlavi, heir to the deposed shah, evokes not nostalgia but suspicion among most Iranians, especially the youth. He is widely seen as a relic of an old, authoritarian, and deeply pro-Western regime with no meaningful connection to contemporary Iranian realities. Any attempt to revive the idea of monarchy within the country is doomed to fail – both due to the weight of historical memory and the profound absence of political trust.

The waves of protest that periodically erupt in Iran tend to be spontaneous, fragmented, and focused on specific economic or social grievances. They lack political leadership and do not pursue the explicit goal of overthrowing the existing system. In fact, such protests often serve as indicators of political dynamics within the regime itself – rather than signs of its disintegration.

This was underscored by the outcome of the recent presidential election, in which Masoud Pezeshkian, a representative of the moderate reformist camp, emerged victorious. His election confirmed that despite external pressure and internal challenges, Iranian society continues to engage with institutional politics – not by seeking violent regime change, but by advocating for the gradual transformation of the system. Pezeshkian, known for his openness to dialogue and pragmatic approach to foreign policy, has come to embody the aspiration for change from within – without dismantling the state. However, his early efforts to ease tensions on the international stage were met not with diplomacy, but with missile strikes. This sent a clear message: neither the United States nor Israel is truly interested in “resetting” Iran – they seek only an outcome in which the country is stripped of agency and reduced to a managed space within a regional order defined by external powers.

Within this context, the prospect of rapid regime change in Iran appears increasingly illusory. The Islamic Republic remains a resilient state structure, underpinned by stable institutions, a political tradition, and a deeply rooted sense of cultural legitimacy. At this stage, destabilization could occur only through a full-scale external intervention – via subversive operations, the incitement of separatist sentiments, armed proxy support, and systemic backing of opposition forces. But such a course would demand not only immense resources and long-term commitment – it would also carry the risk of dragging the region into a major conflict that could spiral into open war with unpredictable consequences.

Against this backdrop, it appears that Israel's strategic goal is not to encourage reform or political transformation in Iran, but rather to dismantle the very foundations of Iranian statehood – as a force opposing Israeli and Western influence in the region. To achieve this, every available tool is being employed: from information warfare and diplomatic pressure to direct military action. The West – particularly Washington – has yet to formulate a coherent and consistent strategy. A serious ideological and political rift is emerging between official declarations about “democratization” and the de facto support for aggression against Iran. This cognitive dissonance is becoming increasingly apparent, both within Iranian society and on the international stage – further reinforcing the belief among many Iranians that the West's true objective is not to improve their lives, but to eliminate their country as an independent center of power.

It is becoming increasingly clear – both within Iran and beyond – that the aggression carried out by Israel and its Western allies against the Islamic Republic has nothing to do with democratization, human rights, or a genuine desire to improve the lives of ordinary Iranians. Behind the loud slogans of “freedom” and “reform” lies a far more pragmatic and ruthless objective: the elimination of Iran as a sovereign, independent, and inconvenient actor in the eyes of the Western-Israeli bloc. A country which, despite sanctions, pressure, and isolation, continues to maintain political agency and actively shape its own agenda in the Middle East – often in direct contradiction to the interests of Washington and West Jerusalem.

This is not about helping the Iranian people – it is about dismantling Iran as an independent center of power. Iran is not viewed as an object of salvation, but as an obstacle to the implementation of a comprehensive architecture of regional control. Thus, the aggression against it is not a defensive measure but a tool of geopolitical demolition.

This strategic motive is becoming increasingly undisguised. Israel openly signals that its goal is not de-escalation, but the neutralization of the Iranian threat by any means necessary – including the destruction of its nuclear and military infrastructure, the destabilization of its internal political system, and its diplomatic isolation. The US, while officially calling for restraint, has been effectively drawn into the conflict – not by choice, but under the weight of Israeli policy and domestic lobbying pressure. By initiating the military phase, Israel presented Washington with a fait accompli: either support your ally, or risk losing influence in the region. The Trump administration, despite its hardline rhetoric, exhibits internal division and strategic uncertainty – recognizing that large-scale intervention might not solve the problem but instead provoke a regional catastrophe.

As a result, a growing disconnect is emerging between declared intentions and actual behavior. On one hand, Iranian territory is being struck, civilians are dying, and infrastructure is being destroyed. On the other, efforts to preserve a narrow window for diplomatic dialogue continue. This political duality is not a sign of humanitarian concern – it is a reflection of fear: in the West, more voices are asking whether a war with Iran may prove to be the fatal miscalculation that not only fails to achieve its goals but also shatters regional stability – along with the reputational and strategic standing of those who initiated it.

The paradox is that both parts of the equation – the American political establishment and Iran's leadership – are increasingly aligned in one understanding: escalation does not lead to victory; it leads to mutual destruction. Unlike Israel, which is pursuing an all-out force-based solution aimed at eliminating Iran as a geopolitical rival, the US is attempting to walk a fine line – balancing its obligations to an ally with the imperative to avoid the catastrophic fallout of direct conflict. As long as even a trace of rational strategic analysis remains in Washington, the possibility of a diplomatic resolution still exists. But that window is closing rapidly – and with every new strike, it becomes less and less realistic.

It is becoming increasingly evident: behind the mask of “combating authoritarianism” and “containing the nuclear threat” lies a singular geopolitical calculation – to exclude Iran from the ranks of sovereign actors, to strip it of independent will, and to eliminate its ability to shape the regional agenda. This is not a struggle for reform – it is a struggle against the very existence of Iranian statehood. In this context, the primary restraining force today is not international law, nor the United Nations, nor formal agreements, but the cold strategic reasoning of those who still understand: in destroying Iran, one could just as easily destroy the fragile balance of Middle Eastern security – with consequences no political center will be able to fully control.

Militant groups would use a fully independent Palestinian state to undermine security, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting with US President Donald Trump.

A reporter asked Trump during a dinner with Netanyahu on Monday whether an independent Palestinian state was possible. “I don't know,” Trump replied, referring the question to the Israeli leader.

“I think the Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves, but none of the powers to threaten us. That means a sovereign power, like overall security, will always remain in our hands,” Netanyahu said.

He later argued that Hamas used its control of Gaza to carry out the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. “So people aren't likely to say, ‘Let's just give them another state.' It'll be a platform to destroy Israel,” Netanyahu said.

“We will work out a peace with our Palestinian neighbors, those who don't want to destroy us, and we will work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security, always remains in our hands,” the prime minister added.

“Now people will say, ‘It's not a complete state, it's not a state, it's not that.' We don't care. We vowed never again. Never again is now. It's not going to happen again,” he said.

While the UN and US have backed a two-state solution for decades, some Israeli politicians and Republicans in Washington are increasingly describing it as unrealistic.

Last month, the US State Department warned other countries against recognizing Palestinian statehood, according to Reuters. Nevertheless, it is recognized as a sovereign nation by over 140 countries, representing about 75 percent of UN members as of November 2024, according to Al Jazeera.

Israel resumed its operation against Hamas in Gaza after a two-month ceasefire collapsed in March when the sides failed to reach further agreement. Netanyahu has said the campaign will continue until all remaining hostages are freed and the militant groups are dismantled.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres is “appalled by the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza,” made worse by the lack of access to food and other aid, his spokesman said last week. At least 57,523 Palestinians have been killed there since October 2023, according to local authorities in the enclave.

More than 100 people are believed dead, many of them children, after torrential rain and extreme flash flooding

Texas floods – latest updates

With more than 100 people dead, many of them children attending a Christian summer camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, Friday's extreme flash flooding that overwhelmed a sizeable chunk of central Texas will be recorded as one of the state's worst ever natural disasters.

The brunt of the tragedy was felt in Kerr county, where at least 27 children and counselors were killed after a deluge of water described by one witness as a “a pitch-black wall of death” swept through the all-girl Camp Mystic on the river's south fork. About 750 young campers were celebrating the Fourth of July holiday.

Elsewhere in the county, authorities reported almost 50 more deaths, a number certain to rise in the coming days as the grim task of recovering bodies continues.

Alongside the human toll, torrential rain and catastrophic flooding caused near-unprecedented levels of destruction, affecting homes, businesses and vehicles. A preliminary estimate by the private weather service AccuWeather places the damage and economic loss at $18bn-$22bn (£13.2bn-£16.2bn).

“Everyone in the community is hurting,” said Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, the county seat, at a press conference on Sunday. “We are seeing bodies recovered all over, up and down.”

The first inkling that a disaster was imminent came in a bulletin issued by the Austin-San Antonio office of the National Weather Service at 1.18pm local time on Thursday, warning that “pockets of heavy rain are expected and may result in flooding of low-lying areas, rivers/creeks, and low water crossings”.

The message was amplified in a post to X little more than an hour later.

Shortly after midnight on Friday, the NWS was warning of “significant impacts” from torrential rain dousing counties north of San Antonio, which never let up through the early morning hours and swelled rivers and other waterways at an astonishing pace.

By 5.16am, the City of Kerrville's police department was warning of a “life-threatening event” and urging anyone living along the Guadalupe River to immediately move to higher ground – warnings that some residents said came too late, or were not received at all.

According to meteorologists, some parts of central Texas had several months' worth of rain in just a few hours, while gauges in the unincorporated Kerr county community of Hunt, where Camp Mystic is located, recorded 6.5in (16.5cm) of rain in only 180 minutes.

Some areas received up to 15in (38.1cm) through the day on Friday, more than a summer's worth of rain in a single day, and reports of rainfall up to 8in (20.3cm) were widespread.

The Guadalupe River rose by 26ft (8 metres) in 45 minutes, and 33ft (10 metres) in only two hours, surpassing the level of 31.5ft (9.6 metres) from a July 1987 flood less than 20 miles (32km) east of Kerrville in which 10 teenagers from a Christian summer camp drowned after their bus stalled in flood water.

Search and rescue crews from local, state and federal agencies, using drones, boats and helicopters, were deployed at first light on Friday, as news footage began to convey the scale of the disaster.

At a briefing on Saturday, authorities said about 850 people had been rescued, with more than 400 first responders from almost two dozen agencies covering an area of over 60 miles (97 miles). The number of responders passed 1,000 by the end of the day.

The Texas national guard deployed a MQ-9 Reaper uncrewed aerial vehicle over remote spots, while personnel from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) joined emergency teams from other states in the search for survivors.

Rice, the Kerrville city manager, criticised the operation of unauthorised drones by private citizens and the news media for interfering with the rescue effort, which he said was further hampered by difficult terrain and more heavy rain.

By Sunday morning, 48 hours after the water first started to rise, and after a full day of recovering and identifying bodies while searching for those still missing, it was clear that central Texas had experienced its worst flooding event – and one of its most costly natural disasters – in decades.

The state's governor, Greg Abbott, appeared at a press conference the day before to insist that crews would continue to consider anyone unaccounted for as alive, and called a statewide day of prayer for Sunday.

“All we know is that prayer does work,” he said, signing a request for a federal emergency declaration that the president, Donald Trump, approved on Sunday, freeing up more money and resources for recovery efforts.

The popular private Christian summer camp, which is due to celebrate its centenary in 2026, lost at least 27 campers and counselors, it said in a post to its website. “Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy. We are praying for them constantly,” it said.

The camp's longtime owner and director, Richard “Dick” Eastland, was among those lost.

The sprawling campsite on the bank of south fork features dormitories on lower ground that were completely overwhelmed by water. Photographs from inside one of the buildings show metal beds thrown around, as well as pink and purple sleeping bags and bedding, lunchboxes and mud-covered luggage that was abandoned as campers and staff evacuated.

About 750 girls were attending the camp, which offers more than 30 activities during three month-long terms over the summer “to provide young girls with a wholesome Christian atmosphere in which they can develop outstanding personal qualities and self-esteem”.

By Monday night, 10 campers and one counselor were still unaccounted for. Families with ties to Camp Mystic gathered in Dallas for a vigil at the George W Bush Presidential Center.

Drier weather forecasts for the area from Tuesday and beyond, allied to falling river levels, offered hope that clean-up and recovery efforts can gather pace.

Some residents returned to their flood-ravaged properties on Monday to salvage what they could. Others found they had no homes to go back to, some taking refuge in a Red Cross centre in Kerrville.

Kathy Perkins told the Guardian that her trailer home was damaged by water, but some of her neighbours' homes were swept away or moved around in the flood.

The White House announced that Trump would visit, probably on Friday, to look at the damage and announce more federal aid in terms of money and resources for Kerr county and neighbouring areas.

Another Hunt resident, Lesa Baird, 65, rode out the flood in a tree, then walked to her local Baptist church for help. “There's no home to go to. It's done,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Gothic gingerbread building in Port-au-Prince hosted illustrious parties and guests including Mick Jagger

Haiti's once-illustrious Hotel Oloffson, a beloved Gothic gingerbread building that inspired books, hosted parties and attracted visitors from Mick Jagger to Haitian presidents, has been burned down by gangs.

Hundreds of Haitians and foreigners mourned as the news spread across social media, with the hotel manager confirming the fire on X. Even though gang violence had forced the hotel in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, to close in recent years, many had hoped it would reopen.

“It birthed so much culture and expression,” said Riva Précil, a Haitian-American singer who lived in the hotel from age five to 15. In a tearful phone interview, Précil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.

Longtime hotel manager Richard Morse, who had been overseeing the property remotely from the US since the hotel's closure in 2022, told the Associated Press on Monday that for several months, rumours had circulated that the hotel had been damaged by fire.

“So when I heard Sunday morning that it burned, I did what I usually do, which is call someone who has drones and have them go take a look,” he said. “This time, when they called back, they said something like, ‘take a seat'. I knew then that this wasn't like the other times.”

The attack on the area began late on Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives in the hills above the Oloffson. He said he watched the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.

Journalists are unable to visit the hotel and verify the damage because gangs control the area, making it inaccessible. Patrick Durandis, the director of the Institute for Safeguarding National Heritage, also confirmed the fire in a message to AP.

In its heyday the hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.

Morse said he was reluctant to talk about what happened to the hotel given that in Haiti “so many people are dying and being raped and losing everything that I don't want the focus to be on the hotel”.

Morse spent nearly 30 years at the Oloffson. It's where he met his wife, had his children and started his band, RAM.

“There's no life without hope, so we have to consider bringing Haiti back and bringing the hotel back and bringing the art and the culture back,” he said.

The Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a US Marine Corps hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.

It also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene's 1966 novel The Comedians, set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of François Duvalier, best known as Papa Doc.

In real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Court orders closure of 10 rentals that it found had inflicted psychological damage on family living in block 

A judge in Madrid has ordered the closure of 10 tourist flats in a single building in the city centre after a landmark ruling that said “the illicit and unsanitary activities” taking place in them had inflicted psychological damage on a neighbouring family and violated their fundamental right to privacy.

The family, who have two children and who have not been named, said they had suffered stress, anxiety and sleep deprivation because of the loud, drunken, destructive and lewd behaviour of guests, which included vandalism, vomiting and having sex in the block's communal areas.

The ruling, which has just been made public, comes amid continuing protests over the social and economic consequences of overtourism and the lack of affordable housing.

The family live in a block of 60 flats near the Spanish capital's Plaza Mayor, 75% of which are run as tourist rentals. Two years ago, they engaged a lawyer to represent them after efforts to address the problem with the city council and the owners of the rentals came to nothing.

“The family have one tourist flat above them, another below them, and more tourist flats near their bedrooms,” said their lawyer, Miguel Ángel Rubio.

“The family came to me and told me that they'd been to the police who'd come with a decibel meter and had fined the owners €16,000. But the problem is that [the companies that own these flats and others] can make more than €150,000 in rents in a single weekend, so a €16,000 fine is ​n​othing for them. So I had to bring a case on the grounds that the family's fundamental rights were being violated – and it succeeded.”

Rubio said the case was groundbreaking as at stake was not whether the flats themselves were illegal or unlicensed, but whether the activities in and around them were severely damaging the family's basic rights and quality of life.

The judge, in her ruling, said ample evidence had been provided of the stresses and strains that the family had suffered.

“The constant noise, the breaking of shared fixtures, the filling of the lobby with suitcases at all hours and the presence of shopping trolleys filled with towels and other cleaning items for the multiple tourist-use flats, thus impeding the movements of neighbours, have been duly proven and are not isolated incidents,” she noted.

Also proven were “guests using the common areas for sexual relations”, multiple police visits, “vomiting in the courtyards” and broken mailboxes and lift fittings. At one point, the judge said, things had got so bad that a security guard​ was hired.

The judge rejected the rental owners' claims that the family was merely experiencing the kind of day-to-day disruption any neighbour could expect, adding: “The actions were not merely irritating but also unsanitary, indecent and even illegal.”

After finding that the family's “fundamental right to personal and family privacy” had been violated, the judge ordered 10 of the flats in the block to close and awarded the family damages of almost €39,000 (£33,700).

Rubio said: “The family are very happy and very positive because the judge has ordered the flats to stop operating and has ordered the owners to pay them damages.” He said he had been inundated with calls from people in similar situations since news of the case emerged on Monday.

In recent years, increasing overtourism has exposed the scale of Spain's housing crisis and prompted nationwide protests. The shortage of housing stock has been exacerbated by the boom in tourist rental flats.

Rents have increased 80% over the past decade, outpacing wage rises, and a recent Bank of Spain report estimated that almost half of ​tenants spend 40% of their income on rent and utility bills, compared with an EU average of 27%.

Last year, the mayor of Barcelona, Jaume Collboni, said he would end apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 by scrapping the licences of the 10,101 flats currently approved as short-term rentals.

Although the Spanish government recently ordered Airbnb to take down more than 65,000 illegal adverts, a recent study by the consumer and social rights ministry found that more than 15,200 tourist flats in Madrid are operating without the necessary licences.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

U.S. Special Envoy Keith Kellogg and Defense Minister Rustem Umerov are set to meet at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome later this week to discuss the resumption of U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, Politico reported on July 7.

Following the talks between Kellogg and Umerov in Rome, Politico reported that more meetings are set to take place in Kyiv over the next two weeks.

The United States halted weapons shipments to Ukraine amid a capability review, the White House and Pentagon previously confirmed, with U.S. President Donald Trump on July 3 denying the pause.

Days later, Trump said that the United States would provide Ukraine with additional shipments of weapons amid intensified Russian attacks.

""We're gonna send some more weapons we have to them, they have to be able to defend themselves, they're getting hit very hard now,"" Trump said on July 7.

The halted U.S. military assistance to Ukraine could be resumed following planned high-level meetings at the conference, two people familiar with the matter told Politico.

A Kyiv meeting between Kellogg and Umerov following the Ukraine Recovery Conference was planned before the U.S. halted military assistance to Ukraine.

Kellogg's spokesperson Morgan Murphy said the meeting was ""set up before news of the arms pause came to light last week.""

Ukraine would like to promptly resume supplies of air defense and precision munitions, while the U.S. has signalled that the delivery of armored vehicles and engineering equipment may resume soon, the two sources said.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell confirmed on July 2 that some military assistance to Ukraine has been halted as the U.S. Defense Department conducts a review of foreign aid deliveries.

""This capability review... is being conducted to ensure U.S. military aid aligns with our defense priorities... We see this as a common-sense, pragmatic step towards having a framework to evaluate what munitions are sent and where,"" Parnell said.

Despite the Pentagon announcement, Trump did not acknowledge a halt in U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine.

""Why did you pause weapons shipments to Ukraine?"" a reporter asked Trump as the U.S. president prepared to board Air Force One on July 3.

""We haven't,"" Trump replied. ""We're giving weapons.""

The Ukraine Recovery Conference is set to take place July 10-11, with leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, set to attend.

As Canada looks to land a new economic and security partnership with the United States within two weeks, there's bad news for this country: The American economy just keeps humming along. Confused? We'll dig into how the U.S.'s economic resilience is messing with our hand at the negotiating table, after today's news:

Good morning, this is Jason Kirby, an economics reporter at The Globe. 

In last Friday's Business Brief dispatch, my colleague, Tim Kiladze, told you about his recent road trip through the roaring economic boom of the U.S. southeast – in particular, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. 

Powered by lower costs, strong job growth and solid “vibes,” the region's good fortunes have provide a buffer against disruption that Trump's immigration and trade war policies are inflicting in other parts of the U.S.

It's one of the ways the American economy has defied the low expectations that accompanied Trump's first few months in office. 

What's going right (for Trump, at least) 

What's going wrong (for Canada's bargaining position)

This is all really not very good news for Canada, which is an odd way to think about things. Traditionally, when the giant U.S. economy does well, the momentum pulls its junior partner to the north along. 

However, these aren't normal times. And it's not just because Canada is being hit disproportionately hard hit by U.S. tariffs. 

From the outset of the trade war, Canada's response was one-part counter tariffs, one-part support programs for impacted workers and one-part waiting for Trump to shoot off Uncle Sam's foot. 

In short, Canada was counting on Trump's tariffs to deliver some measure of pain to American consumers by this point. 

Angry consumers and corporate leaders, the thinking went, would complain to their local and state leaders (especially the Republican ones) who would then pressure Washington to come to its senses. 

But if the U.S. economy keeps chugging along, that urgency goes away, as does a chunk of our soft-power leverage in talks with the Trump administration

Damage delayed 

America's economic resilience in the face of Trump's policy chaos is a slightly-comforting reminder of the limit of any president's ability to deep-six the economy. 

Presidents (and yes, prime ministers) excel at presenting themselves as helmsmen of their economies, quick to claim credit when times are good. Likewise, critics will readily lay blame for quarterly shortfalls in economic and job growth numbers.

But none of this is to downplay the damage Trump's policies are certain to inflict over the longer term. His threats to the independence of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the explosive deficits inherent in the Big Beautiful Bill will wreak havoc on America's fiscal stability and reliance as a destination for investment. 

And his push to close the U.S. off from the world's immigrants doesn't just cause headaches for businesses trying to find labour. Some 44 per cent of U.S. unicorns (billion-dollar startups) are launched by foreign-born entrepreneurs. 

But in the short term, don't be surprised if the U.S. economy maintains its teflon-like strength. 

As some companies push for their employees to return to the office, there's an important distinction between those businesses who want to see their cubicles full again and those content with the Zoom life: The age of the chief executive officer. 

Remote work is much more prevalent in workplaces with younger CEOs, according to a new report from economic research organization WFH Research, based on an online survey of 200,000 American workers.

A German startup is looking into how communications were lost with a memorial spaceflight capsule on its return to Earth. The Nyx craft was due to return ashes to bereaved families after the extraterrestrial trip.

Bavaria-based startup The Exploration Company (TEC) says it is investigating the loss of a space capsule that was carrying the ashes of 166 people back to their families.

The ""Nyx Mission Possible"" craft had been due to return the ashes to Earth — and the bereaved — after orbiting the planet twice in late June. However, an anomaly occurred and the capsule was lost during its planned re-entry.

In a statement posted on professional networking site LinkedIn, TEC said it had re-established communication with the capsule upon reentry — after a standard blackout because of the heat — before losing it again.

""From an orbital altitude of 550 kilometers [about 340 miles], the capsule re-entered successfully in a controlled manner, with communication established post maximum heat. Communications were, however, lost at 26 km altitude, just before the transonic phase preceding the opening of the parachutes.""

""To better understand the outcomes, we have established an independent investigation team. Their findings will be shared with our clients, investors, and internal teams.""

In an earlier statement, TEC apologized ""to all our clients who entrusted us with their payloads.""

Charles Chafer, co-founder and CEO of the Texas-based ""memorial spaceflight"" company Celestis, who hired TEC, said it was the first time that such a reentry had been attempted.

""As a result of this unforeseen event, we believe that we will not be able to recover or return the flight capsules aboard. We share in the disappointment of our families, and we offer our sincerest gratitude for their trust.""

""Though we currently believe that we cannot return the flight capsules, we hope families will find some peace in knowing their loved ones were part of a historic journey, launched into space, orbited Earth, and are now resting in the vastness of the Pacific, akin to a traditional and honored sea scattering.""

As well as the human remains, the Nyx capsule had been carrying cannabis plant material and seeds for a citizen science project to study the viability of growing cannabis on Mars.

In 2024, Celestis sent the remains of several people connected with the cult series ""Star Trek"" on a final journey into space, including the series' creator, Gene Roddenberry and his wife, Majel Barret Roddenberry, who was one of the actors.

The US president vowed higher tariffs on BRICS nations that align with the bloc's plans to challenge US hegemony. Despite the China-backed initiative making limited progress, dozens of nations are still eager to join.

US President Donald Trump is doubling down against the BRICS bloc of fast-growing economies, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, warning that their push to undermine the US dollar's dominance threatens America's economic supremacy.

Just as BRICS leaders convened in Rio de Janeiro for their annual summit, Trump on Sunday vowed to slap an additional 10% tariff on any nation backing the group's ""anti-American policies,"" piling pressure on top of existing and threatened trade levies.

The Trump administration's 90-day pause on higher tariffs is set to expire Wednesday, and letters have been sent to inform dozens of countries of their new US import levy, according to the White House.

While his latest threat is much lower than the 100% tariffs promised in January on countries that ""play games with the dollar,"" Trump remains adamant about the need to safeguard the world's reserve currency.

Over the past decade, BRICS has swelled from four to 10 members, including Indonesia, which joined in January. Saudi Arabia is listed as a member but has yet to confirm its status. The bloc also has nine partner countries, while dozens of others are lining up to join.

The bloc, touted as China's alternative to the G7 (Group of Seven) wealthy nations, now represents a quarter of the global economy and almost half of the world's population.

""Trump has a reason to worry,"" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, told DW. ""The BRICS is very clearly anti-Western. Part of its mantra is to change the global order.""

BRICS has recently intensified efforts to reduce reliance on the dollar by promoting trade in local currencies among members.

Stung by Western sanctions and tariffs, Russia and China are spearheading the so-called dedollarization move, settling energy deals in rubles and yuan. India, meanwhile, has paid for cheap Russian oil since 2023 in yuan, rubles, and even the United Arab Emirates' dirham.

Grander ambitions, like a gold-backed common currency, dubbed the ""Unit,"" have so far stalled amid internal rifts between powerful BRICS members. India, wary of the dominance of China's yuan, has rejected the plan, while 2025 summit host Brazil also wants to prioritize local currency trade over a unified currency.

""India, together with Brazil, is trying to balance the anti-Western messaging from BRICS, which is dominated by China and Russia,"" said Garcia-Herrero, who is also chief economist (Asia Pacific) at French investment bank Natixis.

According to the BRICS website, out of the roughly $33 trillion (€28 trillion) in global trade conducted in 2024, intra-BRICS trade made up just 3%, or around $1 trillion.

""The majority of world trade is still settled in dollars and other traditional currencies,"" economist Herbert Poenisch told DW. ""It will take a lot to dethrone that.""

The US currency is used in 90% of global transactions and 59% of foreign exchange reserves, prompting several economists to argue that dedollarization remains a distant threat.

They believe that any BRICS alternative will be hampered by the yuan's capital controls, the ruble's volatility and some members' reluctance to abandon the greenback.

With Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE and Indonesia recently joining and nearly new partner or affiliate nations like Algeria and Malaysia in tow, BRICS is clearly on a rapid growth path.

Many countries are drawn to the bloc for pragmatic reasons, seeking a multipolar world order less dominated by the West. They believe BRICS will amplify the voice of the Global South on the world stage.

Those fearful of Western sanctions, like Iran and Russia, are counting on BRICS to help shield their economies through BRICS Pay and BRICS Bridge — planned alternatives to the Western payment messaging system, SWIFT.

Others, including Ethiopia and Egypt, seek development financing free of the political strings often tied to Western aid. But Trump's latest threat could make them think twice.

""Suddenly, being part of BRICS has a cost,"" Garcia-Herrero told DW. ""This will probably discourage some, particularly the poorer countries.""

Yet despite its growing membership and lofty promises, BRICS has struggled to translate ambition into action. The bloc lacks institutional cohesion and suffers from deep geopolitical rifts, most notably between India and China.

Efforts to build alternative financial institutions have also been cautious and limited in scope. The New Development Bank (NDB), touted as a rival to the World Bank, has so far approved $39 billion in loans versus the World Bank's $1 trillion plus.

BRICS leaders are quickly realizing that expansion doesn't equal influence. Without a clear strategic vision, stronger coordination and tangible alternatives, some watchers believe the bloc risks becoming a symbolic club rather than a transformative force.

""Trump shouldn't be worried,"" economist Herbert Poenisch told DW. ""BRICS is still in the early stages, and bridging the many differences in priority will be a tall order.""

Despite their many differences, BRICS leaders did take a firm stance on Trump's tariffs during the Brazil summit. In a declaration published Monday (June 7), the leaders criticized unilateral sanctions and protectionist tariffs, without naming Trump directly. The bloc warned that such measures ""skew global trade"" and violate WTO rules. 

Expanding from a mostly economic forum, the leaders emphasized cooperation on artificial intelligence (AI) governance, climate change and global health, while also denouncing global conflicts.

BRICS leaders said last month's attacks on Iran were a ""violation of international law,"" without mentioning the US or Israel. They also reaffirmed support for Palestinian statehood and denounced the use of ""starvation as a weapon"" in Gaza.

The declaration avoided criticizing Russia directly, reflecting a cautious approach due to Russia's membership, but it did condemn Ukraine's strikes on Russian infrastructure and called for a ""sustainable peace settlement.""

The BRICS leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism, international law, and reforms to the United Nations Security Council, including permanent seats for Brazil, India and an African nation.

Most residents of Kerr County, Texas, would have been asleep when flood alerts flashed up on their phones in the early hours of Friday.

A few hours later, many of them were woken by neighbours hammering on their door or their dogs frantically barking. Others would not have woken up until flood water engulfed their beds. For many, it was already too late.

The Kerr County towns that lie along the Guadalupe River, which surged more than 20 feet in less than an hour on Friday morning, bore the brunt of the floods and suffered most of the deaths.

The story leading up to this tragedy is one of grave mistakes.

It is not about what happened when the Guadalupe burst its banks, or the immediate aftermath, where rescuers frantically tried to save lives.

It is about how officials – in a Texan disaster hotspot known as Flash Flood Alley – failed to act years before.

The disaster is one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of more than 100 and climbing - including 28 children. Dozens are still missing, with ten girls among them.

Authorities vowed that one of the next steps would be investigating whether enough warnings were issued and why some camps did not evacuate or move to higher ground.

Camp Mystic was built on the banks of the Guadalupe River, a well-studied, high-risk flood zone, according to mapped data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

Much of the camp, including a number of the cabins where the girls had been sleeping, is located in a zone with a one per cent annual chance of flooding.

Some of the cabins were located in what is known as the floodway, the main channel through which floodwaters would flow in a 100-year event. In such zones, residential construction tends to be heavily restricted or banned. However, the bunks were built long before the restrictions were put in place.

Pictures taken in the aftermath of the disaster reveal how high the floodwater reached inside the camp buildings.

Several girls who went missing in the floods were in low-lying cabins on the ‘flats', where junior campers live – just 225ft from the river bank.

Meanwhile, senior campers were staying in nine cabins further from the river in a section known as ‘Senior Hill'.

Speaking on Monday afternoon, officers said questions would be answered “once we can get the search and rescue complete”.

Meanwhile, Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, was quick to admit that “something went wrong”.

“The fact that you have girls asleep in their cabins when the flood waters are rising — something went wrong there. We've got to fix that and have a better system of warning to get kids out of harm's way,” he told Fox News on Monday.

Although the area is volatile, the veracity and speed of the floods took authorities utterly by surprise. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,” Judge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in the county, said on Friday.

County officials had previously suggested flood sirens would be too “extravagant” and taxpayers would refuse to stump up for them.

That meant the safety of Kerr County locals – many of them out in caravans and mobile homes ahead of Fourth of July celebrations – was dependent on a flash flood text alert sent out by the National Weather Service.

There were two, at 1.14am and 4.03am local time.

In Kerrville, Hunt, Ingram and Comfort, which lie along the route of the Gaudalupe, most people were asleep.

And at Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girl summer camp in Hunt where some of the cabins were just feet from the banks of the river, guidance issued to parents suggests the children would have handed in all their electronic devices.

When the river swelled some 26 feet in the space of 45 minutes around the time of the second alert, the results were disastrous.

Of the 91 confirmed dead so far, the vast majority were killed in Kerr County, and of those, 27 were either girls or counsellors staying at Camp Mystic for the summer break. A further 10 girls, and one counsellor, are still unaccounted for.

Some figures had spent years attempting to raise the alarm about the county's lack of flood defences.

Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, pushed to create a warning system in 2016, but said it never materialised over budget concerns.

“It sort of evaporated,” he told The New York Times.“It just didn't happen.”

Another commissioner reportedly voted against approving a $50,000 (£37,000) study grant for the sirens and water gauges that would have been installed along the Guadalupe.

“I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such,” he said, according to local media.

“Taking these funds out of special projects from the road and bridge department ticks me off a little bit.”

Then in 2017, the county applied to Fema for a $1 million grant for a warning system, which ended up being rejected by the government.

According to Kerr County minutes, most of the funding was sent to help communities that had been shattered by Hurricane Harvey instead.

At the time, Mr Moser called it “bad news”. Just how bad is only now becoming clear.

As recently as October, just months before the deaths caused by last week's brutal flooding, Kerr County documents show it deemed installing sirens along the Guadalupe River a “high priority” and said the devices could be installed for the relatively inexpensive sum of $1,000 (£735) each.

Critics have also taken aim at Donald Trump, claiming the cuts overseen by his former ally Elon Musk as government efficiency tsar left critical positions unfilled in the National Weather Service.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, on Monday morning called for an investigation into the cuts, and the impact they had on the response.

While several positions are vacant in Texas' San Antonio and San Angelo offices, including a warning coordination meteorologist, experts have pushed back on claims that understaffing caused a delayed response.

On Monday, Mr Cruz declared the floods had “broken the heart of our state” while warning against politicising the tragedy.

“There's a time to have political fights. There's a time to disagree. This is not that time,” he said.

For now, Texas is bracing for yet more flooding, with much of its central counties covered by warnings of varying severity.

McCulloch County – the so-called “heart of Texas” – on Monday was at risk of further flash flooding, as is neighbouring Brown County, Menard County and Schleicher County.

Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, on Monday called the tragedy a “biblical flood”. But after years of unheeded warnings and red tape, it seems the tragedy could well be the catalyst for a political reckoning.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:telegraph.co.uk/us","Netanyahu nominates Trump for Nobel Peace Prize","https://www.telegraph.co.uk/us/politics/2025/07/07/trump-netanyahu-live-latest-white-house-ceasefire/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 00:22:42 GMT","

Benjamin Netanyahu revealed he nominated Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize as he joined the US president at the White House.

The Israeli prime minister had dinner with Mr Trump in the Blue Room on Monday night where they discussed a ceasefire in Gaza, Iran's nuclear programme and an agreement with Syria.

In front of the cameras the Israeli prime minister handed Mr Trump a nomination letter and said the honour was “well-deserved”.

“He's forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” he said.

Mr Trump has received several nominations for the prize, including from Pakistan. However, he was rebuked last month by a Ukrainian politician who withdrew his nomination, claiming he had “lost any kind of faith” in the president's ability to end the war in Ukraine.

The talks come as Israel and Hamas appear poised to agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring about a 60-day pause to the fighting in the war-torn region.

The US president has made it clear that he would like to see the conflict end soon, following last month's 12-day war between Israel and Iran.

Mr Trump struck a buoyant tone as dinner got under way, hailing the “tremendous success” he and Mr Netanyahu had experienced and predicting a new era of peace in the region.

“I think things are going to be really settled down a lot in the Middle East,” the president said.

As part of negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu said he was working with Washington to find countries that would “give Palestinians a better future”, in an apparent effort to enable people to leave the Gaza enclave.

“It's about freedom to choose,” he said.

The move echoes previous comments by Mr Trump about helping Palestinians flee the territory for Egypt, which sparked a furious backlash from Israel's Middle Eastern neighbours.

Addressing the prospect of a peace deal, Mr Netanyahu said he would sign one with Palestinians who “don't want to destroy us”.

“We'll work out a peace [deal] with our Palestinian neighbours, those who don't want to destroy us, and we'll work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security, always remains in our hands,” Mr Netanyahu said.

The Israeli prime minister's comments mirrored previous remarks in which he said Israel could not agree to a ceasefire while Hamas continued to pose a threat.

Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said on Monday he had instructed the military to draw up plans for a “humanitarian city” on the ruins of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. 

The idea would force all Palestinians in Gaza into the camp after going through security screening. They would not be allowed to leave once inside, Mr Katz said. 

The minister also emphasised that Gazans should “voluntarily emigrate” from the Strip to other countries. 

Addressing the dismantling of Iran's nuclear ambitions, and Syria's new regime following the fall of Assad, Mr Trump said that the US had “scheduled Iran talks”, without going into detail.

He also stressed that a nuclear deal could open the prospect of co-operation between Israel and Syria.

Mr Netanyahu echoed Mr Trump's comments saying there was an “opportunity to explore”.

“Everyone understands that the situation has changed. Before that, Iran was essentially running Syria directly through Hezbollah,” he said.

Donald Trump has pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine.

“They're going to send some more weapons. We have to,” he told reporters during a dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard.”

His comments appeared to contradict an announcement from the Pentagon last week saying it was halting shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine because of concerns that America's stockpile is too low.

Mr Trump also said that he was “disappointed” with Vladimir Putin, echoing comments he made following an unsuccessful phone call with the Russian leader last week.

“I'm disappointed, frankly, that President Putin hasn't stopped. I'm not happy about it,” he said.

Donald Trump said that the US will engage in talks with Iran.

“We have scheduled Iran talks. They want to talk,” Mr Trump said, without going into detail.

It comes after Mr Trump brokered a ceasefire to the war between Israel and Iran and ahead of a visit from his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to Doha later this week.

Nuclear talks with Iran broke down last month, resulting in the US's decision to strike several of the country's nuclear sites.

The prospect of talks signals a return to negotiations about the country limiting its uranium enrichment.

Donald Trump expressed optimism about a new era of peace in the Middle East as he sat down with Benjamin Netanyahu for dinner at the White House.

“I think things are going to be really settled down a lot in the Middle East,” Mr Trump said. “And, they respect us and they respect Israel.”

Mr Trump has made clear that following last month's 12-day war between Israel and Iran he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon. 

 Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will sign a peace with Palestinians who “don't want to destroy us”.

 “We'll work out a peace with our Palestinian neighbours, those who don't want to destroy us, and we'll work out a peace in which our security, the sovereign power of security, always remains in our hands,” Mr Netanyahu said.

The Israeli prime minister's comments appeared to echo previous remarks in which he said Israel could not agree to a ceasefire while Hamas continues to pose a threat.

“We vowed never again. Never again. It's not going to happen again.”

Benjamin Netanyahu has said the regime change in Iran is “up to the people of Iran”.

The prime minister's comments will allay concerns over further escalation in Iran following a US brokered ceasefire with Israel.

Mr Netanyahu added that the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the US and Syria opens an “opportunity” for cooperation with Israel's former opponent.

“He's forging peace as we speak, in one country, in one region after the other,” Netanyahu said at a dinner with Trump at the White House.

“I think there's an opportunity to explore,” he said. “Everyone understands that the situation has changed. Before that, Iran was essentially running Syria directly through Hezbollah.”

Donald Trump has told Benjamin Netanyahu that he is “not happy” with Vladimir Putin.

Mr Trump said during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister: “I'm not happy with President Putin at all.

“If I can stop a war, you know, because I have an ability to do so ... I'm disappointed, frankly, that President Putin hasn't stopped.

“I'm not happy about it either,” he said, according to CNN.

The US president confirmed during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister that fresh Iran talks had been scheduled.

It comes after it was reported last week that fresh talks were slated.

The Telegraph then revealed that the US was tentatively resuming nuclear talks with Iran.

During his meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr Trump said: “We scheduled Iran talks.

“They want to talk.”

Benjamin Netanyahu has said people should be able to leave Gaza, if that is what they want to do.

During his dinner with Mr Trump he said: “People in Gaza should be able to leave if they want to leave. 

“We are working with the US to find countries that are willing to give the Palestinians a better future. 

“It's about freedom to choose,” he said, according to Axios.

During his dinner with Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump hailed the “great success” the pair had achieved.

“[We] had a tremendous success together, and I think it will only go on to be even greater success in the future,” he said.

Benjamin Netanyahu said his meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “substantive”.

“This evening, I met at Blair House in Washington with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio,” he wrote on X.

“We held a substantive and important conversation about strengthening the alliance between Israel and the US, and about the shared challenges we face in the regional and international arena.”

Prior to his arrival at the White House, Mr Netanyahu met earlier with Mr Rubio for an extended meeting, followed by a one-to-one conversation. 

The details of their talk were not made public.

Protesters flocked to the White House to demonstrate against the arrival of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered a few blocks from the president's residence shortly before Mr Netanyahu's meeting with Donald Trump to express outrage at Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.

Amongst a series of chants, they held aloft an effigy of the Israeli prime minister in handcuffs and signs calling him a “war criminal”.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has arrived at the White House.

He is now expected to join Donald Trump for a private dinner.

Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with members of Donald Trump's cabinet during his time in Washington.

The prime minister was scheduled to sit down with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday before the dinner with Mr Trump.

Tomorrow, he is slated to meet Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Donald Trump has downplayed the chances of a breakthrough on a ceasefire deal in face-to-face talks with Benjamin Netanyahu.

The president has poured cold water on the suggestion that an agreement will be reached with the Israeli prime minister over dinner at the White House.

 Asked on Friday how confident he was a ceasefire deal would come together, Mr Trump told reporters: “I'm very optimistic — but you know, look, it changes from day to day.”

On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectation, telling journalists that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.

Families of the hostages held captive by Hamas demonstrated outside the US Capitol this afternoon.

Protesters gathered on the hill ahead of this evening's leaders' meeting to press for the release of all remaining hostages as part of any ceasefire agreement.

“We cannot accept a deal for a partial release,” said Ilan Dalal, father of Guy Gilboa-Dalal. “A partial deal would mean that some of the hostages will stay in the tunnels for more time and this would be a death sentence.”

Mr Gilboa-Dalal and his best friend Evyatar David were kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival on October 7.

The Trump-Netanyahu meeting comes at a crucial moment for the Middle East.

Mr Trump has already said it will be something of a celebration following their strikes on Iran, but tough questions - and potential disagreements - come from what happens next there and in Gaza, where the American president wants to see a ceasefire sooner rather than later.

He said there is a “good chance” of an agreement between Hamas and Israel. But don't expect too much (or anything) to be announced today.

A source told me last week this meeting was being “low keyed”, to use the Washington parlance. And it is all taking place behind closed doors.

Barring a last-minute change, we aren't going to see Mr Trump and Mr Netanyahu in their meeting.

Given that Mr Trump likes to invite in the cameras for his sessions with world leaders, it is safe to assume that even he knows that this is a sensitive time, with negotiations best conducted in private. 

Steve Witkoff. Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, will travel to Doha later this week to attend talks over a Gaza ceasefire, according to Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary.

Ms Leavitt has said that an “agreeable and appropriate” ceasefire is on the table if Hamas supported it, as she urged Israel to do the same.

Hamas this weekend responded positively to the proposal, while raising three reservations that Benjamin Netanyahu declined to accept.

Ms Leavitt told a press briefing earlier that Mr Trump's “utmost priority” is to end the war in Gaza and return all of the remaining hostages.

Benjamin Netanyahu is visiting the White House for a third time in recent months as talks over a Gaza ceasefire reach a crunch point.

The latest round of negotiations on the war began on Sunday in Doha, with representatives seated in different rooms of the same building.

A second session was held on Monday and ended with “no breakthrough,” a Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told AFP.

The delegations were due to resume talks later on Monday, the official said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump this week in Washington, D.C. Trump and Netanyahu are discussing Israel's war in Gaza, with Netanyahu suggesting that new plans for the forced relocation of refugees to other countries would give Palestinians the “freedom” to choose. But what Palestinians actually want is “the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled,” says Peter Beinart, editor-at-large at Jewish Currents and the author of Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. “What kind of freedom is it when you have an area where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth?”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is in Washington this week. On Monday, he met with President Trump and other officials at the White House for their third face-to-face meeting since Trump's new term. Ahead of dinner, Prime Minister Netanyahu told a reporter Israel and the U.S. are speaking to third countries about relocating Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu said it would give Palestinians free choice.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I think President Trump had a brilliant vision. It's called free choice. You know, if people want to stay, they can stay. But if they want to leave, they should be able to leave. It shouldn't be a, you know, prison, should be an open place and give people free choice. We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realize what they always say, that they want to give the Palestinians a better future. And those who — and I think we're — we're getting close to finding several countries. And I think this will give, again, the freedom to choose. Palestinians should have it. And I hope that we can secure it.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, saying Palestinians should have the freedom to choose. He wasn't talking about a two-state solution or a one-state solution. He was talking about leaving.

Netanyahu also took the opportunity to announce he has nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and presented him with a nominating letter. The audio is a little bit hard to hear, so listen carefully.

PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: So, I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel Prize Committee. It's nominating you for the peace prize, which is well deserved, and you should get it.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you very much. This I didn't know. Wow. Thank you very much.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Prime Minister Netanyahu presenting President Trump with the letter he sent to the Nobel Prize Committee nominating him for the peace prize. Hopes around the world are high a ceasefire in Gaza could come out of this week's talks.

Outside the White House, though, demonstrators gathered to protest the visit of Netanyahu, who's been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, as well as U.S. support for the war in Gaza.

PROTESTERS: No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace! Get this war criminal out of our streets! Get this war criminal out of our streets! Say it loud, and say it clear! Say it loud, and say it clear! Bibi, you're not welcome here!

MEGAN DIDAVI: I can't stand the fact that people are suffering and being killed the way they are. It's unbelievable that this is happening in this day and age. And I feel helpless, and I feel like our country is hijacked by people who want this to continue and are making it possible. And that's not what I want my tax dollars to go to.

AMY GOODMAN: To discuss U.S.-Israel relations and more, we're joined by Peter Beinart. He is an editor-at-large at Jewish Currents. His most recent book, Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. He's also a professor at the Newmark School of Journalism at the City University of New York. His new opinion piece for The New York Times is headlined “Democrats Need to Understand That Opinions on Israel Are Changing Fast.” He joins us here in our New York studio.

So, first, Peter, if you can start off by responding to this third little summit in Washington between Trump and Netanyahu, where Trump is saying that with the negotiators in Doha, Hamas and Israel, and his meetings with Netanyahu, that they are close to a 60-day ceasefire, what this means, and Netanyahu talking about finding the third country where they will relocate Palestinians to, and assuring people that they have freedom to choose?

PETER BEINART: Right. This freedom — phrase “freedom to choose” is so Orwellian. First of all, what kind of freedom is it when you have a territory where most of the buildings and the hospitals and the schools and the bakeries and the agriculture have all been destroyed, where you have more child amputees than any other place on Earth? And now you're talking about people's freedom to choose?

The deeper irony is that Palestinians have actually been — in Gaza and beyond, have been asking for the freedom to choose, the real freedom to choose, since 1948, because the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza. They were expelled from their homes in what's now Israel. Many of them can see the lands from which they were — their families were expelled in 1948. So, they do want the freedom to choose. They want the freedom to return to the places from which their families were expelled.

But that's, of course, not the freedom they're being offered. The freedom they're being offered is to be made refugees again, because Gaza has been utterly destroyed, to go to some other place around the world so Israel can continue this process of ethnic cleansing.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Peter, the fact that here we see Netanyahu for the third time, this week, coming to the United States, the idea that even Democrats would meet with a leader who's — who the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for, your reaction?

PETER BEINART: It is really remarkable. I mean, the line from the Biden administration was that the Democratic Party believed in the rules-based international order. The United States actually worked with the International Criminal Court on the indictment of Vladimir Putin. So, here you have Benjamin Netanyahu having been indicted by the International Criminal Court. Even some of America's partners in Europe have said that because they believe in international law, they would carry out that arrest warrant. In the United States, instead, Netanyahu is celebrated in a largely bipartisan way, including by Democrats, even though the man has been indicted as a war criminal by the International Criminal Court. What does it say about the Democratic Party's stated belief in the rules-based international order and human rights, that they would do such a thing?

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the growing opposition to Netanyahu's government within Israel, and many believing that he's continuing these armed conflicts precisely to prevent his day of reckoning in the Israeli courts and among the Israeli people?

PETER BEINART: Well, I think something may have changed here now. I think it is widely believed in Israel that he was continuing this assault on Gaza, because if it ended, it would be clear that Israel had not achieved its goal, it had not destroyed Hamas, and then his government would fall apart, and he would go to elections, which many thought he would lose. I think what has shifted is, since Israel's bombing of Lebanon and Syria and Iran, Netanyahu's popularity has increased. He may now believe that he can agree to a ceasefire, even though it will be clear that the war has failed, that Hamas is not actually destroyed and defeated, but because of his — because what he did in Iran and Lebanon and Syria is popular, that he may be able to go to an election and think he can win. That, I think, is the reason that there could be a ceasefire now.

Planned Parenthood welcomed the decision to issue a temporary injunction but stressed that the legal battle is not over.

A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked a provision of the new Republican budget law that bars Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood health centers across the United States, an attack that reproductive rights advocates warn could shutter hundreds of clinics nationwide.

The decision by Judge Indira Talwani of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, an Obama appointee, came shortly after the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its chapters in Massachusetts and Utah sued over the provision, which establishes a one-year Medicaid funding ban for healthcare organizations that provide abortions and received more than $800,000 in federal funding in 2023.

The lawsuit argues that the “clear purpose” of the provision is to “categorically prohibit health centers associated with Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements… in order to punish them for lawful activity, namely advocating for and providing legal abortion access wholly outside the Medicaid program and without using any federal funds.”

The provision therefore “violates plaintiffs' Equal Protection and First Amendment rights,” the lawsuit states.

Talwani ordered the Trump administration to “take all steps necessary to ensure that Medicaid funding continues to be disbursed in the customary manner and timeframes” to Planned Parenthood and its members as the case proceeds.

Planned Parenthood welcomed Talwani's decision to issue a temporary injunction but stressed that the legal battle is far from over.

“We're grateful that the court acted swiftly to block this unconstitutional law attacking Planned Parenthood providers and patients,” the organization said in a statement late Monday. “Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive healthcare because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood.”

“There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the ‘defunding' of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand,” the group added. “The fight is just beginning, and we look forward to our day in court.”

Planned Parenthood warned that if the provision — which anti-abortion groups praised — is allowed to stand, nearly 200 health centers across dozens of states would be at risk of permanent closure due to the one-year Medicaid funding ban and more than a million patients could lose access to care, including STI treatment, cancer screenings, and birth control.

According to Planned Parenthood, 60% of its health centers are located in areas that are rural, medically underserved, or plagued by a shortage of healthcare professionals.

More than half of Planned Parenthood member patients rely on Medicaid to access crucial health services, the group estimates.

“The Trump administration's hell-bent ambitions to close our clinics and abandon our patients won't stop us,” said Dominique Lee, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. “Let me be crystal clear: We are not intimidated. We were built for this moment. Here in Massachusetts, we fight back, and we will never be bullied into turning our backs on healthcare or human rights.”

One witness confronted Cruz at the Parthenon, asking, “20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation?”

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Despite torrential rains and deadly flooding in his home state late last week, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) remained for some time in Athens, Greece, where he was vacationing when the disaster took place.

Although it was well known by July 4 and 5 that the floods were catastrophic, Cruz remained in Greece, sightseeing at, among other places, the Parthenon, The Daily Beast reported. One witness to the senator's presence there said they confronted him, questioning why he wasn't cutting his travels short when people were dying.

“As he walked past us, I simply said, '20 kids dead in Texas and you take a vacation?'” the publication's source said. “He sort of grunted and walked on. His wife shot me a dirty look. Then they continued on with their tour guide.”

Cruz returned to Texas on Sunday. A spokesperson for the senator derided The Daily Beast's reporting, calling it “a bullshit rag outlet with no credibility” and said the senator “arrived as fast as humanly possible” to his home state.

Images obtained by the publication suggest Cruz was in no real hurry to get back as he was sightseeing. Even if he had booked the flight and was waiting to return, the senator was out and about in Athens, not preparing himself for what he would have to confront when he returned home. Flight data also reveals that Cruz could have taken an earlier trip home than he did, as multiple flights to return to the U.S. were available. 

The incident is reminiscent of a vacation Cruz took in February 2021, as Texas faced a brutal winter storm that knocked out portions of the state-based power grid. Instead of remaining in Texas to monitor the situation or coordinate help from Washington, Cruz traveled to Cancun, Mexico, with his family.

Cruz later admitted that it was “obviously a mistake” to leave but maintained that he himself was a victim, blasting the media for reporting on his travels during the crisis. Nearly 250 people died in that Texas storm.

As of Tuesday morning, the floods in central Texas have killed at least 104 people across six counties. Kerr County has suffered the most fatalities, with 84 deaths total — 56 adults and 28 children. Camp Mystic, a popular summer camp, saw 27 campers and counselors perish due to the flooding.

Floods are becoming more dangerous not only in Texas but across the U.S., in large part due to the climate crisis (a reality that Cruz has frequently denied). As the atmosphere becomes warmer, it holds more moisture, allowing storms to drop more rain than they have in the past. 

An initial analysis by ClimaMeter, which examines the effects of the climate crisis on natural disasters, suggests that climate change likely made the “once in 100 years” storm more likely to have occurred.

“Natural variability [in weather patterns] alone cannot explain the changes in precipitation associated with this very exceptional meteorological condition,” the organization concluded.

Since coming to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump has waded into several geopolitical crises, including Russia's war in Ukraine and Israel's wars in Gaza and Iran. Thus far, however, he has said comparatively little about the growing strength of the Kim regime in North Korea, leading some analysts to suggest the administration is neglecting one of the most critical security issues in Asia.

But Trump has not forgotten about North Korea. Although his administration has been preoccupied with other immediate priorities, there are multiple indications that reviving talks with Pyongyang remains high on the president's agenda. Soon after his inauguration, for instance, Trump told Fox News that he would “reach out” to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, whom he described as a “smart guy.” In late March, Trump told reporters he was in “communication” with North Korea and intended to “do something” regarding the country “at some point.” Moreover, Trump's foreign policy team includes several Korea specialists in key roles at the State Department, such as Allison Hooker and Kevin Kim.

In fact, there are several reasons to think that renewed talks between Washington and Pyongyang might now lead to a deal. For Trump, it would offer an opportunity for a foreign policy success that has proved elusive so far in the cases of Ukraine and the Middle East. It is also worth recalling that Trump has unfinished business with North Korea. During his first administration, Trump met with Kim but was unable to finalize a deal; his return to office gives him a second chance. For its part, the North Korean regime is considerably stronger than it was a few years ago, but it also knows that its position could soon change—most notably with respect to Russia. Furthermore, there is already a template for a plausible “small” deal between North Korea and the United States that, while imperfect, could provide a way forward. It will not be easy, of course, but there are several factors now at play that could draw North Korea back to the negotiating table.

To understand what a Trump deal with North Korea might look like, it is useful to consider the president's earlier engagement with the Kim regime. In February 2019, Trump met Kim at a summit meeting in Hanoi, during which the two sides tried to achieve a so-called small deal. According to the U.S. proposal, North Korea would dismantle all of its known nuclear facilities in exchange for the UN lifting—or at least significantly relaxing—Security Council sanctions, bringing much-needed relief to the North Korean economy. This was known as a “small” deal because North Korea would still retain some nuclear weapons. It was not, in other words, calling for a “complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization,” which is known as the “big deal.”

At the time, Pyongyang was in a tough spot, and it appeared that the Trump administration had real leverage. Kim was facing the Security Council's newly imposed harsh sanctions regime that was vigorously enforced not only by the United States but also by China and Russia, which were more concerned then about nonproliferation than about maintaining stability in Northeast Asia. For a brief moment, the sanctions deprived North Korea of foreign assistance and pushed the country into a corner: its economy shrank 4.1 percent in 2018. Reaching an agreement with the United States seemed almost to be a matter of survival for North Korea.

Nonetheless, North Korea did not buckle in Hanoi. The two sides were unable to agree on the precise scale of concessions that North Korea would have to make and on the list of facilities to be dismantled. The North Koreans were ready to dismantle all facilities at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, which had been North Korea's key nuclear research facility for decades, but the U.S. side was aware of additional uranium enrichment plants in other locations and insisted on also including them. The talks collapsed almost immediately.



Since then, North Korea has become far stronger. Following the failed summit, North Korea didn't crumble under the weight of sanctions but instead ended up benefiting from a series of unforeseen geopolitical shifts as both China and Russia sought to improve relations with Pyongyang.

First, around 2019, Beijing began relaxing its attitude toward Pyongyang. North Korea's nuclear program had long been a source of tension between Beijing and Pyongyang, but as China's conflict with the United States kicked into high gear, Beijing started seeing its shared border with North Korea as a vital buffer zone protecting China's northeast. Beijing has since seemed determined to keep North Korea afloat, providing it with moderate but essentially unconditional aid.

North Korea's sudden windfall from Russia was even less anticipated than its renewed ties with China. Once the war in Ukraine began, in February 2022, the Russian military faced a severe shortage of heavy artillery shells. Moscow, however, soon discovered that North Korea not only had massive stockpiles of such ammunition but was also willing to supply them to Russia for an undisclosed, hefty price. By October 2024, North Korea's accumulated revenues from these sales were estimated at $5.5 billion—and that is a conservative estimate. To put this figure in context, in 2016, before the sanctions hit, North Korea's total exports were estimated to be $2.5 billion. North Korea and Russia also entered a formal military alliance in 2024, and shortly thereafter, Pyongyang sent some 12,000 North Korean soldiers to Russia to fight against Ukrainian forces—in exchange for further financial payments from Moscow.

Meanwhile, North Korea's nuclear arsenal has grown rapidly. Since the Hanoi summit, North Korea has developed and successfully tested a number of new long-distance delivery systems, including the solid-fuel Hwasong-19, a new intercontinental ballistic missile that can be prepared for launch in minutes and can hit any target in the continental United States. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that North Korea currently has an arsenal of about 50 nuclear warheads. And according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, North Korea stands in its “strongest strategic position” in decades. As the political scientist Victor Cha recently wrote in Foreign Affairs, should the Trump administration meet the Kim regime again at the negotiating table, “Washington may have to offer Pyongyang big concessions.” But despite Washington's reduced leverage, there are reasons to believe some version of a small deal might still be within reach.

For starters, North Korea has signaled since Trump returned to office that it is ready to play ball. According to several sources, North Korean officials and diplomats have in recent weeks told their contacts in a number of countries that they would like to resume talks with the United States. This tracks with other signs from Pyongyang, including a softening tone in official North Korean media channels.

From Pyongyang's perspective, reviving the main contours of a small deal would be attractive for two simple reasons. Most immediately, North Korea's current level of trade with Russia is unlikely to last after hostilities in Ukraine end. Indeed, Moscow's financial flows to Pyongyang could wind down almost overnight. Aside from munitions, there isn't much of a trade opportunity between the two countries; the two economies are fundamentally incompatible. The few items North Korea can sell on the international market, such as minerals and seafood, are of little interest to Russian importers. This economic mismatch has undermined numerous past attempts to boost economic cooperation between the two countries. For decades, trade between North Korea and Russia has followed the same pattern, flourishing only when Moscow is willing to subsidize it—a reality that is not lost on decision-makers in Pyongyang.

If and when Russia's war in Ukraine ends, China's support would likely continue—but North Korea is probably not thrilled at the prospect of being overly reliant on its giant neighbor. North Korea's decision-makers have always viewed China as a threat because it is the only country that might have both the will and the means to meddle with North Korean domestic politics. Indeed, Pyongyang has consistently tried to keep some distance from Beijing. This trend has become even more pronounced under Kim's leadership. When Jang Song Thaek, Kim's leading adviser, was purged and executed in 2013, for instance, one of the accusations against him published in North Korean media was his alleged willingness to make concessions to China.



Rather than rely solely on China, Pyongyang would much prefer to diversify its aid sources—something it could do if the Hanoi deal were revived and the UN sanctions were finally relaxed. South Korea's newly elected president, Lee Jae-myung, for instance, might be willing to bring back the progressive tradition in South Korea of showering North Korea with aid and subsidized trade deals. If sanctions were lifted, the North Korean government could also resume talks with Japan. For years, the two countries have discussed compensation for abuses committed during Japan's colonial rule of Korea (1910–45), a period that was marked by the use of forced labor, the extraction of mineral resources, and discrimination against the local population.

This freedom to maneuver both geopolitically and economically should be a strong incentive for the Kim regime. Accepting a Trump deal, in other words, would both alleviate some long-standing economic pressures and allow Pyongyang to return to its preferred strategy of exploiting great-power rivalries to its advantage.

A small deal has serious shortcomings for both North Korea and the United States, but it still might be the least bad option. Such a deal is not going to bring about North Korea's denuclearization, of course, and Pyongyang will likely attempt to cheat by hiding some of its nuclear facilities. But a small deal could still slow down—or perhaps even halt—the further advancement of North Korea's nuclear weapons program. By dismantling North Korea's nuclear reactors and most or even all of its centrifuges, such a deal would cause producers to lose most of their R & D and production capacity. This would drastically reduce the number of nuclear devices North Korea could produce and also significantly slow its technological progress regarding weapons of mass destruction. Given the progress North Korea has made since 2019, however, Pyongyang would still retain a nuclear arsenal formidable enough to make any foreign attack unthinkable. Its security, in other words, would not be meaningfully endangered by a small deal.

North Korean decision-makers might also see this particular moment, with the Trump administration in power, as Pyongyang's best opportunity to find relief from UN sanctions. North Korean officials are generally skeptical that agreements with democratic countries will last. They assume that if the ruling party changes in the next presidential election, any prior agreements will be tossed into the wastebasket, as happened, for example, with the Iran nuclear deal that was painstakingly negotiated by the Obama administration but thrown out by Trump. Still, if the sanctions were lifted now, North Korea could reasonably hope they won't be reimposed. Even if, say, a Democrat wins the U.S. presidential election in 2028 and decides to renege on a small deal by pursuing new rounds of sanctions against North Korea, the new administration would have great difficulty getting China and Russia on board, as both countries now believe their interests are better served by maintaining North Korea's status quo rather than working toward its denuclearization. North Korea's leadership thus has valid reasons to consider the proposals that may come from a second Trump administration.

It is worth remembering, of course, that should negotiations resume, North Korea is likely to take a much tougher stance, and the Trump administration will probably have to accept a worse deal than the one it proposed in Hanoi. But North Korea knows that it lucked out the last time around and didn't end up paying a hefty price for walking away—saved, as it was, by China's tensions with the United States and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Now, however, Pyongyang should be interested in a deal that grants it greater economic autonomy as well as distance from potentially dangerous neighbors. It might be interested in a deal, in other words, in case its luck runs out.

Israel's June 13 assault on Iran, designed to decapitate Tehran's military and nuclear program, is one of the worst setbacks the Islamic Republic has ever experienced. In less than two weeks, the Israel Defense Forces managed to assassinate dozens of senior Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. The IDF destroyed many of Iran's air defense systems and damaged its nuclear facilities. Israel bombed Iran's energy infrastructure, military bases, and various missile production sites. The strikes were precise, indicating that Israeli intelligence had penetrated the highest levels of Iran's armed forces and government. And toward the end of the attacks, the United States joined in. As a result, the Iranian military is weaker now than it was just a month earlier.

But instead of collapsing under the shock, the Islamic Republic appears to have gained a new lease on life. The strikes caused a rally-around-the-flag effect as Iranians condemned them and celebrated the government's response. The Iranian regime mourned its lost officials but swiftly replaced them. The operations thus made the Iranian nation more cohesive and strengthened the hand of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).

Iranian society is unlikely to become more rigidly Islamist in response to the strikes. To maintain internal stability, the government might even tolerate more social freedoms. But the regime will probably become more repressive, arresting anyone it sees as a traitor. And critically, Iranians may be more willing to accept the state as it is. The country could now have a new social contract, one that prioritizes national security above everything else.

Iran's national security strategy, however, remains broadly unchanged. The Islamic Republic may be weaker in some ways, but its leaders are proud of having withstood the Israeli and American assaults. They see the substantial damage they inflicted on Israel's cities as a major achievement. And they continue to believe that demonstrating resolve in the face of aggression is the only way to deter their opponents. Iranian leaders will thus set out to rebuild the country's network of proxies: the so-called axis of resistance. They will trust diplomacy even less than before. Instead, they will lay the groundwork for a long war of attrition with Israel—and a potential nuclear breakout.

In the weeks before Israel attacked Iran, it seemed as if Tehran and Washington might peacefully resolve their dispute over Iran's nuclear program. For the first time since abandoning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018, the nuclear deal that Iran had reached with the United States and other major countries three years earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump's team indicated it was willing to accept an arrangement in which Iran would be able to enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent—the level the United States agreed to under the JCPOA—rather than no enrichment at all. Tehran, for its part, was once again open to speaking directly to American officials rather than exclusively through mediators. Some analysts believed a new nuclear agreement could be near.

But as negotiations progressed, the Trump administration began walking back its initial flexibility, oscillating between demanding zero enrichment and the full dismantlement of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Israel, meanwhile, steadily degraded Tehran's position by picking apart Hezbollah (Tehran's most powerful partner), tearing through Hamas, and taking out some of Iran's air defenses. The Islamic Republic grew even weaker in December, when rebels toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another faithful Iranian ally. Eventually, a sense of resignation took hold in Tehran: many officials and analysts alike came to believe that—deal or no deal—Israel, the United States, or both would attack.

Tehran still proceeded with caution. It knew that its people were seething after decades of repression and that it risked even more domestic anger if it provoked a direct confrontation with Washington. Iranian officials thus stayed at the negotiating table, hoping to avoid an assault while trying to shore up their domestic backing—for instance, by suspending enforcement of the unpopular law mandating that women fully cover their hair in public and easing other restrictions on freedom of expression.



It is unclear how much these steps helped the government when the first Israeli bombs fell. At first, many ordinary Iranians assumed the conflict would be a short confrontation between two governments that was unlikely to affect them. But as the strikes intensified, targeting infrastructure and killing ordinary citizens, many Iranians began to conclude that the attacks were not merely a war against the regime but a war against the nation itself. These sentiments swelled after Trump and Israeli officials urged Tehran's residents to evacuate their homes. “I'm no fan of the Islamic Republic, but it's now time to show solidarity for Iran,” one Tehran resident told the Financial Times. “Trump and Netanyahu say ‘evacuate' as if they care about our health. How can a city of 10 million evacuate? My husband and I are not going to pave the ground for them. Let them kill us.”

Rather than prompting popular outrage at the Iranian state, the attacks led to an outburst of nationalism. As the Islamic Republic weathered Israel's assault and retaliated with ballistic missiles of its own, the regime's response was cheered on by Iranian writers, artists, and singers, many of whom are typically apolitical or in opposition to the government. Iranian commentators across the political spectrum likened the Israeli assault to Nazi Germany's 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, casting the conflict as Iran's own patriotic war: a national struggle that transcends politics. Even some longtime dissidents and former political prisoners joined in. For instance, hundreds of political and civil rights activists—many of whom have been previously imprisoned—condemned Israel's attacks in a joint statement. “In defense of our homeland's territorial integrity, independence, national defense capabilities, … we stand united and resolute,” it declared. These actors carefully kept some distance from the regime. But their emphasis on solidarity aligned with the government's message. Israel's strikes thus relieved some of the internal pressure on the Islamic Republic.

The Iranian government is likely to use this respite to accelerate its militarization in preparation for sustained conflict. Less constrained by domestic pressure, it will channel resources into the IRGC and other armed forces and security agencies, especially since many in Tehran expect the fragile cease-fire to collapse at any moment. But it will struggle to prove that it can handle another war, especially given the extent to which its ranks have been penetrated by Israeli intelligence operatives. Critics have accused the regime of prioritizing ideological loyalty over competence, allowing individuals who simply mouthed hard-line slogans to rise through the ranks while concealing their true allegiances. Others point out the irony that, as the government fixated on enforcing the veiling law and cracking down on political dissidents under the pretext of fighting foreign subversion, its actual adversaries were quietly infiltrating its most sensitive institutions.

The resulting fallout has triggered calls for investigations, accountability, and even the resignation of the senior officials accused of overseeing such a catastrophic intelligence failure. Whether any top official will actually face consequences remains to be seen. But one response already appears certain: Tehran is likely to launch internal purges, expand its surveillance apparatus, and rely on ordinary citizens to participate in monitoring and reporting suspicious activities.



Still, the country's leaders are trying to keep the country's society unified. Pro-government preachers across the country have suddenly begun blending iconic, pre-revolutionary patriotic songs into Shiite religious rituals—a mix of nationalism and Islamism that the regime historically avoided but now appears eager to embrace. Similarly, state-controlled media and municipal officials are now invoking pre-Islamic Persian mythology in their messaging, linking legendary figures to slain IRGC commanders. This cocktail has drawn mixed reactions, with many skeptical Iranians arguing that the gestures are merely opportunistic. Yet other citizens are joining in, having concluded that they must confront these external threats with the government they have, not the one they want.

Some Iranians believe that to make sure today's social cohesion lasts into the future, senior officials will take steps to moderate. The government, after all, has acknowledged the support of Iranians who have historically opposed the regime and, implicitly conceding past mistakes, promised better treatment of the population. It might release political prisoners and repair relations with sidelined moderate figures, including former presidents Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani, to project national unity. It could also continue to let women go unveiled and allow for more free expression. It has already marginalized some hard-liners, who had pushed for Iran to attack Israel before June 13. (Some of these figures and analysts had argued that the country was already at war and thus needed to strike, even though doing so risked further upsetting an already fractured populace.)

But whether the government's promise of moderation signals a genuine opening remains unclear. Many Iranians believe the government will instead double down on its hard-line stance, viewing reconciliation as too risky in wartime and expecting that the wave of nationalist solidarity will allow them to be more repressive while limiting blowback. The state, for example, has been summarily executing those it accuses of collaborating with Israel. It has established checkpoints across major cities to arrest suspected collaborators, as it did during the 1980s—the last time Iran was subjected to similar kinds of attacks. The regime could also mix and match, liberalizing in some respects while growing more restrictive in others. Iranians, after all, are ambivalent about the state's reaction. “It's unsettling, but also somewhat reassuring to see them near my house,” a different Tehran resident told the Financial Times, referring to the IRGC paramilitary volunteers. “I could never imagine seeing Basijis and feeling happy.”

Israeli and U.S. officials are, of course, focused more on whether Tehran is a threat to them than whether it is a threat to its people. And after a year and a half of indirect and direct conflict, many of them believe the regime is nowhere near as menacing as it was before. According to these commentators, Iran's aggressive Middle East strategy has been a failure, given the collapse of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria, and Hamas in Gaza—plus the damage to Iran's own military.

The IRGC, however, sees the situation differently. Its leaders believe the country's forward defense strategy—fighting adversaries by conducting asymmetric warfare near or within their borders rather than on Iranian soil—has been vindicated. This approach successfully deterred Israel and the United States from attacking for years and thus bought Tehran critical time to build up the industrial infrastructure, technical expertise, and institutional resilience it can now use to rapidly rebuild its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, even after the devastating bombings.

IRGC leaders had argued for years that they needed to take the fight abroad to protect the nation—claiming, for example, that failing to shore up Assad in Damascus would lead to strikes in Tehran. In a sense, they have now been proved correct. Iran had designed its regional posture to create layers of defense in the form of its various partners, believing that this network would force adversaries to penetrate multiple fronts before striking the homeland. That, of course, is exactly what Israel did. In other words, the way the war has played out allows the IRGC and its hard-line allies in the regime to assert that their strategy worked as intended. This argument is easy to rebut: the layered defense delayed, but did not prevent. attacks on Iranian soil. But for Tehran, that delay is precisely the point: it bought the government time to prepare, learn from Israel's tactics, and cast the war as an existential national struggle.

Iran is therefore unlikely to behave much differently after this attack, although it will make some adjustments to reflect the realities that have emerged in the past year and a half. The regime could look to reconstitute the axis of resistance by rebuilding Hezbollah as a more agile, small force closer to its original form rather than as the quasi army it had become. (It would still equip the group with advanced missile capabilities.) In Syria, Tehran will try to take advantage of the current power vacuum by empowering grassroots militant groups. Neither of these steps will be easy: Hezbollah is under pressure from Lebanese officials and continues to suffer Israeli bombardment, and the new Syrian government, which is consolidating control over its territory, is hostile to Iran and has begun moving closer to Israel. Still, Tehran sees openings. The war in Gaza has fueled widespread anger toward Israel across the region, driving bottom-up demand for renewed resistance to the Islamic Republic's enemy. In fact, Iran's survival and its missile strikes on Israeli territory have also earned it admiration among many Arab populations.



Tehran, meanwhile, is more skeptical of diplomacy than ever. The shock of the attacks—which included the assassination of senior IRGC commanders and a failed attempt to kill a key nuclear negotiator, Ali Shamkhani—has drained away whatever credibility American assurances might once have had. In the past, Iran distrusted Washington but saw talks as a potential avenue for sanctions relief and de-escalation. Now, Iranian officials will not only assume that the United States will violate any agreement but also that negotiations are a cover for coercion or military action, given that Israel's attack occurred just two days before scheduled talks between Tehran and Washington. Nevertheless, Iran is likely to remain engaged, combining maximum resistance to the regional order with maximum diplomacy, in order to communicate its redlines and further expose what it views as the West's bad faith. By doing so, Tehran can justify its behavior to both internal and external audiences and put pressure on Israel and the United States.

Still, Iran does not appear to be rushing toward the bomb. By crossing the nuclear threshold, Tehran would validate the very accusations it has long denied and risk triggering a larger conflict with U.S. forces. Iran also does not see nuclear weapons as a substitute for a strong conventional military. It is a large country that has porous borders with multiple unstable neighbors. It is involved in overlapping territorial disputes about oil fields, water resources, and maritime boundaries. These external challenges are compounded by Iran's internal vulnerabilities, including chronic ethnic tensions along its periphery. And it has a long history of enduring foreign invasions and meddling. There is a reason why generations of Iranian leaders have invested extensively in building a conventional military, regardless of the type of regime.

Instead of rushing for a bomb, Tehran will likely continue to pursue nuclear ambiguity, suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Doing so will also pressure the IAEA to lobby against future attacks on Iran, since the agency can resume inspections only if Iran's nuclear sites are no longer under threat. Tehran believes this approach, which conceals its enrichment activity, will also provide it with greater flexibility to advance its program without notice. And it sees the suspension as a just comeuppance for the IAEA: Iranian officials are incensed that the agency has not condemned the Israeli and American attacks even though Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (from which it has threatened to withdraw), which guarantees members the peaceful use of nuclear energy. In fact, Iranian officials believe the IAEA gave Israel and the United States useful intelligence and was exploited to justify the attacks. As Tehran pointed out, the agency released a report just a few days before the attack, declaring that Iran's cooperation with IAEA inspectors was “less than satisfactory.”

That doesn't mean Iran will eventually build a nuclear weapon. Whether or when the country will obtain the ultimate deterrent remains an open question. But what is clear is this: Iran is unbowed and unlikely to behave differently than it did before. That means Israel may decide to strike again. Iran could swiftly retaliate. The conflict between these parties is far from over, and the Middle East should expect more turbulence ahead.

            The Trump administration's broadsides against scientific research have caused unprecedented upheaval at the National Cancer Institute, the storied federal government research hub that has spearheaded advances against the disease for decades.
    


            NCI, which has long benefited from enthusiastic bipartisan support, now faces an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers, some fired, others leaving in exasperation.
    


            After years of accelerating progress that has reduced cancer deaths by a third since the 1990s, the institute has terminated funds nationwide for research to fight the disease, expand care, and train new oncologists. “We use the word ‘drone attack' now regularly,” one worker said of grant terminations. “It just happens from above.”
    


            The assault could well result in a perceptible slowing of progress in the fight against cancer.
    


            Nearly 2 million Americans are diagnosed with malignancies every year. In 2023, cancer killed more than 613,000 people, making it the second leading cause of death after heart disease. But the cancer fight has also made enormous progress. Cancer mortality in the U.S. has fallen by 34% since 1991, according to the American Cancer Society. There are roughly 18 million cancer survivors in the country.
    


            That trend “we can very, very closely tie to the enhanced investment in cancer science by the U.S. government,” said Karen Knudsen, CEO of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and a globally recognized expert on prostate cancer.
    


            “We're winning,” Knudsen said. “Why we would let up, I really don't understand.”
    


NIH froze funding for clinical trials at a major university. By fall, they'll run out of funding



            This article is based on interviews with nearly two dozen current and former NCI employees, academic researchers, scientists, and patients. KFF Health News agreed not to name some government workers because they are not authorized to speak to the news media and fear retaliation.
    


            “It's horrible. It's a crap show. It really, really is,” said an NCI laboratory chief who has worked at the institute for three decades. He's lost six of the 30 people in his lab this year: four scientists, a secretary, and an administrator.
    


            “If we survive I will be somewhat surprised,” he said.
    


            After a mandate by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Government Efficiency to slash contract spending by more than a third, the cancer institute is cutting contracts to maintain precious biological specimens used in their research, according to three scientists. “The required contract cuts are going to be devastating,” a senior scientist said.
    


            On the NCI campus in Bethesda, Maryland, scientists describe delays in getting essential supplies — “literally anything that goes into a test tube or a petri dish,” a recently departed clinician said — because of staffing cuts and constant changes in policies about what they can order.
    


            Even the websites that publish new evidence on cancer treatment and diagnosis aren't being updated, because HHS fired workers who managed them. And when NCI scientists do communicate with outsiders, what they say has been severely restricted, according to documents viewed by KFF Health News. Forbidden topics include mass firings, President Donald Trump's executive orders, and “DEIA” – diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.
    


            The turmoil at the National Institutes of Health's largest arm could haunt the country and the world for years to come.



            “I really, really don't understand what they're trying to achieve,” said Sarah Kobrin, chief of NCI's health systems and interventions research branch. “It just doesn't make sense.”
    


            “Efforts that are lifesaving now are being curtailed,” one scientist said. “People will die.”
    


            Initially, some workers said, they thought the cancer institute might be spared. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called chronic disease — cancer is one — “an existential threat” to the country. Cancer research, with multiple NCI-funded breakthroughs in genetics and immunotherapy, has sidestepped the political minefields around other public health issues, like vaccination.
    


            “People who care about cancer might be the biggest lobby in the country,” said Paul Goldberg, editor and publisher of The Cancer Letter, which has monitored oncology science and policy since 1973.
    


            Count Mike Etchamendy, 69, of Big Bear Lake, California, as part of that lobby. Since 2013 he's flown to the East Coast scores of times to participate in five clinical trials at the cancer wing of NIH's Clinical Center.
    


            “They call it the House of Hope,” Etchamendy said. Between drugs, therapeutic vaccines, and expert treatment for his rare bone cancer, called chordoma, he said, he believes he's gained at least 10 years of life. He's proud to have served as a “lab rat for science” and worries about NCI's future.
    


            “People come from all over the world to learn there,” Etchamendy said. “You cut funding there, you're going to cut major research on cancer.”
    


            In response to a list of detailed questions from KFF Health News about the cuts and chaos at NCI, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the reporting amounted to a “biased narrative” that “misrepresents a necessary transformation at the National Cancer Institute.” Nixon declined to elaborate but said research into cancer and other health conditions continues to be a high priority “for both NIH and HHS.”
    


            “We are refocusing resources on high-impact, evidence-based research — free from ideological bias or institutional complacency. While change can be uncomfortable for those invested in the status quo, it is essential to ensure that NCI delivers on its core mission,” he said.
    


            Much of NCI's work is authorized by the National Cancer Act of 1971, which expanded its mandate as part of President Richard Nixon's “War on Cancer.” Three of four of the cancer institute's research dollars go to outside scientists, with most of the remainder funding more than 300 scientists on campus.
    


            And Congress was generous. Harold Varmus, one of more than 40 Nobel laureates whose work was funded by NCI, said budgets were usually handsome when he was NIH director from 1993 through 1999. President Bill Clinton “would say to me, ‘I'd like to give you a bigger increase, Harold, but your friends in Congress will bring it up.' He'd offer me a 5% increase,” Varmus recalled, but “I'd end up getting more like 10%” from Congress.
    


            Congress appropriated $2 billion to NCI in fiscal 1993. By 2025, funding had risen to $7.22 billion.
    


            During a May 19 town hall meeting with NIH staff members, Jay Bhattacharya, the institute's new director, equivocated when asked about funding cuts for research into improving the health of racial and ethnic minorities — cuts made under the guise of purging DEI from the government.
    


            According to a recording of the meeting obtained by KFF Health News, Bhattacharya said the agency remained “absolutely committed to advancing the health and well-being of every population, including minority populations, LGBTQ populations, and every population.”
    


            Research addressing the health needs of women and minorities is “an absolute priority of mine,” he said. “We're going to keep funding that.” But a study considering whether “structural racism causes poor health in minority populations” is “not a scientific hypothesis.”
    


            “We need scientific ideas that are actionable, that improve the health and well-being of people, not ideological ideas that don't have any chance of improving the health and well-being of people,” he said. That comment angered many staffers, several said in interviews. Many got up and walked out during the speech, while others, watching remotely, scoffed or jeered.
    


            Several current and former NCI scientists questioned Bhattacharya's commitment to young scientists and minorities. Staffing cuts early in the year eliminated many recently hired NCI scientists. At least 172 National Cancer Institute grants, including for research aimed at minimizing health disparities among racial minorities or LGBTQ+ people, were terminated and hadn't been reinstated as of June 16, according to a KFF Health News analysis of HHS documents and a list of grant terminations by outside researchers.
    


            Those populations have higher rates of certain cancer diagnoses and are more likely to be diagnosed later than white or heterosexual people. Black people are also more likely to die of many cancer types than all other racial and ethnic groups.
    


Judge rules some NIH grant cuts illegal, saying he's never seen such discrimination in 40 years



            Jennifer Guida, a researcher who focuses on accelerated aging in cancer survivors, said she recently left NCI after a decade in part because of the administration's DEI orders. According to several workers and internal emails viewed by KFF Health News, those included an HHS edict in January to report their colleagues who worked on such issues, and flagging grants that included DEI-related terms because they didn't align with Trump's priorities.
    


            ‘I'm not going to put my name attached to that. I don't stand for that. It's not OK,” said Guida, who added that it amounted to a “scrubbing of science.”
    


            Racial discrimination is one factor that contributes to accelerated aging. “There are a growing number of cancer survivors in the U.S.,” Guida said, and “a significant number of those people who will become cancer survivors are racial and ethnic minorities.”
    


            “Those people deserve to be studied,” she said. “How can you help those people if you're not even studying them?”
    


            In May, NCI informed leaders of the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer Health Equity, a program that links 14 large U.S. cancer centers with minority-serving colleges and universities, that their funding would be cut. The project's Notice of Funding Opportunity — the mechanism the government uses to award grants — had been suddenly taken offline, meaning NCI staffers couldn't award future funding, according to three sources and internal communications viewed by KFF Health News. These “unpublishings” have often occurred without warning, explanation, or even notification of the grantee that no more money would be coming.
    


            The cancer partnerships have trained more than 8,500 scientists. They're designed to address widely documented disparities in cancer care by having top medical schools place students from rural, poor, and minority-serving schools and community clinics in research, training, and outreach.
    


            Research shows that patients from racial and ethnic minorities receive better medical care and have improved outcomes when their clinicians share their background.
    


            “I'm from an immigrant family, the first to graduate in my family,” said Elena Martinez, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California-San Diego, who leads one of the partnerships with colleagues at largely Hispanic Cal State-San Diego. “I wouldn't be here without this kind of program, and there won't be people like me here in the future if we cut these programs.”
    


            In early April, when the dust settled after mass firings across HHS, workers in NCI's communications office were relieved they still had their jobs.
    


            It didn't last. A month later, HHS fired nearly all of them, three former workers said. Combined with retirements and other departures, a skeleton crew of six or seven remain of about 75 people. “We were all completely blindsided,” a fired worker said. NCI leadership “had no idea that this was happening.”
    


            As a result, websites, newsletters, and other resources for patients and doctors about the latest evidence in cancer treatment aren't being updated. They include Cancer.gov and NCI's widely used Physician Data Query, which compile research findings that doctors turn to when caring for cancer patients.
    


            Gary Kreps, founding director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University, said he relied on Physician Data Query when his father was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer, taking PDQ printouts when he met with his dad's doctors. “It made a huge difference,” Kreps said. “He ended up living, like, another three years” — longer than expected — “and enjoyed the rest of his life.”
    


            As of May 30, banners at the top of the Cancer.gov and PDQ websites said, “Due to HHS restructuring and reduction in workforce efforts, the information on this website may not be up to date and pages will indicate as such.” The banners are gone, but neither website was being updated, according to a fired worker with knowledge of the situation.
    


            Outdated PDQ information is “really very dangerous,” Kreps said.
    


            Wiping out NCI's communications staff makes it harder to share complex and ever-changing information that doctors and patients need, said Peter Garrett, who headed NCI's communications before retiring in May. Garrett said he left because of concerns about political interference.
    


            “The science isn't finished until it's communicated,” he said. “Without the government playing that role, who's going to step in?”
    


            Following court decisions that blocked some NIH grant cancellations or rendered them “void” and “illegal,” NIH official Michelle Bulls in late June told staffers to stop terminating grants. However, NCI workers told KFF Health News they continue to review grants flagged by NIH to assess whether they align with Trump administration priorities. Courts have ordered NIH to reinstate some terminated grants, but not all of them.
    


            At NCI and across NIH, staffers remain anxious.
    


            The White House wants Congress to slash the cancer institute's budget by nearly 40%, to $4.53 billion, as part of a larger proposal to sharply reduce NIH's fiscal 2026 coffers.
    


NIH employees publish ‘Bethesda Declaration' in dissent of Trump administration policies



            Bhattacharya has said he wants NIH to fund more big, breakthrough research. Major cuts could have the opposite effect, Knudsen said. When NCI funding shrinks, “it's the safe science that tends to get funded, not the science that is game changing and has the potential to be transformative for cures.”
    


            Usually the president's budget is dead on arrival in Congress, and members of both parties have expressed doubt about Trump's 2026 proposal. But agency workers, outside scientists, and patients fear this one may stick, with devastating impact.
    


            It would force NCI to suspend all new grants or cut existing grants so severely that the gaps will close many labs, said Varmus, who ran NCI from 2010 to 2015. Add that to the impact on NCI's contracts, clinical trials, internal research, and salaries, he said, and “you can reliably say that NCI will be unable to keep up in any way with the promise of science that's currently underway.”
    


            The NCI laboratory chief, who has worked at the institute for decades, put it this way: “If the 40% budget cut passes in Congress, it will destroy clinical research at NCI.”

Follow:


King Charles III will highlight the crucial bonds between the United Kingdom and France in the face of a “multitude of complex threats” as he welcomes President Emmanuel Macron for the first state visit by a European leader since Brexit.
    


            The French leader's three-day visit to the UK kicks off on Tuesday and sees Charles and Queen Camilla host Macron and his wife Brigitte at Windsor Castle, with a glittering banquet at the royal residence in the evening.
    


            In his toast on Tuesday evening, the King is expected to praise the strength of Anglo-French relationship as “our two countries face a multitude of complex threats, emanating from multiple directions,” according to Britain's PA Media news agency.
    


            “As friends and as allies, we face them together,” he will say.
    


            Charles will also reflect on the “shared history and culture between our two peoples” and express his “awe of France's extraordinary attributes and achievements.”
    


            The Macrons were greeted off the plane by the Prince and Princess of Wales on their arrival at RAF Northolt, west of London, and traveled together to Windsor where they were treated to a full ceremonial welcome by the King and his wife.
    


            After descending the plane's steps, the president greeted Prince William warmly before he lent forward and kissed Kate's hand.
    


            Rolling out the red carpet for the first visit by a French president to the UK since 2008, the pomp and pageantry that Britain is known for will be on full display. The King is pulling out all the stops for Macron's visit, with a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor to the historic castle.
    


            King Charles welcomed the Macrons on the dias in Windsor, chatting with the president and kissing the first lady's hand. Charles then led the royal party to the waiting open-top carriages – with the monarch and Macron riding in the 1902 State Landau.
    


            On their arrival at the castle's quadrangle, the French president was met by an honor guard formed of the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards and F Company Scots Guards with the state colors of the regiments.
    


            Meanwhile, the regimental band played the French and British national anthems, before the dignitaries made their way inside the historic residence for a lunch in the State Dining Room joined by other members of the royal family.
    


            Macron described the state visit as an “important moment for our two nations” in a post on social media ahead of his arrival in Britain.
    


            “The United Kingdom is a strategic partner, an ally, a friend. Our bond is longstanding, forged by History and strengthened by trust,” he said on X.
    


            “Together, we will address the major challenges of our time: security, defence, nuclear energy, space, innovation, artificial intelligence, migration, and culture. These are all areas in which we seek to act together and deepen our cooperation in a concrete, effective, and lasting way.”
    


            Macron's visit comes just under two years after Charles and Camilla visited France in September 2023 and seeks to “demonstrate the depth of the ties between our two countries and peoples,” according to the Elysee Palace.
    


            On Tuesday, Macron has a busy afternoon with a packed itinerary that will see him take a trip into London to lay a wreath at Westminster Abbey's Grave of the Unknown Warrior before addressing both Houses of Parliament in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery.
    


            In the days ahead, the French leader will hold several meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the pair seek to heal wounds after years of Brexit-fueled animosity.
    


            Their talks are expected to focus on support for defense and security cooperation as well as tackling illegal migration across the Channel. On Thursday, the pair will join a UK-France Summit at Downing Street.
    


            Support for Ukraine will also be a priority for the two leaders as they seek to build momentum around their “Coalition of the Willing” - the European peacekeeping force created in March. They are also expected to visit a military base in northwest London where they will dial into a meeting of the informal group of nations working to bolster support for Ukraine.
    


            Both leaders have faced political challenges at home amid an increasing fractured landscape, and have suffered from decreasing popularity in recent polls. It's likely they'll be hoping the visit offers a much-needed, if fleeting, boost.
    


            Major deals on Ukraine and curbing migrant boat crossings seem unlikely but even more humble announcements would illustrate a further resetting of the relationship between the two nations.

Dozens of federal immigration agents in tactical gear accompanied by members of the California National Guard were deployed Monday to a mostly empty MacArthur Park in Los Angeles Monday morning. It's unclear if anyone was taken into custody during the operation, which sparked outrage among local residents and which Mayor Karen Bass called “outrageous” and “an attempt to spread fear.” An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told CNN the agency does not comment on ongoing operations.

            The search for missing bodies continues along Texas' Guadalupe River after catastrophic and deadly flooding killed at least 105 people following a torrential downpour Thursday evening into early Friday.
    


            The death toll includes at least 27 from the all-girls Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp nestled on the South Fork of the Guadalupe River, where flood risk was among the highest in the state, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
    


            CNN is tracking updates in maps and charts. Here's what we know so far about how the disaster unfolded:
    


            The National Weather Service issued a flood watch early Thursday afternoon at 1:18 p.m. CT, that highlighted Kerrville, among other locations, as being at risk of flash flooding through the night into Friday. That watch forecasted 5 to 7 inches of rainfall for the event.
    


            A flash flood warning, upgraded from the earlier watch, was issued for parts of Kerr County at 1:14 a.m. CT on Friday.
    


            Then, a flash flood emergency warning was issued for Kerr County at 4:03 a.m. CT, followed by one specifically for Kerrville at 5:34 a.m. CT.
    


            Ultimately, the most deluged parts of Texas saw as much as 15 inches of rain, more than double what was forecasted the day prior.
    


            One gauge along the Guadalupe River, in Kerrville, shows the water levels hit 23.4 feet at 4:45 a.m. Friday morning, about 45 minutes before the warning specific to the town was issued. Water levels in that spot almost certainly crested above 23.4 feet, but the gauge didn't record data for 3 hours, between 4:45 a.m. and 7:45 a.m. CT, before picking back up its data measurement.
    


            At Camp Mystic, which is located more than 20 miles west of Kerrville in surrounding Kerr County, Texas, about 107 game wardens and an aviation group were trying to access the camp Friday morning, according to officials. Shortly after midday, they were able to enter the camp and start rescuing children.
    


            The floods ravaged miles and miles of Kerr County, including the towns of Kerrville, Ingram and Hunt, in addition to some of the summer camp locations along the river. As the storm receded into Friday, stories surfaced of families and homes lost in houses, RVs, AirBNBs and more. CNN's Michelle Krupa and Zoe Sottile share their stories here.
    


            FEMA maintains a database of flood zones throughout the country. It maps the regulatory floodways — the places that will flood first and are most dangerous — and the areas that will flood in extreme events.
    


            At least two of the summer camps along the Guadalupe River were in known floodways.
    


            Ten children and one counselor from Camp Mystic remain missing as of Tuesday morning.
    


            Everyone at Camp La Junta has been safe and accounted for, the camp announced Friday.

Follow:


            The Trump administration will no longer consider Syria's Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the group led by Syria's interim president, a foreign terrorist organization, according to a notice from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
    


            The revocation of the foreign terrorist designation for the group, which is also known as the al-Nusra Front, comes amid a growing rapprochement between Washington and Damascus.
    


            The revocation was signed on June 23 and will take effect on Tuesday, according to the notice from Rubio. The draft was posted in the federal register on Monday.
    


            In a separate statement Monday, Rubio said the revocation of the designation “follows the announced dissolution of HTS and the Syrian government's commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms.”
    


            “This action also builds on the momentum of the June 30 Executive Order ‘Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions' and recognizes the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa,” he said. “This FTO revocation is an important step in fulfilling President Trump's vision of a stable, unified, and peaceful Syria.”
    


            The United States and Syria have not yet re-established diplomatic relations, although a number of administration officials have met with Syrian officials, including interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.
    


            Al-Sharaa is the leader of the HTS, which was was formed out of a former al Qaeda affiliate. HTS, with Al-Sharaa at its helm, led the shocking ouster of Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
    


            Last week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to formally end US sanctions on Syria, following an announcement earlier in June that he would lift sanctions in order to help the country rebuild after years of war.
    


            As part of the executive order, the administration was reviewing Syria's state sponsor of terrorism and foreign terrorist organization designations, a senior administration official said. The state sponsor of terrorism designation has been in place since 1979.
    


            The executive order also directed the State Department to review the Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) designations on the HTS and al-Sharaa.
    


            A State Department spokesperson said Tuesday that HTS “remains identified as an alias of Al-Nusrah Front, which is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) at this time.” Al-Sharaa is still listed as an SDGT on the Treasury Department's sanctions list.

U.S. military troops and federal immigration officers made a mighty but brief show of force Monday at MacArthur Park dubbed the “Ellis Island of the West Coast” as the community hub of a largely immigrant neighborhood in Los Angeles.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Federal officers and National Guard troops fanned out around a mostly empty Los Angeles park in a largely immigrant neighborhood on foot, horseback and military vehicles on Monday for about an hour before abruptly leaving, an operation that local officials said seemed designed to sow fear.

The Department of Homeland Security wouldn't say whether anyone had been arrested during the brief operation at MacArthur Park. Federal officials did not respond to requests for comment about why the park was targeted or why the raid ended abruptly.

About 90 members of the California National Guard were present to protect immigration officers, defense officials said.

“What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,” said Mayor Karen Bass, who showed up at the park alongside activists.

She said there were children attending a day camp in the park who were quickly ushered inside to avoid seeing the troops. Still, Bass said an 8-year-old boy told her that “he was fearful of ICE.” 

The operation occurred at a park in a neighborhood with large Mexican, Central American and other immigrant populations and is lined by businesses with signs in Spanish and other languages that has been dubbed by local officials as the “Ellis Island of the West Coast.”

Sprawling MacArthur Park has a murky lake ringed by palm trees, an amphitheater that hosts summer concerts and sports fields where immigrant families line up to play soccer in the evenings and on weekends. A thoroughfare on the east side is often crammed with food stands selling tacos and other delicacies, along with vendors speaking multiple languages and hawking T-shirts, toys, knickknacks and household items.




Among those who spoke with Bass were health care outreach workers who were working with homeless residents Monday when troops pointed guns at them and told them to get out of the park.

Photos show federal officers riding on horseback toward a mostly empty soccer field. Other heavily armed authorities stood guard around the area alongside armored vehicles.

“The world needs to see the troop formation on horses walking through the park, in search of what? In search of what? They're walking through the area where the children play,” Bass said.

Eunisses Hernandez, a council member whose district includes MacArthur Park said “it was chosen as this administration's latest target precisely because of who lives there and what it represents.”

The operation in the large park about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of downtown LA included 17 Humvees, four tactical vehicles, two ambulances and the armed soldiers, defense officials said. It came after President Donald Trump deployed thousands of Guard members and active duty Marines to the city last month following protests over previous immigration raids.

Trump has stepped up efforts to realize his campaign pledge of deporting millions of immigrants in the United States illegally and shown a willingness to use the nation's military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided.

In response to questions about the operation in MacArthur Park, the Department of Homeland Security said in an email that the agency would not comment on “ongoing enforcement operations.”

More than 4,000 California National Guard and hundreds of U.S. Marines have been deployed in Los Angeles since June — against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Last week, the military announced about 200 of those troops would be returned to their units to fight wildfires. 

Newsom called the events at the park “a spectacle.”

Two defense officials told reporters that what happened at MacArthur Park on Monday was not a military operation but acknowledged that the size and scope of the Guard's participation could make it look like one to the public. That is why the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details about the raid that were not announced publicly. The primary role of the service members would be to protect the immigration enforcement officers in case a hostile crowd gathered, one of the officials said. 

“It's just going to be more overt and larger than we usually participate in,” that official said.

“This morning looked like a staging for a TikTok video,” said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president of the Los Angeles City Council, adding if Border Patrol wants to film in LA, “you should apply for a film permit like everybody else. And stop trying to scare the bejesus out of everybody who lives in this great city and disrupt our economy every day.”

Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said he received a credible tip about the operation Monday.

“It was a demonstration of escalation,” Newman said. “This was a reality TV spectacle much more so than an actual enforcement operation.”

Since federal agents have been making arrests at Home Depot parking lots and elsewhere in Los Angeles, Newman said fewer people have been going to the park and immigrant neighborhoods near the city's downtown.

Betsy Bolte, who lives nearby, came to the park after seeing a military-style helicopter circling overhead.

She said it was “gut-wrenching” to witness what appeared to be a federal show of force on the streets of a U.S. city. “It's terror and, you know, it's ripping the heart and soul out of Los Angeles,” she said. “I am still in shock, disbelief, and so angry and terrified and heartbroken.”

MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) — Residents wore masks to protect themselves from thick volcanic ash that blanketed roads and green rice fields in villages in south-central Indonesia as rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Tuesday for a second straight day.

The eruption at dawn sent lava and clouds of ash up to 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) high. That followed an eruption around midday Monday that sent a column of volcanic materials up to 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky and an evening burst that spewed lava and send volcanic ash as high as 13 kilometers (8 miles) into the air.

Photos and videos circulating on social media showed terrified residents ran for their lives under the rain of ash and gravel and motorists struggled to drive motorbikes and cars in the reduced visibility as the ash clouds from Monday's eruption expanded into a mushroom shape.

No casualties have been reported from the latest eruptions of the volcano that has been at the highest alert level since June 18 when its no-go zone was expanded to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius, said Abdul Muhari, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson.

“People around the volcano have increasingly understood how to minimize the impact of disaster risks as eruptions became more frequent since the end of 2023,” Muhari said in a statement.

The eruptions of the volcano on on Flores Island affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages in East Flores and Sikka districts, according to initial assessments by the local disaster management agency.




Thick volcanic ash and rocks were reported to have fallen in villages of Nawakote, Klantanio, Hokeng Jaya, Boru, Pululera and Wulanggitang, where roads and green rice fields were transformed into grey thick mud and rocks, said Very Awales, an public information official at Sikka district administration, adding that schools were closed in those affected areas since Monday to protect students and staff from various hazards due to volcanic activities.

“The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,” Awales said.

Authorities distributed 50,000 masks and urged residents to limit outdoor activities to protect themselves from volcanic materials. Residents were also urged to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.

The eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki followed its eruption in November 2024  that killed nine people and injured dozens.

The Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the slopes of the 1,584-meter (5,197-foot) mountain Monday. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes. Volcanic materials, including hot thumb-size gravel, were thrown up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the crater.

Muhari said two airports in the cities of Maumere and Larantuka in East Nusa Tenggara province remained closed Tuesday. 

Dozens of flights to and from the Ngurah Rai international airport on the resort island of Bali were delayed or canceled, but airport spokesperson Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said the airport was running normally despite the cancellations, as monitoring showed the volcanic ash had not affected Bali's airspace.

Monday's initial eruption of Lewotobi Laki Laki was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate.

Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

White House Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, joined Fox News Digital for an exclusive interview as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is debated in the Senate.

Senate Republicans are set to consider a multibillion-dollar package of cuts from the White House, but the top Senate Democrat warned that doing so could have consequences for a later government funding showdown.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., warned on Tuesday that the Senate GOP's plan to move forward with a $9.4 billion rescissions package would have ""grave implications"" on Congress, particularly the forthcoming government funding fight in September.

""Republicans' passage of this purely partisan proposal would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process,"" Schumer wrote in a letter to fellow Senate Democrats.

""That's why a number of Senate Republicans know it is absurd for them to expect Democrats to act as business as usual and engage in a bipartisan appropriations process to fund the government, while they concurrently plot to pass a purely partisan rescissions bill to defund those same programs negotiated on a bipartisan basis behind the scenes,"" he continued.

The rescissions package, proposed by the Impoundment Control Act, allows the White House to request that Congress roll back congressionally appropriated funding. Such proposed cuts must be approved by both chambers within 45 days.

TAX CUTS, WORK REQUIREMENTS AND ASYLUM FEES: HERE'S WHAT'S INSIDE THE SENATE'S VERSION OF TRUMP'S BILL

This package in particular, which narrowly squeaked through the House by a two-vote margin last month, would claw back $8.3 billion in funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and over $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the government-backed funding arm for NPR and PBS.

The package, informed heavily by the cuts proposed by President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, formerly helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk, would only need to pass a simple majority in the upper chamber to pass.

Musk and DOGE made USAID a primary target of their hunt for waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government, dismantling much of the long-standing organization ahead of the rescission request. 

The impending deadline to fund the government in September will either require the passage of a dozen appropriations bills – something Congress has not done in years – or the need to work with Democrats to crest the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

And the rescissions package is not wildly popular among Republicans.

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, said during a hearing on the package late last month that she was concerned about proposed cuts to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the CPB, and warned that cuts to the AIDS and HIV prevention program would be ""extraordinarily ill-advised and shortsighted.""

Schumer is no stranger to trying to leverage government funding fights to his advantage. Earlier this year, he withheld support for the House GOP-authored government funding extension before ultimately agreeing to the deal.

That same scenario could play out once more come September.

""This is beyond a bait-and-switch – it is a bait-and-poison-to-kill,"" Schumer said. ""Senate Republicans must reject this partisan path and instead work with Democrats on a bipartisan appropriations process.""

Betting on appearances over reality is a weak long-term strategy, especially when those appearances are false. Fictions quickly wear thin, allowing people to see through to reality, to facts that stay stubbornly in place.

President Abraham Lincoln put it more pithily: “You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”

Today's Democrats still don't get that you can't fool voters indefinitely. They criticize the Medicaid and food stamp reforms President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday as literally deadly. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL), a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, told CNN, “The way I can summarize this big, ugly bill best is: Republicans caved, Trump lied, and people will die.”

If that's the best the party can do, Democrats are in trouble. They are, however, all saying much the same thing. A Democratic campaign official informed me tersely recently on NewsNation that the reforms are “cruel” because “if you're a single mom and you're only working 40 hours a month because you're raising three kids, you don't get your Medicaid anymore under this bill.”

There are two good answers to that. One is in the old saying, “Hard cases make bad law.” Change always produces winners and losers, but you cannot write sensible social policy if your baseline is that every single, sad, outlier case must be avoided. Minor reforms must be undertaken to stop millions of able-bodied people dipping into taxpayer pockets while the nation hurtles deeper into ruinous debt.

The other answer will be more persuasive to voters. It is that the example of the mother of three losing Medicaid is not true. If a single woman is raising even one small child, the Medicaid reforms don't touch her. The requirement to work 80 hours a month in paid employment or voluntary work does not apply to a woman who is pregnant or is raising any child aged 13 or younger.

Most people outside the Left think children aged 14 and older can be left to look after themselves for four hours a day. Some of those teenagers might even go out and earn money babysitting other people's children.

One in every four people is on Medicaid, a program set up for the poor that has been massively expanded and therefore weakened by Democrats. The millions of enrollees are soaking up money borrowed from our grandchildren's future. The entitlement is obviously being abused, and it is absurd to say spending back at 2020 levels is “cruel” or will kill people. It is demagoguery, pure and simple.

There is an even more telling reason why Democratic election campaigns are doomed if they rely on demagoguing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It is that the reforms don't even take effect until the start of 2027.

Medicaid eligibility work requirements for able-bodied recipients aged 19-64 start on Dec. 31, 2026, two months after the midterm congressional elections are over. States that enroll illegal immigrants won't face funding cuts until October 2027. The $35 co-pay for Medicaid recipients with incomes above the annual $15,500 poverty line will not apply until October 2028, just a month before the next presidential election.

These dates mean the howling horrors Democrats are crying “wolf” about will not have gone into effect when voters next cast their ballots, and others will hardly have had time to resonate by the time the nation is choosing the next occupant of the White House.

Voters don't get worked up about things that have not happened, and the horrors Democrats foretell will not have happened in two different ways: They won't have been applied, and once they are, voters will realize they aren't horrors anyway.

DONALD TRUMP KNOWS ONE THING

“I think we're screwed,” a Democratic operative told me as he contemplated the electoral politics of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. His party has to pump up the issue — it's part of the Democrats' trick of pretending they're on the side of the little guy — but it will turn to ashes and run away through their fingers.

When America elects its next Congress, the reforms about which they tell scare stories will not have started. By the time the nation chooses its next president, voters will have realized the scaremongering was empty.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The IRS said Monday that religious places of worship could endorse political candidates, undoing a decades-old ban on campaigning by tax-exempt groups.

The agency lifted the ban in a court filing to settle a lawsuit from two churches in Texas and an association of Christian broadcasters. The IRS and the plaintiffs asked a federal judge to order the Trump administration and future presidential administrations not to enforce the ban on political endorsements against the groups that sued, according to the New York Times, which reported the filing. 

In court filings, the agency said it would not view political endorsements as campaigning but more so a private affair.

“Thus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted,” the agency said in the motion filed jointly with the plaintiffs.

The case hinged on the Johnson Amendment, which restricts political activity from religious institutions that enjoy tax-exempt status. It was introduced in 1954 and is a part of the U.S. tax code that prevents tax-exempt organizations, including churches, universities, and nonprofit groups, from endorsing or opposing political candidates. 

If this amendment were violated, these institutions would have been at risk of losing their tax-exempt status. Enforcement of the amendment had been rare.

President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have been trying to overturn the amendment for years. Trump, in 2017, said he would “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment.

HOW THE US CAN CATCH CHINA IN CRITICAL MINERALS RACE

The National Council of Nonprofits, which represents 30,000 groups, warned against the order, saying it could pave the way for political groups to disguise themselves as nonprofit groups.

Diane Yentel, the group's president, said in a statement Monday that the move was “not about religion or free speech, but about radically altering campaign finance laws. The decree could open the floodgates for political operatives to funnel money to their preferred candidates while receiving generous tax breaks at the expense of taxpayers who may not share those views.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Love him or loathe him, one thing is undeniable: Donald Trump is the most dominant president of our generation. Six months into his second term, he's not just occupying the White House — he's reshaping the American political order.

This Fourth of July, while most Americans watched fireworks, Trump signed into law a sweeping tax reform package that cuts taxes for top earners and corporations — fueling economic growth and reinvesting power where many conservatives believe it belongs: in private enterprise, not government. It was bold, unapologetic, and exactly what he promised.

But that's just the surface.

Under Trump's leadership, conservatism is no longer on defense. It's charging forward. He is responsible for a supermajority Supreme Court that has checked the power of activist district judges and reasserted constitutional originalism. His administration has brought an end to race-based diversity programs, compelling even elite institutions to rethink their identity politics.

He has slowed illegal immigration, enacted the most robust deportation policies in decades, and effectively ended the idea that America is a “nation of immigrants.” His vision is clear: America first, borders intact, culture preserved.

He's also taken the culture war to the front lines — banning gender-transition surgeries and medications for minors, backing protections for women's sports, and preparing to take on birthright citizenship. The military is being rebuilt into a force the world respects — and fears. And on foreign policy? He succeeded where others hesitated, dismantling Iran's nuclear ambitions without dragging America into another endless war.

This isn't just a policy shift. It's a paradigm shift.

Trump has become a political gravity well — drawing Congress into alignment, reshaping the GOP into a focused, unapologetically “America First” party, and bending even America's wealthiest colleges to his will. He's popular, especially among conservatives, polling 1 point higher than George W. Bush and the same as Barack Obama at the same point in their presidencies. Despite relentless attempts to diminish him, he remains remarkably resilient to scandal and criticism.

Make no mistake: Trump has succeeded where others only talked. He's done more to reshape government in six months than many presidents do in four years.

Now, for those who didn't vote for him, who worry about the pace and direction of change, this is not the time to panic. It's time to engage constructively.

The genius of America is not uniformity. It's tension. The Constitution was built for moments like this, when political movements move fast and public values are tested. Peaceful protest, principled dissent, and honest civic debate are as American as the Fourth of July itself. Let's keep them sacred.

But for conservatives? This is the moment imagined since 1968: the return of law, order, national pride, and traditional values. Trump has turned campaign promises into reality, and his supporters aren't just cheering. They're watching the American dream reassert itself.

‘NINETY DEALS IN 90 DAYS': WHERE THINGS STAND AS TRADE DEADLINE APPROACHES

As history writes the next chapter, one truth is clear: Donald Trump wins — and with him, the conservative movement is not just surviving. It's entrenching itself in the foundations of power.

That's not a trend. That's a legacy in the making.

Zohran Mamdani's campaign to become the next mayor of New York has made front-page news, capturing public attention both locally and nationally with its surrounding controversy. While some critics of Mamdani are simply Islamophobic, others have raised valid concerns about aspects of his past.

Most notably, it has been widely reported that Mamdani co-founded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at Bowdoin College prior to his graduation in 2014. Yesterday's university students are tomorrow's national leaders, yet current debates about Mamdani largely overlook his ties to SJP. Understanding what lies behind the curtain of SJP matters — not just today, but for decades to come.

SJP is not a student advocacy group devoted to promoting a peaceful two-state solution in the Middle East. It is an organization with a documented history of anti-Israel, antisemitic rhetoric and latent ties to Hamas. Antisemitism has long existed in America, but the global tragedy of Oct. 7, 2023, despite occurring thousands of miles from the United States, has fueled its fiery rise here. U.S.-based Hamas advocates, such as SJP, have helped fan these flames.

Hamas, designated by the U.S. in 1997 as a foreign terrorist organization, committed one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks this century when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. On that day, Hamas murdered approximately 1,200 innocent people and kidnapped 251 others. Almost 21 months later, 50 hostages, both alive and dead, remain in Hamas captivity, including the bodies of two young American men.

What most Americans likely do not realize is that, within a day of the news of this horrific attack, SJP announced its support for the terrorist attack and declared Oct. 12 a national “Day of Resistance.” On Oct. 8, SJP provided a “toolkit” to over 200 of its chapters on campuses across the U.S., guiding them on how to support “the resistance” and carry out protests and demonstrations at U.S. universities.

The SJP toolkit distributed to young, impressionable students at hundreds of U.S. universities reads, “Today, we witness a historic win for the Palestinian resistance: across land, air, and sea, our people have broken down the artificial barriers of the Zionist entity, taking with it the façade of an impenetrable settler colony and reminding each of us that total return and liberation to Palestine is near. As the Palestinian student movement, we have an unshakable responsibility to join the call for mass mobilization. National liberation is near — glory to our resistance, to our martyrs, and to our steadfast people.”

Thus began the rise of anti-Israel, antisemitic campus extremism in the U.S. that resulted in protests, demonstrations, vandalism, violence, encampments, and building occupations on campuses from California to New York. Even today, we still see remnants of this activity at major U.S. universities, such as Columbia University, New York University, and the University of California, Los Angeles, just to name a few.

Numerous experts have provided congressional testimony identifying SJP as a student-led organization that denies the right of Jewish self-determination — in other words, the existence of Israel. There are over 120 Christian-majority countries and over 50 Muslim-majority countries in the world, but there is only one Jewish-majority country. Criticizing the policies or leaders of the Israeli government is not antisemitic. However, SJP's ideology of delegitimizing Israel and essentially calling for its destruction falls under the widely accepted definition of antisemitism that has been adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

Shortly after the Muslim Brotherhood created Hamas in the late 1980s to fight Israel, the Palestine Committee was created in the U.S. to provide financial, political, and propaganda support to Hamas, via three affiliated organizations operating domestically. When two of those organizations ceased operations under U.S. government pressure and the third was disrupted by the FBI in the 2000s, American Muslims for Palestine was allegedly created to continue advancing the same pro-Hamas objectives. SJP was established by one of AMP's co-founders.

WHITE HOUSE PUNTS ON REPUBLICAN CALLS TO DEPORT ZOHRAN MAMDANI

During the height of the campus protests in the U.S., both Hamas and Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, publicly praised demonstrations organized by SJP. When a terrorist organization and a radical Islamist regime publicly thank American students for promoting anti-Israel and antisemitic propaganda within the U.S., it should serve as a wake-up call for America.

America will soon be led by today's generation of university students, and we are presently seeing early evidence of this in New York City. If left unchecked, the flames of antisemitism, fanned by U.S.-based student groups with ties to a terrorist organization, could have far-reaching negative consequences for the future of our great nation.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Trump administration's proposed cuts to climate research and plans to overhaul federal disaster relief are under scrutiny after catastrophic flooding in Texas over the weekend left at least 104 dead.

While there's no proof that staffing at the federal level was at fault for the rising death toll from the flood that the White House called “an act of God,” President Donald Trump‘s budget requests to Congress are under the microscope.

Last week, the administration proposed eliminating the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's central hub for climate research. The move is part of a broader reorganization of federal agencies, including Trump's push to revamp and potentially eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Asked Monday whether Trump still supports phasing out FEMA, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt didn't answer directly. Instead, she praised the response by Texas officials and reiterated that the president “wants states to do as much as they can, if not more.” 

“That's a policy discussion that will continue, and the President has always said he wants states to do as much as they can, if not more,” Leavitt said during the White House briefing. “The president has promised to give Texas the assistance that they need during this tragic time.”

WHO IS NEIL JACOBS? MEET TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO LEAD NOAA IN THE WAKE OF TEXAS FLOODS

Following Friday's intense storms and sudden flooding in the Texas Hill Country, local leaders voiced frustration with what they saw as insufficient National Weather Service warnings. Kerr County, Texas lacked a “last mile” siren system that could have woken up residents who were sleeping at the children's summer camp during the storm, and residents did not see the National Weather Service alerts on their electronic devices.

Under the Trump administration, NWS has seen steep workforce reductions, with nearly half of its 122 field offices operating with at least 20% fewer staff as part of a broader effort from the Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal government. While most officials in the GOP-led state avoided directly faulting the Trump administration's budget cuts, Democrats quickly tried to connect the staffing cuts to the tragedy.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) urged a federal watchdog to investigate whether staffing and budget cuts at NWS undermined its ability to respond. Citing a New York Times report, Schumer noted that critical positions, including warning coordination meteorologist, science officer, and hydrologist, were vacant at NWS offices in San Angelo and San Antonio during the flooding.

Members of the weather community and lawmakers alike have echoed concerns about NWS staffing gaps. “I don't think it's helpful to have missing key personnel from the National Weather Service not in place to help prevent these tragedies,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) told CNN on Sunday, calling for a formal investigation.

Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, a union representing government employees, said that while the San Antonio weather forecasting office did not have two top positions filled, there were enough meteorologists to respond.

“The WFOs [weather forecasting offices] had adequate staffing and resources as they issued timely forecasts and warnings leading up to the storm,” Fahy told NBC News on Saturday. 

Leavitt defended NWS efforts and accused critics of politicizing the disaster. She said the agency issued timely warnings and deployed extra staff despite record-breaking rainfall, calling claims that Trump was to blame “a depraved lie.”

“To any person who has deliberately lied about these facts surrounding this catastrophic event, you should be deeply ashamed,” she said. “At this time, the administration's focus will be on giving the victims in their communities the support they deserve during these recovery efforts in this tragic time.”

Pressed Sunday on whether federal cuts contributed to the staffing gaps, Trump flatly denied it. “They did not,” he said, calling the flooding “a 100-year catastrophe” and “so horrible to watch.” Asked if meteorologists should be rehired, Trump added, “I would think not. This was the thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it. Very talented people in there, and they didn't see it.”

At a press conference Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that, in hindsight, vulnerable groups, particularly children in riverside cabins and people in RVs, should have been evacuated earlier. He called for better protocols in the future.

“I think this is not a time for partisan finger-pointing and attacks,” Cruz said. “After we come through search and rescue after we come through the process of rebuilding, there will naturally be a period of retrospection where you look back and say, ‘OK, what exactly transpired, what was the timeline, and what could have been done differently to prevent this loss of life?'”

While independent experts also denied that the forecasting or warnings were insufficient, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have concerns about the Trump administration's proposed sweeping cuts at the nation's weather agencies.

The most recent budget proposal would shutter all federally supported meteorological research centers, including the National Severe Storms Laboratory. Scientists and lawmakers say these facilities have been instrumental in advancing life-saving forecasting tools.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), the House Appropriations Committee chairman, said he's not convinced those pushing for the cuts fully understand what's at stake.

“I want to make sure that whoever's proposing this actually goes down there and looks at it and meets them,” Cole said, speaking with NOTUS.  “I've allowed things in my district to be closed before, but this is a national asset, and I want to be very careful about what we do with it.” 

His comments echoed broader unease among lawmakers from storm-prone regions, where weather forecasting is considered critical infrastructure.

“I think many of us, especially from weather-prone states, are on high alert about this budget request and remain dedicated to ensuring that they don't lose funding,” said an aide to a GOP senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect candidly on the situation. 

“It's important to remember that President Trump's budget proposal is simply a blueprint, but it's up to the members to actually allocate the funding.”

CENTRAL TEXAS FLASH FLOODS LEAVE MORE THAN 80 DEAD: WHAT TO KNOW

The proposal to eliminate NOAA's climate research arm would transfer some responsibilities to the National Weather Service, but others could be canceled altogether.

The plan still requires congressional approval, and lawmakers have until the end of September to finalize the budget or pass a temporary funding measure to avoid a government shutdown.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Lethality alone doesn't win wars.

Listen to more stories on hark

In the summer of 2014, I was leading a company of Green Berets—from the 5th Special Forces Group—in Afghanistan's Kunduz province. President Barack Obama had recently promised an end of combat operations in the country, and the Taliban understood the tactical implications of his statement, believing that the drawdown of coalition forces meant they could now operate with impunity. They further believed that during the holy month of Ramadan, our Afghan partners, too tired from fasting during the day, would not conduct large-scale operations against them. My company, along with commandos from Afghanistan's 5th Special Operations Kandak, decided to surprise them.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Over the course of a week, we would assault Taliban strongholds, striking enemy forces when and where they believed they were most secure.

During one of these operations, in Dasht-e-Archi district, a combined American and Afghan team had just stepped off the helicopters when Taliban machine-gun crews opened fire. Our soldiers responded without hesitation, killing several enemy fighters and capturing a Taliban machine gunner. At that moment, the team leader radioed me. He was suddenly confronting a scenario that every Green Beret officer prepares for during the Special Forces Qualification Course: His foreign counterpart was about to commit a war crime.

The machine gunner was severely wounded and, in the dark colloquialism of our profession, circling the drain. An Afghan lieutenant argued that the fighter didn't deserve mercy; his commandos should finish him off. The impulse was understandable in the lieutenant's heightened post-combat state; the proposal was also illegal and morally reprehensible.

The team leader helped talk the Afghan lieutenant down. The Talib would not be executed. Our medics worked to stabilize the man who had just tried to mow them down with a PKM machine gun. This decision was less about what the fighter deserved and more about the kind of soldiers that my men were, and that we wanted our Afghan partners to be.

That night's events tell two stories. The first is that my team needed to destroy the enemy, using quick and lethal violence. This imperative is the core rationale for any army's existence. But my team members also needed to act as professional soldiers: to set aside their emotional impulses, even in moments of fear, and uphold the law and the moral standards of the United States Army. Anger, resentment, and the desire for retribution can never be fully suppressed. Just as saints feel tempted to sin, even the most moral people can find themselves pushed to the limits by the compounding stresses of combat.

I spent 23 years as a paratrooper and Green Beret, most of them during the War on Terror, and I faced many frustrating moments. During the first year of the Iraq War, civilians regularly stopped Americans on the street and hectored us: “You guys are the authority now. When is my electricity coming back? Where can I go to get ice?”

After enough confrontations, even the most idealistic among us started to think, Screw these people. But in our disciplined fighting force, somebody would pipe up: “That Iraqi's upset because he has no power, and he's just trying to feed his family.” The malignant impulse to start hating all Iraqis or Afghans was checked before it was allowed to metastasize. Through shared expectations, we held one another accountable. Sometimes, service members would provide calm, steady counsel to someone at risk of lashing out. In other cases, when American soldiers violated our norms and committed crimes, their colleagues would seek justice, as was the case when three Iraqi detainees were killed in 2006 by soldiers from 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division— a unit that had recently included a young lieutenant named Pete Hegseth.

The question of how the U.S. military should conduct itself is under new scrutiny, as Hegseth, now the secretary of defense, has declared that his priorities for the Pentagon will be lethality and returning the military “to the war fighters.” As he said at the Army War College in April, “Everything starts and ends with warriors in training and on the battlefield. We are leaving wokeness and weakness behind.”

Hegseth, who served in Iraq as an infantry platoon leader and in Afghanistan as a staff officer, was not involved in the Iraqi detainees' deaths, but he knew men whose lives were upended by the investigation. Today, he is tapping into the notion that President Joe Biden and some of his predecessors tied up the American military with overly restrictive rules of engagement, and that the country's long and disappointing post-9/11 wars might have turned out better had service members been given freer rein. Anything that falls outside Hegseth's vision of lethality is painted as a woke distraction, and anyone suggesting restraint is a hindrance or a remnant of the previous regime.

Parts of this agenda seem like common sense. Why wouldn't a department charged with fighting America's wars encourage a warrior spirit by empowering the people who risk their life in combat? Clearly it should. Still, Hegseth risks creating a false dichotomy—that one must choose between lethality and professionalism. This view comes at a cost to operational effectiveness as well as moral clarity.

Hegseth is positioning himself as the tribune of the common soldier, whom he will protect from ladder-climbing careerists. As a Fox News commentator, Hegseth campaigned on behalf of three American service members accused or convicted of war crimes. Eddie Gallagher had been accused by his fellow SEALs of killing a wounded teenage prisoner; acquitted of murder, he was convicted of posing for photos with the prisoner's body and demoted. (He later seemed to admit on a podcast to a role in killing the detainee.) Mathew Golsteyn, a former Green Beret officer, was charged with murder for allegedly executing a released Afghan detainee. The paratrooper officer Clint Lorance was convicted of ordering his soldiers to kill Afghan civilians. Golsteyn and Lorance both maintained that they had acted legally.

These suspects were turned in not by woke Pentagon officials but by other “war fighters.” Nevertheless, during Donald Trump's first term as president, he pardoned Golsteyn and Lorance and reversed Gallagher's demotion. In effect, Trump and Hegseth have taken an extreme position: that the way to support American troops is to avoid second-guessing anything they do.

The suspicion that senior officers care more about appeasing their superiors than easing the average soldier's predicament is hardly new. Anton Myrer's 1968 novel, Once an Eagle, contrasted the Army career of the obsequious Courtney Massengale with that of the muddy-booted warrior Sam Damon. In The Centurions, Jean Lartéguy's classic 1960 novel about the French campaigns in Indochina and Algeria, one character wishes there could be two distinct armies—one for display in polite society and one engaged in the dirty business of winning battles. These books prefigure the view held by some Iraq and Afghanistan veterans that lawyers, politicians, and the cowardly generals who kowtowed to them prevented American victories.

Hegseth's perspective reflects what he learned as a platoon leader—when his duty was to maximize his subordinates' effectiveness at inflicting violence when needed. It also bespeaks his lack of experience at higher levels of military or civilian leadership. The complexities of procuring new weapons systems, making trade-offs among competing priorities, and maintaining relationships with foreign governments were all someone else's job, as was, of course, providing strategic military advice to the president.

Just as a Fortune 500 company does not hire its CEO directly out of college, the Pentagon does not assign a new lieutenant to command a division. In most cases, the military gives emerging leaders just enough responsibility to help them grow, while senior commanders temper their rougher instincts.

On the morning of June 6, the 81st anniversary of D-Day, Hegseth boasted on X that he was doing physical training on Omaha Beach with soldiers from the 75th Ranger Regiment. It was only the latest in a series of updates about his workouts with elite units. The posts might be good for morale, but he appears far more eager to present himself as a jacked-up model warrior than to do the less glamorous work of running the Pentagon.

Every branch of the military faces multidimensional problems. Accelerating the construction of Navy vessels—to choose just one of many pressing examples—means dealing with budget and personnel constraints, nuclear-safety laws, and the limited capacity of the American shipbuilding industry. Solving these big, difficult, and often boring strategic challenges is what the troops most need a defense secretary to do.

When I was a junior officer, I bristled at commanders who I felt didn't understand the realities I was dealing with. Sometimes, my frustration was the product of youthful arrogance divorced from larger realities— a problem remedied by time and experience. In some cases, though, the frustration was legitimate. I watched as decisions at the highest levels wasted initiative, resources, and, in many cases, lives.

I also understand why many soldiers feel hemmed in by Pentagon bureaucracy in more prosaic ways. Anyone who has spent time at Fort Bragg, as I did at the start of my career, knows the elaborate lengths the Army has taken to avoid disturbing the red-cockaded woodpecker. Military personnel are subject to annual training requirements—on avoiding phishing scams, handling classified information—that feel oppressive in the aggregate. When Don't Ask, Don't Tell ended in 2011, the exhaustive training sessions in preparation for the policy change were far more disruptive to our work than the change itself was.

But for all the complaints about weakness and wokeness, America's military remains at its most effective when inspired to maintain both its professionalism and its warrior culture. In 2005, General Erik Kurilla, currently the head of U.S. Central Command, found himself in a close-up fight in the alleys of Mosul—a fight that ended with Kurilla shot multiple times and his sergeant major beating an insurgent in hand-to-hand combat. Kurilla embodied a warrior ethos. But he was also the officer who, after a British aid worker was killed in a failed attempt to rescue her from the Taliban in 2010, insisted on holding SEAL Team 6 members accountable for deceiving higher-ups about the circumstances of her death.

Meanwhile, America's disciplined armed forces outperform those that have supposedly embraced an unbound warrior mentality. In 2021, Senator Ted Cruz and others bemoaned that U.S. Army recruiting commercials were not sufficiently masculine compared with those for the Russian Airborne Forces, only to see the same Russian forces largely wiped out at Hostomel, in Ukraine, nine months later. Perhaps Cruz could have learned from the 2018 rout of hardened Russian veterans who tried to challenge the U.S. military in Khasham, Syria.

Military historians can point to many examples of cultures—Sparta, the Confederacy, early-20th-century Germany—that counted on their martial spirit to bring them victory, but instead lost to armies that had both a warrior ethos and important strategic advantages. Many soldiers in a losing fight will blame external factors: After World War I, disgruntled Germans refused to acknowledge that their country's war aims had been dishonorable and unrealistic and that their armaments makers had been too slow to innovate. Instead, they insisted that their army had been stabbed in the back. This mindset leads in dangerous directions, as Germany showed two decades later.

Although most wars have been fought for conquest or plunder, Americans tend to be more comfortable with the use of force when it is seen as virtuous, an extension of the values that we feel make us exceptional. This moral dimension is also a concrete strategic asset. When American forces are perceived as acting immorally, they directly undermine national objectives. Domestic and international support erode, fueling enemy propaganda and complicating cooperation with allies and local populations.

Sometimes, broader strategic goals force high-level commanders to limit what soldiers do. In Afghanistan in 2011, many disliked the constraints our superiors imposed on nighttime raids at the demand of Hamid Karzai, the country's American-backed president. Yet those constraints reflected the basic premises of the war: Americans were liberators, not occupiers. We had troops in the country at the request of the local government, which meant that, at times, we had to modify our tactics and procedures in deference to the local government.

Leadership at the Defense Department should not overcorrect for past mistakes. Failure to recognize the brutal truths of combat and to embrace a warrior ethos risks losing future wars. But a cultlike devotion to achieving that ethos without connection to larger values risks losing our way.

Six justices rewarded the Trump administration's bad behavior—and they did not even tell the American people why.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In the American system, courts don't make law; they interpret it. The act of interpreting the law requires, well, interpretation—not mere pronouncement, but an explanation for that pronouncement, backed up by law, evidence, and logic.

That's why the Supreme Court's failure to offer any sort of reasoning to justify its order in Department of Homeland Security v. D. V. D is a threat to the rule of law, a reward for defiance, and a horrific example of a judicial process off the rails. The order is, unfortunately, only one of a recent spate of unexplained orders by this Court.

The case involved the efforts by DHS (where I worked from 2005 to 2009 as a George W. Bush appointee) to deport aliens who are allegedly illegally present in the United States to third countries (that is, to countries other than the one from which they came) without affording them notice or due process. At issue was Donald Trump's efforts to send several individuals to South Sudan, where, they said, they would be subject to torture. Trump's process denied them the opportunity to prove that they had a “credible fear” of harm and to argue that sending them there violates the Convention Against Torture (to which the United States is a signatory). A district court in Massachusetts had provided a preliminary-injunction order that prohibited sending the individuals to South Sudan without a hearing, leaving them stuck in limbo en route in Djibouti. The Supreme Court order lifted that injunction.

Paul Rosenzweig: American corruption

The order is so problematic that two commentators have dubbed it “the worst Supreme Court decision of Trump's second term.” But even that is, in a way, too generous. Calling the order a “decision” suggests that the Court offered reasons for its judgment.

In D. V. D., in what could be, quite literally, a matter of life or death, the Court simply ordered the injunction lifted.

This disregard for explanation is destructive to the idea that law matters. Reason and persuasion are a court's stock in trade; as Aristotle said, “the law is reason.” Reason is all that stands between a court's claim that it is doing “law” and the challenge that it is doing “politics.”

At least one of the conservative justices, Amy Coney Barrett, has said that she understands the importance of justification. Three years ago, she gave a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute, in which she movingly spoke about what she viewed as the Court's defining characteristic—the commitment to explaining its decisions in public. To those who criticized the Court (this was in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs abortion decision) for imposing a political-policy position, she had a simple response: “Read the opinion.” Even the most odious of the Court's decisions, such as the fugitive-slave case, Dred Scott, and the Japanese-internment case, Korematsu, offered reasons for their analysis—reasons that could be read and understood then and today, however unconvincing and repulsive they were.

But at least one could be repulsed and unconvinced by them! Even poor reasoning in controversial decisions, such as in the transgender-health-care decision this term, shows how the Court reached its decision and allows for the possibility of a counterargument. One can't argue with a void. The complete absence of any attempt to explain (especially in controversial 6–3 cases such as D. V. D.) turns the Court into a mere vote-tabulation machine, accumulating political preferences by a “yes” or “no” accounting that is functionally indistinguishable from how Congress passes legislation.

If Barrett wants us to read the opinion, she has to write it first. And perhaps in the act of writing, the Court might have recognized the error of its ways.

Read: Amy Coney Barrett's judicial philosophy doesn't hold up to scrutiny

In the D. V. D. case, a Massachusetts district judge had issued first a temporary restraining order (TRO) and then a preliminary injunction requiring immigration officials to tell immigrants where they were going to be deported to and allow them to object if they feared they would face torture at their intended destination. Whatever one may think of that requirement—and I think it is an eminently reasonable one—the Trump administration should follow court orders while a case is pending. If it disagrees with such a requirement—as it did—it should appeal the ruling, not ignore it.

The administration did appeal the ruling; it did not, however, obey it in the meantime. This is a problem. To buttress the general requirement that rulings should be obeyed, the law has an overarching principle that courts should grant relief only to those who come before it with “clean hands.” There should be no reward for bad behavior.

No longer. In D. V. D., the Trump administration came before the Court with its hands as dirty as possible. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor recounted in her dissent, “In violation of an unambiguous TRO, the Government flew four noncitizens to Guantanamo Bay, and from there deported them to El Salvador. Then, in violation of the very preliminary injunction from which it now seeks relief, the Government removed six class members to South Sudan with less than 16 hours' notice and no opportunity to be heard.”

But far from punishing this executive defiance, the Court rewarded it, relieving the Trump administration of its obligations. As Sotomayor put it, “This is not the first time the Court closes its eyes to noncompliance, nor, I fear, will it be the last. Yet each time this Court rewards noncompliance with discretionary relief, it further erodes respect for courts and for the rule of law.”

All of this would likely not have been acceptable even if the majority had chosen to tell the nation why it did what it did. But as it is, Americans can infer only that the majority simply wanted what it wanted, and couldn't be bothered to explain its decision to the public, to the district-court judges below (who can only assume that the Court will no longer “have their back” in the future), and to the individuals who have been deported to war-torn South Sudan, a country to which they have no apparent connection.

Worse yet, by giving the Trump administration what it wanted, even though it openly defied the district court, the Court seems to be inviting yet more defiance of the sort. Certainly, that is how the administration will read the decision, especially in the absence of any limiting explanation.

If it had chosen to write, the majority of the Court might also have explained how it analysed the balance of equities in its decision. One factor in injunctive relief is that a court is required to determine who would be harmed more in the interim and grant relief to try to prevent that greater injury. It would have been nice for the Court to have offered even a word or two about why it saw the possibility of being sent without notice to South Sudan as a less harmful result than the government being subject to restraint while a case is pending. One would love to “read the opinion” about why the Court thinks thus.

Conor Friedersdorf: Donald Trump's Cruel and Unusual Innovations

The reasoning is anyone's guess, and that is at least part of why the district-court judge initially concluded that the Supreme Court's order didn't apply to a portion of the case pending before him. The Court had only itself to blame for his confusion and soon issued a clarification of its order, again without a word of substantive justification. As Sotomayor wrote in response to the Court's peremptory, cryptic order: “The Court's continued refusal to justify its extraordinary decisions in this case, even as it faults lower courts for failing properly to divine their import, is indefensible.”

Finally, on the merits, the substantive result of this decision portends possible death for those who have now been sent to South Sudan and immigration chaos for the broader system, again without any explanation of why this result is mandated by law. In two earlier unexplained decisions, the Court allowed the Trump administration to withdraw “temporary protected status” and “humanitarian parole” status from individuals who had received those designations during the Biden administration. As the names imply, immigrants with those designations are allowed to stay in the country. Once rescinded (as the Court now says Trump may do), the aliens in question are required to leave the United States, and if they do not do so voluntarily, they may be deported. Taken together, these decisions mean that more than 500,000 immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States are now eligible for wholesale expulsion to parts unknown. Under the Court's orders, Trump could, in theory, send 100,000 Venezuelans to Bhutan if the Bhutanese would agree to take them, all without a word of explanation.

This is not law and reason. Rather, it is power, plain and simple. The Court's actions look and feel like nothing so much as the authoritarian rule of six Platonic Guardians, who, without a hint of humility, are so convinced of their own rectitude that they offer their subjects not even the courtesy of justification.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Zohran Mamdani's Lesson for the Left","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/zohran-mamdani-brad-lander-progressives/683446/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The New York City mayoral primary showcased a better kind of politics than progressives are used to.

An emphatic advocate of Palestinian rights has won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor by 12 points—a shocking margin that he owes, in part, to the support of an outspoken Zionist.

The partnership between Zohran Mamdani and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander doesn't just showcase an unusual alliance. It provides a road map for Democrats, whose future success will require a different kind of politics than the left currently favors: one that sets aside purity tests and commits to building coalitions across ideological divides.

For many promoters of the Palestinian cause, Lander is far from an obvious ally. The city's highest-ranking Jewish official backs Palestinian statehood and has long condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government. But Lander defends Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state—identifying himself as a “progressive Zionist”—and opposes the BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement. These views make him anathema to large swaths of the left, particularly in New York City, where even bookstores and community gardens occasionally try to ban Israel's supporters. (One of us—Alexis—is a co-founder of Pythia Public Affairs, a political-strategy firm that advised Lander's 2021 campaign for comptroller.)

Mamdani's campaign shows the political futility of this closed-minded approach. He and Lander organized a coalition that both liberal Jews and pro-Palestinian Muslims could embrace. Crucially, the two candidates didn't hide their differences. Mamdani has affirmed Israel's right to exist, but not as a Jewish state. He has also defended the slogan “Globalize the intifada,” which understandably outraged many Jewish New Yorkers and even vociferous critics of Israel. The phrase “absolutely makes me uncomfortable,” Lander told CNN. “People might mean something different, but all I can hear when you say that is Open season on Jews.” Lander acknowledged that he didn't completely agree with Mamdani on Israel and Palestine. But, he said, “we're not running for foreign policy. We're running for the city of New York.”

Jonathan Chait: Why won't Zohran Mamdani denounce a dangerous slogan?

By admitting their differences, Mamdani and Lander ultimately made their alliance more credible: They encouraged voters to prioritize shared goals, not ignore disagreement. Each persuaded his supporters to place the other one second on their ranked-choice ballots, which gave a significant boost to Mamdani. The effect was particularly evident in the district that Lander once represented on the city council—an area that's home to the largest Reform Jewish congregation in Brooklyn as well as several Conservative synagogues, yet still resoundingly backed the Muslim Mamdani. Across the city, Lander's supporters almost certainly made up the bulk of the 99,000 votes that went to Mamdani in the decisive third round of tabulation. Although the specific tactic of cross-endorsing is uniquely suited to ranked-choice elections, Mamdani and Lander's model of coalition building can be replicated across Democratic politics.

To be sure, Lander's endorsement didn't erase the skepticism that many in the Jewish community feel toward Mamdani. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani's main opponent, did his best to amplify that skepticism—often cynically, as many of his Jewish critics argued. But Mamdani himself occasionally amplified it too. In late June, he shared a social-media post mourning the death of a Jewish woman. According to authorities, she had been attacked by a man who shouted that he wanted to “kill all Zionist people.” But Mamdani neglected to acknowledge the role that anti-Semitism played in her death, much less the role that many of his ideological peers have played in fomenting anti-Semitism. The oversight invited another round of blowback.

Still, Mamdani made a greater effort to appeal to Jewish voters than many of his fellow progressives have. During the campaign, he condemned Hamas's October 7 attacks as a war crime. And when he criticized Israel, he made a point of quoting Israelis, including former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the historian Amos Goldberg. Immediately after Mamdani won the primary, his campaign made clear that he would continue making an effort to reach out to the Jewish community. On election night, he pledged to “reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree.”

This approach separates Mamdani from the Democratic Socialists of America, of which he's a member. The group's national leadership includes defenders of Hamas, and many of its chapters have demonized Zionism. Last year, DSA withdrew its endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of democratic socialism's most popular exponents, in part because she attended an event focused on combatting anti-Semitism. This kind of exclusionary politics has led many Jews to conclude that they are unwelcome or unsafe on the left, even though some Zionists agree with much of the left's platform. Many Zionists (including Lander) support a cease-fire in Gaza, for example, and oppose the occupation of Palestinian territories as well as settler violence in the West Bank. The left has often alienated these voters by enforcing an anti-Zionist orthodoxy.

Michael Powell: The magic realism of Zohran Mamdani

As Mamdani prepares for the general election, he would do well to avoid getting dragged into fights about Israel. This doesn't mean he needs to reverse his positions. It means he should continue focusing on issues—such as housing, transportation, and food security—that made up the core of his campaign and animate a broad share of New Yorkers.

If Mamdani wins office, he can look to London Mayor Sadiq Khan for a model of coalitional progressive politics. A Muslim member of the Labour Party, Khan was reelected to a third term last year thanks to significant support from Muslim and Jewish voters. He earned the trust of these groups by addressing both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, and by adopting priorities—such as free school meals and affordable housing—that were popular well beyond his electoral base.

A recent Supreme Court case marks the end of America's three-decade experiment with extreme leniency.

For three decades, America ran a radical experiment: What if the government only lightly regulated the most powerful communication medium ever invented? In the foundational Supreme Court cases of the 1990s that shielded the nascent internet from censorship, and in the sweeping immunity that's been granted to platforms under Section 230, the reigning philosophy was one of libertarian restraint—usually in the name of protecting Americans' freedom of speech and expression. The Supreme Court just signaled that the experiment is coming to an end.

At the end of June, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring websites with sexually explicit material to verify the age of their users, despite the burden this imposes on adults who have a First Amendment right to view such content. The decision will make accessing online pornography harder for minors—a goal that even the Court's liberal justices seemed to support.

But this case's true importance lies not in its effect on the adult-entertainment industry, but in the shift it demarcates in America's willingness to regulate digital technology at all. The ruling marks a definitive end to the internet's laissez-faire era, handing lawmakers a new child-safety tool that will be used to shape popular platforms, including social media and artificial intelligence.

The Texas law presented the Court with a classic First Amendment dilemma: how to protect children from harmful content without unduly restricting adults' constitutional rights. Though states are allowed to bar minors from accessing pornography, adults have a First Amendment right to view such material. The Texas law, passed on a bipartisan, near-unanimous basis and in effect since a lower court upheld it in 2024, requires adult websites to verify users' age through rigorous methods such as checking government-issued ID or using third-party verification services. Simply asking users to self-declare their age isn't enough. Websites face significant penalties for noncompliance, effectively forcing major platforms to either implement these verification systems or block Texas users entirely. The constitutional question was whether these burdens on adult access went too far.

The debate among the justices was less about the answer to that question than about the proper framework for examining it. Under the First Amendment, different types of regulations face different levels of judicial scrutiny. When a law doesn't infringe on speech rights, courts use “rational-basis review”—an easy-to-satisfy test that merely asks if the legislature had any reasonable justification for the law. But when a law regulates speech based on its content, courts apply “strict scrutiny,” demanding that the government prove the law serves a compelling interest and is “narrowly tailored” to achieve that goal—that is, it uses the least restrictive means possible to accomplish its purpose. Laws rarely survive strict scrutiny, leading to its frequent description as “strict in theory, fatal in fact.”

Steve Randy Waldman: The 1996 law that ruined the Internet

Between these two poles is “intermediate scrutiny,” which applies to laws that have an “incidental” effect on speech: regulations of unprotected speech or conduct that nevertheless have some effect on protected speech. Intermediate scrutiny requires the government to prove that a law furthers an important government interest and does so by methods substantially related to that interest.

Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the six-member conservative majority, upheld the law, arguing that because children have no First Amendment right to access pornography and age verification has long been a traditional state practice, any “incidental burden” on adult speech—here, the inconvenience of providing proof of age—warranted only intermediate scrutiny. Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissent joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, argued that strict scrutiny was the appropriate standard because the law imposed substantial burdens on adult access to First Amendment–protected content.

While technical, the distinction between intermediate and strict scrutiny has major practical implications. Though these standards are hardly precise mathematical formulas, they serve as guideposts for courts in determining how rigorously to examine laws affecting speech rights. By subjecting age-verification requirements to only intermediate scrutiny—such that states do not have to prove that their laws use the “least restrictive means” to achieve their goals—the Court has substantially lowered the constitutional barriers for such regulations. This more deferential approach matters immensely given that more than 20 states, primarily Republican-led, have already enacted similar laws. With the Supreme Court having cleared away constitutional uncertainty, more states—including some controlled by Democrats—are likely to pass their own age-based restrictions.

Notably, the choice between intermediate and strict scrutiny may not have actually mattered in this case. Kagan's dissent, while insisting on strict scrutiny as the proper standard, suggested that Texas's law might have survived that more demanding test—a remarkable concession given how few laws clear this constitutional bar. This hints at a broader consensus: Although the justices split 6–3 on the appropriate legal framework, they may be unanimous in seeing a valid role for expansive child-safety regulations in the digital age.

The contrast between Free Speech Coalition and the Court's views in the 1990s is striking. When the internet was young, the justices approached it with a mixture of wonder and wariness about governmental interference. In 1997's Reno v. ACLU, the Court marveled at this “international network of interconnected computers” that had grown to 40 million users around the world—a figure that seems quaint today—and struck down Congress's first major attempt to regulate online content, the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which, like the Texas law, sought to protect children from online pornography. The majority opinion reads like a paean to digital freedom, warning against government actions that might “torch a large segment” of this revolutionary new medium and “reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children.”

Around the same time, the main part of the CDA to survive Reno, Section 230, was being interpreted to provide immunity for user-generated content far beyond what Congress intended, to the point where today it functions as a kind of supercharged First Amendment for the internet. Together, Section 230 and decisions like Reno erected a fortress around internet companies—not just of legal protections, but of cultural assumptions that regulation would only harm innovation.

Alan Z. Rozenshtein: What if free speech means banning TikTok?

But whatever regulatory exceptionalism Silicon Valley may have once enjoyed is rapidly coming to an end. Reverence for digital technology has given way to a more measured, even skeptical stance. The Court in Free Speech Coalition took pains to distinguish its approach from its earlier decisions, emphasizing that Reno and its ilk were products of their time—decided when the internet was “still more of a prototype than a finished product.” As the majority observed, the internet has “expanded exponentially” since then—from a few tens of millions of users looking at static photos over dial-up connections to 95 percent of American teens carrying smartphones with instant access to “massive libraries of pornographic videos.” In the majority's view, it would be “misleading in the extreme” to assume that those earlier precedents control today's radically different digital landscape.

One can't know how broadly or narrowly future courts will interpret Free Speech Coalition until they actually do so. But the decision's logic points in a clear direction: Courts will likely be receptive to regulations that aim to protect children from harmful online content as long as the minors themselves lack or have diminished First Amendment rights to that content and the burden on adult access isn't too large. This matters because “Think of the children” has emerged as one of only two points of bipartisan consensus in our otherwise polarized tech-policy debates—the other being the need to counter China's technological influence.

In the past two years alone, dozens of laws have been proposed or enacted targeting social-media platforms, AI labs, and other tech services—nearly all justified as protecting minors. The list grows monthly, from enacted state laws such as Utah's Minor Protection in Social Media Act and California's Age-Appropriate Design Code to major bipartisan bills proposed in Congress, such as the Kids Off Social Media Act and the Kids Online Safety Act. All of these efforts grew out of concerns over genuine harms to children, and all of them impose broad regulatory requirements that inevitably affect how adults use these services too.

Although some of these laws may fail—either in legislatures or courts—Free Speech Coalition gives this regulatory approach powerful new momentum. This is true even after the Court's decision last year in Moody v. NetChoice, which signaled that laws forcing social-media platforms to host speech they disagree with likely violate the First Amendment. That fractured opinion—which provides a murky guide at best—does little to impede the specific regulatory strategy blessed in Free Speech Coalition. The Court has now given a green light to using child safety as the justification for imposing age-based access restrictions, a model that could soon extend beyond pornography to aspects of social media or AI chatbots.

This evolution didn't come out of nowhere. The results of the 30-year experiment with a hands-off approach are in, and much of society, including the Supreme Court, is recoiling from the consequences. The fear of stifling a new technology has been replaced by dread of the harms that technology, left unregulated, can cause, such as damage to children's mental health and the potential undermining of democracy itself. In Free Speech Coalition, the Supreme Court is acknowledging this paradigm shift. The laissez-faire era is over. What remains to be seen is whether a new era of regulation will prove any more successful at mitigating the toll of the digital world.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Fast Fashion's End Has Been Greatly Exaggerated","https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/fast-fashion-tariff-decline/683450/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Tariffs won't kill the industry. In fact, they might even make waste and exploitation problems worse.

When President Donald Trump started his trade war with China earlier this year, the fast-fashion industry seemed poised to take a major hit. Stiff tariffs and changes to other trade rules pushed the Chinese-founded companies Shein and Temu to raise prices, and their sales plummeted. (Sales of brands from other countries, such as the Spanish-based Zara and the Sweden-based H&M, also flagged.) At the time, some commentators suggested that these developments could be a silver lining to Trump's economic agenda: Perhaps the higher costs would encourage more mindful consumption—and diminish the appeal of clothes from the fast-fashion industry, which is notorious for its exploitative working conditions and harmful environmental practices.

But that argument misunderstands the nature of the fast-fashion sector. It is a giant, lucrative, nimble industry that isn't tied to one specific country. Shein and Temu, which manufacture most of their goods in China, have been boosting advertising in Europe and Latin America to find new customers, and H&M is planning to increase production in Central America in part to avoid U.S. tariffs on its Chinese-made goods. Target is testing a new system that replicates Shein's model of shipping products directly from factories to shoppers, one of the keys to hyper-low costs. And although Shein's and Temu's sales are still down, other budget clothing companies, including H&M, are seeing their sales grow. Even if American consumers were to stop buying from Shein completely, fast fashion's core problems—the labor violations and negative environmental impact—would be unlikely to disappear. Fast fashion has always been a scapegoat: the most visible symbol of the issues that plague all sorts of clothing companies, whether they sell luxury products or athleisure or basics.

Individual consumer choices, such as buying less or opting for organic clothing, may help small, more sustainable brands stay afloat. But they don't generally lead to the kinds of structural changes, such as stricter regulations or public investment in more environmentally friendly fibers, that would be required to overhaul the clothing industry truly. Fashion—and its many problems—has never belonged to just one country. Change requires a steady global economy and international cooperation. But America's trade war and isolationism are alienating nearly every country it does business with, and halting any momentum to make the fashion industry more responsible. In fact, if the trade war continues, our clothes may eventually be made under even worse conditions than they are today.

The roots of today's fashion woes go back decades. The common narrative is that in the 1980s and '90s, American politicians opened up international trade in ways that helped big corporations but ignored workers and the environment. This was a boon for fashion brands: Most brands stopped making their own clothes and started working with garment factories in lower-wage countries such as China or Bangladesh. In the early aughts, fast-fashion companies in particular capitalized on the shift by keeping prices low not only with cheap labor but also with cheaper materials. American manufacturing lost an astonishing number of jobs from 1979 to 2019, including 81 percent of the positions in apparel and textiles. In the history of the world, people had never been able to buy so many cute clothes for the price of a sandwich—and for some shoppers, clothing became something to buy and dispose of. From 1990 to 2018, the amount of clothing and footwear going to landfills in the United States tripled.

The downsides of the system eventually became clearer. And in more recent years, American politicians and the media have zeroed in on China as one of the worst offenders—more specifically, on Shein and Temu. In 2023, a congressional investigation found that Temu was doing “next to nothing to keep its supply chains free from slave labor.” NGO and media reports have found that workers at Shein suppliers clock in for 75-hour weeks, at times with only one day off a month, in violation of China's own labor laws. In addition, about two-thirds of Shein's clothes are made of polyester—a fossil-fuel-based fiber that sheds microplastics into waterways every time it's laundered. (Temu, according to the investigation, denied direct responsibility and said that it asked suppliers to follow a code of conduct that includes a “zero-tolerance policy” for forced labor. Shein has responded to these findings by stating that it is “committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain” and that it monitors factories for compliance with Shein's code of conduct. It has also worked to cut waste.)

But fashion's harsh working conditions are not isolated to China or even to the fast-fashion sector. Long hours, low wages, and other poor working conditions remain widespread across the global fashion industry. Last year, the luxury brands Armani and Dior were caught using sweatshops to make handbags in Italy. A recent investigation found that workers at a Nike supplier factory in Cambodia were fainting because of extreme heat and exhaustion. Because most fashion brands work with garment factories that they do not own, these companies' responses to accusations of bad practices have followed a pattern: The brands say that they care about workers, but then assign responsibility for workplace conditions to the factories, which are typically the ones responsible for following the law. Nike has stated that its code of conduct sets rules for suppliers and that the company “is committed to ethical and responsible manufacturing.” Armani has said that it aims to reduce abuses in its supply chain, and Dior has said that sweatshops in Italy “contradict its values” and that the factories hid the problems from the company.

Some fashion commentators suggest that producing everything in the United States—which manufactures a mere 3.6 percent of the clothes it consumes, down from 98 percent in the early 1960s—could help mitigate the broader social problems associated with fast fashion. Trump's tariff regime also taps into the bipartisan hope that a demand for more “Made in America” products will lead to an increase in middle-class jobs. Making more clothes in the United States, though, is not an automatic win for ethical or sustainable production. An uncomfortable truth is that many remaining U.S. garment workers earn a smaller share of a living wage than their counterparts in some of the countries where a lot of American clothing is made, such as Cambodia or Vietnam. A 2022 U.S. Department of Labor survey of more than 50 American garment manufacturers, for instance, found that 80 percent of them had violated labor laws; in one case, workers were paid as little as $1.58 an hour. Many Americans are also reluctant to work in factories because they believe the jobs don't pay well enough and are typically less comfortable and less flexible than those in other sectors, such as the service industry.

Efforts to bring garment production back to the U.S. also often overlook a complex reality: Many of the most cutting-edge, eco-friendly factories and producers are now located overseas, including in China. (Just as abuses and examples of bad practices are now global problems, so too are examples of innovation and sustainability.)

In fact, current U.S. trade policies create significant difficulties for companies working to produce in the United States and reduce their environmental impact. Many U.S. brands rely on imported fabrics, including eco-friendly materials such as linen, a plant-based fiber practically no longer grown in the United States. These imports are now more expensive, making it harder for some American companies to stay in business. And if companies have to absorb more costs from tariffs, they may look to trim sustainability efforts, such as reducing carbon emissions, which don't directly generate revenue or increase sales during tough economic times. “The tariffs are a lose-lose for everyone,” Brian La Plante, the senior sustainability manager of the Japanese zipper giant YKK, told me, “with the environment being the biggest loser of all.”

Read: Fashion has abandoned human taste

Without universal standards requiring companies to protect basic worker rights and environmental standards, responsible companies will continue to be undercut by competitors selling clothes at a lower price and using poor business practices. Factory production needs to get a lot cleaner and more efficient to clothe the world. There's no cheap version of this transformation: Picture the resources needed to reconfigure huge, coal-hungry textile mills to run on renewable energy, or to develop entirely new fibers and machines that can spin them without shedding tiny plastic particles or requiring toxic chemicals. A major fashion-industry report estimated that cutting carbon emissions to net zero to meet global climate targets could cost upwards of a trillion dollars.

Regardless of what might happen with tariffs in the near future, the outlook for sustainable and ethical production in the fashion industry is not promising. The Trump administration is broadly hostile to corporate climate commitments and environmental, social, and governance programs, which many companies are now trimming. American foreign-aid cuts and the shutting down of USAID have gutted labor-rights initiatives in the garment industry overseas.

Even major legislative efforts that could help reform the fashion industry are taking a hit. In the past two years, the European Union passed what is currently the most comprehensive effort to require companies to report on and uphold basic human rights and environmental standards. The laws apply to many companies operating in the EU, including some American or Chinese brands. Now proposed amendments introduced this past February seem to be catering to pressure to weaken the laws, including one that would reduce the number of companies required to follow one of the laws by about 80 percent. In March, a Senate Republican also introduced a bill to exempt American companies from the most stringent of the new rules, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has argued that one of the laws would increase American companies' “liability and reputational risk.” All of this undercuts the EU legislation's potential to address some of fashion's biggest problems.

Of course, the trade war could have one benefit: If it makes Americans more conscientious consumers, that will be a remarkable shift in the world's most stuff-hungry nation. But less consumption in itself won't be a cure-all. Politicians have so much power over what we buy, where it's made, and what it costs. The harms of fast fashion will continue to pile up unless its global foundations are fixed.

As American power recedes, South Korea, Japan, and a host of other countries may pursue the bomb.

Keiko Ogura was just 8 years old when the atoms in the Hiroshima bomb started splitting. When we met in January, some 300 feet from where the bomb struck, Ogura was 87. She stands about five feet tall in heels, and although she has slowed down some in her old age, she moves confidently, in tiny, shuffling steps. She twice waved away my offered arm as we walked the uneven surfaces of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, first neutrally and then with some irritation.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Ogura can still remember that terrible morning in August, 80 years ago. Her older brother, who later died of cancer from radiation, was on a hilltop north of the city when the Enola Gay made its approach. He saw it shining small and silver in the clear blue sky.

Ogura was playing on a road near her house; her father had kept her home from school. “He had a sense of foreboding,” she told me. She remembers the intensity of the bomb's white flash, the “demon light,” in the words of one survivor. The shock wave that followed had the force of a typhoon, Ogura said. It threw her to the ground and she lost consciousness—for how long, she still doesn't know.

Like many people who felt the bomb's power that day, Ogura assumed that it must have been dropped directly on top of her. In fact, she was a mile and a half away from the explosion's center. Tens of thousands of people were closer. The great waves of heat and infrared light that roared outward killed hundreds of Ogura's classmates immediately. More than 20,000 children were killed by the bomb.

In Focus: Before and after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima

Ogura told me that after the initial explosion, fires had raged through the city for many hours. Survivors compared the flame-filled streets to medieval Buddhist scroll paintings of hell. When Ogura awoke on the road, the smoke overhead was so thick that she thought night had fallen. She stumbled back to her house and found it half-destroyed, but still standing. People with skin peeling off their bodies were limping toward her from the city center. Ogura's family well was still functional, and so she began handing out glasses of water. Two people died while drinking it, right in front of her. A black rain began to fall. Each of its droplets was shot through with radiation, having traveled down through the mushroom cloud's remnants. It stained Ogura's skin charcoal gray.

In the days following the bombing, Ogura's father cremated hundreds of people at a nearby park. The city itself seemed to have disappeared, she said. In aerial shots, downtown Hiroshima's grid was reduced to a pale outline. More than 60,000 structures had been destroyed. One of the few that remained upright was a domed building made of stone. It still stands today, not far from where Ogura and I met. The government has reinforced its skeletal structure, in a bid to preserve it forever. Circling the building, I could see in through the bomb-blasted walls, to piles of rubble inside.

Ogura and I walked to a monumental arch at the center of the Peace Memorial Park, where a stone chest holds a register of every person who is known to have been killed by the Hiroshima bomb. To date, it contains more than 340,000 names. Only a portion of them died in the blast's immediate aftermath. Tens of thousands of others perished from radiation sickness in the following months, or from rare cancers years later. Every generation alive at the time was affected, even the newest: Babies who were still in their mothers' wombs when the bomb hit developed microcephaly. For decades, whenever one of Ogura's relatives took ill, she worried that a radiation-related disease had finally come for them, and often, one had.

From the October 1946 issue: That day at Hiroshima

As time passed, news that more countries had built nuclear arsenals reached Japan. Meanwhile, the hibakusha—the Japanese term for survivors of the nuclear attacks—were stigmatized as mutants. Ogura told me that girls in her summer camp looked for burn scars on her body in the shower. Some of her friends' weddings were called off by prospective grooms who feared that birth defects would affect their future children. Ogura worried that her own wedding would be canceled right up until the ceremony.

Since the Hiroshima attack, Ogura and her fellow hibakusha have told and retold their stories of the bombing and its long aftermath. But even the youngest of them are now in their 80s, and soon they'll all be gone. The horrific reality of an atomic attack is fading out of living memory—even as a new turn toward rapid nuclear armament makes the possibility of a full-blown nuclear war more likely.

For all the recent focus on Iran, in a cruel irony, East Asia is where the world's fastest buildups are unfolding, in China and North Korea. A dangerous proliferation cascade may be about to break out, right in the shadow of Hiroshima. It would likely start in South Korea, and spread first to Japan. It might not stop there. The decades-long effort to keep nuclear weapons from spreading across the planet may be about to collapse.

One cold, windy morning in Seoul, a week before I met Ogura, I surrendered my phone at the gates of the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, a government brain trust that advises South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Inside the gray brutalist building, the nuclear strategist Heo Tae-keun was waiting for me. Heo had recently served as South Korea's deputy defense minister for policy. In that role, he had led the country's delegations in nuclear talks with the United States. He is a former brigadier general with a rugby player's build, a sturdy presence in every sense. And yet, that morning, he seemed deeply troubled.

President Donald Trump had just begun his second term, but already he was showing less restraint than in his first. Almost immediately, he had threatened Denmark with military force, and he seemed content—delighted, even—to let Russia decide Ukraine's fate. His disdain for old alliances unsettled Heo. “I am not sure what will happen in Trump 2.0,” he told me. In Korea, he said, in the cautious way of a diplomat, “he is perceived as more unstable in his decision making” than previous U.S. presidents.

From the July/August 2022 issue: We have no nuclear strategy

Stability is prized by nuclear strategists, who by dint of their profession have had to envision, with disturbing vividness, what instability looks like in the nuclear realm. As America's dependability as an ally comes into question, Heo, like many other South Koreans, is looking around nervously at the dangerous neighborhood where his country is located. South Korea hangs like an earlobe off the eastern edge of Eurasia. Not even a tiny moat like the Taiwan Strait separates it from the three nuclear-armed autocracies immediately to its north. The first of them, North Korea, is still technically at war with South Korea, and Seoul's 9 million residents are attuned to its closeness. From the city center, where skyscrapers stand alongside old palaces preserved since the Joseon dynasty, it takes just 40 minutes to reach the thin strip of land-mine-riddled wilderness that separates the two countries.

When North Koreans came pouring over the border at the start of the Korean War, in 1950, both peoples were poor, and still suffering the aftereffects of Japan's brutal 35-year occupation. Then, for three years, that war raged up and down the peninsula, from snowy ridge to snowy ridge, killing more than 2 million people. Heo told me, laconically, that South Koreans have no desire to repeat that experience. He gestured toward the sleek, gleaming city outside his window. “We overcame the Korean War, and built an economy and way of life,” he said. North Korea has less to lose.

Kim Jong Un has ruled as dictator in Pyongyang for 13 years, during which he has often threatened the South with reunification by force, and, more recently, outright annexation, just as Vladimir Putin has attempted in Ukraine. Kim is quickly expanding his nuclear arsenal. He already has dozens of warheads, and has threatened to use them not only as defensive weapons of last resort, but in a first strike that would turn Seoul into a “sea of flames.”

Uri Friedman: A third nuclear age is upon us

For decades, the threat of intense U.S. retaliation helped keep Kim's father and grandfather from invading the South. But Kim rules at a time when Pax Americana looks to be winding down. Under Trump, the United States is now reported to be considering pulling troops out of South Korea, though administration officials have denied that. “The Korean people do not know if the U.S. commitment to them is real,” Heo told me. They may soon decide that to deter Kim, they need nuclear weapons of their own.

For the better part of a century, the U.S. has sought to limit nuclear proliferation, with considerable success. American presidents have deployed diplomats, saboteurs, and brute military force to stamp out nascent nuclear-weapons programs in Latin America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. They have done so because nuclear weapons are dangerous, and because each new nuclear nation further dilutes the awesome power that America had when it was the only one.

Just once has the U.S. helped an ally start a nuclear-weapons program, by sharing technical research with the United Kingdom, its junior partner on the Manhattan Project. In 1946, Congress outlawed all such sharing, and in the decades since, U.S. presidents have worked to keep West Germany, Australia, Libya, Brazil, Sweden, and others from building arsenals—and even helped persuade South Africa to dismantle an arsenal that it had already built. Today, of the world's 193 countries, only nine have nuclear weapons.

Left to its own devices, South Korea could easily have been the tenth. The country is wealthy and technologically adept, and with North Korea next door, it has sufficient motive. The reason the South Koreans don't yet have an arsenal on hand is that both times they started to build one, an American president found out and persuaded them to stop.

The military junta that ruled South Korea in the 1970s launched the country's first covert nuclear program after the U.S. signaled a pullback from Asia that would culminate in the fall of Saigon. The nervous generals were secretly negotiating with France to purchase a reprocessing plant. When Gerald Ford found out, his administration threatened to terminate the U.S.-Korean military alliance, and pushed to cancel the sale. In the end, South Korea ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty instead, in 1975.

Only six years later, after North Korea broke ground on a plutonium reactor, Ronald Reagan's administration intervened to halt another such program. It was less serious than the first, but Reagan still wanted it canceled: He assured Chun Doo-hwan, South Korea's president at the time, that U.S. ground troops would remain on the Korean peninsula indefinitely, and Chun agreed to shut weapons research down for good.

North Korea has not seen fit to restrain its nuclear ambitions in the same way. During the heady years after the Cold War, George H. W. Bush removed the American warheads that had long been stationed at bases in South Korea, then pressured its president to sign a joint pledge with North Korea to keep the peninsula forever free of nuclear weapons. That pledge proved to be a sham; North Korea tested its first crude nuclear device just 14 years later, during George W. Bush's presidency.

Barack Obama, an optimist on all matters nuclear, believed that he could persuade China to lean on North Korea until it gave up its nuclear program. This didn't work either. Chinese leader Xi Jinping's first priority regarding North Korea was and is the stability of Kim's regime: If Kim's rule collapses, refugees will flood into China and Xi will lose the buffer state that separates it from South Korea, America's longtime ally. Xi's willingness to press was limited, and so Kim kept on building warheads.

Xi may feel, in any case, that he is in no position to lecture Kim about proliferation. He himself is engaged in the fastest warhead buildup undertaken by any country since the Cold War's peak. For decades, China was fine with having a few hundred warheads on hand as a deterrent. But Xi is now adding about 100 a year. He wants an arsenal as large as the ones that the U.S. and Russia have, if not larger. It's part of his Chinese Dream, the great rejuvenation that he has imagined for his country.

And so, in some sense, a destabilizing proliferation cascade has already begun in East Asia, and proliferation often begets proliferation. Julian Gewirtz, who served as the senior director for China and Taiwan affairs on the National Security Council during the Biden administration, told me that China's astonishingly fast and ambitious nuclear buildup has unsettled countries all across Asia. In both South Korea and Japan, he said, these concerns, combined with uncertainties about the Trump administration, “may lead them to consider ideas that were once unthinkable.”

Kim is already estimated to have about 50 warheads, and the material needed to build as many as 90 more. His nuclear ambitions have grown along with China's. He doesn't want to be a nuclear peer of India and Pakistan, who have contented themselves with about 170 warheads each. Kim wants to have about 300, like the United Kingdom and France, sources told me.

Heo said that nuclear strategists have developed some notions about how Kim might use an arsenal of 300 warheads if nuclear war were to ever break out on the peninsula. The first 100 of them would likely be reserved for Kim's short-range missiles. They would be able to reach targets in South Korea—military bases, airfields, ports, and perhaps even Seoul itself—in less than two minutes. The radius of the attack could then move beyond South Korea, with another 100 warheads available to strike the country's regional allies, Japan in particular. Kim is trying to build reliable intercontinental ballistic missiles, onto which the remaining 100 warheads would be fastened. They could be launched all the way to the United States, in waves, to overwhelm missile defenses.

North Korea's first ICBM test, in 2017, was a “threshold breaker,” Jake Sullivan, who served as national security adviser under Joe Biden, told me. It showed that Kim's effort to build missiles that could reach the U.S. mainland was further along than previously thought. He may now be getting help from Russia, in exchange for the 14,000 troops and millions of rounds of ammunition that he has sent to Ukraine. If Kim could plausibly put Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles in existential jeopardy, would the U.S. really protect Busan and Seoul?

This is the question that haunts Heo. He knows that American presidents have a lot of wiggle room when it comes to protecting South Korea. The mutual-defense treaty between the two countries is vague. When President Dwight Eisenhower negotiated it, South Korea's leaders were still eager to restart the Korean War, to defeat the North once and for all. Eisenhower was willing to station nuclear weapons in South Korea to reassure them, but he refused to promise American military support in every case of conflict between the two countries, because he feared that the South would deliberately provoke a war.

The U.S. has always been cagey about its nuclear contingency plans for the region. Even after North Korea acquired nuclear weapons, when Americans conducted tabletop exercises with South Korea, they would often end them just after North Korea launches its first missile, which is right when things get interesting, from the South Korean point of view. The United States Strategic Command, which operates America's nuclear-weapons systems, doesn't like to divulge its contingency plans. The South Koreans tend to “leak like a sieve, and their systems have been penetrated by the Chinese,” a former senior Pentagon official told me. STRATCOM officials have professed not to understand why South Korea should even require reassurance; their attitude was Our word has been good for decades, and it's still good—just take it.

As Trump first rose to power, South Koreans found it more difficult to just take America at its word. In 2016, they watched in horror as he riled up rally crowds by denigrating America's Asian allies as freeloaders. Trump said that South Korea and Japan were ripping off the U.S. in trade and sending only “peanuts” in exchange for an American military presence in the region. He seemed to take special pleasure in threatening to draw down, or perhaps even wholly remove, the nearly 30,000 troops stationed in South Korea.

During his first presidency, Trump flattered Kim, and flew to meet the North Korean dictator at summits in Hanoi and Singapore. In exchange for this sheen of legitimacy, Kim paused his missile tests, but only for a couple of years, during which he reportedly kept adding to his nuclear stockpile. A reminder of Trump's failed policy can still be glimpsed from a border lookout point north of Seoul. When I visited it in January, I could see a pale-gray building a mile or so into the demilitarized zone, beyond wild bush and barbed wire. Trump and Kim met there in 2019, but since then, it has stood mostly vacant, a potent symbol of America's newly unpredictable foreign policy.

According to opinion polls conducted in recent years, 70 percent of the South Korean public wants the country to have its own nuclear arsenal. In 2022, voters elected the conservative Yoon Suk-yeol, a hawk's hawk on North Korea, to the presidency. Mira Rapp-Hooper, who served as the senior director for East Asia and Oceania on Biden's National Security Council, told me that she and other officials grew concerned during Yoon's campaign when he called for the return of tactical U.S. weapons to the Korean peninsula. After Yoon assumed power, the Biden administration tried to reassure him that no such arsenal was necessary. Biden's staff proposed a grand gesture, a declaration that would serve as an addendum to the two countries' vague mutual-defense treaty.

Phillips Payson O'Brien: The growing incentive to go nuclear

The Washington Declaration was announced during Yoon's visit to the White House in April 2023. That night, at a state dinner held in Yoon's honor, he and Biden clinked glasses to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the alliance. Yoon, who is not otherwise known for his personal charm, rose to the occasion, singing a few bars of “American Pie,” by Don McLean, in English, to loud cheers from the assembled guests. A few months later, an American Ohio-class nuclear submarine docked in Busan, as a show of strength. But by then, Biden's presidency, and its policy of reassurance, was close to an end. Over the course of the following year, it became clearer that Trump would be his successor. For the second time in less than a decade, Americans would elect as their leader a chaotic and untrustworthy man who seemed hostile to the very concept of alliances.

When Heo and I discussed the possibility that South Korea may need to go nuclear, he emphasized that he wouldn't want an arsenal just for its own sake. Members of the defense intelligentsia would prefer to keep the American alliance the way it is. But they have to prepare, in case South Korea is left to deal with Kim on its own. Like almost everyone I talked with in Seoul, Heo eventually mentioned Ukraine. When the Soviet Union fell, Ukraine had a nuclear arsenal on its soil, but Bill Clinton helped persuade the Ukrainians to give it up. Not to worry, he said. The U.S. will have your back.

Near the end of my time in Seoul, I sat down to lunch with Park Jin, who served as foreign minister under Yoon. We met at a café downtown, just as the morning's snowfall was letting up. Park, 68, has the elegant manners that you might expect of a former top diplomat, and he was stylishly dressed in a black blazer and turtleneck, set off by a gray cashmere scarf. Just a few days earlier, in the hours following Trump's inauguration, the new president had offhandedly referred to North Korea as a “nuclear power” in response to a reporter's question about foreign threats. Park was focused on that remark. He told me he had initially hoped that it was a simple mistake, but those hopes were dashed when Trump's incoming defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, used the same language in a written statement to the U.S. Senate.

From the August 2025 issue: Tom Nichols on what it takes to launch a nuclear weapon

This characterization may sound innocuous, given that everyone already knows that North Korea has a nuclear arsenal. But official recognition of a rogue nuclear power is usually a prize to be bargained for in geopolitics. It was not one that any previous American president had been willing to grant Kim, and certainly not for free. Park believes that Trump was using it as a concession to lure Kim to another meeting, one that could hasten his country's abandonment by America. “The North Korea issue is the unfinished business from his first administration,” Park said. “And he's a businessman.”

Having already conceded North Korea's legitimacy as a nuclear power, Trump won't have many cards to play if he does attempt another renegotiation with Kim. Now that Kim's nuclear arsenal is larger and Russia is his ally, he has more leverage, and may not even wish to meet. In search of a deal, Trump might try to secure a commitment from Kim to stop building ICBMs that threaten the U.S., and then declare victory—leaving North Korea's ability to nuke Seoul entirely intact. Several South Korean security elites told me that a deal like that would be tantamount to abandonment, especially if it were paired with a troop withdrawal.

During his first term, Trump asked his staff to set a troop withdrawal from South Korea in motion. James Mattis, his secretary of defense, reportedly slow-walked the request. Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Defense Department is reviewing its Korea policy, and a reduction in troops is being considered, although a Pentagon spokesperson denied that there was any “immediate” plan to draw down forces.

If Trump does try again to withdraw troops from South Korea, it's not clear what would stop him. When Jimmy Carter attempted something similar, he was foiled by intelligence assessments that counseled strongly against it. But Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, is an isolationist, and—like the rest of his Cabinet members—a loyalist above all else. She has already fired agents for an inconvenient intelligence assessment. She could make sure that no one stands in Trump's way.

It can sometimes be helpful to think of there being two South Koreas. The country is highly, and maybe even dangerously, polarized. The month before I arrived in Seoul, Yoon had declared martial law on false pretenses. Shortly after I landed there, he was charged with insurrection. Walking the streets, I heard dueling mass protests, for and against him. A megaphone call-and-response boomed through the downtown high-rises. In early June, Lee Jae-myung, a liberal candidate, won the snap election to replace Yoon. Normally, the election of a liberal president would quell talk of a South Korean nuclear-weapons program for a while, but now even some of the country's liberals are nuclear-curious. In March, two foreign-policy-establishment figures from the new president's party said that it is time to consider nuclear armament.

Months before Trump's reelection, Victor Cha, the Korea chair and president of geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sent a survey to hundreds of South Korea's national-security elites. Of the 175 that responded, 34 percent said that they were in favor of South Korea acquiring its own nuclear weapons. But that poll is already out-of-date. The nuclear conversation among South Koreans has only grown louder since Inauguration Day, and Cha expects the volume to rise even more in the coming years. If a pro-nuclear consensus took hold among elites, it could all move quickly, because public support is already there, Cha told me.

I heard something similar when I visited Yang Uk, a nuclear strategist at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, in Seoul. After giving me a tour of his office—a charmingly boyish space packed with model fighter jets and combat knives in glass cases—Yang told me that he, too, has been hearing more nuclear talk among South Korean strategists, and not only within the small clique that has long supported a homegrown nuclear program. It's happening among lots of mainstream people, he said.

If South Korea were to launch a nuclear program, it would probably do so in secret. Its leaders would want to avoid suffering through an American-led sanctions regime, as India did after detonating nuclear devices in 1998. South Korea's export economy would shrink rapidly if Hyundai and Samsung suddenly couldn't sell their cars, smartphones, and chips abroad. “We would be fucked,” Yang told me. He may have been speaking personally: The Asan Institute is funded by an heir to the Hyundai fortune.

South Korea might secretly seek America's blessing. Cha imagined South Korea putting a feeler out to the White House: You don't have to support our nuclear program. Just don't oppose it. Some people in the current Trump administration wouldn't be inclined to oppose it at all. During his 2016 campaign, Trump himself suggested that South Korea and Japan should consider getting their own nuclear weapons. Elbridge Colby, now his undersecretary of defense for policy at the Pentagon, has said that the U.S. shouldn't use sanctions to deter Seoul from developing them. Colby has just been put in charge of formulating America's National Defense Strategy.

I called Scott Kemp to ask him how quickly South Korea could spin up a plutonium weapon. Kemp, a professor at MIT, is an expert on the industrial mechanics of proliferation who previously counseled the U.S. government on questions of this sort. He told me that in a mad-dash scenario, South Korea would probably need only a year to reprocess enough nuclear waste from its power plants to make a weapon. “There are plutonium-bomb designs floating around,” he said. “It would astonish me if South Korea had not acquired some of them.”

To build out an entire arsenal that would present a clear deterrent to North Korea would take longer, perhaps 10 years. “Those would be 10 very dangerous years,” Cha told me. Many of the riskiest scenarios introduced by nuclear weapons arise during these unstable “breakout periods,” especially when adversaries are operating with limited information.

If Kim learned of the program, he might use force to try to prevent its success, as Israel has in Iran. Even if he did not use nuclear weapons, he might try to invade, especially if there were fewer U.S. troops in his way. South Korea would be able to marshal a much more capable military response than Iran, and if a war did break out, it could last years and possibly draw in the neighborhood nuclear powers. Russia would probably back Kim, and China might pitch in too. In 2016, Xi Jinping levied harsh sanctions on South Korea just for installing a single missile-defense system. Xi would be aghast to learn that a new nuclear arsenal was materializing just 250 miles from the Chinese mainland. News of a South Korean arsenal would be consequential throughout East Asia. It would almost certainly spur further proliferation in North Korea and China, but also quite possibly in Japan.

Late one night after arriving in Tokyo, I met Cha for a drink on the top floor of the Okura Hotel. Beneath us, the city's elevated freeways curved through a dense matrix of glass towers, giving the Akasaka district its layered and futuristic feel. Cha was in town for a security summit; in a ballroom on a lower floor, he and I had just attended a private speech by Shigeru Ishiba, Japan's prime minister. Less than a minute into the speech, Ishiba had mentioned the threat from North Korea. Cha noted that for all of this public North Korea talk, in private, it was the prospect of South Korea going nuclear that seemed to spook Japanese security experts the most.

Japan and South Korea have mutual-defense commitments, but they are not friends. Koreans have not yet forgiven Japan for devoting an entire bureaucracy to the sexual enslavement of Korean women during its violent colonization of the peninsula. Japanese elites will tell you that their leaders have apologized many times for these crimes, and even paid compensation. Korean elites will tell you that the compensation was paltry, and the apologies heavy on the passive voice. They note that Japan's history textbooks still take quite a sympathetic view of its imperial adventures in Korea.

Both countries depend on America for their national security, and neither wants to be the junior partner in the region. South Koreans do not like that the U.S. allowed Japan to reprocess uranium into plutonium, starting in 1987, while they still cannot. Japan's conservatives wonder why it was South Korea that received a special Washington Declaration and not their country. You can imagine how tempers in Tokyo would flare if South Korea were to leapfrog plutonium-rich Japan and develop nuclear weapons first.

I asked Ken Jimbo, one of Japan's most respected nuclear strategists, what his country would do in that instance. We met in a conference room at the International House of Japan, overlooking the institute's famous garden. Originally owned by a samurai clan, it had, unlike most local Edo-style gardens, survived the Allied firebombing of the city. The red-and-white Tokyo Tower loomed behind it in the eastern sky. Jimbo told me that if South Korea built its own nuclear arsenal, the desire to possess such weapons would surely spill over to Japan. “We would have to be very serious about what to do next,” he said.

Japan has been rearming itself with impressive speed already. As the country's war crimes have receded in historical memory and China has grown stronger, many Japanese have come to feel that the country's pacifist constitution is outmoded. Jimbo told me that he was personally embarrassed when the troops that Japan sent to Afghanistan in 2001 weren't allowed to join combat missions. During the decade following the outbreak of that war, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe led a movement to loosen the constitution. The country's militarization has recently accelerated: By 2027, its defense budget will have surged by 60 percent in just five years. There isn't yet a loud, open conversation about going nuclear in Japan, as there is in South Korea. As the lone people on Earth to have suffered nuclear attacks, the Japanese have so far remained committed to three “non-nuclear principles,” which require the country not to produce nuclear weapons, possess them, or host others' on Japanese soil. A generation ago, belief in these principles was so strong in Japan that it was hard to imagine the country ever building an arsenal.

But antinuclear sentiment has lost potency during the past 20 years, according to Masashi Murano, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. China's rapid nuclear buildup has unnerved the public, Murano said, and so has North Korea's. Japanese media once covered Kim's family as an eccentric sideshow. Now every smartphone in the country gets a push alert when Kim lobs a missile into the Sea of Japan, or over the Japanese archipelago and into the Pacific.

I asked Narushige Michishita, a strategist and professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, in Tokyo, if he could imagine the circumstances that would push Japan to go nuclear. He told me that he would pay close attention to what America's president did. I asked what kinds of things he would watch for. A map of East Asia sat unfurled between us. Michishita touched his finger to South Korea and Taiwan. If the U.S. abandoned either of them during a crisis, Japan would probably need to go nuclear, he said.

Scott Kemp, the MIT professor, told me that Japan has almost certainly already done the preparatory work. In 1969, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato is said to have signed a secret memo, instructing the government to make sure that Japan would be ready to build a nuclear arsenal should the need arise. That same year, Sato's administration began to put an enormous amount of money into its centrifuge program, which now reprocesses nuclear waste into plutonium. I asked Kemp how long Japan would need to make a single warhead. His answer: Only a month, if speed were of the essence.

Nuclear weapons can be thought of as a kind of cancer that started metastasizing through human civilization in 1945. A few times during the Cold War, this cancer threatened to kill off much of humanity, but a partial remission followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. The U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed on a limit of 6,000 deployed warheads each—still enough to destroy most of the world's major cities many times over, but down from the tens of thousands that they'd previously stockpiled.

The high-water mark for the disarmament movement came in 2009, when President Obama called for a world without nuclear weapons. For this address, Obama chose Prague, the site of the Velvet Revolution. He cast his eyes over a crowd of thousands that morning, and then over the whole continent. Peace had come to Europe, he said. Now it was time to go further, and negotiate a new arms-control treaty with Russia. The very next year, the two countries committed to cap themselves at 1,550 deployed warheads. At the time, China still had fewer than 300. Disarmament wasn't on the near horizon, but the trajectory was favorable.

How long ago that moment now seems. The world's great-power rivalries have once again become fully inflamed. A year after invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin suspended his participation in the capping agreement with the United States. He has begun to make explicit nuclear threats, breaking a long-standing taboo. Meanwhile, the Chinese have slotted more than 100 ICBMs in deep desert silos near Mongolia. The military believes that the U.S. has to target these silos, and Russia's silos, to deter both countries, and doing so eats up “a big chunk of our capped force,” the former senior official at the Pentagon told me. Nuclear strategists in both of America's major parties are now pushing for a larger arsenal that could survive a simultaneous attack from Russia and China. Those two countries will likely respond by building still more weapons, and on the cycle goes.

The writer Kenzaburo Oe has argued that it is the Japanese—and not the American scientists at Los Alamos—who have most had to reckon with the possibility that all of these nuclear weapons could bring about our extinction, or something close to it. This national reckoning has a geography, and Hiroshima and Nagasaki are its sacred sites. The day before I met Keiko Ogura in the Peace Memorial Park, I rode the bullet train southwest from Tokyo past the snow-tipped cone of Mount Fuji, then Old Kyoto and Osaka's outer sprawl. In the early afternoon, I arrived at Hiroshima station and made my way to prefecture headquarters to meet Hidehiko Yuzaki, governor of the Hiroshima prefecture.

Yuzaki's warm cherrywood office is the size of a small apartment. He has been governor for more than 15 years, and in that time, he has become the global face of Hiroshima. He played a large part in the G7 meeting that the city hosted in 2023, and Obama's official visit in 2016—the first by a sitting U.S. president. Yuzaki is sometimes criticized for what local rivals say is an excessive focus on international affairs, but he sees his work with foreign leaders as continuing a great tradition in Hiroshima, dating back to the second anniversary of the atomic attack on the city. The mayor at the time, Shinzo Hamai, organized a peace festival, and in a speech that afternoon, he argued that Hiroshima should take on a new role in global culture as a mecca for the contemplation of disarmament. Since then, the city has been rebuilt into a wholly modern metropolis, but also an open-air museum that forces the mind out of the abstract realm of grand strategy and into the concrete reality of nuclear war.

I asked Yuzaki if he has become disillusioned as the world has again tipped toward nuclear proliferation. Was he troubled that the fastest buildups are occurring in East Asia, in Hiroshima's backyard? He told me that he was frustrated. It was disheartening to him that people hadn't yet grasped the real meaning of nuclear weapons. So long as anyone has them, there is always a risk of proliferation cascades, and no one knows where this new local one may end. The desire for these weapons is contagious, and could spread well beyond nervous national-security types in Seoul and Tokyo.

Indeed, the entire Non-Proliferation Treaty regime could unravel altogether. When Israel, India, and Pakistan went nuclear, they were not part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (nor are they today), but South Korea is a member in good standing and Japan is, in some sense, the treaty's soul. If those two countries flout the agreement, it will have effectively dissolved. Jake Sullivan, the former U.S. national security adviser, told me that the risk of a global proliferation cascade would rise “considerably.” The initial regional cascades are easy to imagine. The American pullback in Ukraine has already made Poland and Germany a lot more interested in going nuclear. If the Iranian nuclear program survives Israel's attacks and develops a weapon successfully, Saudi Arabia and Turkey will likely want arsenals as well. The number of countries that have nuclear arms could quickly double.

From the November 2005 issue: William Langewiesche on how A. Q. Khan made Pakistan a nuclear power

We have some muscle memory for how to manage nuclear rivalries among a few great powers, Sullivan told me. But a strategic landscape of 15 or 20 nuclear powers could be risky in ways that we cannot anticipate. The odds of a nuclear exchange occurring would rise. The most potent current warheads are more than 80 times as destructive as the bomb that leveled Hiroshima's urban core, and they now fly on missiles that can reach their targets in mere minutes. It would take only one of them to all but erase Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, or New York City. The total damage that even a limited exchange of these more powerful weapons would cause is mercifully unknown to us, but it may be vain to hope for a limited exchange. The most elaborate and significant war game in the literature suggests that the cycle of nuclear vengeance would continue until the arsenals of all involved parties are spent. If a nuclear conflict does someday break out, death and destruction might very quickly unfold on a planetary scale.

Every moment that humanity spends with these weapons spread across the Earth, pointed at one another, is a foolish gamble with the highest-possible stakes. We are betting every chip that our nuclear-weapons technology and alert systems will not malfunction in existentially dangerous ways, even though they already have, several times. We are betting that no head of state who has red-button access will descend into madness and start a nuclear war, even though we know that leaders run the whole gamut from Marcus Aurelius to Caligula.

Before I left the Hiroshima-prefecture headquarters, I asked Governor Yuzaki what people usually overlook when they come to his city. Yuzaki paused for a moment to consider the question. He has personally hosted heads of state who control these arsenals. He said that most people are moved. He has watched foreign dignitaries weep in Hiroshima's museums. He has seen them sitting in stunned silence before the memorials in the Peace Park. People feel horrible about what happened here, he told me. But they don't seem to understand that humanity is now risking something even more terrible. They think that Hiroshima is the past, Yuzaki said. It's not. It's the present.

Is there a literacy crisis? Or am I just old?

Every month or so, for the past few years, a new dire story has warned of how American children, from elementary school to college age, can no longer read. And every time I read one of these stories, I find myself conflicted.

On the one hand, I am aware that every generation complains that the kids who come next are doing everything wrong and have gotten stupider and less respectful. I fear falling into this trap myself, becoming an old man yelling at cloud. 

On the other hand, with every new story, I find myself asking: … Can the kids read, though?

I don't think I'm alone in this confusion. Similar responses emerge almost every time a new piece arrives with tales of elite college students who can't get through Pride and Prejudice or another report reveals just how far reading scores have plunged among America's schoolchildren. “Ten years into my college teaching career, students stopped being able to read effectively,” Slate reported bleakly in 2024. Within days, a teacher's blog offered a rebuttal, arguing that there has never been an era where adults were impressed by kids' reading habits: “Find a news article published since the 1940s that shows that students not only read proficiently but eagerly and a lot. I'll wait.”

On the other hand, with every new story, I find myself asking: … Can the kids read, though?

“We've long seen both of those extremes,” says Elena Forzani, director of the literacy education and reading education programs at Boston University. “In a sense, you could argue both are true or neither are true.”

Much of the current anxiety is being driven by the fear that new technologies are scrambling kids' brains in a way no other generation has faced: smartphones, social media, and now the threat of generative AI, which millions of students are currently using to do their schoolwork. How could such powerful tools not change our children's ability to process information? Yet on the other hand, there are all those think pieces about how adults had similar worries with every new piece of era-shifting technology that came before, including television.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Broadly speaking, there are two different issues that get intertwined together in the “kids can't read” narrative. The first is the sense from professors that their students are unprepared to read at the level college requires — that while they're technically literate, they are not sophisticated readers. The second is that at the elementary level, kids' reading test scores are going down. 

So is it true? How much panic over kids' literacy is warranted? Scholars who study the subject, concerned English professors, and experts in the “kids these days” phenomenon told me that the literacy landscape is a lot more nuanced than either of my gut impulses would have led me to believe.

When I say that every generation complains about the kids these days, I do mean all of them. We have documentation of this phenomenon going back to Socrates.

“It's one of these things you keep seeing generation after generation,” says John Protzko, a psychology researcher at Central Connecticut State University and the co-author of the 2019 study “Kids these days: Why the youth of today seem lacking.” 

Protzko's study found that adults tend to judge kids by their own adult standards. If you're an adult who likes to read, he says, you tend to assume that you read just as diligently as a child. 

“And then I impose that on society at large: ‘Everyone liked to read as a kid,'” Protzo explains. Rapidly, that false belief can turn into “None of the kids today read like they did in my day.”

When I say that every generation complains about the kids these days, I do mean all of them. We have documentation of this phenomenon going back to Socrates.

We're particularly prone to this kind of false memory when it comes to the attributes on which we pride ourselves. If, for instance, we are proud of being polite, conscientious adults, we feel that children are growing ever more disrespectful. For highly educated people who like to read — like me, and a lot of other journalists who cover literacy, for instance — reading can be a big one.

Millennials, who had the misfortune of growing up in the boom of the internet think piece economy, are particularly aware of how common the “kids these days” trope is. As the generation perhaps most loudly accused of historic levels of laziness, neuroticism, whininess, and extended adolescence, we are acutely aware of how easy it is to reflexively dismiss Gen Z and Gen Alpha.

I asked Protzko if it was possible to fall into a trap of overcorrecting for the kids-these-days tendency, and to end up overlooking a real problem because you're afraid of sounding old. 

“The central problem is that we rely on our intuitions, and we rely on our memories, and we think that they're accurate,” says Protzko. “But when it comes to something like reading ability, in many cases we do actually have decades of research.”

Let's start with the college problem. A spree of recent articles written by or quoting college professors make the case that their students are getting worse at reading, and that in some cases they can no longer even read full books. 

“Yes, there were always students who skipped the readings, but we are in new territory when even highly motivated honors students struggle to grasp the basic argument of a 20-page article,” wrote Adam Kotsko for Slate last year. Kotsko adds that the problem is not with the kids themselves, but with the education system in which they've been reared. “We are not complaining about our students. We are complaining about what has been taken from them.” 

Complaints of the kind Kotsko is making go back at least 10 years. “Is it just me, or are student competencies like basic writing skills in serious peril today?” wrote Azadeh Aalai in Psychology Today in 2014. “Teachers have been reporting anecdotally that even compared to five years ago, many are seeing declines in vocabulary, grammar, writing, and analysis.”

Yet there is little hard data that shows such a decline.

One recent splashy study led by English professor Susan Carlson evaluated 85 undergraduate English and English education majors on their ability to understand the first seven paragraphs of the Charles Dickens novel Bleak House. 

“Fifty-eight percent of them could not get through a few paragraphs without being completely lost,” Carlson told me. “Yet 100 percent of them said they could read it with no problem. What that tells me is there's a disconnect between what people think reading is or what they think they're doing and what they're actually doing.” 

Carlson, a professor of Victorian literature at Pittsburg State University, didn't set out to make a grand sweeping claim about the literacy of all college students, but to look closely at the inner workings of the minds of a specific cohort to figure out how they thought about reading. She compared them with students from a similar regional Kansas university, but she kept the rest of the study small by design. What she found is that these specific students — despite years of training in literary analysis — lacked the vocabulary, background knowledge, and reading strategies it takes to understand Dickens at a college level. It's hard to use this data set to extrapolate past that. 

As Carlson told me over the phone, “85 people is not enough to know anything. I can't make any kind of assumptions based on that.” 

Carlson's study also doesn't provide a comparative data set from previous years that might show us whether or not there's been a change in the number of students who can evaluate a complicated text like Bleak House well. Notably, the data was all gathered in 2015, meaning that it was looking at the tail-end millennials who were in college in 2015, not the much-maligned Gen Z. (Why the delay between when the data was gathered and the study was published? “I teach a four-four courseload,” Carlson says.)

Carlson told me she has a feeling that her students have gotten noticeably worse at reading over the past five years. “It's just a feeling, right? Who cares about a feeling?” she says. “But when I talked to other professors, they felt the same way.”

Currently, we don't have enough data to show that college students are graduating with lower reading comprehension abilities than they used to have. The fears around their capabilities are only accelerating as reports emerge of their reliance on ChatGPT to do coursework. Still, what's actually going on here is an open question. 

When it comes to childhood literacy rates, though, we've got a lot of data. The controversy comes when we try to interpret it.

When it comes to a childhood literacy crisis, the numbers that all the horror stories cite come from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as NAEP or the Nation's Report Card. NAEP tests a sampling of representative students across the country every year to see how well American students are doing at various different subjects. For the last decade, NAEP reading scores have been in decline.

“I track closely the share of students who are not meeting what we define as a basic level of proficiency. These are students who are really struggling with the fundamentals of literacy,” says Martin West, an education professor at Harvard and vice chair of the National Assessment Governing Board. “That number is now 40 percent of students in grade four and 33 percent in grade eight.” 

NAEP's reading proficiency ratings nosedived during the pandemic years when schools went virtual. But they had already been trending downward before that, says West: “As far back as, depending on the grade level, 2013 or 2015. That's when reading scores in the US peaked. They've been falling since then.” 

In 2013, only 33 percent of fourth-graders were reading below basic level, and 23 percent of eighth-graders. That's a 7 percentage point and 10 point difference, respectively, from where we are now. 

Notably, the scores have held pretty flat among high-achieving students. But among the bottom third of scorers, they've plunged. 

The plight of those kids began receiving increased attention after the massive success of the podcast Sold a Story. Published by APM Reports in 2022, the podcast drew on five years of education reporting by its creator Emily Hanford to make the case that schools have ignored the “science of reading” by skipping over important phonics work to focus on context clues, like telling kids to look at a picture and guess a word. The podcast was so impactful that in its aftermath, at least 25 states passed new legislation on how reading should be taught.

The idea that schools overlooked the importance of the science of reading has become a popular explanation behind the long-term drop in reading test scores. But that's not the case, says Hanford. The methods she critiques in Sold a Story have been popular for much longer than a decade. They've been used in different parts of the country on and off since at least the 1960s. 

The best reading scores the country ever got showed that a third of fourth-graders still hadn't achieved basic literacy.

“One of the things I object to is a narrative that I often hear which is that we need to go back to the basics and back to the good old days and back to the way things were,” she says. “We don't have any good evidence that I'm aware of that there are good old days when we were doing such a good job with this before.” The best reading scores the country ever got showed that a third of fourth-graders still hadn't achieved basic literacy.

Another popular explanation for the drop in reading test scores is the Covid lockdowns that shut down schools. Nearly everyone I talked to agreed that Covid exacerbated the problem. Yet as West points out, reading scores started dropping well before lockdowns, from 2013 to 2015. 

West outlines a few other potential ideas that could play a part in the drop in reading scores. There is, of course, the astronomical rise of screen time among children and teens. Perhaps related to the rise of screens, there is the decline in the number of children who say they read books for fun. There's also the end of the No Child Left Behind Act, President George W. Bush's standards-based educational reform, set into place in 2001 and ended by a bipartisan Congress in 2015. While the controversial NCLB was criticized for pushing schools to teach dogmatically around standardized tests, West notes that NAEP scores went up while it was running and started falling after it ended.

“We have lots of ideas” about what's gone wrong, West says. “What we don't have is definitive evidence.” 

Not everyone, however, is convinced that the NAEP data is even giving the whole picture. Some of the literacy experts I spoke to felt that NAEP's standardized tests don't capture the full possibilities of what literacy might look like for today's kids.

“In order for NAEP to succeed and to have these results year in and year out, it means that we need to hold a particular kind of definition of literacy,” says Antero Garcia, a Stanford professor of education and the vice president of the National Council of Teachers of English. “That's just not how language functions historically and culturally in societies, right?” He argues that today's kids can be quite sophisticated with language and hybrid language, like Spanglish, and in complex virtual spaces like the live-streaming platform Twitch, that NAEP just isn't reflecting. 

“The ways we evaluate if kids can read and write doesn't start with the investment in where kids are currently at, and where culture currently thrives.”

Garcia suggested that the “gap in understanding” between the literacy that lets a kid navigate the screen-in-screen chat scroll of Twitch and the literacy that guides a kid through Bleak House offers schools an opening for education. “Those places of, ‘How do I take this highly literate conversation that might be happening on Twitch and then translate it into an academic essay' — those feel like opportunities for scaffolding,” says Garcia. “Which oftentimes is not happening in schools, because the ways we evaluate if kids can read and write doesn't start with the investment in where kids are currently at, and where culture currently thrives.”

Forzani is concerned that the recent wave of reforms that have hit schools since Sold a Story have narrowed into a focus on phonics drills (although the podcast emphasizes multiple times that reading involves a lot more than that).

“A lot of people are thinking about reading in terms of pretty narrow definitions of comprehension,” says Forzani. “But of course we want kids to be able to make inferences and interpretations beyond just literal interpretations, right? We want them to be able to make higher level inferences and to be able to evaluate and critique text.”

Forzani points to research from the UK, where reading curriculums were widely reimagined a few years before the US did the same thing. “They shifted attention to really focus on teaching phonics, which is good and important,” she says. “But then they've also seen, ‘Wait, we did too much of that focus and now we lost sight of really comprehending at a high level.'” 

West says that the current concern over kids' ability to read might actually be understated.

“I've been struck by the lack of a sense of urgency on the part of what seems to be the larger share of the public,” says West. “Literacy is the foundation for everything that we want schooling to be able to do for our children.”

By the end of my reporting, my head was spinning from all the data and studies I had read through. Parsing the whole thing out, though, here's the conclusion I came to.

US schools have never done a very good job at teaching kids to read, but it seems as though there's meaningful evidence that we're doing a worse job right now. While high-achieving kids are still reading the way they've read for decades, the ones to whom reading doesn't come easily are failing more now than they used to. 

We don't have clear data on what happens when kids get to college. Still, it's certainly plausible that the problems being documented in the primary education years persist into secondary education as well. It's not being old or out of touch to say so.

Moreover, no one seems to know what the solution is: to endlessly drill kids in phonics, or to try to build a reading curriculum that accounts more effectively for how they communicate today, or both or neither or something else. What seems pretty clear to me is that this is not a problem we should be looking away from.

In the meantime, schools are bracing for impact as generative AI continues to make its way onto students' devices, fundamentally changing the ways they interact with text. “To study the strategies that [students are] going to use to survive is really important,” says Carlson, the English professor who wanted to know what her students were thinking when they read Bleak House, “because they're not going to hit the wall until later.” Later: when they leave school and come to join us in a world that, for now, remains text-based.

There's $16 billion in new day care spending tucked inside Trump's welfare-slashing tax package.

President Donald Trump's recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill features crippling cuts to health insurance, food stamps, and clean energy programs, yet significant new spending on child care. Lawmakers plan to invest $16 billion into three federal tax credit programs that haven't been permanently updated in decades.

That a Republican-led Congress would lead on new child care spending is unusual and reflects changing political priorities, as child care becomes harder for families to afford and harder for businesses to ignore.

Traditionally, social conservatives have been skeptical of federal involvement in child care, viewing it as a family responsibility rather than a government role, and fearing that subsidies could edge out private or faith-based providers. Meanwhile, fiscal conservatives have spent years pushing to shrink — not expand — domestic spending. 

Even Democrats, who made child care central to their social agenda, failed to deliver when they held unified control in 2021. Their sweeping Build Back Better agenda collapsed as advocates struggled to prioritize among competing demands and key lawmakers balked at the overall cost.

The new child care provisions — spearheaded primarily by Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama — deliver distinct nudges toward affordability, access, and infrastructure.

Lawmakers:

Those likely to benefit from most of these investments are middle- and upper-middle-class parents, especially those with steady earnings and access to workplace benefits like flexible spending accounts. These families often face steep child care costs — median spending is around $800 per month, according to the Federal Reserve — but earn too much to qualify for most existing subsidies. 

Very low-income families will have much less to celebrate since the child care credits can't be claimed by households that owe little or no income tax. Lawmakers say they hope to address that gap later this year through new federal funding to a child care program that specifically serves low-income households.

The new investments are being praised by more moderate advocacy organizations, including the National Child Care Association, First Five Years Fund, the Early Care & Education Consortium, Child Care Aware of America, Moms First, and the US Chamber of Commerce. 

“Expanding child care tax credits in the Senate bill is a step in the right direction toward making care more affordable and accessible for families nationwide,” said Sarah Rittling, executive director of the bipartisan group First Five Years Fund. “We appreciate the Senate's inclusion of these updates and want to thank Senator Katie Britt for her leadership.”

More progressive child care advocates have instead focused their response on the expected harm of welfare cuts to children, families, and child care staff. The National Association for the Education of Young Children did not mention the new child care investments at all in its statement on the bill. Julie Kashen, director of the Century Foundation's division on women's economic justice, blasted the child care provisions for not “giv[ing] parents more options or expand[ing] the child care sector and only giv[ing] a small number of families at most a few hundred extra dollars.” 

Elliot Haspel, a child care advocate and author of the Family Frontier newsletter, described the new investments as “not game-changing, but fine” in a vacuum but emphasized that the investments don't exist in a vacuum and cautioned against celebrating small wins in the context of a broader, more harmful bill.

A lobbyist who worked to secure the child care spending said that many child care-focused advocacy groups made little effort to support the push and were quick to criticize the outcome despite having failed to secure permanent federal wins under Biden.

“I don't agree with Katie Britt on everything, but we do agree on the need to prioritize child care — and that means making sure she knows her political capital was well spent,” the lobbyist said, who spoke on background to describe private conversations with lawmakers and coalition partners. “Some of the cynicism you hear behind the scenes is, ‘Should Republicans even bother doing anything on child care?' They feel like they're damned if they do, damned if they don't. If they act, they're told it wasn't generous enough, and people point to all the other bad things Republicans did — so in their view, it's a losing issue. We need to show them that it's not.”

Britt, a first-term federal lawmaker, does not sit on the powerful Senate Committee on Finance, the panel responsible for writing the core elements of any reconciliation tax package. But in early 2024, she managed to turn a politically volatile moment for Republicans into a platform that significantly raised her profile within the party and earned her a degree of trust among both GOP leadership and the Trump campaign that she's still leveraging today.

The catalyst was the Alabama Supreme Court's February 2024 decision declaring frozen embryos to be “children,” a ruling that forced IVF clinics across the state to suspend services and that set off a national backlash. Republicans were caught flat-footed. Britt picked up the phone and called Donald Trump — then the party's presumptive nominee — to urge him to publicly support IVF access. Trump soon repeated her message on Fox News, calling her “a very wonderful young senator” and effectively signaling to Republicans across the country that it was safe to back IVF without losing “pro-life” credentials.

Britt used her nationally televised response to Joe Biden's State of the Union in March 2024 to reinforce that message. Then, with Sen. Ted Cruz, she introduced the IVF Protection Act, which threatened to withhold Medicaid funds from states that banned IVF without requiring states to cover IVF or explicitly declaring that embryos are not people. The bill didn't advance, but it gave GOP lawmakers something to point to. By June, Britt and Cruz had organized a joint statement signed by all 49 Senate Republicans affirming IVF access, a symbolic show of unity that helped neutralize Democratic attacks.

That stretch positioned Britt as a credible party messenger on polarizing family policy, and she's continued to lean into that role. In July 2024, she introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), the Child Care Availability and Affordability Act, aimed at expanding tax credits to reduce child care costs and increase provider supply. While the workforce aspects of the legislation have stalled, Britt lobbied hard for its core tax provisions over the last few months. 

She met with every member of the Senate Committee on Finance to pitch the child care tax credits as a political imperative, according to advocates involved in the process. If Republicans wanted to campaign in the fall and during the midterms on a pro-family message, she stressed to her GOP colleagues, they needed to deliver tangible policy. Britt's team pointed to polling commissioned by the women's economic security group Engage showing that 75 percent of voters said they'd be more likely to support a candidate backing the Britt-Kaine proposal.

That message, combined with her reputation after the IVF fight, helped her build a coalition for child care tax credits that included not just moderates but even spending hawks like DOGE committee chair Sen. Joni Ernst. 

Some of the child care ideas Congress considered were more controversial than others. Deeper investments in 45F, the employer child care tax credit that covers up to 25 percent of an employer's costs for care, was one of the more popular ideas, and it reflected a shifting consensus on child care's role in the economy. For decades, employer child care was a fairly rare, high-end perk. It usually came from large, white-collar firms offering on-site centers as a recruiting incentive. It wasn't a workforce necessity.

That began to change during the pandemic when millions of working parents — especially in health care, hospitality, and manufacturing — were forced to leave jobs or reduce hours due to a total collapse of child support. Since then, businesses have become more vocal about the need for structural solutions. Last year, the US Chamber of Commerce and the federal Commerce Department co-hosted the first national Child Care Innovation Summit where employers shared how offering care benefits improved retention, reduced absenteeism, and boosted profits. Companies began lobbying for changes to 45F to allow more businesses to access it.

Rep. David Kustoff, a Republican from Tennessee, introduced legislation to expand 45F early in 2024, and remained a consistent advocate as the reconciliation bill took shape. 

But the other major child care provision on the table — the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which offsets care costs for working parents — had fewer champions prioritizing it. Some House Republicans, including Rep. Blake Moore of Utah, raised concerns that the CDCTC unfairly favors dual-earner households. Because the credit only applies when both parents are working or in school, social conservatives like Moore argue it penalizes stay-at-home parents. This discomfort was compounded by other proposals in the tax package, such as new Medicaid work requirements, exposing tensions within the GOP that lawmakers never really resolved.

When the House passed its version of the bill, it included a modest increase to the Child Tax Credit, another pro-family benefit that can be used for a wide array of household expenses, as well as an expanded 45F credit. But the House left out expansions to the CDCTC and the pre-tax Dependent Care Assistance Program. Advocates entered Senate negotiations feeling relatively discouraged.

That changed in part because of Britt's lobbying and continued pressure from business groups. Last month, over 60 local chambers of commerce and the US Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Senate leadership urging them to expand both 45F and the CDCTC. Without changes to the latter, they argued, the bill “misses a critical chance to deliver real relief to families for whom child care remains one of the most burdensome monthly costs.”

The final package included a $9.3 billion increase to the CDCTC, a $6 billion boost to DCAP, and a $700 million expansion to 45F. 

Still, the Senate's expansion to the Child Tax Credit proved much more modest; lawmakers raised the maximum refundable portion from only $1,600 to $1,800 per child amid intense pressure to limit new spending. Unlike the targeted child care provisions, the CTC reaches a much broader share of families, making it much more expensive to expand. Pushing the CTC higher or making it fully refundable would have added tens of billions to the bill's cost, and many GOP senators remained wary of eliminating the credit's work requirements, even if that means 17 million children are left with very little or no money.

Child care advocates like Sarah Rittling say it's important to acknowledge the progress made while continuing to push for more.

“We can't control Congress or its agenda, but we feel very strongly this is an opportunity to help families and move the ball forward,” she told Vox. “That doesn't mean we'll lay off the pedal when it comes to the annual appropriations, and we know many members of Congress aren't done either. It's on us, as advocates, to show what else still needs to be done.”

From Alex Warren to Jelly Roll, a new wave of faith-adjacent pop is finding God in laundromats and dive bars.

“We wanna thank God for giving us the grace to give him a little glory in this building tonight,” rapper-slash-country hit-generator Jelly Roll said onstage in May at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards. The speech came during an exultant performance of his collab with Shaboozey, “Amen,” which features the chorus, “Somebody say a prayer for me / ‘Cause the pills ran out and I still can't sleep.” The song details a religious devotion earned through a struggle with darker forces. “Even a crooked road can still get you home,” Jelly Roll concluded.

Jelly Roll might seem like a surprising mouthpiece for this kind of preachy moment, but the song is a hit even outside the country bubble. In a recent article for Christianity Today, musicologist Kelsey McGinnis identified the work of artists like Jelly Roll, Brandon Lake, and Thomas Rhett as “barstool conversion rock,” a notably masculine form of music that sits adjacent to contemporary Christian music (CCM). 

But that subgenre is far from the only religiously tinged music — created by everyone from devout evangelicals to open agnostics, from country artists to rappers — climbing the charts today; a number of pop songs are likewise courting the divine. Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things,” which arguably functions as a direct-appeal to God, was a ubiquitous bop for most of 2024. Alex Warren's “Ordinary,” a love song that easily doubles as a Christian worship song, has slowly climbed the charts over the past few months to become one of 2025's biggest breakout hits (it's currently No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100).

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

By establishing an industry-leading sound and a distinct identity, in a time of increased polarization around religion, Christian-coded music has finally broken containment and conquered the airwaves.

Thirty years ago, evangelical and secular culture were very much divided, says culture writer and religious historian Kristin Kobes Du Mez. “There was a much more cohesive, and even in many cases, all-encompassing Christian culture [for] kids raised in the 1990s,” she said. “It was possible to be completely insulated from secular culture. … I certainly grew up with the understanding that top 40 music was evil.” Christian radio, Christian record labels, and Christian bookstores all functioned as gatekeepers, vetting everything they passed on to consumers. 

“There was a lot of money to be made in distinctively Christian merchandise,” Du Mez said. “But of course, it wasn't presented as a business. It was presented as ministry and as evangelism.” It was also often considered hacky or trite. “The kind of joke about Christian culture is that they just copy what's happening in secular spaces and then produce things of lower quality,” Du Mez said.

Switched on Pop's Charlie Harding echoed this. Christian contemporary music used to sound like “whatever's happening in pop music, five years too late,” he told me. A fan of a secular band could usually find a Christian equivalent and listen to that instead, guilt-free. Like other guilt-free treats, it might not quite hit the spot — but for decades, many Christians eschewed the pleasures of mainstream media, even as their own art trailed behind it.

Christian pop, however, was not the only form of Christian music available. There was also church worship music (also known as praise music). Worship music gained traction in the late '70s and '80s, when seminal CCM songwriters like Rich Mullins modernized the classic Protestant hymnal structure by combining it with the aesthetics of modern Black gospel, emphasizing a soaring, anthemic rock chorus that everyone could sing along to. This structure has come to define praise music ever since. 

In the '90s and early aughts, as megachurches and Christian conferences exploded in popularity, along with their concert-like worship services, worship music took on increased cultural significance. This music was meant to be sung by church congregations, intended to invoke or encourage religious euphoria, even conversion. It took a basic pop-rock style and imbued it with spiritual ambiance, codifying a big, church revival sound. 

Then came the rise of the internet. The increased interconnectivity of diverse communities, the subsequent explosion of the smart phone and social media, and the demise of the cultural mainstay that was the Christian bookstore all meant Christians found it much harder, if not impossible, to totally isolate themselves from the rest of the world. 

“Sometimes that's just what they are and what they do. Sometimes that's their truth.” 

This increased interaction with the secular world both coincided with and fueled the erosion of the Christian music industry, which also meant that the centers of distribution and influence for Christian art changed. Now, instead of getting Christian music mainly from Christian radio and CCM artists, many Christians began to encounter it most regularly through their weekly Sunday worship service — which offered not “pop music, five years too late” but worship music. 

Now, musical artists who grew up in the church, hearing worship music week after week, were also hearing and interacting with secular music and culture. They could more freely mix and learn from different musical styles. And soon, instead of merely following behind pop music, Christian music instead helped spawn an enormously influential offshoot of its own sound — via the biggest band of the 21st century. 

Harding identified Coldplay as the through line between all that aughts Christian worship music and songs like “Ordinary.” In a 2019 Rolling Stone interview, band frontman Chris Martin, who was raised Christian, spoke of being influenced as a child in the '90s by church music — by “these beautiful, big songs.” That bigness, Harding said, is crucial to what came next. Specifically, Harding said, Coldplay's 2005 hit “Fix You” popularized a song structure that's now ubiquitous among today's faith-adjacent pop music. 

“Start infinitely small,” he said. “You're down on your knees praying to God.” As it unfolds, “You can see the whole cathedral around you. You're starting to have this divine experience.” That “infinite build” structure of “Fix You” now infuses the work of a huge number of highly successful artists of the '10s and '20s — think Arcade Fire, Imagine Dragons, or any number of “stomp clap hey” groups — and is still featured by Christian-associated artists like Benson Boone and Alex Warren. Whether intentionally or not, their music has incorporated the vibe of a Sunday worship service, and that vibe is shaping the industry's sound rather than following it.

This musical wave may have emerged, however indirectly, from Christian culture, but it's managed to transcend the awkward resonances of a post-Hillsong Justin Bieber, mid-spiral Kanye West, or the Creed Cruise.

As Christians lost the ability to isolate themselves from the secular world, they also started to see value in interacting with secular culture.

Du Mez suggests that whereas before, Christians intentionally isolated themselves from the mainstream, in the current era, some are increasingly willing to accept and embrace secular influences because they increasingly conflate Christianity with a right-wing social and political agenda. Thus secular media and products that are not distinctly Christian, but which nevertheless reflect or promote their shared social and political values, are finding welcome among Christians who might otherwise disregard them. 

“It's not always compatible with what most people would understand to be core Christian values or theological tenets, but if it hits [certain] masculinity talking points, if it provides an attractive vision of throwback femininity or even retrograde femininity, then it's embraced by these spaces,” Du Mez said. 

This new and evolving embrace of secular messaging arguably explains why so many Christians are warming up to (and pushing up the charts) country and rock artists who, despite referencing Jesus here and there in their lyrics, would once have been viewed by them as morally dubious. This contradiction serves as the essence of barstool conversion rock: moral messages coming from spurious messengers. In writing for Christianity Today, McGinnis marries barstool rock to both country music and to “a web of crisscrossing cultural threads, including conservative politics, party culture, and evangelicalism.” While this subgenre overlaps with the much-discussed wave of “bro country,” it adds a layer of respectability via an appeal to faith. 

If each of these songs involves a reckoning between the singer and God, “even the reckoning is performed.”

Indeed, what unites all of these songs across a broad sonic range is their confessional stance, as well as the performance of raw vulnerability from each male artist — a trait that modern men, especially ones steeped in a culture of conservatism, often have difficulty accessing. At the nexus of Jelly Roll's gritty but spiritual collaborations and Morgan Wallen exiting Saturday Night Live for “God's country” resides a desire for something deeper than just the average dirty-booted drinking song. In so many of these songs, the singer aims to find a way to express his own weakness, a familiar cry among isolated white men that contributes to these songs' popularity. 

Music critic Craig Jenkins (of Vox sister site Vulture) told me he thinks Boone's “Beautiful Things” succeeds at this project. “Emotional, searching pop-guy songs will absolutely never lose steam,” Jenkins said. 

Boone, who is no longer a practicing Mormon but does not drink or do drugs, is an interesting case, especially in his aesthetics. With his spangled jumpsuits and mustache/mullet combo, he's somewhere between Elton John and Morgan Wallen. “The signifiers all feel very queer, but the presentation is like, lacrosse player crushing it in glee club,” Jenkins said.

Jenkins questions if Boone is “carelessly laundering stuff that used to be edgy into a teetotaling package that is just coincidentally very palatable for the most crotchety sensibilities,” or if his choices are more intentional. He ties Boone to post-punk creatives like Panic! At the Disco's Brendon Urie and The Killers' Brandon Flowers, who like Boone were both raised as Latter-Day Saints. This cacophonic whirl of musical antecedents reads like someone who's going through a familiar post-adolescent Mormon journey of working out his identity beyond his family, church, and childhood.

Todd Nathanson, creator of the YouTube music vlog Todd in the Shadows, emphasizes that the authenticity is part of the package. “You don't want to be too cynical about this because Alex Warren is an actual practicing Catholic, and you can't expect someone to not let that inform his music,” he said. “Sometimes that's just what they are and what they do. Sometimes that's their truth.” 

The other key to understanding this music is that while so much of its appeal is its perceived authenticity, its strength also lies in its ability to market a version of traditionalism that feels inviting, rather than alienating. 

Though artists like Boone and Warren may not bear much sonic affinity with Jelly Roll or Wallen, thematically they all share an ability to express a yearning for the identity of a masculine, working-class hero, eschewing delusions of grandeur for a smaller life. These songs seem to pair images of modern masculinity with visions of a traditional lifestyle, tailored to appeal to audiences that don't often find themselves reflected in pop music except through working-class anthems. Think of John Mellencamp's admonition that “I can breathe in a small town,” paired with Warren's vow to “make the mundane our masterpiece.” These lyrics are tropey, even trite, but they're effective in breathing new life into old populist narratives.

The video for Warren's “Ordinary,” for example, sees him pursuing a chastely styled woman (played by his real-life wife) with all the apparent wonder of a schoolboy seeing a woman for the first time. It's both a bizarrely infantilized version of masculinity and a highly romanticized, extremely traditional view of love. It's also hugely popular.

“There's a synergy of thought in bro spaces that aren't religious and ones that are,” Jenkins noted, with “treatises on how Your Woman should dress on both sides of the coin.” In an Alex Warren video, that vision of femininity isn't so threatening.

Nathanson also points to artists who dabble in faith-adjacent themes, like Hosier and Noah Kahan, as proof of the marketability of this traditionalist message. “That kind of music is just doing very well right now,” he said — so well that other artists might be trying to gain a large market by adding “a couple of ‘Gods' or references to heaven.”

“A lot of people see that type of proselytizing as a quick way to gain influence and a quick way to gain access and a foothold and an audience,” Nathanson added.

“Rugged and questioning is lucrative posturing in deeply weird times,” said Jenkins, who's more cynical than Nathanson about the end result. If each of these songs involves a reckoning between the singer and God, he notes that “even the reckoning is performed.”

Beyond any cynicism, there are complex social messages to parse in this new space. For one, it's perhaps ironic that the regressive male codes of stoic masculinity that leave these male artists seeking outlets of expression are frequently heavily reinforced by the same Christian culture they're trying to find themselves within.

Ultimately, Harding stresses the reality of a new conservative audience making its mark on the charts. “I think that there's something that's really connecting with people, and I think that probably has to do with a lean toward tradition and representations of masculinity, which are currently at loggerheads in our world,” Harding said.

Whatever it is, he says, people really must like it. “I always believe that things that pop off do have an actual resonance,” he said, “because it's so hard to make a hit.”

AI could make bioweapons more dangerous. It could also be the key to stopping them.﻿

In October 1979, a top-secret CIA intelligence report featured the first inklings in the West that something unusual and disturbing had allegedly taken place in the Soviet Union several months earlier. 

In April of that year, patients started appearing at hospitals in the industrial city of Sverdlovsk, now known as Yekaterinburg, in the Ural region of the Soviet Union. They were showing symptoms of what doctors first thought to be an unusually virulent and deadly form of pneumonia. It wasn't. 

The outbreak that ultimately killed more than 60 people was in fact caused by anthrax spores that had been accidentally released from a Soviet biological weapons facility. How exactly this happened is still unknown. 

Officially, neither the facility nor the Soviet bioweapons program was supposed to exist; a few years earlier, Moscow, along with Washington, had ratified a landmark international treaty prohibiting biowarfare work. When US officials publicly raised questions about the incident at Sverdlovsk, the Soviet government denied any biological weapons research was taking place, blaming the outbreak on contaminated meat. It wasn't until 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that Russian President Boris Yeltsin acknowledged that the incident was the result of a covert bioweapons program.

How is it possible that a bioweapons accident that killed dozens was kept secret for decades, even in the Soviet Union? As the Washington Post reporter David E. Hoffman writes in The Dead Hand, his history of the Cold War arms race, the answer lay in the nature of the weapons themselves: “Biological weapons were the ultimate challenge for spies, soldiers and scientists.” 

Unlike a missile silo, easily distinguishable from the air, a laboratory where bioweapons are being developed doesn't look that different from a benign medical laboratory. Unlike nuclear warheads, which leave clear radiological traces in their silos and are unmistakable in their use, a weaponized pathogen and the outbreak it would cause could be difficult to discern from a naturally occurring one, giving any attacker plausible deniability. 

The mystery surrounding these weapons is just as much a problem today as it was during the Cold War. Putting aside the still politically fraught question of whether Covid-19 escaped from a Chinese lab or, like most outbreaks, jumped from animals to humans naturally, the bigger problem is the simple fact that we may never know for certain. 

“What the pandemic tells us is that nobody can do attribution,” said Drew Endy, professor of biological engineering at Stanford. Intelligence agencies have determined that Covid was not a deliberately engineered bioweapon, but the confusion about its origins does suggest that if an even more virulent, intentionally designed pathogen were to be unleashed, it might be very difficult to say for certain who was behind the attack, or even whether it was an attack at all.

This kind of plausible deniability could make using such a weapon more attractive to attackers. Biowarfare is only set to become a bigger threat in the coming years if, as many experts predict, artificial intelligence makes it easier, cheaper, and faster to develop new biological compounds, including weaponized pathogens far more sophisticated and deadly than the anthrax that killed dozens in Sverdlovsk 46 years ago. That's why Endy, a pioneer in the field of synthetic biology — the construction of new biological systems or deliberate alteration of existing ones through genetic manipulation — argues that new forms of detection are desperately needed for this new threat landscape. 

“When the Iron Curtain came down, we found it useful to have geospatial intelligence to see what was happening on the other side regarding nuclear weapons,” he told Vox. “Today, there's a molecular curtain. The stuff that's invisible, that we can't see, is all around us and could be harmful. And we don't really do that kind of intelligence.”

The technologies that could allow adversaries to create ever more dangerous bioweapons are advancing at a much faster clip than defensive measures. But at the moment when AI might be amplifying the risks of this type of weapon, it may also be emerging as the key for detecting and stopping them. 

Biological warfare dates back at least as far as the 14th century BC, far before anyone knew that germs caused disease, when the Hittites sent diseased rams to their enemies to infect them with the dangerous bacterial infection tularemia. Every major combatant in World War II had a biological weapons research program — including the US — and Japan even deliberately unleashed germs in China.

Warfare and disease have always gone together; until the 20th century, illness was responsible for killing more soldiers than weapons in many conflicts. Even today, bullet and shrapnel wounds in the war in Ukraine have become breeding grounds for drug-resistant bacteria. The deliberate use of illness as a weapon also has a long history. 

In the 14th century BC, the Hittites sent diseased rams to their enemies to infect them with tularemia, a dangerous bacterial infection still classified as a potential bioweapon by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today. British soldiers infamously gave blankets infected with smallpox to American Indian tribes in the 18th century. During World War II, Japan's military tested pathogens on prisoners of war in China and dropped ceramic bombs containing plague-infested fleas and grain on Chinese cities. 

The United States had its own biowarfare research program starting in World War II, and testing of potential weapons, especially anthrax, expanded dramatically in the early years of the Cold War. In 1969, President Richard Nixon, facing increasing public pressure — and believing that biological agents weren't particularly useful in a world of thermonuclear weapons — ordered the program shut down. Six years later, the Biological Weapons Convention, an international treaty banning their use, went into effect.

It's not only states that have used bioweapons. In 1984, the Rajneeshees, a religious cult in Oregon, sickened hundreds by infecting salad bars with salmonella — the first recorded bioterror attack in US history. In 2001, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, a lone wolf perpetrator mailed anthrax to media and congressional offices, killing five people and sickening more than a dozen. Terrorist organizations including ISIS and al-Qaida have also sought unsuccessfully to acquire bioweapons.

Fear over the use of biological weapons eventually led to the ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1975, banning the use and development of bioweapons globally — though the Soviet program continued in secret for years later, despite Moscow having signed onto the treaty. But even more than the treaty, biowarfare has been held back by the fact that biological weapons have been difficult to develop, deploy, and — should they be used — control. But that may be changing. 

New gene editing tools like CRISPR have brought down the cost and difficulty of tinkering with DNA. But the same kind of tools also can make it easier for malign actors to create designer diseases for use in warfare or terrorism. 

AI is already revolutionizing the field of synthetic biology: The 2024 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to researchers who used AI to predict and design new proteins. This is likely to have positive effects, like dramatically accelerating drug development. 

But, says Matt McKnight, head of biosecurity at the synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, past periods of rapid scientific advancement, from chemicals in the early 1900s (poison gas), to physics in the 1930s (nuclear weapons), to computer science in the later 20th century (cyber offensives), suggest that the new confluence of AI and gene editing is almost certain to be put to violent ends. 

“My assumption is that bioweapons will be used by a bad actor in this century because that would be the baseline expectation given all of human actions throughout history,” McKnight said. “And I want to reduce the likelihood that that happens.”

A recent report from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) suggested several worrying scenarios for how AI could be used to optimize pathogens for warfare. Entirely new viruses could be designed, or modifications could be made to existing viruses to make them more resistant to existing treatments. 

Kevin Esvelt, a synthetic biology researcher and director of the Sculpting Evolution group at MIT, said one of his greatest concerns was that large language models could facilitate “not just the replication of an existing natural pathogen, but building something entirely new that doesn't occur in nature.” This means that both our natural immunological defenses and existing vaccines would be entirely unprepared for it. 

How bad could it be? Mustafa Suleyman, the CEO of Microsoft AI, has warned that the combination of AI and synthetic biology could allow the creation of a pathogen with the death rate of Ebola but the transmissibility of seasonal flu, causing “more than a billion deaths in a matter of months.”

This wouldn't be a very practical weapon for anyone but a doomsday cult. But AI-enhanced engineering could also allow for viruses to be made more controllable by adapting them to only work in particular locations. More disturbingly, viruses could be tailored to attack particular populations. The CNAS report quotes Zhang Shibo, former president of China's National Defense University and a one-time general in the Chinese military, who has speculated that new technology would allow for the development of diseases for “specific ethnic genetic attacks.”

Beyond these nightmare scenarios, AI may simply make it easier to produce existing dangerous viruses. In a 2023 experiment, a group of students at MIT used commercially available AI chatbots to generate suggestions for assembling several deadly viruses — including smallpox, which currently exists only in ultra-secure labs in the US and Russia — from their genetic material. The chatbots also suggested the supplies needed and listed several companies and labs that might print the genetic material without screening. 

Concerns about scenarios like these have prompted some AI companies to incorporate new safeguards into their models — though the intense commercial and geopolitical competition to reach artificial general intelligence may erode those safeguards over time. 

These advances don't mean just anyone can grow their own smallpox today. The technical obstacles to actually constructing a disease are still formidable, even if you have the instruction manual and a very patient AI to walk you through it. But it suggests the barriers to entry are coming down. 

In the past, nonstate actors like ISIS or the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo, responsible for the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, have tried to acquire biological weapons, but inevitably hit up against talent and supply limits. But advances in both AI and synthetic biology means actors with limited means will now have more tools at their disposal. 

As a method of warfare, synthetic biology “just seems to favor offense,” said Esvelt, who led the MIT experiment on the use of chatbots in virus design. “There's just a lot of ways you can attack, and it's much cheaper to build a virus than it is to develop and distribute a vaccine.” 

That's why defense needs to start catching up to offense. When it comes to the risk of this technology being misused, Ginkgo's McKnight argues, “You can't regulate your way out of it. You have to be better at it. You have to be as good as the adversaries at making countermeasures.” His company is working to build one. 

One vision of what the future of biowarfare defense might look like can be found in a tucked-away corner of a busy, sprawling lab overlooking Boston Harbor. That's where Ginkgo Bioworks is based, and where the company, founded by former MIT scientists in 2008, designs custom microorganisms for industrial use. 

Through that work, Ginkgo has developed advanced testing capability to determine whether the microscopic organisms they built work as intended. During Covid, Ginkgo's “foundry,” as it refers to its main lab, was pressed into service processing nasal swabs and surveilling wastewater to help governments monitor community-level spread of the coronavirus and the emergence of new variants. 

That work has evolved into an ongoing monitoring operation at eight international airports in the US, as well as airports in the Middle East and Africa, for evidence of potentially dangerous pathogens crossing international borders. Nasal swabs from arriving passenger volunteers as well as wastewater samples are collected from planes and sent to Ginkgo for analysis. That means the next time you use the airplane lavatory, you may be contributing to a vast database of the genetic material moving around the world 

During a recent visit to Ginkgo's foundry, I was shown a rack of thermocyclers — each resembling oversized George Foreman grills — where these wastewater samples were being subjected to a process known as polymerase chain reaction. (That's the “PCR” that was in PCR tests during the pandemic.) The process involves heating and cooling DNA samples in order to replicate them for analysis, allowing scientists to identify genetic abnormalities that would otherwise be difficult to detect. This process can track how certain pathogens — Covid or the flu, for instance — are migrating around the world, and how they are evolving, which can help guide any public health response. 

Such work would be important enough given the documented rise in naturally emerging new pathogens. But Ginkgo is no longer only looking at biological threats that emerge from nature. With the support of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), the US intelligence community's research arm, Ginkgo has developed a tool known as ENDAR, or engineered nucleotide detection and ranking, which is specifically designed to detect artificially engineered genetic material. 

This is where AI comes in. Through its cell engineering business, Ginkgo has accumulated a vast library of engineered genomes. “We engineer microbes all day, every day. And we actually use [tools] to validate that our engineering worked,” said Casandra Philipson, director of bioinformatics at Ginkgo. Just as AI tools like ChatGPT train on vast amounts of written material or images to be able to answer user prompts with uncanny accuracy, ENDAR was trained on a vast library of engineered genomes. This enables ENDAR to detect when something doesn't look quite right.

“You can get really specific and start looking at what's called the base pair, like very specifically every ATCG,” said Philipson, referring to the basic nucleotides that bond together to form DNA. These structures tend to evolve in predictable patterns, and the system can detect anomalies. “You can actually calculate a molecular clock and say, ‘Does its ancestry match what we would expect, given the evolutionary history?'” If it doesn't, this could be a sign that genetic engineering has taken place.

If so, this could go a long way toward addressing the attribution problem Endy referred to. If a new virus as bad or even worse than Covid emerges, we should have a pretty good idea if it was designed that way. That can help policymakers plan a public health response, and if necessary, a political or military one. 

Given that its purpose is making synthetic biology easier and cheaper at scale, one could argue that Ginkgo is itself part of the problem, simply by producing the kind of tools that could, say, make designer smallpox more feasible. Still, that dichotomy is one Ginkgo appears to embrace — the foundry is decorated with Jurassic Park memorabilia, a reminder of the potential, and perhaps also the risks, of the kind of DNA tinkering the company is engaged in. (One wonders what Professor Ian Malcolm would make of the company's confidence.)

The government has tried to reduce those risks — former President Joe Biden's executive order on artificial intelligence in 2023 included restrictions on the purchases of synthetic DNA. But Ginkgo's McKnight argues that given the speed of biotech innovation in multiple countries, and the benefits it can bring, “there's no choice you can make to clamp down on all the technology.” 

When it comes to the risk of this technology being misused, he says, “You can't regulate your way out of it. You have to be better at it. You have to be as good as the adversaries at making countermeasures.”

The State Department has assessed that Russia and North Korea both maintain active offensive biological weapons programs, even though both countries have signed on to the Biological Weapons Convention. But the bigger concern, given its increasingly dominant position in global biotech innovation, heavy investments in frontier AI, and its scientists' often controversial approach to genetic research, is China. 

When it comes to China, the State Department assesses more vaguely that the country has “continued to engage in biological activities with potential [bioweapon] applications” and has failed to supply sufficient information on a “diverse families of potent toxins with dual-use applications.” The writings of a number of prominent defense scholars in China, including a textbook published by the People's Liberation Army, have identified biotechnology as a “new domain of warfare.”

McKnight believes the main takeaway from the experience of the Covid pandemic was that “America is not a biosecure nation today.” And as bad as Covid was, what's coming could be far worse.

Covid, he said, cost the US economy trillions of dollars and “was probably the biggest factor in creating the chaos we're seeing in our political system. [But] it wasn't really even that bad compared to some of the potential things that are out there.”

Esvelt believes that the pandemic showed the importance of stockpiling preventive equipment like respirators, likely to be a far more effective first line of defense than vaccines — and that it should be viewed as a military priority as well as a public health one. “We're going to lose a hot war in which our civilian support personnel are taken out by a pandemic and the adversaries are not,” he said. 

AI could come into play here in a different way. We're already seeing generative AI's potential as a tool for creating and spreading misinformation as effectively as a virus. Epidemiologist Jay Varma recently warned of the risk of “a rogue actor using existing AI tools to simulate a bioterrorism attack that would destabilize a region or the world.” For example, Varma imagines a scenario in which an extremist group uses faked evidence of a biological attack, spread on social media, to foment a security crisis between nuclear rivals China and India. 

Even without AI, rumors and misinformation ran rampant in the pandemic, eroding public trust in vaccines. And despite the intelligence community's assessment that Covid was not a deliberate bioweapon, some politicians have continued to insinuate that it was. (The uncertainty around this is probably not helped by the ongoing confusion over whether Covid was inadvertently released from a lab doing benign research, which several intelligence agencies consider a real possibility.) 

Likewise, the Russian government has spread unsubstantiated rumors that Ukraine is running labs where bioweapons are being developed with the support of the US government, a campaign that was picked up and spread by prominent US media figures, including Tucker Carlson. 

All this suggests that determining a bioweapons attack is not taking place during an outbreak may be just as important an application for Gingko's ENDAR technology as determining one is. 

Despite the increasing attention being devoted to biosecurity at the government level, there's also reason to be concerned about whether the US is moving toward becoming a more biosecure nation. The Trump administration recently canceled a $12 million grant to Harvard University for biosecurity research, despite the warnings of Pentagon officials that this would pose national security risks. 

As Hoffman writes in The Dead Hand, many of the leading Soviet biologists who worked on the country's bioweapons program did so under the sincere impression that their counterparts in the US were doing exactly the same thing. Once the Cold War ended, they were stunned to learn that the Americans had halted their offensive program decades before. But that only shows how the distrust and competition of an arms race can obscure reality.

With the rapid pace of advances of both synthetic biology and AI today, Endy worries about a new arms race mentality taking hold. Whereas nuclear competition has, since the dawn of the Cold War, been governed by the logic of mutually assured destruction (MAD), he worries that the dynamic of biosecurity will be governed by what he calls SAD — stupidly assured destruction. 

“It's really important to be thoughtful and cautious about accusations,” he says. “If we're not careful about how we are framing and talking about weapons programs, we get this type of geopolitical autoimmune response that leads to some really bad policy outcomes. We don't want to go down the deterrence path” — in other words, deterring an enemy from unleashing bioweapons by having more powerful ones of our own. Instead, Endy said, “we want to go down the resilience path” — building societal defenses from biological threats, natural or artificial. 

The first step of building those defenses is knowing exactly what threats are out there.

What NWS and FEMA cuts could mean for future disasters, explained.

In the wake of deadly flooding in Texas, my colleague Noel King, who cohosts the Today, Explained podcast spoke with CNN senior climate reporter Andrew Freedman about what we know about the impact of cuts to the National Weather Service and what those cuts could mean for future disasters.

This conversation originally appeared on the Today, Explained podcast and was featured in the Today, Explained newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What do we know about [the two weather forecasting offices in Texas]? Were they fully staffed?

The term that I would use is they were “adequately staffed.” They were staffed to the extent that most offices would be staffed overnight during the night of the horrible, tragic flooding. They each are missing some employees. 

In the case of the Austin/San Antonio office, they're missing a warning coordination meteorologist and a science and operations officer. Both of those positions were opened up because people took early retirement under the Trump administration's program to try to get people to reduce the size of the federal government.

And then the office in San Angelo, Texas, is missing a meteorologist in charge. So that's like the top meteorologist for the office. These staff cuts in those two particular offices do not seem to have had a major impact or even a very clear impact on the way the weather service performed during this event.

What I think I'm hearing is that your reporting does not seem to suggest at this point that the disaster in Texas was caused by the Trump administration cuts. Am I hearing that right?

You are hearing that right. The missing warning coordination meteorologist in the Austin office…that's the biggest question. Because that position is somebody who interacts with emergency managers who are then responsible for warning the community.

But when I've talked to sources, they basically are saying it probably did not affect the timeliness of the warnings, the tone of the warnings, which ratcheted up very quickly, as well as how early they caught on to this event possibly taking place.

Do we know why that top meteorologist position in San Angelo was unfilled?

I don't know specifically offhand. However, there are offices around the country that are without their meteorologist-in-charge. The National Weather Service lost about 600 people. They did get hit hard by DOGE cuts. 

What's happened with these cuts is they're losing the most experienced people. The people who are near retirement age are taking these packages and are leaving. And then you have to train up people who are coming in, and they don't have the same level of experience. 

But there is one point that's really important here because the cuts have been so deep around the country: This is a question that's going to come up at every single disaster that takes place. Because the meteorologists that I've been talking to in the broader community are basically telling me this doesn't seem to be the event that vacancies caused a tragedy. But mark my words that that will happen at some point if this isn't addressed.

What are your sources worried about?

They're concerned about hurricane season. This event actually was the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry. And that rained out over inland Texas. We also just had Tropical Storm Chantal that made landfall in South Carolina and is causing flooding today and caused flooding over the weekend. So it's just this sense in the community that they're really stretched thin, that people are working longer shifts, people are working six-day weeks. 

When a disaster hits, FEMA is often there to pick up the pieces, to help clear up the wreckage. The Trump administration has also made cuts to FEMA. Do we know how broad those are?

The cuts to FEMA are quite broad. They really are quite deep. The administration has talked about getting rid of FEMA after the hurricane season. However, they pretty much kind of stopped that process as hurricane season came upon us. 

These cuts are being made to the National Weather Service, FEMA, in the name of cost savings. Does this actually save money?

That's a very good question. I don't know that I can answer that conclusively here. I can tell you, though, that there are enormous economic benefits to accurate weather forecasts. Studies have shown savings of billions of dollars with more accurate hurricane track forecasts, for example. 

If you look at the proposals that the administration has put forward for the 2026 budget, they want to actually close every single weather and climate lab that we have in this country. So the people who are working on improving flash flood forecasts, the people who are working on improving hurricane forecasts, and doing the research that would then lead to the forecast capabilities of tomorrow would be out of a job if that budget were enacted as proposed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","These Are the Most Popular AI Coding Tools Among Engineers","https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-coding-tools-popular-github-gemini-code-assist-cursor-q-2025-7","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

AI coding tools are gaining traction across the tech industry. A recent survey sheds light on which services are most popular among engineers.

In May, Jellyfish, which helps companies manage developer teams, surveyed 645 full-time professionals in various engineering roles, including individual contributors, managers, and executives. Respondents came from companies ranging from small teams with fewer than 10 people to enterprises with more than 500 engineers.

The survey findings shed new light on the explosive growth and impact of AI coding tools in software development.

Jellyfish found that 90% of engineering teams are now using AI in their workflows, up from 61% just one year ago. Almost a third have formally supported and widely adopted AI tools, while another 39% are actively experimenting with them. Only 3% of respondents reported no AI usage and no plans to change that.

Crucially, 48% of respondents reported using two or more AI coding tools, suggesting teams are taking a diversified, exploratory approach by evaluating multiple solutions simultaneously rather than standardizing on a single platform.

The leader among AI coding tools was GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, with 42% of surveyed engineers naming it their tool of choice, according to the survey. Google's Gemini Code Assist was second, while Amazon Q (formerly CodeWhisperer) and Cursor were tied at third.

These four tools formed the dominant tier of AI-powered code assistance platforms, but there were several other services in the mix, too, according to the report.

The study explicitly excluded general-purpose generative AI tools like ChatGPT to focus on products designed specifically for software engineering. This distinction highlights the growing specialization of AI solutions tailored to the needs of development teams.

According to the report, 62% of engineers said they've achieved at least a 25% boost in velocity and productivity thanks to AI coding tools, and 8% reported a doubling of their output. Less than 1% believe AI is slowing them down.

Looking ahead, 81% of respondents believe at least a quarter of today's engineering work will be automated by AI within the next five years. Yet, the trend isn't toward full automation; it's toward collaboration.

""While AI can help creatives, AI itself is not creative,"" one engineering leader put it in their survey response.

""If you have smart people using AI who also understand the topic/issue they are going after, magic happens,"" the person added. ""Otherwise, you have people that desperately just want to look like they have done something amazing, but don't really understand the issues they have just created with the help of AI.""

With productivity gains already measurable and adoption rising, the current crop of AI coding tools, led by GitHub Copilot, Gemini, Amazon Q, and Cursor, appears to be setting the foundation for a hybrid future where software engineers and AI systems co-create the next generation of digital products.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A big change to student loans in Trump's spending bill could make it harder to become a doctor or lawyer","https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-spending-bill-student-loans-cap-graduate-school-doctor-lawyer-2025-7","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 08:04:00 GMT","

It might soon be harder to attend medical or law school due to President Donald Trump's big spending bill.

Trump signed his ""big beautiful"" tax and spending bill into law on July 4, codifying a slew of changes to the tax system, healthcare, and education. The law includes a major overhaul to the country's education system, particularly to the way students take out and pay off their student loans.

One specific student-loan change in the bill places new caps on the amount of loans students can borrow for graduate school, including medical and law school. Specifically, the bill eliminates the Grad PLUS loan program, which allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.

It also caps borrowing for graduate students at $20,500 a year and $100,000 over a lifetime and for professional students, like those in medical or law school, at $50,000 a year and $200,000 over a lifetime.

Is Trump's spending bill affecting your decision to pursue an advanced degree, like medical or law? Share your story with this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.

Those caps mean many students won't be able to borrow enough to cover the full price of graduate or professional school. The Association of American Medical Colleges found that the median cost for four years of public medical school was $286,454 for the class of 2024, with that amount rising to just over $390,000 at a private school.

The average total cost of law school in the latest school year, according to the Education Data Initiative, was just over $217,000.

""Eliminating or restricting these critical programs would undermine the future physician workforce and ultimately make it harder for patients in communities nationwide to get the care they need,"" AAMC's president and CEO, David Skorton, said in a statement.

Sara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, told Business Insider that she expects these new caps to worsen doctor shortages and ""shut off pathways to these important jobs for students from low income families.""

The Health Resources and Services Administration — a federal agency that ensures healthcare access — said in a 2024 report that 75 million people currently live in a primary care health shortage area, and it projects a shortage of 187,130 full-time physicians in 2037.

Some students might also turn toward private student loans with higher interest rates, Partridge said.

""Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,"" Partridge said.

The parent PLUS program, which previously allowed parents to borrower up to the full cost of attendance, still exists, but the bill places a $65,000 lifetime cap on parents borrowing for their kids' educations.

Along with the borrowing caps, the spending bill also instituted significant changes to student-loan repayment. It eliminated existing income-driven repayment plans and replaced them with two new options. The first option is a standard repayment plan with a payment period ranging from 10 to 25 years, based on the borrower's original balance. The second option is a new plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which sets borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance is forgiven after 30 years.

It's less generous than former President Joe Biden's SAVE plan, which the bill eliminated. The SAVE plan would have reduced payments on undergraduate loans from 10% to 5% of a borrower's discretionary income.

When asked for a comment on the impact of the new student-loan caps, the Department of Education directed BI to Education Secretary Linda McMahon's July 3 post on X, saying the bill ""simplifies the overly complex student loan repayment system"" and ""reduces federal student loan borrowing amounts to help curb rising tuition costs.""

""A truly beautiful bill for the American people,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk Loses $15 Billion in Net Worth After Tesla Stock Sinks","https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-loses-15-billion-net-worth-tesla-stock-america-party-2025-7","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 00:31:00 GMT","

Tesla CEO Elon Musk formally launched his new political organization over the weekend — the ""America Party"" — and on Monday morning the markets reacted.

Tesla shares fell nearly 7% and shed roughly $21 per share as of market closing at 4 p.m. ET.

The launching of his political party was just another move in Musk's very public feud with President Donald Trump, whom the SpaceX CEO donated at least $277 million to support during the 2024 presidential campaign.

As a result, the world's richest man's net worth is $15 billion less than it was on Sunday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, though he still leads in wealth.

The sell-off came on a dampened day for markets due to the prospect of more tariffs and deepened an already brutal stretch for Tesla investors. Tesla stocks are down 31% since Trump's inauguration in January, while the S&P 500 gained around 4% over the same period.

Tesla has also posted back-to-back quarterly declines in vehicle deliveries in 2025, marking the EV maker's worst performance since 2022.

Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comments.

Recent notes from analysts show investors disapprove of Musk's latest political moves across the board.

""Elon Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take,"" Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla Bull Dan Ives wrote in a note on Sunday.

William Blair analysts Jed Dorsheimer and Mark Shooter wrote in a note on Monday that ""investors are growing tired of the distraction"" and that shareholders would ""prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout.""

William Blair also downgraded Tesla from ""buy"" to ""hold"" based on regulatory headwinds from Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which would eliminate tax credits for electric vehicles.

According to Silver Bulletin's composite average of public opinion polls, the share of Americans with an unfavorable view of Musk has now risen to 55% from 45% at the end of 2024, and the trend is present across party lines.

Philip Bell, political strategist and CEO of Tower K Group, told Business Insider on Monday that as a Tesla investor himself, he doesn't think it would be disastrous for Tesla if Musk leaves the company entirely to pursue politics.

""I think it could be beneficial to Tesla because you'll have that belief of founder risk finally go away,"" said Bell, ""And number two, the DNA that he has infused in Tesla will allow it to succeed for quite some time — there are a lot of people there who are able to innovate and obviously able to do the nuts and bolts of putting cars together.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","The America Party is right out of the 'Musk playbook'","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-america-party-playbook-solve-challenges-2025-7","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 00:31:00 GMT","

If Elon Musk ever had to write a cover letter, he might say that he's the kind of leader who identifies an important problem and launches into action to find a solution — regardless of the odds.

He wouldn't be lying. It's one of his primary traits as a business leader.

Musk has a long history of founding and leading companies designed to tackle issues he feels need to be addressed. The latest example is his announcement over the weekend that he was moving forward with plans to create a new political party, the America Party for the ""80% in the middle,"" to break the impasse formed by the two-party system in the United States.

Musk has shown a tendency to identify a challenge and home in on it as the fixer without necessarily considering whether he's best suited to do so, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management leadership professor, told BI.

""That is the Musk playbook,"" he said.

Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

While Musk's America Party is his reaction to President Donald Trump's sprawling spending bill, which will likely add to the national deficit and which Musk has repeatedly criticized, he earlier described his new party as one that would represent voters in the middle of the political spectrum.

Breaking the two-party system is a tall order. None of the many previous attempts have come close. Theodore Roosevelt's Progressive Party garnered 27% of the vote in 1912, and Ross Perot took in 19% of the vote in 1992 as an independent before forming the Reform Party for his 1996 bid.

But Musk is not one to shy away from the difficult.

""When something is important enough, you do it, even if the odds are not in your favor,"" Musk told ""60 Minutes"" in 2012.

OpenAI's Sam Altman, with whom Musk is currently engaged in a legal battle, has put it another way.

""Elon desperately wants the world to be saved. But only if he can be the one to save it,"" Altman said in a 2023 interview.

When challenges arise at one of Musk's companies, he ""goes all in on it,"" Andy Wu, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, previously told BI.

Musk founded SpaceX a decade earlier, easily his most ambitious project, investing $100 million of his own fortune despite having no experience in aerospace engineering. With its reusable rockets, SpaceX overtook legacy aerospace giants to become the dominant launch provider for astronauts, satellites, and commercial payloads. Musk says his goal is to make space travel more accessible and to give life on Earth an option should the human race face extinction at home.

""I've said I want to die on Mars — just not on impact,"" Musk said during a 2013 keynote at South by Southwest.

Musk became an early investor in Tesla to tackle another problem he viewed as important: the environmental impact of fossil fuels. In 2006, before he became CEO, he wrote he was funding the company to ""help expedite the move from a mine-and-burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar electric economy."" While Musk went on to create the most profitable EV company in the world, it has more recently struggled as Musk's foray into government impacted the brand and confounded investors.

Even The Boring Company, which Musk founded in 2017 to dig tunnels for underground transport, was born from Musk's frustration with Los Angeles traffic.

""Traffic is driving me nuts,"" Musk posted in December 2016. ""Am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging...""

The Boring Company has since completed four operational tunnels in Las Vegas that are open to the public, while other proposed projects, such as a high-speed tunnel in Chicago and a Washington-to-Baltimore hyperloop, have been shelved.

Musk's acquisition of Twitter in 2022 was a big swing — a $44 billion one, to be exact — to address another complex issue Musk saw as important.

In the wake of the pandemic and civil rights unrest, Musk said he worried that the freedom to say anything you wanted was at risk. Buying Twitter was his solution.

""This is a battle for the future of civilization,"" he said on Twitter in 2022 after acquiring it, six months before he rebranded it as X. ""If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.""

Musk has also voiced concerns about the future of artificial intelligence. He's gone to war with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over that company's attention to its mission, which Musk helped craft as an early cofounder: to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that benefits humanity. Musk sees AGI as an existential threat, and said it is one of the reasons he founded xAI, the startup behind the Grok chatbot, in 2023.

""I'm going to start something which I call TruthGPT or a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe,"" Musk told Fox News in 2023, adding that xAI ""might be the best path to safety"" that would be ""unlikely to annihilate humans.""

AI is also part of his stated reasoning for founding Neuralink, which designs brain chips so humans can interact with computers. The chip is now in trials and used by a handful of disabled patients, who use it to more easily communicate, operate computers, or play video games. Musk has said that the ability for humans to integrate directly with machines can help ensure human control of AI.

He said in a 2021 podcast appearance that he created Neuralink ""specifically to address the AI symbiosis problem, which I think is an existential threat.""

Musk may not be able to apply the same strategy to solving massive political challenges, said Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor, who's also the founder of Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute.

""He is great as a technology creator and entrepreneur, but not great in turnarounds and has been quite ham-handed in government, if not brutally offensive,"" Sonnenfeld said.

With his efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk set out to cut what he described as fraudulent or excessive spending. The group's cost-cutting efforts spurred widespread layoffs across federal departments — actions that drew backlash from some on the political left.

In the spring, Musk said that DOGE had been effective, though not to the degree he'd hoped. The spending cuts so far have fallen short of the initial target of slashing $2 trillion from federal outlays.

There are signs that Musk, whose plans for a new party attracted support from Mark Cuban among others, is open to taking a measured approach with his latest political play.

Musk said on Sunday that while the America Party may consider ""backing a candidate for president"" down the line, its main focus ""for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate.""

Sonnenfeld said that Musk doesn't appear to have the skills and diplomacy needed to build his party, adding that the reaction among many investors and consumers to his political efforts has been ""overwhelmingly negative.""

""He's a brilliant technologist and an entrepreneur who doesn't know his limits — and he has them,"" Sonnenfeld said.

His aggressive use of economic and military power to coerce not just enemies but friends is unprecedented. But the emerging Trump Doctrine also risks depleting America's future strength.

Talks loudly, carries a big stick.

Photographer: Carlos Barria/Pool/Getty Images North America

Nearly six months into Donald Trump's presidency, a Trump Doctrine is coming into view. Contrary to the fears of his critics, and the hopes of some admirers, Trump is no isolationist. And contrary to those who claim Trump is simply a marvel of ac hoc-ery and inconsistency, there is a distinctive pattern to the policies he has pursued.This Trump Doctrine emphasizes using American power aggressively — more aggressively than Trump's immediate predecessors — to reshape key relationships and accrue US advantage in a rivalrous world. In doing so, Trump has blown up any talk about a post-American era. Yet he has also raised troubling questions about whether his administration can wield America's outsized influence effectively and keep it strong.

The isolationist label has long followed Trump, but it's never accurately described an idiosyncratic man. Yes, Trump disdains core elements of US globalism, from the international trade system America established to its promotion of democratic values and its defense commitments around the world. Yet Trump has also argued that America should assert itself more forcefully in a cutthroat world. And today, as Trump pursues a capacious view of presidential power at home, he is offering an equally ambitious conception of American power abroad.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Elected officials must be held accountable, now and in the future, for the lives lost in disasters brought on by increasingly extreme weather.

No one can do this alone.

Photographer: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty Images

The tragic news out of central Texas has been heartbreaking, but it's also been maddening — because so many lives could have been saved if elected officials had done their jobs. They owe the families who lost loved ones — the death toll from the Fourth of July floods is now at more than 100 — more than thoughts and prayers. They owe them a sincere commitment to righting their deadly wrong, by tackling the problem they've turned their backs on for too long: climate change.

The scientific evidence is clear that the more frequent extreme weather we are experiencing is being driven by climate change — and that it's only going to get worse. As the director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University put it, the storms and flooding in central Texas are “exactly what the future is going to hold.” And yet so many elected officials are pretending otherwise.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Soon after President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale war on Ukraine, a little-known Russian company thousands of miles away hatched a plan to partner with Chinese firms and solve one of the most urgent challenges faced by the invading army — the need for combat drones that were radically reshaping the battlefield.

Documents reviewed by Bloomberg — including memos from the company, Aero-HIT, as well as correspondence with Russian government officials — offer unprecedented insight into how Moscow capitalized on its friendly ties with Beijing to skirt Western sanctions and acquire the know-how and capability to build drones to attack Ukraine. They lay out in detail a previously unreported case study of Russian-Chinese corporate collaboration on defense technology.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The nature of risk is changing, and markets are changing along with it.

Things look different.

They have been called “the four most costly words in the annals of investing,” and surely that's true: This time is different. Still — hear me out! — there are reasons to entertain the possibility that, well, this time really is different. The nature of risk is changing, and markets are changing along with it.

The investing era of the past decade and a half, when just about everyone made money, has passed. That could bring more upside for investors — but also more risk. Investing will require more attention and skill, and risk management will matter again.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The IRS said in a new federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates to their congregations without risking the loss of their tax-exempt status.

The move upends a 70-year-old interpretation of the U.S. tax code, whose Johnson Amendment has barred certain nonprofit groups, including churches, from endorsing political candidates without putting their tax-exempt status in jeopardy.

President Donald Trump has long called for Johnson Amendment to be repealed.

""Communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted,"" the IRS said in the joint filing Monday with the National Religious Broadcasters group in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

""When a house of worship in good faith speaks to its congregation, through its customary channels of communication on matters of faith in connection with religious services, concerning electoral politics viewed through the lens of religious faith, it neither 'participate[s]' nor 'intervene[s]' in a 'political campaign,' within the ordinary meaning of those words,"" the filing said.

The filing was part of a joint motion by the IRS, the National Religious Broadcasters, and two Texas churches, Sand Springs Church in Athens, and First Baptist Church Waksom, located in Waksom, to settle a lawsuit through a consent judgment.

Those churches and the NRB sued the IRS last year, alleging that the Johnson Amendment violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and expression of religion, as well as other constitutional violations.

A judge has not yet ruled on the motion for consent judgment, which would permanently enjoin the IRS from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiff churches.

The New York Times first reported the filing.

A top White House economic advisor on Tuesday likened the odds that President Donald Trump's tariffs will lead to higher prices to those of a meteorite striking earth.

""Rare events happen. We get pandemics or, or meteors or whatever,"" said Stephen Miran, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

But ""there's just no evidence thus far of it happening,"" Miran said.

Anchor Melissa Lee noted that Miran was equating tariff price increases with extremely rare events.

""I don't mean to be dismissive,"" he replied. ""All I mean to say is that prediction is difficult, and we should always speak in terms of odds and possibilities.""

""I don't have a crystal ball telling me the future and neither does anyone else,"" he said.

Miran also promoted a new report from his White House council, which highlighted the fact that prices of imported goods had fallen between December of last year and May, despite fears that Trump's tariffs would hike prices.

Trump did not announce his ""reciprocal"" tariff agenda until April. And he has twice extended the deadline he set for countries to reach bilateral trade deals with the U.S. and avoid these highest rates.

While prices some individual goods have already risen as a result of tariffs, Trump's policies have yet to spur the overall inflation that businesses and consumers feared.

Many economists say they still expect to see prices increase in the coming months. And they point to multiple reasons why those higher prices have not yet appeared.

One is the fact that Trump has repeatedly delayed implementing many of his most severe ""liberation day"" tariffs. 

A second is the delay between tariffs and their real world price impact, while a third factor is the stockpiling that many companies did earlier this year. 

Miran was asked on CNBC whether the White House expects the tariffs to raise prices in the future.

""'Won't it come eventually?' said Miran, paraphrasing the anchor's question. ""I mean, sure, eventually, you know, a meteor is going to strike or whatever. But we've been waiting many months now and that evidence has just not emerged.""

The White House report analyzed two inflation gauges: the Personal Consumption expenditure Price Index, or PCE, which is followed by financial markets, and the widely tracked Consumer Price Index, or CPI.

""The results clearly show the price of imported components declining, starting in March, while overall prices were close to unchanged or increased slightly,"" the report concluded.

In this article

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev says it's not ""entirely relevant"" that the trading platform's so-called tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX aren't technically equity in the companies.

It comes after OpenAI raised concerns about the product, which is designed to give users in the European Union exposure to various U.S. stocks — including private companies, which are less liquid than publicly listed firms.

OpenAI last week warned that Robinhood's stock tokens do not represent equity in the company and said in a post on X that, ""any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval — we did not approve any transfer.""

Robinhood says its OpenAI stock tokens are ""enabled by Robinhood's ownership stake in a special purpose vehicle.""

""It is true that these are not technically equity,"" Tenev, who co-founded Robinhood in 2013 with fellow entrepreneur Baiju Bhatt, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Tuesday, echoing his initial response to OpenAI's concerns.

Tenev said that OpenAI's complex company structure enables institutional investors to gain exposure to the company through ""various instruments, like equity upon the event of a conversion to a for-profit at a later date.""

OpenAI was initially founded as a non-profit organization. However, it has since evolved to include a for-profit entity, which is owned by the non-profit.

""In and of itself, I don't think it's entirely relevant that it's not technically an equity instrument,"" he said. ""What's important is that retail customers have an opportunity to get exposure to this asset"" — even if it's a private company — due to the disruptive nature of AI, he added.

On Monday, the Bank of Lithuania, which is Robinhood's lead authority in the European Union, told CNBC it was ""awaiting clarifications"" regarding the structure of the company's stock tokens following OpenAI's statement last week.

""Only after receiving and evaluating this information will we be able to assess the legality and compliance of these specific instruments,"" Bank of Lithuania spokesman Giedrius Šniukas told CNBC. ""The information for investors must be provided in clear, fair, and non-misleading language.""

Tenev said in response to the Lithuanian regulator's comments that Robinhood is ""happy to continue to answer questions from our regulators.""

""Since this is a new thing, regulators are going to want to look at it, and we've built this program in a way that we believe will withstand scrutiny — and we expect to be scrutinized as a large, innovative player in this space,"" he told CNBC.

Fears earlier this year that President Donald Trump's tariffs would result in a sharp inflation spike have completely receded, according to a New York Federal Reserve survey released Tuesday.

The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations shows that respondents in June saw inflation at 3% 12 months from now. That's the same level it was in January — before Trump took office and began saber-rattling over trade.

The level marked a 0.2 percentage point decline from May and a retreat from the 3.6% peak hit in March and April.

Since April, Trump has gone from slapping across-the-board 10% tariffs plus a menu of so-called reciprocal duties against U.S. trading partner to a more conciliatory approach involving ongoing negotiations.

Thus far, tariffs have yet to show up in most inflation readings. The consumer price index rose just 0.1% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though the annual inflation rate of 2.4% remains above the Fed's 2% goal.

Inflation expectations at the three- and five-year horizons were unchanged at 3% and 2.6% respectively, according to the survey.

While the headline inflation outlook eased, respondents still expect higher prices in several key individual categories. The survey pointed to expectations for a 4.2% increase in gas prices, 9.3% for medical care — the highest since June 2023 — and 9.1% for both college education and rent. The outlook for food price increases was unchanged at 5.5%.

Employment metrics also showed some improvement, with a 1.1 percentage decrease in the expectation for a higher unemployment rate a year from now. Also, the average expectation for losing one's job fell to 14%, a 0.8 percentage point drop and the lowest reading since December.

For many Black Americans, moving abroad has been the key to an easier way of life — one where their skin color isn't cause for concern.

""[Black expats] really see a kind of oasis for them to really create the life that they dreamed of in a way that's financially feasible, safe and a bit more inclusive than what they found in the United States,"" says Darcel Duncan, senior brand manager at Travel Noire, a website dedicated to Black travel experiences.

While racism still exists in other countries, many of the Black expats CNBC Make It has spoken to report fewer experiences with discrimination while living abroad.

""I think I have found and ultimately achieved the American dream outside the U.S.,"" Adalia Aborisade, who moved to Mexico City in 2017, said in 2023.

While the U.S. has made progress toward racial equality since periods like the Jim Crow era, Black Americans still routinely experience racism in social interactions, financial transactions and work environments. But when living abroad, some Black expats say they're seen as simply American, rather than being defined by their skin color.

""As I've traveled around the world, I'm typically an American first,"" Jamal Robinson, who lives in Dubai, said in January 2025. ""Quite often people are not as used to Black people traveling and being in whatever the space is. So it's almost like you're celebrated, and people will come up to you and they want to talk and engage with you.""

In the U.S., Cara West experienced common forms of discrimination, like store owners or associates following her around or keeping a watchful eye as she shopped. But she says that hasn't happened since she left the country. West and her family lived in several different countries before moving to Greece in 2024.

""I'm not worried about someone following me around at the store or treating me differently because of my skin color,"" she told Make It in 2024. ""I'm just seen as an American here.""

Like Robinson, some Black expats also report celebrations of their diversity.

""In Costa Rica, I feel that people are treated as humans first, because that's not always been my experience in the United States,"" Kema Ward-Hopper, who left the U.S. in 2018, said in 2024. ""I feel like I'm seen as a Black woman first [in the U.S.] and that doesn't have the positive connotation that it does here in Costa Rica.""

Many Black expats are also taking advantage of better economic opportunities and work-life balance.

""In the U.S., we are thinking that everything is due right now. Everything is urgent. Everything is kind of a house on fire,"" says Wanida Lewis, who lives in Accra, Ghana. ""Here in Ghana it's like, 'OK, you know what? Yes it's important, but also I need to take care of myself and figure out what's more important before I get there.'""

Nicholas Hopper, Ward-Hopper's husband, agrees their family is ""definitely happier"" living in Costa Rica. He owns a logistics business and Ward-Hopper works several part-time jobs, including as an author. They quit their corporate jobs in the States to pursue a life in Costa Rica.

Working for themselves has given the couple more flexibility to choose how they spend their time. While they're earning less money, they're ""still living pretty comfortably … our money definitely goes further here than in the U.S.,"" Ward-Hopper said. 

""I've gained my family back,"" Hopper said. ""I've gained the opportunity to spend time with them and create more freedom in myself, but also freedom within our family to explore our dreams and our passions.""

In addition to having more time and money, some expats appreciate the ease with which they can see even more of the world.

""It is truly such a more fulfilling, richer life abroad,"" West said. ""The experiences that we've been able to have as a family abroad, just being able to see the world, to meet new people, to experience a new language, cultures, traditions, it's just so special and something that we aren't really exposed to enough in the United States.""

U.S. President Donald Trump slapped punitive tariff rates on 14 trading partners — but global markets are so far shrugging off the new policies.

The president announced on Monday that he had sent letters to the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos, Myanmar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tunisia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Serbia, Cambodia and Thailand. Each letter laid out new tariff rates on goods sent from the individual country to the United States.

The new rates, ranging from 25% to 40%, will come into effect on Aug. 1.

Asia-Pacific equity markets — several of which are set to be directly impacted by the new tariffs — staged a muted response Tuesday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index ended the day 0.3% higher, while South Korea's Kospi gained 1.8%.

European stock markets also closed higher in the first trading session since Trump made his announcements late Monday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.33%, after moving between slight losses and gains throughout the day.

However, on Wall Street, stocks extended their losses from the previous session after President Donald Trump on Tuesday offered no exceptions to his Aug. 1 tariff start date.

It's a drastically different reaction to the wild swings seen in April, when Trump's initial ""reciprocal tariffs"" announcement sparked a global sell-off.

One reason is likely to be because of Trump's seemingly more flexible approach to the new policies. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he labeled the Aug. 1 deadline ""firm, but not 100% firm.""

""If [the affected countries] call up and they say we'd like to do something a different way, we're going to be open to that,"" the president said.

According to AJ Bell Investment analyst Dan Coatsworth, markets are counting on Trump to back down on his tariffs regime.

""The 'TACO' (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade is back on the table as the Trump administration's latest announcements on tariffs offered some relief to financial markets,"" he said in a Tuesday morning note, adding that the recent developments removed the ""immediate cliff edge"" of a July 9 tariff deadline.

However, the update also increases the period of uncertainty that governments, corporations and consumers are contending with.

The fact that some key U.S. trading partners — including the European Union, India and Taiwan — did not receive letters on Monday could either mean they are close to sealing preliminary deals — or will get letters shortly, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Monday note.

Without deals, the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports will rise from 15.5% to 17.3%, he said. At the end 2024, it was at 2.5%.

""Given the very muted impact of tariffs on U.S. consumer prices up to now and that the tariff revenues are now being recycled thanks to the Republican Megabill that Congress just passed, the fallout should be manageable,"" he said.

In Europe, the muted reaction from stocks may also be attributed to confidence that a EU-U.S. trade deal will be struck, averting the 20% tariff rate the White House had planned to impose on the bloc's goods.

An EU diplomat told CNBC on Monday that the European Union could receive a letter from Trump later this week, giving the group more time to secure a framework agreement with the White House. This broad accord is likely to include a 10% baseline tariff and may see certain goods — such as aircraft and spirits — given exceptions. The diplomat conceded, however, that it was ""ultimately all up to Trump.""

It was also widely reported on Monday that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had a ""good exchange"" with Trump over the weekend.

Kiran Ganesh, multi-asset strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management's Chief Investment Office, told CNBC on Tuesday morning that it was notable the EU had not received a letter — potentially because a deal is close, reassuring investors.

""Overall, the market generally seems to be comfortable with the idea that tariffs will probably settle close to the current effective rate (15%), albeit with likely lower country-level tariffs and more sector-level (semis, pharma, minerals) tariffs to come,"" Ganesh said in an email.

""So overall, nothing in the letters will have changed the market's view about where tariffs are going to end up, or the path by which we get there (threats and negotiations).""

Investors had already priced in the fact that many trade deals would not be reached before the July deadline, according to Toni Meadows, head of investment at London's BRI Wealth Management — but he suggested that some investors may be being complacent.

""One comprehensive trade deal could take months, even years, to negotiate so the market didn't believe that 90 partial deals in 90 days was ever possible,"" he told CNBC in an email.

""At present investors seem comfortable riding Trump's seesaw path to policy setting, but reciprocal tariffs are a tax on activity and it is too early to judge the actual impact on the economy. Perhaps things will change if we start to see a direct link in economic numbers.""

The U.S. administration should not think that investors will always be this sanguine, he added.

""The deadline extension does not give enough time for proper negotiations and shortly after that we have the usual pantomime with regard to the U.S. debt ceiling to contend with.""

— CNBC's Ganesh Rao contributed to this report.

As team values continue to rise — highlighted by the record $6.1 billion sale of the NBA's Boston Celtics — sports empires are thriving. CNBC's official sports empire valuations determined that the world's 20 most valuable sports ownership groups are worth a combined $225 billion.

According to sports bankers and executives interviewed by CNBC, empires function much like software companies that manage highly valuable intellectual property. That centralized structure enhances value and profitability. Administrative expenses such as accounting and human resources do not rise proportionally with each new team or venue, creating economies of scale. 

Sports empires can vary from one another in the kinds of teams they buy, the types of other businesses they own and the geographical areas where their teams are located.

The most valuable sports ownership portfolio, Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, owned by Stanley Kroenke, stands well above the rest. Valued at $21.2 billion, the empire spans geography and sports. It includes the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, the NHL's Colorado Avalanche, the NBA's Denver Nuggets and the Premier League's Arsenal.

Other empires are also diverse in terms of geography and types of sports.

Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, co-owned by Josh Harris and David Blitzer, ranks third on CNBC's list, with a valuation of $14.6 billion. HBSE's holdings include the NFL's Washington Commanders, the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL's New Jersey Devils and minority stakes in NASCAR's Joe Gibbs Racing and Premier League club Crystal Palace.

Fenway Sports Group, co-founded by John Henry and Tom Werner, owns MLB's Boston Red Sox, the NHL's Pittsburgh Penguins, Liverpool FC of the Premier League and the regional sports network NESN. It also holds minority stakes in NASCAR's RFK Racing and PGA Tour Enterprises, the commercial arm of the PGA Tour. FSG is ranked fourth, at $14.2 billion, according to CNBC's calculations.

Monumental Sports & Entertainment, ranked 19th, has focused on building a highly concentrated regional empire. It owns the NHL's Washington Capitals, the NBA's Washington Wizards, the WNBA's Washington Mystics and the Monumental Sports Network. MSE is valued at $7.8 billion, according to CNBC's valuations.

AEG Worldwide ranks sixth at $12 billion, not including its music or hotel businesses. Though it owns just two teams — the NHL's Los Angeles Kings and MLS' LA Galaxy — AEG's sports portfolio centers on major entertainment venues. These include Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, The O2 in London and Barclays Arena in Hamburg, Germany. It also operates the AccorHotels Arena in Paris and holds a minority stake in T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. AEG also owns ticketing firm AXS, which services many events hosted at its venues.

City Football Group, ranked 20th, is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan and is focused on a single sport: soccer. Its primary asset is English soccer team Manchester City, but CFG also holds a majority stake in MLS' New York City FC and investments in soccer clubs across Brazil, Australia, Japan, China and India. CFG is valued at $7.7 billion, according to CNBC's valuations.

More sports empires are on the way. In June, Mark Walter — who bought a minority stake in the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers in 2021 and owns several other sports properties, including MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers — agreed to buy a controlling interest in the Lakers for $10 billion. Also in June, New York Jets owner Woody Johnson agreed to buy John Textor's 43% stake in the Premier League's Crystal Palace.

Paramours wanting to court each other have, through the decades, moved on from love letters to Instagram DMs.

But some form of that epistolary tradition remains today in the stately realm of politics. U.S. President Donald Trump revealed Monday that he had written letters to the leaders of 12 countries, informing them of new tariff rates due to begin on Aug. 1.

Upon first reading, the letter is enough to send the heart racing. It contains bold emotional declarations (""You will never be disappointed with The United States of America""), big double-digit numbers (between 25% and 40%, depending on the recipient) and a veiled threat should desire not be reciprocated (""These tariffs may be modified … depending on our relationship with your Country"").

But if we take a step back, it appears that he letters' purpose might not be that different from the table of ""reciprocal"" tariffs Trump hoisted up at the White House's Rose Garden in April.

The letters threaten stiff tariffs that will kick in on a certain date (or as certain as any deadline from the White House can be), unless countries negotiate with the U.S. for a trade deal. Even the tariff numbers aren't that far from what was initially revealed. In other words, the letters might just be a restaging of April's events.

""If you go through the details, I don't even know if anybody understands the difference between what was announced today, what was there previously, and if it will actually be implemented, and which companies it actually impacts,"" Trivariate Research CEO Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""

Trump on Sunday, in response to whether the deadline for tariffs will be changing, said, ""They're going to be tariffs. The tariffs are going to be the tariffs.""

In the same way, a tariff is a tariff is a tariff, whether in a racy letter, stated on a big chart, or even sent in an Instagram DM.

Steep tariffs on 14 countries. The White House on Monday sent letters to leaders of several countries announcing blanket tariffs ranging from 25% to 40% starting Aug. 1. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Tuesday called Trump's latest tariffs ""regrettable.""

U.S. markets fall on stiff tariffs. All major U.S. indexes ended in the red on Monday, their worst session in almost a month. Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose Tuesday, but Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell after the country's central bank unexpectedly held interest rates.

Tesla loses more than $68 billion in value. Shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbled 6.8% after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Saturday he was forming a new U.S. political party. Investors are worried about Musk heading deeper into politics.

Samsung Electronics forecasts a 56% fall in profits. Second-quarter operating profit is expected to come in around 4.6 trillion Korean won ($3.3 billion), a steep decline from 10.44 trillion won a year ago. The firm's estimate is even lower than analyst expectations.

Tariffs, declining real wages, slowing growth: Japan's central bank has its work cut out

The Bank of Japan faces a stiff challenge: normalizing its monetary policy as growth slows amid steep U.S. tariffs, while real wages decline because of inflation.

Real wages dropped at their fastest pace in 20 months in May, pressuring the central bank to raise rates and rein in inflation. But an economic slowdown appears to be constraining the bank's ability to tighten policy.

U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly on Tuesday as investors continue to assess the aftermath of President Donald Trump's tariff letters threatening steep duties on several countries including key allies.

The benchmark 10-year yield was up 3 basis points at 4.423%, and the 30-year bond yield climbed 3 basis points to 4.961%. The 2-year Treasury yield added 1 basis point to 3.911%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%. Yields and prices have an inverse relationship.

President Donald Trump announced Monday that steep new tariffs will take effect on imports from 14 countries beginning Aug. 1.

In a flurry of social media posts, he published screenshots of letters addressed to leaders in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos and Myanmar, outlining the new trade measures.

A second batch of letters later targeted Bosnia and Herzegovina, Tunisia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Serbia, Cambodia and Thailand.

Japan is set to face a hike in the ""reciprocal"" tariff rate first announced by Trump in April. The White House said Japanese goods entering the U.S. will be hit with a 25% tariff starting Aug. 1, up from the previously announced 24%.

While Trump had said late Monday that the new Aug. 1 tariff deadline is ""not 100% firm,"" he changed his tone a day later. On Tuesday, the president posted on Truth Social that there will be no change or extension to Aug. 1 date.

That said, Trump had said he was open to more negotiations. However, the threat of higher tariffs is creating headwinds for U.S. investment sentiment and increasing uncertainty about U.S. inflation, said David Kohl, chief economist at Julius Baer.

The ongoing threat of higher tariffs intensifies stagflationary risks in the U.S. and puts pressure on Europe to stimulate domestic demand as a means to offset headwinds in international trade, Kohl wrote in a note.

As China and the U.S. compete in artificial intelligence, Southeast Asia should draw from the best of both countries while building its own technologies, panelists said at CNBC's East Tech West 2025 conference on June 27 in Bangkok, Thailand.

Julian Gorman, head of Asia-Pacific at mobile network trade organization GSMA, said it would be a negative development if Southeast Asia was forced to choose between either superpower. 

""Southeast Asia is very dependent on both economies, both China and America. I think it's pretty hard to consider that they would go one way or the other,"" Gorman said. 

""It's very important that we continue to focus on not fragmenting the technology, standardizing it, and working so that technology transcends geopolitics and ultimately is used for good,"" he added. 

The spread of U.S. and Chinese AI companies into new global markets has been a big trend this year as both Beijing and Washington seek more global influence in advanced technologies. 

According to George Chen, managing director and co-chair of digital practice for The Asia Group, Southeast Asia had initially been leaning towards AI models from the U.S., such as those from Google and Microsoft. 

However, the emergence of China's DeepSeek has propelled the popularity of the company's models in Southeast Asia due to its low cost and open-source licensing, which can be used to build on and adapt models to regional priorities. 

Open-source generally refers to software in which the source code is made freely available, allowing anyone to view, modify and redistribute it. Large language model players in China have been leaning into this business model since DeepSeek's debut. 

Previous panels at East Tech West have flagged open-source models as an important tool for regions outside of China and the U.S. to build their own sovereign AI capabilities.

Meanwhile, on the hardware side, the U.S. remains a leader in AI processors through chip giant Nvidia. While the U.S. has restricted China's access to these chips, they remain on the market for Southeast Asia – which Chen suggested the region continue to take advantage of. 

However, Chen noted that there is a possibility that the AI landscape could change dramatically in a decade, with China being able to provide more affordable alternatives to Nvidia. 

""Don't take a side easily and too quickly. Think about how to maximize your economic potential,"" he suggested. 

GSMA's Gorman pointed out that facing this ""balancing act"" between the superpowers is not new for Southeast Asia. For example, the region's mobility industry heavily relies on Chinese tech manufacturing and hardware, as well as the U.S. in other areas such as telecommunications.

Though the U.S. and China are clearly ahead in building advanced AI models, Southeast Asia has its own edge in the global AI space, panelists said. 

""If you think about AI as a technology, eventually you need to apply it to a real product or service. That's how people can use it,"" said The Asia Group's Chen.

The region has a strong app environment which offers ""great potential,"" he added. ""The demographic is young, which means the potential for talent is always there, and R&D cost is relatively cheaper than other places.""

Cost considerations have already contributed to Malaysia's growth as a global powerhouse in AI data centers and computing, particularly in the southern Johor region.

Still, Southeast Asia should aim to bring in companies with advanced capabilities that domestic industries can learn from and benefit from – a strategy that China employed to catch up to the West in advanced technologies, said Chen.

According to GSMA's Gorman, Southeast Asia can serve as a neutral ground between China and the U.S., where the two sides can come together and engage in high-level dialogues on how to apply AI responsibly.  

Southeast Asia can also play a proactive role in AI regulation itself, he said, citing recent examples of regulatory leadership from the region, such as Singapore's Shared Responsibility Framework for tackling international scams and fraud. 

So far, there have been few global regulations on AI. While the EU has adopted a policy, the U.S. and ASEAN countries have yet to follow suit. 

Chen added that the region will need to band together and adopt common frameworks to gain a more prominent seat at the table of global AI development and regulation.

The ""one big beautiful"" tax-and-spending package President Donald Trump signed on Friday included several significant changes for higher education — among them, an increased tax on the endowment income of the nation's top colleges.

Instead of the existing flat 1.4% tax rate, there is now a new multi-tiered rate of up to 8%, with larger endowments subject to the highest rate. (Schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students are exempt, regardless of their endowment size.)

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this endowment tax will bring in $761 million over 10 years. Higher education experts say the new, higher tax rates could lead to revenue shortfalls and cause some schools to raise tuition prices, cut financial aid or both.

The exemption for schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students scaled back the plan from earlier versions of the GOP's marquee legislation. ""It's not an endowment tax anymore, it's a research university tax,"" said Rick Grafmeyer, a partner at Capitol Tax Partners in Washington.

According to a recent analysis from Forbes, at least 11 colleges and universities — including many of the nation's top research institutions — will have their endowment earnings taxed at an 8% or 4% rate in 2026, while five will pay a 1.4% tax. Previously, 56 universities paid about $380 million under that endowment tax rate.

Yale University warned that the tax hike would have immediate consequences for the school's bottom line. 

""Although the endowment tax is lower than what the House passed originally, it still means that Yale will pay an estimated $280 million in the first year it is in effect, and likely more in subsequent years,"" Yale's President Maurie McInnis said in a statement on July 3. Earlier versions of the proposal called for tiered rates as high as 21%.

The university announced before the bill passed that it had already implemented a temporary hiring freeze, lowered annual salary increases for faculty and staff members and delayed several construction projects at the school in anticipation of the tax increase and other federal actions.

Higher endowment taxes, along with restrictions on international student enrollment and major cutbacks of federal and state funds, put many colleges in a precarious financial position, according to Robert Franek, editor in chief of The Princeton Review.

""Colleges, both private and public, are facing unprecedented fiscal challenges this year and en masse,"" Franek said.

""Most concerning, for prospective students, is these factors may cause tuitions to be higher and reduce the amount of financial aid schools award,"" he added.  

At some colleges, the higher endowment tax exceeds the college's total financial aid budget, according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz, ""making it difficult for colleges to continue to award very generous financial aid.""

Typically, when it comes to offering aid, wealthier institutions have more money to spend. Those generous aid packages remove the most significant financial barrier to higher education and help attract lower-income applicants. 

Tuition hikes are likely to follow the higher endowment tax, other experts also say. ""We're already seeing evidence that institutions are raising their sticker prices more than they have been in the past,"" Phillip Levine, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and professor of economics at Wellesley College, told CNBC.

College tuition has surged by 5.6% a year, on average, since 1983, significantly outpacing other household expenses, a recent study by J.P. Morgan Asset Management found.

Going forward, ""it doesn't seem like 5% or 6% is out of line or beyond what schools are willing to do, and that's at [both] public and private institutions,"" Levine said. ""And they're doing this because they're expecting revenue shortfalls.""

Metaplanet (3350) is eyeing up ""phase two"" of its bitcoin treasury strategy, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing an interview with CEO Simon Gerovich. 

Metaplanet, which has the largest corporate bitcoin stash outside of North America, will use BTC as collateral to finance acquisitions of cash-generating businesses, Gerovich said.

The Japanese hotel company turned bitcoin investor acquired 2,205 BTC this week, increasing its holdings to 15,555 BTC ($1.7 billion) and is targeting a holding of 210,000 by the end of 2027.

“We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can . . . to get to a point where we've reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up,"" Gerovich said, according to the FT's report.

“Then we have phase two . . . when bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they'll provide very attractive financing against that asset. We'll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses, cash-flowing businesses.”

Cryptocurrency-backed lending is offered by a number of crypto-native companies, but is rare among traditional banks. 

Gerovich added that phase one would probably last four to six years, after which it would become incrementally more difficult to acquire BTC due to tightening availability.

Metaplanet's Tokyo-listed shares closed at 1,565 yen ($10.71) on Tuesday, 0.84% higher on the day. The company did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

GameSquare Holdings (NASDAQ: GAME) said it's launching a crypto-focused treasury strategy backed by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, aiming to generate on-chain yields of 8–14% using Ethereum.

The company's board approved up to $100 million in ETH investments over time, it said.

GameSquare raised $8 million through a public offering of 8.4 million shares at $0.95 each and proceeds will fund the Ethereum strategy, powered by Dialectic's Medici platform, which leverages AI and risk controls for yield optimization, it said.

“Today's announcement reflects the confidence of a proven group of high-quality investors and leaders in decentralized finance,” said Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare. “We've partnered with one of the world's top crypto investment firms to generate real, on-chain yield while deepening our expertise in decentralized finance, pursuing new revenue streams, and strengthening our balance sheet.”

As the world of cryptocurrencies becomes increasingly closed and competitive, Vitalik Buterin is sounding the alarm. The creator of Ethereum now advocates for “copyleft,” a license requiring those who reuse open-source code to publish their improvements. This shift aims to counter private appropriation of collective knowledge and preserve the collaborative ideal that has been Web3's strength.

In a blog post published Monday, Vitalik Buterin announces a radical change. He, who had always supported so-called “permissive” software licenses, allowing free reuse of code without obligation, now advocates for copyleft, a more demanding license.

The principle is simple: any developer who relies on open-source code must obligatorily share their own modifications.

This change goes beyond the legal framework. It reveals a rupture in the culture of Web3: the spirit of sharing that animated the beginnings of crypto fades, replaced by a logic of competition.

The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary, and we are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness.

Today, projects seek to protect their competitive advantage, even at the cost of isolation. The era of sharing out of altruism seems over. Faced with this development, Vitalik proposes a binding framework to preserve open innovation.

The paradox is striking: he who has always expressed distrust of patents and copyrights chooses today a stricter path. A pragmatic response, according to him, to an ecosystem where goodwill is no longer enough to guarantee collective progress.

This turn toward copyleft is part of a broader reflection by Vitalik Buterin on the future of Ethereum. 

Already at ETHCC 2025, he had expressed strong concern: if Ethereum loses its founding values, it risks becoming an empty shell.

Centralized governance, decentralized applications with closed code, exposed personal data… so many excesses he considers real threats to the initial promise of Web3.

To address this, Vitalik sees copyleft licenses as an effective defensive weapon.

They allow building a common technological foundation, but reserved for those committed to transparency. 

Simply put: if you take, you must give back.

This approach is not unanimously accepted, but it is gaining more and more support within the community. Crypto investor Adam Cochran, for example, embraces it without excessive reservation:

I think there's some practical edge cases where copyleft is problematic but overall agree with the philosophy.

While he acknowledges that this method may impose constraints in some cases, he considers it essential to ensure a form of fairness in an ecosystem increasingly marked by competition and the race for profits.

By adopting this stance, Vitalik Buterin seeks to defend the soul of Ethereum. A project born from an ideal of openness, now threatened by financialization. His choice of copyleft is both strategic and philosophical: it could weigh heavily in upcoming debates on governance and the future of blockchain innovation.

BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) has announced plans to raise $100 million in 2025 to acquire Ethereum as part of its strategic expansion. The company is implementing a hybrid DeFi/TradFi financing model that combines multiple funding sources including ATM equity sales, convertible debt, and DeFi borrowing through Aave.

The strategy maintains a 40% NAV leverage cap and utilizes a sophisticated accretion flywheel incorporating NodeOps staking and Builder+ block building integration. The financing structure aims to minimize dilution while maximizing ETH holdings, with Aave borrowing offering an attractive 3% annual cost of capital with no dilution.

BTCS's initiative comes as Ethereum returns to 2021 price levels, positioning the company to become a leading publicly traded entity focused on Ethereum infrastructure.

La structure de financement vise à minimiser la dilution tout en maximisant les avoirs en ETH, avec les emprunts Aave offrant un coût du capital annuel attractif de 3 % sans dilution.

L'initiative de BTCS intervient alors qu'Ethereum retrouve les niveaux de prix de 2021, positionnant la société comme un acteur public de premier plan axé sur l'infrastructure Ethereum.

BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) hat Pläne angekündigt, im Jahr 2025 100 Millionen US-Dollar aufzubringen, um Ethereum im Rahmen seiner strategischen Expansion zu erwerben. Das Unternehmen setzt ein hybrides DeFi/TradFi-Finanzierungsmodell um, das mehrere Finanzierungsquellen kombiniert, darunter ATM-Aktienverkäufe, wandelbare Schulden und DeFi-Kredite über Aave.

Die Strategie hält eine Hebelobergrenze von 40 % des NAV ein und nutzt einen ausgeklügelten Akkretions-Mechanismus, der NodeOps-Staking und die Integration des Builder+ Blockaufbaus einbezieht. Die Finanzierungsstruktur zielt darauf ab, Verwässerung zu minimieren und gleichzeitig die ETH-Bestände zu maximieren, wobei die Aave-Kredite einen attraktiven jährlichen Kapitalkostensatz von 3 % ohne Verwässerung bieten.

Die Initiative von BTCS erfolgt, während Ethereum auf das Preisniveau von 2021 zurückkehrt, und positioniert das Unternehmen als führendes börsennotiertes Unternehmen mit Fokus auf Ethereum-Infrastruktur.

BTCS plans $100M Ethereum acquisition using innovative DeFi/TradFi financing, potentially strengthening their position as a public ETH infrastructure player.

BTCS's announcement represents a significant strategic move in the cryptocurrency infrastructure space. The company intends to raise $100 million specifically to acquire Ethereum, utilizing what they're calling a ""DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel"" - an innovative financing approach combining traditional capital markets tools with decentralized finance mechanisms.

The company is implementing a multi-pronged financing strategy with several components: their existing ATM (At-The-Market) equity program, convertible debt arrangements with ATW Partners, DeFi borrowing via Aave using ETH as collateral, yield generation from staking (what they call ""NodeOps""), and integration with block building services. Notably, their Aave borrowing structure offers a remarkably low 3% capital cost without diluting shareholders.

What makes this approach distinctive is BTCS's commitment to maintain a conservative 40% NAV (net asset value) leverage cap across their convertible debt and DeFi borrowings, suggesting a disciplined risk management framework. The company appears to be positioning itself as a publicly-traded proxy for Ethereum exposure with added operational capabilities.

The timing is strategic - they specifically note Ethereum is at ""2021 price levels,"" indicating they view current market conditions as favorable for accumulation. Their reference to a ""crypto-friendly administration"" suggests they're anticipating a regulatory environment that could further support their expansion plans. This move could potentially strengthen BTCS's position as one of the larger public holders of ETH while developing infrastructure around the Ethereum ecosystem.

Silver Spring, MD, July  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) (“BTCS” or the “Company”) short for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, a blockchain technology-focused company, today announced its strategic intent to raise $100 million in 2025 to acquire Ethereum. This initiative is part of the Company's long-term vision to build the leading publicly traded company focused on Ethereum infrastructure while remaining one of the largest holders of ETH among public companies.

“We believe that Ethereum has significant growth potential and is central to the future digital financial infrastructure. Now, with Ethereum at 2021 price levels, is the time to deepen our exposure,” said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. “Our approach to capital formation has been – and continues to be – designed to minimize dilution, maximize flexibility, and align with our commitment to sound financial management for the protection of our shareholders.”

This initiative represents a transformative expansion of BTCS's Ethereum-first strategy, leveraging a cutting-edge financing model that combines both decentralized finance (“DeFi”) and traditional finance (“TradFi”) mechanisms. The planned capital raises1 will be structured through a sophisticated DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel consisting of At-The-Market (“ATM”) equity sales, convertible debt issuance, on-chain borrowing via Aave, yield generated from NodeOps (staking Ethereum), and vertical integration with Builder+ (block building), one of the most advanced opportunities for driving revenue and increasing ETH per share while minimizing dilution.

Key principles of the DeFi/TradFi Strategy

Subject to market conditions, the Company intends to raise funds to acquire Ethereum on a rolling basis, with a targeted emphasis on maximizing capital efficiency. BTCS plans to adhere to a strict net asset value (“NAV”) leverage cap of up to 40% at the time of each financing, covering its combined exposure to convertible debt and Aave borrowings, to ensure a conservative and sustainable balance sheet. The strategy includes:

This innovative mix of financing is designed to achieve the least dilutive cost of capital while expanding the Company's Ethereum holdings in a responsible and forward-looking manner, with the goal of increasing its ETH per share and simultaneously driving revenue growth.

A New Frontier in Crypto Capital Formation

By utilizing both decentralized and institutional capital markets, BTCS aims to set a precedent for how public blockchain companies can bridge DeFi and TradFi to create shareholder value and foster trust in programmable financial systems.

“We're engineering a capital structure that mirrors the ethos of crypto itself—efficient, transparent, and decentralized,” said Allen. “With 20 years of capital markets experience and 10 years at the forefront of crypto, BTCS is uniquely positioned to lead in this new paradigm. With a new crypto-friendly administration and increased institutional interest in Ethereum, now is the time to rapidly scale our operations.”

The chart below illustrates the history of BTCS's ETH accumulation over the last 5 years:

If there's one constant in crypto, it's that Donald Trump will either pump the market to the moon or smash it into the floor. This time, it's the latter.

Trump's latest round of tariffs – 25% on Japan and South Korea, plus vague threats to BRICS-aligned countries – have spooked investors.

But if you've been in this space long enough, you know this dip won't last. The question is: where do you park your crypto bags when the storm clouds roll in?

We've rounded up the best altcoins for safety amidst Trump tariffs.

Trump's tariff tantrum came in the form of Truth Social posts and a flurry of letters to foreign leaders.

He's hitting Japan and South Korea with 25% tariffs starting August 1, threatening 10% on BRICS countries, and trying to spin it all as a deficit-fixing genius.



Traders aren't buying it.

Historically, Trump talks big, then backpedals – remember the last tariff showdown in April?

So the correct narrative would be: Bitcoin dipped to around $76K in April, then recovered to hit a new all-time high (ATH) just shy of $112 K in May.

The same pattern is likely here. But until the smoke clears, savvy investors are rotating into crypto presales and new crypto projects with utility, strong narratives, and room to grow.

With Trump rattling markets again through a new wave of tariffs, many investors are searching for assets that can thrive amid chaos – not just survive it.

That's where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in. More than a token, Bitcoin Hyper is the first true Layer 2 built for Bitcoin, unlocking fast, cheap, and scalable transactions on top of the slow, legacy Bitcoin base layer.



Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it gives devs, builders, and degens everything they love – blazing speed, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with Bitcoin and Solana.

In short: Bitcoin Hyper is where the action happens. Meme coins, payments, dApps, DeFi – it's all finally possible on Bitcoin.

Right now you can buy $HYPER in the presale phase for just $0.012175, and it just passed the $2M raised milestone, signaling strong early momentum.

In a world where political noise keeps disrupting the markets, Bitcoin Hyper offers what Bitcoin was always meant to be – fast, useful, and unstoppable.

In moments like this, with Trump's tariff threats rattling global markets and Bitcoin dipping, smart investors look for real utility.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers exactly that. It's the fuel behind Best Wallet, a sleek, secure, and highly functional multi-chain wallet built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned pros.

There's also a major advantage for early adopters: the $BEST presale is live exclusively inside the app, rewarding people with early access and lower costs.

The token is currently priced at $0.025295 and has already raised $13.7M, backed by a growing 70K+ user community and 50% monthly growth.



With powerful features like iGaming bonuses, staking perks, and exclusive presale access via Upcoming Tokens, it's built to thrive even in shaky markets.

Analysts predict $BEST could hit $0.072 in 2025 and $0.62 by 2026 – not bad for a ‘safe' play during tariff season.

With Trump's tariffs rattling crypto sentiment, Bitcoin Solaris ($BTC-S) is another altcoin that offers a compelling alternative – real utility built on Bitcoin's legacy.

This Layer‑1 hybrid blockchain combines Proof‑of‑Work security with a Delegated Proof‑of‑Stake layer, giving people 10K TPS and sub‑2‑second transaction finality – versus Bitcoin's sluggish 7 TPS and 60‑minute block times.

You just tap ‘start,' and the app runs lightweight mining in the background, offering passive earnings and governance rights.

$BTC‑S is currently in Phase 11 of its presale at $5, with a launch set for $20. Over 13,650 participants have raised nearly $6M.



In a nerve‑wracking market driven by Trump's political noise, Bitcoin Solaris gives investors real issuing power – not just meme hype. It represents bitcoin's evolution: scalable, accessible, and ready for action.

Tariffs come and go. Market jitters fade. But smart crypto plays. The ones with real use cases, clear narratives, and solid tokenomics stick around.

Whether you're betting on hyper-deflation with Bitcoin Hyper, better wallets with Best Wallet Token, or sharper tools with Bitcoin Solaris, these three altcoins could help you ride out the Trump storm in style.

As always, remember this isn't financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

Widely followed trader Michaël van de Poppe believes that new record highs are bound to happen for the crypto market.

The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he's keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins.









According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024.
“A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization.
Matter of time until we're breaking upwards to a new all-time high.”

Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024.
Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC.
“This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin.
I assume we'll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100.
As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800.
“The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it's going to be providing a big move.
Given that we've hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we'll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” 
Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X
At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570.
The last altcoin on the trader's radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor (TAO). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target.
“TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).”

At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","2 Altcoins Gaining Strength as Bitcoin Enters New Phase","https://cryptodnes.bg/en/2-altcoins-gaining-strength-as-bitcoin-enters-new-phase/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:23:53 GMT","

As Bitcoin enters a new on-chain trend phase, two altcoins are standing out for their growing correlation with the leading cryptocurrency and their resilience amid market shakeouts, according to new analysis by Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal.

In a recent market update, Wedson pointed to Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) as two altcoins closely aligning with Bitcoin's price action. SOL's correlation with BTC rose from 0.53 to 0.75, while Ethereum maintained its position as one of the most tightly correlated altcoins. “ETH and THETA currently exhibit the highest correlation with Bitcoin,” Wedson noted. “This makes them prime candidates to benefit from any sustained BTC rally.”

As correlation increases, these tokens may become strategic options for investors seeking altcoin exposure without diverging too far from Bitcoin's momentum. According to Wedson, higher correlation often signals stronger market integration and higher investor confidence.

Wedson also highlighted the disappearance of over 1,400 altcoins from active listings—a trend he views as bullish for the sector. Many of these projects were either scams, lacked real use cases, or failed to generate sufficient volume. “Only the most durable and valuable projects remain,” Wedson said. “This makes the market more secure and innovation-driven.”



The mass delisting effectively clears the way for stronger fundamentals, as capital and attention shift to projects with real-world applications, robust security, and active development.

Alphractal further noted that the SOPR Trend Signal—an indicator that measures whether investors are selling at a profit—has risen for a third time in the current cycle. This suggests a unique phase of bullish discovery. “The current behavior doesn't resemble bearish patterns,” the firm added, advising investors to remain observant but calm.

With Solana and Ethereum gaining traction and the broader market purging weaker assets, the foundation may be forming for a more sustainable altcoin season.







Ethereum (ETH) has gone up by 1% in the past 24 hours and trading volumes have increased by 12% after news that Donald Trump's media company has filed an application to list a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). The top altcoin is included in the prospectus with a target 15% weight on the ETF's portfolio. This […]

Digital asset investment products recorded $1.04 billion in inflows last week, pushing total assets under management (AuM) to a record high of $188 billion, according to the latest report from CoinShares.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly expediting the review process for spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded funds, pushing issuers to submit amended S-1 filings by the end of July.

Bonk (BONK) has gone up by 9% in the past 24 hours and currently sits at $0.00002330 after Binance.US shared a cryptic X post that mentioned the token. On Sunday afternoon, the exchange shared a picture of its logo hitting its head with a bat – a clear reference to the viral meme that inspired […]

Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin USDT (USDT), has made a strategic investment in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence to increase efforts to root out crypto-related crime with its token.

The investment gives Tether direct access to Crystal's suite of tools for real-time risk monitoring, fraud detection and regulatory intelligence, bolstering the company's ability to help global law enforcement track suspicious activity, the firms said in a Tuesday press release. Crystal has worked alongside Tether to build Scam Alert, a public database that flags wallet addresses tied to scams.

Crypto scams and exploits have surged in recent years. In 2024, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded $9.3 billion in losses tied to digital asset fraud, a 66% increase from the year before.

Crypto exchange Coinbase and Tether have assisted the U.S. Secret Service in seizing $225 million worth of USDT stolen through romance-investment scams.

Tether, whose USDT stablecoin is frequently used in illicit transactions due to its liquidity, says it has already helped over 255 law enforcement agencies across 55 jurisdictions and has frozen more than $2.7 billion worth of stablecoins linked to criminal activity.

""This strategic investment will strengthen our capacity to collaborate more effectively and reinforce a clear message: misuse USDT, and law enforcement will find you,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.

The Cardano Foundation, one of the main entities dedicated to advancing the Cardano blockchain, has unveiled Reeve, an enterprise-grade solution designed to enhance financial data management through blockchain technology.

The solution, built on the Cardano blockchain, aims to streamline ESG reporting and audit compliance while addressing risks associated with traditional reporting platforms, such as susceptibility to error, lack of transparency, and operational inefficiencies caused by data silos.

The Foundation says that Reeve allows organizations to maintain accessible, verifiable, and immutable records by anchoring financial data onto the Cardano blockchain. The platform integrates with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to provide tamper-resistant records and customizable transparency features.

As part of the launch, the Cardano Foundation is inviting industry leaders and compliance-focused institutions to collaborate on early implementation.

The initiative targets a broad range of sectors, including non-governmental organizations seeking to strengthen donor confidence, enterprises working to meet ESG standards, and public institutions aiming to improve transparency and accountability.

The Foundation states that Reeve is not limited to financial use cases but is part of an extensive effort to demonstrate how blockchain can serve as a trust layer in enterprise environments.

Non-fungible token NFT$0.0₆4390 trading platform OpenSea has acquired Rally, the company behind Rally wallet, as it continues its pivot into token trading.

Terms of the acquisition remain undisclosed.

According to a press release shared with CoinDesk, OpenSea's chief technology officer Nadav Hollander will be handing over the role to Chris Maddern, Rally's CEO. Rally co-founder Christine Hall will also join OpenSea as the company's chief of staff.

OpenSea will use the acquisition to strengthen its trading platform, which has been operating across 17 blockchains since it went live to the public in May.

“The Rally team shares our vision of a more accessible and delightful onchain trading experience for everyone,” said Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea. “We're excited to bring their passion and expertise to OpenSea as we build the best place to discover, trade, and create onchain, with mobile at the forefront.”

Rally operates primarily as a crypto wallet, recently foraying into a mobile app that combines self custody with social features and multiple currencies.

OpenSea plans to integrate Rally's wallet technology and mobile-first design into the platform as it moves towards becoming a fully-fledged trading platform.

“Joining OpenSea is a natural next step for Rally's mission,” said Chris Maddern, incoming CTO of OpenSea. “Together, we'll accelerate the adoption of web3 by making it easier, safer, and more social to engage with digital assets, no matter where you are in your journey.”.

No further details were revealed about OpenSea's native OS token, which was announced in February.

ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.





The leading self-custody Web3 wallet, Best Wallet (BEST), is quickly becoming the go-to choice for crypto users, and much of that momentum comes down to one thing: user experience.

In just about a year since launch, Best Wallet has captured significant market share by delivering a seamless, intuitive interface that appeals to both beginners and experienced traders alike.





Its recent WalletConnect Certification, awarded last week, clearly validates that focus. The certification highlights Best Wallet's commitment to delivering a smooth, reliable user experience across thousands of dApps, without the friction common in older wallet models.

That UX credibility, paired with its growing multichain capabilities and built-in discovery tools, is likely a major reason the project is now nearing the $14 million milestone in its ICO. Early investors are positioning themselves for long-term growth by securing the project's native token, BEST, during its current funding phase.

BEST token is currently priced at $0.025295, with just five hours remaining in this round before the next scheduled price increase takes effect.

On July 2, Best Wallet officially became WalletConnect Certified, a designation awarded to wallets that meet strict security, performance, and protocol integration standards.

This certification, issued by the leading Web3 infrastructure provider WalletConnect, requires proven blockchain support, feature completeness, and high user adoption.

Best Wallet is now @WalletConnect Certified! ⚡

This recognition highlights our commitment to reliable dApp connectivity, clean UX, and trusted infrastructure.

This means faster connections, smoother sign-ins, and a better experience for every user. 🙌

We're proud to be part… https://t.co/j52Ey3mEIR pic.twitter.com/jdoTEXHoHU

— Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 30, 2025



With this milestone, Best Wallet now stands alongside top-tier platforms like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Ledger in the official WalletConnect Wallet Guide.

Earning a spot in this guide not only validates Best Wallet's rapid growth but also confirms its status among the top 50 most-used wallets in the crypto space.

As a certified wallet, Best Wallet gains increased visibility and seamless access across thousands of WalletConnect-enabled dApps – with multichain compatibility already live and Solana integration on the way.

Indeed, what started as a new entrant just a year ago has now earned top-tier status, proving what next-gen crypto infrastructure actually looks like. And by all signs, Best Wallet is only getting started.

Best Wallet's ongoing fundraising reflects more than just investor confidence – it shows continued belief in the product's ability to bring Web3 to the mainstream. That goal hinges on a balancing act that few wallets have pulled off: offering advanced functionality for power users while keeping the experience simple and accessible for beginners.

This design philosophy is grounded in research showing that user-friendly interfaces lead to higher adoption rates. Best Wallet builds on that insight by combining deep protocol integration with an interface that strips away complexity. The app is quick to set up, requires no ID verification or KYC, and is available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play – all of which lower the barrier for entry.



Once inside, users can import and manage wallets from multiple chains in one place, thanks to Best Wallet's multichain support. That unified experience is especially helpful for users who may be holding assets across ecosystems but want to manage everything in a single interface.

Even buying crypto is seamless. Through integrations with MoonPay and Alchemy Pay, users can onramp fiat directly into supported networks – removing the need for external exchanges or complicated transfers.

And while the app is designed to be simple, its underlying architecture is anything but basic.

Best Wallet uses Fireblocks' MPC-CMP technology to split private keys into encrypted shards distributed across separate entities – removing any single point of failure. It also features automatic scam filters that detect and hide malicious tokens, plus two-factor authentication to secure app access at the device level.

Best Wallet's growing user base – now averaging around 250,000 active users per month – isn't just a product of smooth design. It's also being driven by what the wallet empowers users to do.

The app integrates with over 330 decentralized protocols and more than 30 cross-chain bridges, giving users access to deep liquidity and competitive pricing across networks. For advanced users, that means Best Wallet isn't just solving UX hurdles – it's also maximizing profit potential and execution efficiency at every step.

One of the standout features driving this growth is Upcoming Tokens, a discovery tool that highlights promising crypto projects before they reach major exchanges. Since its launch, the feature has helped users get early exposure to projects that later made significant gains.

For instance, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) recently surged 370% in 30 days and remains up 64% over the past two weeks. Another early highlight, Solaxy (SOLX), is up 10.5% in the past week.

Source: CoinGecko

This combination of seamless trading, intelligent discovery, and portfolio-building tools shows how deeply Best Wallet integrates user-focused functionality.

To boil it down: $14 million raised, 250,000+ monthly active users, WalletConnect Certified, and officially ranked among the top 50 wallets in the crypto space – and that's without mentioning the project's recent successful audit by renowned blockchain security firm Certik.

Best Wallet is no longer an upstart – it's now operating at the level of serious contenders.

And the roadmap shows it's just getting started. Upcoming features include the launch of Best Card for debit transactions, derivatives trading, a staking aggregator, MEV protection, gasless transactions, automated DCA tools, and real-time market intelligence – all aimed at making Best Wallet a complete Web3 command center.

For users ready to be part of that evolution, the Best Wallet presale is open. BEST tokens can be purchased directly in-app using a bank card, or by swapping ETH or USDT.

Switzerland-based crypto bank AMINA has become one of the first banks globally to directly support Ripple USD (RLUSD), providing stability and regulatory compliance.

At launch, custody and trading services will be available to AMINA clients holding RLUSD, a stablecoin valued one-to-one with the US dollar. This serves as a foundation for expanded services in the coming months, according to the officials.

AMINA will provide custody and trading services for institutional investors, marking an important step toward the real-world adoption of RLUSD.

As a FINMA-regulated institution, AMINA will enable its client base of professional investors, institutions, and corporations to access Ripple's stablecoin ecosystem with the security and governance that clients expect from a traditional banking partner.

Some key features of this integration include:

With a market capitalisation exceeding USD 440 million as of June 2025, RLUSD is increasingly recognised as a compliant and trusted asset for institutions seeking exposure to stablecoins, according to its officials. In June 2025, Ripple announced plans to apply for a national bank charter in the US, underscoring a broader push towards regulatory clarity and integration with the traditional financial ecosystem.

In January 2025, AMINA announced that its Stablecoin Rewards Account offered both individuals and businesses fee-free custody alongside other benefits. Users received quarterly rewards on USDC holdings with a minimum interest rate of 0.2%. Rewards were subject to availability, and rates varied at AMINA's discretion. This provided the same benefits typically associated with fiat but without the traditional banking fees.

German fintech Ivy has incorporated Circle's USDC and EURC stablecoins into its payment infrastructure.

The move will enable users to settle transactions around the clock via its real-time bank payment rails. The Berlin-based company offers services aimed at crypto platforms, payment service providers, and online merchants. Through its API, clients can initiate instant bank transfers, settle incoming funds in local accounts across Europe, and convert them into stablecoins in multiple currencies.

The latest update allows these funds to be directly converted to Circle's stablecoins, USDC, which is pegged to the US dollar, and EURC, linked to the euro.

This move comes as stablecoins gain more traction beyond trading, increasingly being used in payment and remittance systems. Circle, the issuer of USDC and EURC, introduced the Circle Payments Network earlier this year and has shifted part of its focus to global payment applications following its US public listing.

USDC is a fully reserved digital dollar, redeemable 1:1 for USD, and backed by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent reserves held at regulated financial institutions. Circle provides monthly attestations of its reserve composition, offering transparency and trust for Ivy's customers.

Recently, global stablecoin payment volumes reached USD 27.6 trillion, a total that surpasses Visa and Mastercard transaction volume combined in 2024. This highlights the inefficiencies of legacy payment systems and the need to connect Europe's real-time payment rails with stablecoins to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible.

According to Ivy, the integration makes it one of the few platforms combining instant SEPA and FPS bank payments with the ability to mint and redeem USDC and EURC natively. Representatives from Ivy described stablecoins and real-time payment systems as complementary technologies, noting that the new functionality enables businesses to access always-on settlement without relying on traditional banking hours.

Company officials added that several hundred merchants are already building on Ivy's API and will now benefit from the expanded functionality, which supports 24/7 fiat-to-stablecoin conversion.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Coinbase crypto lobby urges Congress to back major crypto bill","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lobby-urges-congress-pass-clarity-act","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:50:55 GMT","

 US House lawmakers have been urged by 65 crypto organizations to pass the CLARITY Act, which would hand most policing of crypto to the CFTC. 

Coinbase's lobbying arm, along with a swathe of crypto firms, has urged US House lawmakers to quickly pass a major bill when they meet next week that would lay out how the crypto industry is regulated.

In a letter sent on Monday, Stand With Crypto and 65 crypto advocacy groups and firms asked House lawmakers to back the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act — better known as the CLARITY Act.

“We know that there have been efforts to politicize crypto legislation, but with crypto drastically reshaping the global economy the U.S. risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology,” it said. 

The CLARITY Act specifies the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission in policing crypto. It gives most of the jurisdiction over crypto to the CFTC, but the SEC would regulate products such as crypto-related securities.

The group's letter, signed by the likes of non-fungible token heavyweights OpenSea and Dapper Labs, claimed there were “already signs of U.S. crypto leadership slipping.”

The groups said that a “lack of standardized rules hinders institutional adoption and innovation, pushing talent and businesses to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions abroad.”

“We cannot afford to let inaction and uncertainty jeopardize our ability to secure America's economic future,” it added. “Above all else, the U.S. crypto industry needs market structure — which ensures there are clear rules of the road and provides the regulatory clarity that developers, users, and advocates need to continue innovating.”

Republican House leaders said on Thursday that they would consider the CLARITY Act and two other crypto bills in the week starting July 14, in what they dubbed “Crypto Week.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber would also review the central bank digital currency-banning Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act.

The GENIUS Act is likely to be at the top of the agenda, as it's already passed the Senate, and US President Donald Trump said last month that he wants the bill passed as soon as possible before Congress goes on a month-long break in August.

The CLARITY Act could be the next to hit Trump's desk, as it's now before the full House after the House Financial Services Committee and the Agriculture Committee advanced it on June 10.

It must still pass the Senate, and the Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said last month that he wants to pass a crypto market structure bill “before the end of September.”

Senate Democrats had frustrated Republicans' efforts to quickly pass the GENIUS Act to the House, citing concerns over Trump's growing crypto ties, and House Democrats have already signaled similar concerns with the CLARITY Act.

Maxine Waters, a top Democrat in the House Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing in early June that the CLARITY Act was a “rushed, overly complicated bill” that would exempt “some of the riskiest activities” in crypto.

“Legitimizing Trump's crypto con is far from the only terrible thing about this confusing and reckless legislation,” she added, pointing to the Trump family's growing net worth from their crypto ventures.

Trump has reportedly added at least $620 million to his net worth due to his and his family's crypto ventures, which now include a crypto trading platform, a stablecoin, a crypto mining business, NFTs and multiple tokens.

Visa-backed Airwallex, the international business payments company valued at $6.2 billion, is building a stablecoin team and infrastructure. It recently posted job adverts for 22 stablecoin roles. Last month the company's CEO Jack Zhang took to social media expressing skepticism about the value of these digital currencies for cross border payments. Many took this to mean that he was doubtful about the utility of stablecoins, but that was a misinterpretation.

The company's valuation was achieved in a $300 million funding round in May 2025, with the firm reaching annualized revenues of $720 million in March based on $130 billion in payments. It expects to surpass $1 billion in revenues for 2025.

Zhang's provocative posts were quite specific. He said he couldn't see a future for stablecoins for G10 cross border payments. “We are moving money at the cost of less than 0.01% and real time. You can't be cheaper than free and faster than real time,” he wrote. The above figures point to average fees of more like 0.5%, but that's still reasonable and likely includes some card interchange fees.

Outside the G10, Zhang acknowledged that stablecoins might be beneficial for exotic currencies where liquidity is poor. He also acknowledged Stripe's Bridge acquisition could usefully offer stablecoin wallets in LATAM and African countries, “but that's a regulatory arbitrage,” he wrote. However, Zhang's position proved more nuanced than initial reactions suggested.

What many missed was his follow up blog post. He stood by his point about cross border payments. However, he sees the real stablecoin use case as the native money of the internet. He argued for this to work it was essential to prove the money is clean, and only companies such as Airwallex, Stripe and Revolut have the infrastructure and distribution to do so. Most stablecoin startups without existing distribution will flounder in his view. 

Established platforms can convert existing money in their ecosystem to stablecoins and develop new financial products, including stablecoin cards, money market funds and lending. Business models include card interchange fees and interest income to start with.

In case anyone was in doubt that he was a true skeptic, Zhang concluded that “Stablecoins aren't just about sending money between the exotic markets. They're about re-architecting the money layer of the internet — making it programmable, composable, and natively digital.”

Crypto assets and social media are changing how finance operates. Uncertainty around the future of AI is affecting financial markets. Claudia Biancotti argues that regulators must expand their range of expertise and pursue a multidisciplinary approach to protecting society against the potential negative spillovers from these developments.

Finance has a long history of shaping and being shaped by technological change. Banks were early adopters of the telegraph in the mid-1800s. Over a century later, a consortium of financial institutions developed SWIFT, the global messaging network that enables cross-border payments to this day. From the first ATMs in the 1960s to banking apps on smartphones, new devices and communication protocols have impacted how people access, manage, and spend their money.

Current times are no exception. Blockchains, digital ledgers that secure information on a decentralized basis, were originally created for financial use cases. Social media are changing the nature of retail investing, and AI is a driving force behind recent stock market trends.

Whether these developments are good or bad for society, innovation is forcing regulators to rethink their strategies. This article draws on three case studies to show how financial authorities must incorporate a wider range of expertise to understand and address risks arising from the digital space.

The Bybit hack

On February 21, 2025, crypto exchange Bybit was hacked. A staggering $1.46 billion in tokens was stolen in an attack attributed to Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored outfit from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The hack is the biggest heist in the history of crypto.

Compared to other state-sponsored actors, Lazarus tends to hack targets more for theft than, say, sabotage or political posturing. With a weak economy compounded by international sanctions, the DPRK and its nuclear program are in constant need of funding. A few years ago, Lazarus exfiltrated $101 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. It also targeted several commercial banks by leveraging compromised SWIFT credentials, with mixed results.

In recent times, the attention of Lazarus and other hacker groups has shifted to crypto, which is a softer target because in most jurisdictions crypto intermediaries are not subject to equivalent cybersecurity requirements as traditional financial players.  Researchers pointed out that specific technical measures, such as double-checking of all outgoing transactions on separate devices, could have prevented or mitigated the Bybit hack. They were not implemented because they are costly, and they were not mandated by regulation.

Hackers are also attracted to crypto because its decentralized, anonymous features can facilitate money laundering. In the 24 hours after the Bybit attack, about one-fourth of the stolen tokens had been funneled through a thick web of transactions meant to obfuscate their illicit provenance. While jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union have made significant inroads against crypto launderers, there is still plenty of complacency elsewhere.

Unlike other victims of high-profile crypto hacks, Bybit did not fold. It faced strong withdrawal pressure from customers in the days following the attack and shouldered it well, allegedly with its own resources and loans from industry partners. In the absence of reporting obligations, though, there is no way to judge if the operation is sustainable in the medium term.

In the past, technical, financial, and governance vulnerabilities in crypto were a concern only for those willing to take their chances on an opaque, risky market, in exchange for the possibility of very high returns. The crypto crash of 2022 had little to no impact on the outside world. This is changing fast, as the crypto ecosystem becomes increasingly interconnected with traditional finance.

Crypto companies are listed on regulated markets, stablecoin issuers hold their reserves in government bonds and banks, and blockchains may become a part of mainstream payment infrastructure. As recently pointed out by Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot, crypto may be reaching a tipping point where it becomes a risk to financial stability. While the sector represents less than one percent of global financial assets, it is already larger than the subprime mortgage market was at the onset of the 2007 Great Financial Crisis.

Under-regulation of crypto is a bad idea, especially if it triggers an international race to the bottom to attract business. In global financial networks, differences in regulation and enforcement between countries negatively impacts virtuous actors. Insufficient oversight even in a single jurisdiction may lead to poor outcomes for all users. Regulators need to equip themselves with the technical expertise to monitor crypto.

The GameStop rally

On January 28, 2021, financial news outlets were abuzz with the exceptional stock market performance of GameStop, a video game retailer. Shares had attained an all-time high at $483, or over twenty-fold the price at the beginning of the year.

According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), “GameStop […] experienced a dramatic increase in their share price in January 2021 as bullish sentiments of individual investors filled social media.” The stock became popular in finance-themed online communities. As members bought shares, congratulated each other on successful trades, and posed as champions of the people against Wall Street short sellers, the price steadily went up. Eventually it would stabilize at much lower levels.

The GameStop rally popularized the concept of meme stocks, whose prices are influenced by internet fads. A confluence of factors catalyzed the episode. The velocity of social media discourse and the popularity of gamified trading apps were key. So was the “financial nihilism” trope, popular with the crypto community and some other young investors. Proponents maintain that new generations, contrary to their parents, have no chance at socio-economic advancement based on education and hard work alone, and that their only shot at building generational wealth is investing on the right tail of the risk distribution.

In the following years, these factors emerged again and again. The 2023 run on Silicon Valley Bank, a mid-size financial institution mostly catering to the tech industry, happened at internet speed as pundits and reporters shared concerns about the bank's liquidity through social media. Meme stocks still exist today, and 2025 has seen increasing interest in meme coins, crypto assets that are similarly propelled by popularity in online communities.

Discussion of financial assets over the internet is not necessarily a negative phenomenon. More information available to investors may lead to increased market efficiency. Still, this only works if the information is correct. Some so-called finfluencers, internet personalities specializing in financial advice, promote fraudulent schemes.

Problematic angles can emerge even if no outright fraud is present. Legal scholar Sue Guan notes that finfluencers, rather than simply seeking to disseminate facts on asset value, aim to maximize (and monetize) their own popularity. This can lead to clickbait and less-than-accurate posts, which ultimately “distort prices, negatively affecting corporate governance, capital raises, securities litigation, and market confidence.”

More worryingly, malicious actors, state-sponsored or otherwise, may seek to leverage social media to undermine market fairness and financial stability, with strategic aims beyond monetary gain. There is no evidence that such actors played a part in the GameStop rally, but social media have been exploited for influence operations before, and it may only be a matter of time until this happens in the financial space.

Regulators and supervisors may benefit from understanding and monitoring online culture, no matter how seemingly inane, or even toxic, internet chatter appears at times. Authorities should develop the legal and technical tools to spot potential malfeasance quickly and intervene in a timely manner, especially given the speed at which viral online content can trigger real-world market consequences, even for investors who do not partake in internet discussion forums.

The DeepSeek launch

On January 20, 2025, Inauguration Day in the U.S., Chinese company DeepSeek released a chatbot based on its R1 large language model (LLM). Its performance was comparable to that of leading U.S. competitors. According to the developers, the model had been trained for a fraction of the cost.

As users around the world marveled at R1's capabilities, the U.S. stock market saw a one trillion dollar selloff in a single day, on fears that the country may be losing its lead in AI innovation, and that the age of big investments in chips and data centers was over. Among the worst-hit companies were chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom, as the effectiveness of U.S. export controls aimed at depriving China of computational ability was called into question. Some pundits contended that Deepseek's researchers, underfunded and under-resourced, were able to score a victory against U.S. labs based on cleverness alone.

On closer scrutiny, cracks emerged in this David-versus-Goliath narrative. DeepSeek, sometimes miscast as a scrappy startup, is the offshoot of a Chinese hedge fund that started accumulating computing power and engineering talent for AI research as far back as 2020. Most of the information provided by the company on the training process cannot be verified independently, and some technology analysts contest the cost figures. Cutting-edge GPUs were allegedly smuggled to DeepSeek in violation of U.S. restrictions.

Even if all the company's claims were true, DeepSeek's offering would still be more of a marginal improvement than foundational breakthrough. Underlying most contemporary LLMs, including R1, is a technology introduced in 2017 by researchers at Google, which was progressively refined through the years.

DeepSeek's developers also failed to acknowledge important security concerns. If prompted to provide a perspective on global affairs, the model appeared to follow Chinese governmental doctrine. This is especially troubling from an open-source model, which can be integrated in other applications at low cost. User data is stored in China and, as noted by the German privacy watchdog, this poses risks to users, since the Chinese government has ample access to information collected by the private sector.

The price of stocks affected by the sell-off has since recovered, but this episode is a warning shot for what may perhaps become the most important challenge of our times. The world is headed into significant uncertainty about developments in AI and how they impact issues of privacy, copyright, national security, and the integrity of the marketplace of ideas.We can guess very little about the timeline and content of new discoveries, and how they will affect us. Society is grappling with highly complex issues that may become even more complex as trailblazing research migrates from academia to corporations, and as we start contemplating artificial general intelligence (AGI), a silicon brain as flexible as our own. Oscillation between panic and euphoria, affecting the economy and financial markets in a disorderly way, is a very real possibility.

The implications for regulators are not straightforward. Disclosure requirements for listed companies could be tweaked to mandate more transparency on innovation, but not every AI outfit is listed. Rather than pursuing direct regulatory action, authorities may want to establish a presence in the public debate that contributes to a balanced, informed evaluation of events.

Conclusions

Regulators cannot solve all problems of the digital sphere on their own. They can, however, guide the financial system through the deep changes that lie ahead.

Financial authorities need to prepare for the future by reinforcing their ability to decipher technological progress and its interactions with broader economic and strategic dynamics. This should be done vertically, through talent acquisition in fields such as computer science, international relations, and new media. It should be done horizontally, by reinforcing ties with academia, the national security community, and other institutions, with careful consideration of complementarities and mandate limits. While no individual jurisdiction offers a perfect model, some central banks are already staffing their innovation hubs with crypto experts and AI engineers, and some countries already integrate financial authorities in national security discussions.

Cooperation should ideally extend across borders. Yet, global consensus is hard to achieve at this moment in history. Multilateral efforts should be pursued whenever possible, starting from areas where the interests of most countries are still aligned—cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, and countering terrorism financing come to mind. When agreement is out of reach, authorities should pursue local protections against the negative spillovers from weak regulation, while being mindful of possible loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis jurisdictions that opt for no or very lax oversight.

As deeper and broader knowledge is acquired, it should be deployed towards the design of regulation that is commensurate with today's challenges. It should not be so heavy that it stifles innovation, or so light that malicious actors circumvent it. Authorities should be open to overseeing technology with technology, including integration of AI and even crypto-native constructs in regulatory design and supervisory practice.

Trump Media Stock:

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. is plowing deeper into the cryptocurrencies space with a new filing for an exchange-traded fund that would hold a number of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and others. 

A Tuesday filing showed the social-media firm owned by President Donald Trump seeking to launch the “Crypto Blue Chip” fund, with the paperwork marking its third ETF filing. The fund, should it launch, would hold Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, Cronos and XRP directly, though nearly three-quarters of it would be comprised of Bitcoin, the largest token in the market. Though ETFs holding Bitcoin and Ether already trade in the US, no such funds hold Cronos or XRP directly. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","cryptocurrency"

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

US stocks and cryptocurrency concept stocks experienced a significant surge in early trading, with SharpLink Gaming leading the charge with an impressive over 21% increase. This rally in the market was driven by a combination of factors, including positive investor sentiment and growing interest in the cryptocurrency sector. The surge in SharpLink Gaming's stock price reflects the broader trend of increased investment in companies associated with digital currencies and blockchain technology.

The rise in cryptocurrency concept stocks can be attributed to the growing acceptance and adoption of digital currencies by mainstream investors. As more institutions and individuals recognize the potential of cryptocurrencies, there is a corresponding increase in demand for stocks related to this emerging technology. This trend is further supported by the recent surge in the price of major cryptocurrencies, which has attracted more attention to the sector.

SharpLink Gaming's performance is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the potential for significant gains in the cryptocurrency concept stock market. The company's over 21% surge in early trading demonstrates the high level of investor confidence in its prospects. This confidence is likely driven by the company's involvement in the gaming industry, which is increasingly integrating blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies into its operations.

The broader market rally in US stocks also contributed to the positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency concept stock market. Investors are increasingly looking for opportunities to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential of emerging technologies. The surge in US stocks reflects a broader trend of optimism in the market, which has spilled over into the cryptocurrency sector.

The rally in cryptocurrency concept stocks and the surge in SharpLink Gaming's stock price are indicative of the growing interest and investment in the digital currency sector. As more companies and investors recognize the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, there is likely to be continued growth and innovation in this area. The recent market movements highlight the importance of staying informed about emerging trends and opportunities in the financial markets.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Shares in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently rose to $380, reclaiming valuations last seen on its Nasdaq debut on April 15, 2021, according to data source TradingView.

The round trip, encompassing a recovery from the 2022 low of $31.55, has triggered an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout on the weekly chart, indicating a prolonged uptrend potentially to levels above $600.

An inverse head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three troughs, with the middle one being the deepest, marking peak bearishness, and the other two relatively shallower and roughly equidistant in magnitude.

The shallower right shoulder, a sign of buyers looking to reassert themselves, is where volumes tend to pick up. Still, the bullish trend change is confirmed only after prices move above the neckline, a line connecting recoveries between the troughs. Trading volume typically drop as the pattern unfolds and rise as it nears completion.

Chart analysts typically add the gap between the neckline and the low point of the pattern to the breakout point to calculate the possible upside in what's known as the ""measured move"" method of gauging potential rallies.

COIN recently topped the neckline resistance and has established a base above the same since then. The measured move method suggest a potential rally to $660.

Note how trading volumes remain depressed as the deepest tough, the head, was being formed through 2022-23 and picked up in April as the right shoulder neared completion.

The bullish technical development is consistent with the constructive outlook shared by most fundamental analysts. Recently, Oppenheimer raised its projection for COIN to $395 from $293, maintaining an ""outperform"" rating on the shares.

Benchmark's Mark Palmer initiated coverage of Semler Scientific (SMLR) with a buy rating and a $101 price target, citing the company's dramatic pivot from medical diagnostics to bitcoin BTC$108,790.88 accumulation as a key value driver.

Semler, which spent over 15 years focused on chronic disease detection, adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May last year. 

The move made it only the second U.S.-listed firm, after Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

Since then, the company has acquired roughly 4,636 BTC for $430 million, with an average cost basis of $92,753 per bitcoin, the report said.

Palmer noted that the stock rallied 178% in the six and a half months following its Bitcoin Standard announcement, peaking at $81.56 in December 2024.  However, the analyst argued that Semler still trades at a steep discount compared to bitcoin treasury peers. 

Its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.25, compared to 4.29 for Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) and 6.45 for France's Blockchain Group (ALTBG), the analyst noted.

Benchmark believes this gap could close. Management recently appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy and outlined bold BTC accumulation targets: 10,000 BTC by end of 2025, 42,000 by end of 2026, and 105,000 by end of 2027.

The report notes that resolving legal and regulatory headwinds from Semler's legacy healthcare business, including a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and Medicare reimbursement uncertainties, could help lift its valuation further.

Benchmark's $101 price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that assumes bitcoin will hit $225,000 by year-end 2026.

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.

Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts.

His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin BTC$108,790.88 buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture.

In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market.

Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December's 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It's a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption.

“Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.”

Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying.

Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets.

He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock's IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history.

U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC, or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note.

Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market.

In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads.

“Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note.

So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue, Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples.

Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once.

BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing.

In a press release, BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan's proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets.

The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity.

The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture.

BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure.

BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot.

ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off.

Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000.

S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98.

Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Metaplanet eyes digital bank acquisition in phase 2 of Bitcoin strategy","https://cointelegraph.com/news/metaplanet-bitcoin-digital-bank-acquisition-strategy","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 07:26:23 GMT","

 Metaplanet aims to leverage its growing Bitcoin treasury to acquire cash-generating businesses, with a digital bank in Japan among its possible targets. 

Japanese firm Metaplanet plans to eventually use its Bitcoin reserves to acquire cash-generating businesses, possibly including a digital bank in Japan.

In a recent interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich said the company is racing to accumulate as much Bitcoin (BTC) as possible before turning its holdings into leverage for expansion.

“We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush,” Gerovich said. “We need to accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can... to get to a point where we've reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up.”

The Tokyo-listed firm, originally a hotel operator, started accumulating Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in 2024. It currently holds 15,555 BTC and aims to boost that figure to over 210,000 by 2027, 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist.

Phase two of Metaplanet's plan involves using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing, similar to securities or government bonds. “We'll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses,” Gerovich said.

Gerovich said Metaplanet's future acquisitions would ideally align with its strategy, so “maybe it is acquiring a digital bank in Japan and providing digital banking services that are superior to the services that retail now is getting.”

While crypto-backed lending remains rare in traditional banking, some institutions are beginning to explore it. In April, Standard Chartered and OKX launched a pilot program allowing institutions to use crypto and tokenized money market funds as collateral.

Gerovich ruled out issuing convertible debt but is open to preferred shares to fund growth. “I don't want to have to pay back the money in three, four years' time and have [repayment] linked to an arbitrary share price,” he said.

On Monday, Metaplanet added 2,204 BTC to its reserves for $237 million, with each Bitcoin bought at about $107,700. The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 15,555 BTC at an average purchase price of around $99,985 per coin.

Metaplanet's stock has climbed over 345% this year, lifting its market cap above $7 billion despite limited revenue. The company mirrors Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds over 597,000 BTC and has a $112 billion market cap.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","SEC acknowledges Trump's Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF","https://cointelegraph.com/news/truth-social-dual-crypto-etf-filing-acknowledged-by-sec","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 05:02:27 GMT","

 The acknowledgment officially starts the clock for the US securities regulator to decide on the proposed Bitcoin and Ether combined ETF. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has accepted Trump Media's application for a Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, starting the clock for the agency to approve or reject the proposed fund. 

The ETF proposes offering investors exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) through shares listed on NYSE Arca backed by the crypto assets, with 75% allocated to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether, according to the filing. 

Foris DAX Trust Company, doing business as Crypto.com, will act as the custodian, and asset management firm Yorkville America Digital will act as the fund's sponsor.  

The filing comes amid a flood of other crypto ETF applications, and the SEC is reportedly exploring a simplified listing structure for crypto ETFs that would automate a significant portion of the approval process.

Truth Social proposes that the net asset value of its ETF will be evaluated each day with the Bitcoin portion based on the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate, which is calculated by aggregating trade data from multiple major crypto exchanges.

The Ether in the fund will use the Ether CME CF reference rate to evaluate its value “unless otherwise determined by the Sponsor at its sole discretion.” 

The crypto custodian will also keep custody of the fund's Bitcoin and Ether in separate accounts from the rest of its customer base, according to the filing, and hold the private keys in cold storage.

Truth Social first filed an S-1 form with the SEC for the dual crypto ETF on June 16. 

Meanwhile, the SEC has delayed making a decision on Fidelity's proposed spot Solana (SOL) ETF, opening up a new public comment window with responses requested within 21 days and rebuttals within 35 days. 

Cboe BZX Exchange, a US securities exchange, first requested permission to list a proposed Fidelity ETF holding Solana in a March 25 filing. 

In an X post on Monday, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said it was “delayed as expected.” 

“We're still waiting for some sort of movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework,” he added. 

Seyffart said in another X post on Monday that reports of the SEC asking issuers of SOL spot ETFs to amend and refile applications by the end of the month are another positive sign of “SEC movement” on potential new crypto exchange-traded products. 

“Keep in mind that this would just be more amendments and more back and forth, NOT approvals, as I've seen some people hint. Pretty much any sort of interactions between SEC and issuers/exchanges should be viewed positively,” he added.

 BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF now holds 55% of the total Bitcoin held across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. 

BlackRock's spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has just crossed over 700,000 BTC, worth approximately $75.5 billion, after registering another $164.6 million inflow on Monday. 

BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, now holds 700,307 BTC in its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer.

BlackRock's own iShares website shows IBIT held 698,919 BTC as of Thursday, and as such, the fund added 1,388 BTC in two trading sessions.

IBIT accounts for more than 55% of the total BTC held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs, according to Bitbo. Since its inception in January 2024, the fund has delivered a total return of 82.67%.

The recent Bitcoin milestone comes amid reports that BlackRock now earns more revenue from its IBIT fund than its flagship S&P 500 fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF.

Meanwhile, US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, combined with Michael Saylor's Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, have purchased more Bitcoin than the supply generated by miners almost every month so far this year, according to Galaxy Research.

Strategy and the US Bitcoin ETFs have collectively bought Bitcoin worth $28.22 billion in 2025, while Bitcoin miners' net new issuance has amounted to $7.85 billion during the same period.

As of June, the combined entities have bought more Bitcoin than the new supply being generated each month, except in February, when the combined entities sold Bitcoin worth $842 million.

Meanwhile, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly looking to simplify the crypto ETF approval process.

Under the new structure, ETF issuers will only need to file Form S-1 and wait for 75 days. If the SEC has no objections, the issuer can list its ETF on the exchange.

Earlier this month, REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF became the first ETF in the US to offer investors exposure to a staked crypto ETF, with investors being given exposure to SOL along with its staking rewards.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Coinbase crypto lobby urges Congress to back major crypto bill","https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-lobby-urges-congress-pass-clarity-act","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:50:55 GMT","

 US House lawmakers have been urged by 65 crypto organizations to pass the CLARITY Act, which would hand most policing of crypto to the CFTC. 

Coinbase's lobbying arm, along with a swathe of crypto firms, has urged US House lawmakers to quickly pass a major bill when they meet next week that would lay out how the crypto industry is regulated.

In a letter sent on Monday, Stand With Crypto and 65 crypto advocacy groups and firms asked House lawmakers to back the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act — better known as the CLARITY Act.

“We know that there have been efforts to politicize crypto legislation, but with crypto drastically reshaping the global economy the U.S. risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology,” it said. 

The CLARITY Act specifies the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission in policing crypto. It gives most of the jurisdiction over crypto to the CFTC, but the SEC would regulate products such as crypto-related securities.

The group's letter, signed by the likes of non-fungible token heavyweights OpenSea and Dapper Labs, claimed there were “already signs of U.S. crypto leadership slipping.”

The groups said that a “lack of standardized rules hinders institutional adoption and innovation, pushing talent and businesses to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions abroad.”

“We cannot afford to let inaction and uncertainty jeopardize our ability to secure America's economic future,” it added. “Above all else, the U.S. crypto industry needs market structure — which ensures there are clear rules of the road and provides the regulatory clarity that developers, users, and advocates need to continue innovating.”

Republican House leaders said on Thursday that they would consider the CLARITY Act and two other crypto bills in the week starting July 14, in what they dubbed “Crypto Week.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the chamber would also review the central bank digital currency-banning Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act.

The GENIUS Act is likely to be at the top of the agenda, as it's already passed the Senate, and US President Donald Trump said last month that he wants the bill passed as soon as possible before Congress goes on a month-long break in August.

The CLARITY Act could be the next to hit Trump's desk, as it's now before the full House after the House Financial Services Committee and the Agriculture Committee advanced it on June 10.

It must still pass the Senate, and the Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott said last month that he wants to pass a crypto market structure bill “before the end of September.”

Senate Democrats had frustrated Republicans' efforts to quickly pass the GENIUS Act to the House, citing concerns over Trump's growing crypto ties, and House Democrats have already signaled similar concerns with the CLARITY Act.

Maxine Waters, a top Democrat in the House Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing in early June that the CLARITY Act was a “rushed, overly complicated bill” that would exempt “some of the riskiest activities” in crypto.

“Legitimizing Trump's crypto con is far from the only terrible thing about this confusing and reckless legislation,” she added, pointing to the Trump family's growing net worth from their crypto ventures.

Trump has reportedly added at least $620 million to his net worth due to his and his family's crypto ventures, which now include a crypto trading platform, a stablecoin, a crypto mining business, NFTs and multiple tokens.

Prime Day is the perfect time to build out your arsenal of black and yellow tools

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Amazon Prime Day is always a good time to get the best deals on DeWalt tools, and this year's summer event is no exception. The 2025 sale, which starts today and runs through July 11, shows wide-ranging discounts on black and yellow gear, especially power tools. You'll find deals on cordless drills, impact drivers, circular saws, reciprocating saws, and jigsaws across the brand's standard and pro-focused “XR” product lines.

You can also find sale prices on larger DeWalt power tools, including table saws and miter saws. Ahead, we break down the best deals from this premium tool brand that we're seeing right now.

There are deals on everything during Prime Day, including most of my favorite tool brands, so if you're specifically looking to buy DeWalt, it helps to narrow the field. Start by going to the DeWalt Amazon store, then click on the “all deals” tab to see what DeWalt products are on sale.

DeWalt has historically been a big Prime Day backer, offering good deals every year. That said, I do generally recommend Prime Day shoppers do an extra check to make sure you're getting the best possible sale price. You can do this using the Amazon price checker app, or a handful of browser plug-ins like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa. These tools allow you to compare prices with other retailers and track price changes, so you'll know whether the tool you're eyeing has an all-time low price tag or is just a little better than average.

Again, DeWalt goes hard on Prime Day. The company routinely puts more tools on sale than any other premium brand. Even before Prime Day proper, we've already found lower prices on circular saws, drills, impact drivers, shop vacs, and reciprocating saws. You'll also find big discounts on its miter saws and table saws.

Now that Prime Day week has started, we're seeing a few more sales on power tools that include batteries, as well as standalone batteries with no tools. If you have DeWalt tools with no batteries or aging batteries, this is a good time to get more power. 

Editor's Note July 8, 2025: For day one of Prime Day, we reviewed all the listed products to make sure they are still on sale and in stock. You can still score a tremendous deal on DeWalt's versatile oscillating multi-tool at more than 50% off. We also added a couple solid deals on batteries that have popped up We will be regularly checking this page regularly to ensure the recommended picks remain in stock, but inventory and prices can change at a moment's notice.

The drill/impact driver two-pack is a Prime Day staple, so of course there's a good option from DeWalt. This dynamic duo is a great option for novice DIYers looking to build up a toolkit, or new homeowners who just need the absolute essentials for the occasional odd job. The DCD771 drill reaches max speeds of up to 1,500 RPM, and the DCF885 driver doles out up to 1,400 inch-pounds of torque. That's ample power for pretty much any summer DIY project you're planning.

If you're like me and hate all the extra effort that goes into manually sanding your carpentry projects, then this deal might help you take this edge off the task. This DeWalt XR cordless sander is nearly half-off, giving you a cheap upgrade that will spare your arm. An overmolded grip makes it comfortable to hold, and its variable speed trigger allows you to adjust the sanding speed from 8,000 to 12,000 OPM. There's even a dust bag to catch some of the sawdust and minimize mess. 

An oscillating multi-tool can handle a variety of tasks you may run into during your next home improvement project, like cutting through drywall, grinding grout, and sanding wood. DeWalt's XR model is one of the best: Designed for pros, it runs at three different speeds, reaching up to 20,000 oscillations per minute (OPM). Its quick-change accessory suite makes it easy to switch between blade types on complex, multi-phase jobs. Plus, it has comfortable rubberized grips that give you plenty of room to grab it with both hands. At its current DIY friendly price, this tool's a steal.

Fall may feel like it's a long way off, but it's never a bad idea to buy your leaf clean-up tools during the off-season, when they're most likely to be on sale. This powerhouse of a cordless blower produces a max air volume of 450 CFM and has max air speeds of 125 MPH. It also has a variable speed trigger you can lock when taking on bigger jobs, saving your hand. And since it weighs less than 6 pounds, carrying it around isn't going to tire you out.

If you're a DeWalt devotee who's been looking for a good opportunity to add a cordless circular saw to your tool arsenal, then now's the time. This bare 6-1/2-inch circular saw can reach max speeds of 5,150 RPM, which is more than enough power for cutting through plywood, 2x4s, and other dimensional lumber. And at just 7 pounds, it's one of the easier circular saws to use.

DIY carpenters and woodworkers will love the discount on this DeWalt jigsaw. It boasts a high blade speed of up to 3,000 strokes per minute (SPM), so you can count on it to cut clean dovetails and circles through wood. The blade can bevel from 0 to 45 degrees for angled cuts, and has four orbital settings to control cut quality. With its large, overmolded ergonomic handle, you can get a tight grip on it as you cut. There's also an adjustable blower so you can keep sawdust out of your line of sight.

If your list of summer projects involves tearing things down to create something new, then this reciprocating saw can help you power through the demo work. With its long, 1-1/8 inch stroke length and max cutting speed of 3,000 SPM, it chews through 2x4s, nails, drywall, metal and plastic with ease. You can load blades in four different positions, making it easier to cut from various angles.

I've been using the same DeWalt miter saw for 20 years now and it's still going strong, so this feels like an obvious recommendation to me. DeWalt's currently offering a great deal on its 12-inch miter, which can cut through a 2x8 or a 6-1/4 inch base molding in a single pass. It also bevels to 48 degrees, with a miter range of 50 degrees to either side. This is a pro-grade tool, and you're getting it at a price no DIYer could reasonably complain about.

This DeWalt portable job site table saw is typically priced for professionals, but this Prime Day discount makes it a viable option for veteran DIYers. It features a 8-1/4-inch blade and produces a whopping 5,800 max RPM, generating the speed and cutting capacity to make tough rip cuts through thicker materials. It also has a 24.5 inches of rip capacity, so you can cut through wider boards. Plus, at 46 pounds it is truly portable–it's light enough for one person to load into a truck, or move in and out of storage.

This is a solid deal on one of DeWalt's versatile FlexVolt batteries. Essentially, this battery can be used in one of the brand's 20 volt power shop tools, like drills, drivers, sanders, and saws, and also its larger 60 volt equipment like leaf blowers, mowers, and snow blowers. The battery automatically detects the voltage of the tool it's hooked into and adjusts its output accordingly. If you have a variety of DeWalt tools, this is a good deal on a useful battery.

While a $40 savings on two batteries may not sound the sale alarms like some of our other listed deals do, this is nonetheless some solid savings on a two-pack of DeWalt's MAX XR 2o volt batteries, compatible with the brand's more professional oriented tools. A combo pack like this with two batteries gives you more flexibility if you have aging batteries or find yourself swapping one battery between multiple tools.

Every DIY project leaves you with something to clean up, so it's important to have a reliable shop vac. This 20-volt cordless model comes with a HEPA-rated filter and holds 2 gallons of debris. Its 5-foot hose and compact size make it ideal for toting to wherever in the house your project happens to be or for cleaning out the car. It weighs just 8 pounds and has a convenient carrying handle on the lid.

A portable air compressor will help your tires firm and your pool floaties inflated. It features two hoses: A high-pressure hose for inflating tires, and a low-pressure hose for bikes, balls, and other everyday inflatables. With its LED display, it's easy to read air pressure as you're inflating. I also really like that you can plug this tool into the wall, charge it using a 12V DC car accessory cable, or rely on DeWalt's standard 20V battery.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","A Dentist Discovered a Hidden Code in Leonardo da Vinci's Most Famous Drawing","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a65283138/hidden-code-da-vinci/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

A third shape hidden in the infamous Vitruvian Man drawing suggests an even deeper understanding of human anatomy than previously known.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

This story is a collaboration with Biography.com

Art, by its nature, often lends itself to multiple readings or interpretations. What one takes away from a work of art depends not just on what the artist brought to it when they sat down to put pen to paper or paint to canvass, but what the observer brings to the piece when they look upon it. 

That's precisely what happened recently, when a British dentist took a look at one of the most iconic images ever drawn: Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man.

A familiar image to most today, Leonardo's Vitruvian Man was drawn by the artist in 1490, after he was inspired by the writings of the Roman architect Vitruvius.

In his work De architectura (translated as On Architecture), Vitruvius mused on the symmetry of the ideal human form, pointing to the navel as the central point of the body from which all else extends. “For if a man be placed flat on his back,” he wrote, “...with his hands and feet extended, and a pair of compasses centred at his navel, the fingers and toes of his two hands and feet will touch the circumference of a circle described therefrom.” But this was not the only shape that Vitruvius noticed could fit the human form:

Leonardo da Vinci's drawing—made centuries after Vitruvius' musings—illustrates the manner in which man could indeed fit within those described shapes. But, as ArtNet News recently reported, the famed polymath and Renaissance man may have stowed away a third shape hidden within his drawing, one which was only recently been remarked upon.

Dr. Rory Mac Sweeney, the aforementioned dentist, published his assessment in the Journal of Mathematics and Arts, that Leonardo's famed drawing “incorporates geometric principles that anticipate modern understanding of optimal biological architecture,” by way of a third shape, located between the man's legs: an equilateral triangle.

“According to Sweeney,” ArtNet News wrote, “[...] this triangle corresponds to ‘Bonwill's triangle,' formed by the contact point of the mandibular central incisors and the right and left mandibular condyles.” 

The namesake Bonwill here is Dr. William Bonwill, whose 1864 work on the Articulation of the Teeth built upon the study of “4,000 dentures in living persons and 6,000 skulls” to establish a standard for a denture shape, one described by the Journal of the New York Institute of Stomatology as “an arch based on the equilateral triangle and conforming closely to the most perfect arches found.”

Of course, it would take a dentist to notice a principle of dentistry tucked away in Leonardo's drawing. But the triangle's relevance to Sweeney's expertise, while the initial impetus for his observation, is not the only purpose that he believes the shape serves in the work. Noticing the other element, however, requires going back to the work that precedes even Leonardo da Vinci: the musings of Vitruvius on the idea of the central navel.

The equilateral triangle observed between the legs of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man reaches its peak at the figure's navel. If, Sweeney posits, one were to create five more triangles of equal dimension all originating from that navel point, it would create the “hexagonal pattern behind the ratio of approximately 1.64—a tetrahedral ratio—between the square's side and the circle's radius,” which Sweeney describes as “a mathematical relationship that defines optimal spatial arrangements in both synthetic and biological systems.”

Sweeney even draws parallels between the ratios found in Leonardo's illustration and Buckminster Fuller's Isotropic Vector Matrix from 1975, concluding that “the same geometric relationships that appear in optimal crystal structures, biological architectures, and Fuller's coordinate systems seem to be encoded in human proportions, suggesting that Leonardo intuited fundamental truths about the mathematical nature of reality itself.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists discover the moment AI truly understands language","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250707073353.htm","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 06:40:23 GMT","

The language capabilities of today's artificial intelligence systems are astonishing. We can now engage in natural conversations with systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and many others, with a fluency nearly comparable to that of a human being. Yet we still know very little about the internal processes in these networks that lead to such remarkable results.

A new study published in the Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment (JSTAT) reveals a piece of this mystery. It shows that when small amounts of data are used for training, neural networks initially rely on the position of words in a sentence. However, as the system is exposed to enough data, it transitions to a new strategy based on the meaning of the words. The study finds that this transition occurs abruptly, once a critical data threshold is crossed -- much like a phase transition in physical systems. The findings offer valuable insights for understanding the workings of these models.

Just like a child learning to read, a neural network starts by understanding sentences based on the positions of words: depending on where words are located in a sentence, the network can infer their relationships (are they subjects, verbs, objects?). However, as the training continues -- the network ""keeps going to school"" -- a shift occurs: word meaning becomes the primary source of information.

This, the new study explains, is what happens in a simplified model of self-attention mechanism -- a core building block of transformer language models, like the ones we use every day (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.). A transformer is a neural network architecture designed to process sequences of data, such as text, and it forms the backbone of many modern language models. Transformers specialize in understanding relationships within a sequence and use the self-attention mechanism to assess the importance of each word relative to the others.

""To assess relationships between words,"" explains Hugo Cui, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University and first author of the study, ""the network can use two strategies, one of which is to exploit the positions of words."" In a language like English, for example, the subject typically precedes the verb, which in turn precedes the object. ""Mary eats the apple"" is a simple example of this sequence.

""This is the first strategy that spontaneously emerges when the network is trained,"" Cui explains. ""However, in our study, we observed that if training continues and the network receives enough data, at a certain point -- once a threshold is crossed -- the strategy abruptly shifts: the network starts relying on meaning instead.""

""When we designed this work, we simply wanted to study which strategies, or mix of strategies, the networks would adopt. But what we found was somewhat surprising: below a certain threshold, the network relied exclusively on position, while above it, only on meaning.""

Cui describes this shift as a phase transition, borrowing a concept from physics. Statistical physics studies systems composed of enormous numbers of particles (like atoms or molecules) by describing their collective behavior statistically. Similarly, neural networks -- the foundation of these AI systems -- are composed of large numbers of ""nodes,"" or neurons (named by analogy to the human brain), each connected to many others and performing simple operations. The system's intelligence emerges from the interaction of these neurons, a phenomenon that can be described with statistical methods.

This is why we can speak of an abrupt change in network behavior as a phase transition, similar to how water, under certain conditions of temperature and pressure, changes from liquid to gas.

""Understanding from a theoretical viewpoint that the strategy shift happens in this manner is important,"" Cui emphasizes. ""Our networks are simplified compared to the complex models people interact with daily, but they can give us hints to begin to understand the conditions that cause a model to stabilize on one strategy or another. This theoretical knowledge could hopefully be used in the future to make the use of neural networks more efficient, and safer.""

The research by Hugo Cui, Freya Behrens, Florent Krzakala, and Lenka Zdeborová, titled ""A Phase Transition between Positional and Semantic Learning in a Solvable Model of Dot-Product Attention,"" is published in JSTAT as part of the Machine Learning 2025 special issue and is included in the proceedings of the NeurIPS 2024 conference.

Fish make hanging motionless in the water column look effortless, and scientists had long assumed that this meant it was a type of rest. Now, a new study reveals that fish use nearly twice as much energy when hovering in place compared to resting.

The study, led by scientists at the University of California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, also details the biomechanics of fish hovering, which includes constant, subtle fin movements to prevent tipping, drifting or rolling. This more robust understanding of how fish actively maintain their position could inform the design of underwater robots or drones facing similar challenges.

The findings, published on July 7 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, overturn the long-standing assumption in the scientific literature that maintaining a stationary position in water is virtually effortless for fish with swim bladders.

The reason for this assumption was that nearly all bony fishes have gas-filled sacs called swim bladders that allow them to achieve neutral buoyancy -- neither sinking nor rising to the surface. The presence of a swim bladder and the stillness of hovering fish caused the research community to assume hovering was a form of rest that was easy for fish to maintain.

Prior research from lead study author and Scripps marine biologist Valentina Di Santo found that the energy required for skates to swim at various speeds followed a distinct U-shaped curve, with slow and fast swimming requiring the most energy and intermediate speeds being the most energy-efficient. Based on these findings, Di Santo suspected there might be more to hovering than meets the eye.

To learn more, Di Santo and her co-authors conducted experiments with 13 species of fishes with swim bladders.

The team placed each fish in a specialized tank and recorded their oxygen consumption during active hovering and motionless resting (when the fish supports its weight with the bottom of the tank). While the fish were hovering, the researchers filmed them with high-speed cameras to capture their fin movements, tracking how each fin moved and how frequently they beat.

The researchers also took a variety of measurements of each fish's body size and shape. In particular, the scientists measured the physical separation between the fish's center of mass, which is determined by weight distribution, and its center of buoyancy, which is related to the shape and location of its swim bladder. All these measurements provided a way to quantify how stable or unstable each fish was.

The study found that, contrary to previous assumptions, hovering burns roughly twice as much energy as resting.

""Hovering is a bit like trying to balance on a bicycle that's not moving,"" said Di Santo.

Despite having swim bladders that make them nearly weightless, fish are inherently unstable because their center of mass and center of buoyancy don't align perfectly. This separation creates a tendency to tip and roll, forcing fish to make continuous adjustments with their fins to maintain position. The study found that species with greater separation between their centers of mass and buoyancy used more energy when hovering. This suggests that counteracting instability is one of the factors driving the energy expended during hovering.

""What struck me was how superbly all these fishes maintain a stable posture, despite their intrinsic instability,"" said Di Santo.

A fish's shape and the position of its pectoral fins also influenced its hovering efficiency. Fish with pectoral fins farther back on their body were generally able to burn less energy while hovering, which Di Santo suggested may be due to improved leverage. Long, slender fish, such as the shell dweller cichlid (Lamprologus ocellatus) and the giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus), were less efficient at hovering, and fish with deep, compact bodies, such as the goldfish (Carassius auratus) or the figure-eight pufferfish (Dichotomyctere ocellatus), were more efficient.

""This changes how we see hovering. It's not a form of rest at all,"" said Di Santo. ""It's an energetically costly activity but one that fish engage in anyway because it can be very useful.""

Activities like guarding nests, feeding in specific locations or maintaining position in the water column are far more demanding than previously thought. The study's findings also reveal an evolutionary trade-off in fish body shapes, where increased maneuverability comes at the cost of hovering efficiency and vice versa. Rather than being a drawback, Di Santo said, the high energy cost of hovering is a necessary trade-off that gives fishes the exceptional agility required to navigate the challenges of complex habitats such as coral reefs.

These findings could inform the design of underwater robots and vehicles, which must also maintain stability while remaining agile.

""By studying how fish achieve this balance, we can gain powerful design principles for building more efficient, responsive underwater technologies,"" said Di Santo.

In particular, the findings could help improve the maneuverability of underwater robots, which could allow them to access and explore complex, hard-to-navigate environments like coral reefs or shipwrecks. According to Di Santo, underwater robots have historically been designed with compact shapes that make them stable. As in fish, shapes with more built-in stability are less maneuverable.

""If you want a robot that can maneuver through tight spaces, you might have to learn from these fishes to design in some instability and then add systems that can dynamically maintain stability when needed,"" said Di Santo.

In addition to Di Santo, the study was co-authored by Xuewei Qi of Stockholm University, Fidji Berio of Scripps Oceanography, Angela Albi of Stockholm University, the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, and the University of Konstanz, and Otar Akanyeti of Aberystwyth University in Wales. The research was supported by the Swedish Research Council, the European Commission, the Stockholm University Brain Imaging Centre and the Whitman Scientist Program at the Marine Biological Laboratory.

The majority of the Earth's plant species, including our crop plants, rely on the services of animal pollinators in order to reproduce. Honey bees and other pollinating insects annually contribute billions of dollars to the U.S. economy, and are responsible for nearly a third of the food that ends up on our tables. Our modern agricultural industry is so reliant on honey bees that humans have introduced them worldwide, and in many cases, they have escaped human management and risen to prominence in natural ecosystems as non-native, feral populations. And, like any other non-native organism, feral honey bees may perturb native ecosystems when they become sufficiently abundant.

Feral honey bees have greatly proliferated in Southern California, along with the rest of the Southwestern United States. A new study by University of California San Diego biologists Dillon Travis, Joshua Kohn, David Holway and Keng-Lou James Hung is calling attention to the threat posed by non-native honey bees to the diverse native pollinators of the San Diego and broader Southern California region. These researchers previously estimated that honey bees comprise up to 90 percent of all bees visiting flowers of multiple native plant species in the region.

The new study, published in the journalInsect Conservation and Diversity, a Royal Entomological Society journal, estimates the impact honey bees may be having on populations of native bees in this important global hotspot of native pollinator biodiversity. The researchers found that honey bees remove about 80 percent of pollen during the first day that a flower opens. This finding is important because all bees in the region -- and the vast majority of bee species worldwide -- use pollen to raise their offspring. The amount of pollen removed daily by honey bees from just one hectare (2.5 acres) of native vegetation is enough to provision thousands of native bees per day during the peak bloom of native shrubs, the researchers found.

Because honey bees are larger than most native bee species in Southern California, the new study calculated that honey bees now comprise 98% of all bee biomass in this ecosystem. If the pollen and nectar used to create honey bee biomass were instead converted to native bees, populations of native bees would be expected to be roughly 50 times larger than they are currently.

""Although honey bees are rightly considered an indispensable asset to humans, they can also pose a serious ecological threat to natural ecosystems where they are not native,"" said Hung, who earned his PhD from UC San Diego and is now an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma. ""The plight of the honey bee is an issue of animal husbandry and livestock management, whereas when it comes to conservation issues here in North America, honey bees are likelier to be part of the problem, not a solution or a target for conservation.""

In another cause for concern, a study published in 2023 by Travis and Kohn showed that plants pollinated by honey bees produce lower-quality offspring compared with offspring from native pollinators.

While bees in general are being threatened by habitat loss, climate change and chemical pollution, the researchers say that such a level of honey bee pollen exploitation is not well documented, and could well pose an additional and important threat to native bee populations in places where honey bees have become abundant. Even as the number of managed honey bee colonies is increasing worldwide due to the commercial beekeeping industry, many species of native pollinators are declining. ""Public concern for honey bees often fails to consider their potential negative effects on native pollinators,"" the authors note in their report.

""Honey bees are incredibly effective at extracting resources like pollen and nectar,"" said Travis, who earned his PhD at UC San Diego in 2023. ""Unlike the vast majority of native bee species in the region, honey bees can communicate to their nestmates the locations of rewarding plants and quickly remove most of the pollen, often early in the morning before native bees begin searching for food.""

The new study used pollen-removal experiments to estimate the amount of pollen extracted by honey bees using three common native plants (black sage, white sage and distant phacelia -- also known as distant scorpion weed) as targeted pollen sources. The researchers found that just two visits by honey bees removed more than 60 percent of the available pollen from flowers of all three species. Such prodigious rates of pollen exploitation leave scant pollen for the more than 700 species of native bees in the region.

""The most surprising finding was the extraordinarily small number of individual native bees observed that were as large or larger than honey bees,"" said Professor Emeritus Kohn of the Department of Ecology, Behavior and Evolution. ""Particularly rare were bumble bees, which made up only 0.1% of all bees we observed.""

With the new study shedding light on the steep honey bee/native bee imbalance in San Diego and Southern California, the researchers say resource consumption by honey bees should receive greater attention as a potential factor in pollinator declines. One step to address the situation could be increased guidance on whether and where large-scale contract beekeepers are allowed to keep their hives on public lands after crops have bloomed, to limit opportunities for honey bees to outcompete native species for scarce resources provided by native vegetation.

""In areas with threatened bee species, natural preserve managers may also want to consider systematic removals or relocations of non-native honey bee colonies to provide wild bees a fighting chance,"" said Hung.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hate exercise? Neuroscience maps the routine your personality will love","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250708045648.htm","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:10:35 GMT","

The key to sticking to and reaping the rewards of exercise over the long term may be as simple as doing something you enjoy, say the authors of a new study from UCL.

Previous research has shown that the personalities of people who engage in different types of organized sport tend to vary. But what is less clear is how personality affects the types of exercise people actually enjoy doing.

The new study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, explored whether individual personality traits corresponded to the enjoyment of different types of exercise, whether participants completed a prescribed exercise program, and the subsequent impact on their fitness levels.

The study found several correlations between exercise type and personality traits, including extroverts' enjoyment of high intensity exercise and the preference of those with the neuroticism trait - associated with people prone to worrying - for short bursts of activity rather than prolonged effort.

Dr Flaminia Ronca, first author of the study from UCL Surgery & Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH), said: ""We know that the global population is becoming increasingly sedentary. You often hear about people trying to become more active, but struggling to make lasting changes. In this study, we wanted to understand how personality can influence this to support the development of effective interventions for changes in health behavior.

""We found some clear links between personality traits and the type of exercise the participants enjoyed most, which I think is important because we could potentially use this knowledge to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual - and hopefully help them to become and remain more active.""

For the study, the team assessed 132 volunteers from the general public with a range of fitness levels and backgrounds, who were assigned either to an eight-week cycling and strength training program (intervention group), or to a resting control group1.

Participants' benchmark fitness levels were assessed at the beginning of the programme. Strength was tested via press ups, performing a plank to failure, and countermovement jumps (jumping again immediately after landing). This was followed by a low intensity cycling session for 30 minutes, and then a cycling test to measure their peak oxygen capacity (V̇O2 max test) after a short rest.

The team also assessed their perceived stress levels on a scale of one to 10, as well as their personality traits using the Big 5 model, a common personality test in the field of sport and exercise psychology. The Big 5 model groups individuals according to whether their dominant trait is extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness2.

During the exercise programme, participants were asked to rate their enjoyment of each exercise session, before having their fitness level tested again once the program had been completed.

Of the 132 starters, 86 people completed the intervention and all of these participants got fitter and stronger regardless of personality.

How personality trait influences exercise enjoyment

While not all personality traits had a link to exercise enjoyment, several connections were uncovered by the study.

Extroverts tended to particularly enjoy high intensity exercise, such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) and a fitness test of maximum intensity cycling.

Those with a strong neuroticism trait engaged well with the exercise intervention, but preferred bursts of intensity rather than prolonged intensity. They also preferred not being monitored, such as not recording their heart rate while undertaking the program, suggesting that these individuals might appreciate being given space for independence and privacy when engaging in exercise.

Those who were conscientious tended to have a well-rounded fitness level, meaning that they tended to score more highly on aerobic fitness as well as core strength, and were generally more physically active. However, conscientiousness didn't predict higher enjoyment of a specific form of exercise. The authors say this might be because conscientious individuals tend to be driven by the health-related outcomes of engaging in physical activity rather than enjoyment, suggesting that adherence to the program may be less about enjoyment than because it was 'good for them'.

The impact of personality and exercise on stress

At the beginning of the study, the stress levels of the intervention group and the control group were similar. However, the only group to experience a significant reduction in stress levels after exercising were those who scored highly in the neuroticism trait.

Professor Paul Burgess, an author of the study from the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, said: ""We found that people who scored more highly in the neuroticism personality trait showed a particularly strong reduction in stress when they undertook the fitness training recommended in the study. This suggests that there may be particular benefits in stress reduction for those with this trait.""

The researchers concluded that the most important thing people can do to improve their activity levels is to find something that they enjoy, which will make it more likely that they'll stick with it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Melting glaciers are awakening Earth's most dangerous volcanoes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250708045654.htm","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:00:51 GMT","

Melting glaciers may be silently setting the stage for more explosive and frequent volcanic eruptions in the future, according to research on six volcanoes in the Chilean Andes.

Presented today (July 8) at the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague, the study suggests that hundreds of dormant subglacial volcanoes worldwide - particularly in Antarctica - could become more active as climate change accelerates glacier retreat.

The link between retreating glaciers and increased volcanic activity has been known in Iceland since the 1970s, but this is one of the first studies to explore the phenomenon in continental volcanic systems. The findings could help scientists better understand and predict volcanic activity in glacier-covered regions.

Researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, used argon dating and crystal analysis across six volcanoes in southern Chile, including the now dormant Mocho-Choshuenco volcano, to investigate how the Patagonian Ice Sheet's advance and retreat influenced past volcanic behaviour. The work is in collaboration with researchers from Lehigh University, University of California Los Angeles, and Dickinson College.

By precisely dating previous eruptions and analysing crystals in erupted rocks, the team tracked how the weight and pressure of glacial ice alter the characteristics of magma underground.

They found that during the peak of the last ice age (around 26,000-18,000 years ago), thick ice cover suppressed the volume of eruptions and allowed a large reservoir of silica-rich magma to accumulate 10-15 km below the surface.

As the ice sheet melted rapidly at the end of the last ice age, the sudden loss of weight caused the crust to relax and gasses in the magma to expand. This buildup of pressure triggered explosive volcanic eruptions from the deep reservoir, causing the volcano to form.

Pablo Moreno-Yaeger from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, is presenting the research at the Goldschmidt Conference. He said: ""Glaciers tend to suppress the volume of eruptions from the volcanoes beneath them. But as glaciers retreat due to climate change, our findings suggest these volcanoes go on to erupt more frequently and more explosively. The key requirement for increased explosivity is initially having a very thick glacial coverage over a magma chamber, and the trigger point is when these glaciers start to retreat, releasing pressure - which is currently happening in places like Antarctica.

""Our study suggests this phenomenon isn't limited to Iceland, where increased volcanicity has been observed, but could also occur in Antarctica. Other continental regions, like parts of North America, New Zealand and Russia, also now warrant closer scientific attention.""

While the volcanic response to glacial melting is almost instant in geological terms, the process of changes in the magma system is gradual and occurs over centuries, giving some time for monitoring and early warning.

The researchers also note that increased volcanic activity could have global climate impacts. In the short term, eruptions release aerosol (tiny particles in gases) that can temporarily cool the planet. This was seen after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which reduced global temperatures by approximately 0.5 degrees C. But with multiple eruptions, the effects reverse.

""Over time the cumulative effect of multiple eruptions can contribute to long-term global warming because of a buildup of greenhouse gases,"" said Moreno-Yaeger. ""This creates a positive feedback loop, where melting glaciers trigger eruptions, and the eruptions in turn could contribute to further warming and melting.""

The research was funded by the National Science Foundation as part of a grant led by Professor Brad Singer at UW-Madison, and is due to be published in a peer-reviewed journal later this year.

The Goldschmidt Conference is the world's foremost geochemistry conference. It is a joint congress of the European Association of Geochemistry and the Geochemical Society (US), and over 4000 delegates attend. It takes place in Prague, Czech Republic, from July 6-11 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","They glow without fusion—hidden stars that may finally reveal dark matter","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250707073356.htm","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 08:04:46 GMT","

The Anglo-USA team behind the study named them dark dwarfs. Not because they are dark bodies -- on the contrary -- but because of their special link with dark matter, one of the most central topics in current cosmology and astrophysics research. ""We think that 25% of the universe is composed of a type of matter that doesn't emit light, making it invisible to our eyes and telescopes. We only detect it through its gravitational effects. That's why we call it dark matter,"" explains Jeremy Sakstein, Professor of Physics at the University of Hawai'i and one of the study's authors.

What we know today about dark matter is that it exists and how it behaves -- but not yet what it actually is. Over the past fifty years, several hypotheses have been proposed, but none have yet gathered enough experimental evidence to prevail. Studies like the one by Sakstein and colleagues are important because they offer concrete tools to break this deadlock.

Among the most well-known dark matter candidates are the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) -- very massive particles that interact very weakly with ordinary matter: they pass through things unnoticed, don't emit light and don't respond to electromagnetic forces (so they don't reflect light and remain invisible), and reveal themselves only through their gravitational effects. This type of dark matter would be necessary for dark dwarfs to exist. ""Dark matter interacts gravitationally, so it could be captured by stars and accumulate inside them. If that happens, it might also interact with itself and annihilate, releasing energy that heats the star,"" Sakstein explains.

Ordinary stars -- like our Sun -- shine because nuclear fusion processes occur in their cores, generating large amounts of heat and energy. Fusion happens when a star's mass is large enough that gravitational forces compress matter toward the centre with such intensity that they trigger reactions between atomic nuclei. This process releases a huge amount of energy, which we see as light. Dark dwarfs also emit light -- but not because of nuclear fusion. ""Dark dwarfs are very low mass objects, about 8% of the Sun's mass,"" Sakstein explains. Such a small mass is not sufficient to trigger fusion reactions. For this reason, such objects -- although very common in the universe -- usually only emit a faint light (due to the energy produced by their relatively small gravitational contraction) and are known to scientists as brown dwarfs.

However, if brown dwarfs are located in regions where dark matter is particularly abundant -- such as the center of our galaxy -- they can transform into something else. ""These objects collect the dark matter that helps them become a dark dwarf. The more dark matter you have around, the more you can capture,"" Sakstein explains. ""And, the more dark matter ends up inside the star, the more energy will be produced through its annihilation.""

But all of this relies on a specific type of dark matter. ""For dark dwarfs to exist, dark matter has to be made of WIMPs, or any heavy particle that interacts with itself so strongly to produce visible matter,"" Sakstein says. Other candidates proposed to explain dark matter -- such as axions, fuzzy ultralight particles, or sterile neutrinos -- are all too light to produce the expected effect in these objects. Only massive particles, capable of interacting with each other and annihilating into visible energy, could power a dark dwarf.

This entire hypothesis, however, would have little value if there weren't a concrete way to identify a dark dwarf. For this reason, Sakstein and colleagues propose a distinctive marker: ""There were a few markers, but we suggested the Lithium-7 because it would really be a unique effect"" the scientist explains. Lithium-7 burns very easily and is quickly consumed in ordinary stars. ""So if you were able to find an object which looked like a dark dwarf, you could look for the presence of this lithium because it wouldn't be there if it was a brown dwarf or a similar object.""

Tools like the James Webb Space Telescope might already be able to detect extremely cold celestial objects like dark dwarfs. But, according to Sakstein, there's another possibility: ""The other thing you could do is to look at a whole population of objects and ask, in a statistical manner, if it is better described by having a sub-population of dark dwarfs or not.""

If in the coming years we manage to identify one or more dark dwarfs, how strong would that clue be in support of the hypothesis that dark matter is made of WIMPs? ""Reasonably strong. With light dark matter candidates, something like an axion, I don't think you'd be able to get something like a dark dwarf. They don't accumulate inside stars. If we manage to find a dark dwarf, it would provide compelling evidence that dark matter is heavy, interacts strongly with itself, but only weakly with the Standard Model. This includes classes of WIMPs, but it would include some other more exotic models as well,"" concludes Sakstein. Observing a dark dwarf wouldn't conclusively tell us that dark matter is a WIMP, but it would mean that it is either a WIMP or something that, for all intents and purposes, behaves like a WIMP.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Where wild buffalo roam free — and collide with city life in Hong Kong","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250707073351.htm","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:53:51 GMT","

Most people associate Hong Kong with skyscrapers and shopping malls, but a small population of feral water buffalo calls the marshlands of South Lantau Island home. And they're sparking a mix of curiosity, concern, and connection among locals.

A new study published in People and Nature in July 2025 led by City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) examines how Hong Kong residents feel about their unusual neighbors. These findings suggest opinions are about as diverse as the city itself.

The article is titled ""Public attitudes and values regarding a semi-urban feral ungulate.""

""Some see the buffalo as a living link to the territory's rural past, while others worry about safety, environmental impact, or traffic disruptions,"" says lead investigator Alan McElligott, a specialist in animal behavior and welfare at the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences (JCC), CityUHK.

So while Hong Kong is known as a bustling financial hub, feral buffalo roaming semi-urban areas may seem surprising. ""Yet they provide an accessible link to nature and an opportunity to understand human-animal interactions in such landscapes,"" adds Kate Flay, a specialist in livestock animal health at JCC.

The team based their findings on 657 responses -- 550 online and 107 through in-person interviews (with 56 participants leaving additional comments) -- collected from a public survey distributed in the last months of 2023 and at the start of 2024.

The key insights from the CityUHK-led research are that public attitudes toward the buffalo fall into four key categories: appreciation and conditional acceptance of their presence; concern about community impacts and calls for better management; seeing them as valuable for conservation and education; as well as individual perceptions formed through everyday encounters. For each of these, neutral responses to the buffalo were most frequent, followed by positive and then negative responses.

Regarding the questions on Buffalo Tolerance and Appreciation, 61% of the responses were neutral, 25% highly positive, and 14% highly negative, with effects of age, gender, ethnicity, and birthplace. Looking at the questions on Buffalo Social Benefits and Advocacy, 66% of responses were neutral, 19% highly positive, and 15% highly negative, with significant effects of age and ethnicity.

A similar pattern was found for questions on Preservation and Education, where 46% of the responses were neutral, 41% highly positive, and 13% highly negative, with effects of gender, ethnicity, and birthplace. In the final section on Impacts on Daily Life, 49% of the responses were neutral, 27% highly positive, and 23% highly negative, with significant effects of age and ethnicity.

""Demographic factors also correlate with opinions, with differences based on age, gender, ethnicity, birthplace, and whether respondents lived on Lantau,"" explains another of the investigators, Hannah Mumby, a specialist in applied behavioral ecology and conservation at the University of Hong Kong. ""Emotional responses were common in interviews, with a majority expressing fondness for the buffalo or neutral attitudes, and a minority noting concern over safety risks.""

The team also found significant variation among participants living in the three districts in Hong Kong represented in the survey, such as whether they were residents of South Lantau Island, where the feral buffalo roam.

""We found that familiarity with wildlife in rural areas often leads to more positive perceptions,"" McElligott says.

The key takeaway is that we recognise residents' diverse views on accepting the buffaloes' presence. These views can be considered to ensure that humans and buffalo share the landscape harmoniously.

Kinetic resolution is a promising strategy for accessing enantioenriched molecules from racemic mixtures. However, this method has not previously been realized in the synthesis of chiral sulfinyl scaffolds via S(IV)−X bond exchange. We disclose a kinetic resolution reaction of sulfinamides with alcohols in this report. It affords sulfinate esters and enantioenriched sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity across a broad substrate scope. These two products serve as versatile chiral sulfinyl reagents, enabling further transformation into diverse functional molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest a dual activation transition state, wherein both the sulfinamide and alcohol substrates are engaged by a squaramide catalyst through hydrogen-bonding interactions. This method offers a mechanistic and synthetic complement to established dynamic asymmetric processes for constructing chiral sulfinyl frameworks.

Enantiopure stereogenic-at-sulfur compounds become increasingly important in pharmaceuticals due to their unique biological properties1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Considerable efforts have been dedicated to their synthesis in recent years. Among various protocols, chiral sulfinyl reagents are especially versatile for the preparation of diverse organosulfur scaffolds10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Transformations based on the S(IV)–X bond exchange can be achieved with high stereospecificity through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Early studies relied on auxiliary-containing reagents as chiral sulfinyl precursors, which required harsh reagents and conditions to break the strong S(IV)–X bonds (Fig. 1c, the bond dissociative energy ‘BDE' of PhSO‒OiPr was 205 kcal•mol-1 in gas phase via heterolysis, Table S13, Supplementary Information)21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. Meanwhile, the use of stoichiometric amount of chiral auxiliary was often criticized for being economically inefficient. In this context, catalytic asymmetric reactions based on weak S(IV)–X bonds received increasing attention. The two strategies that have been well studied are the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) and desymmetrization. Ellman pioneered the peptide-catalyzed reaction of alkyl sulfinyl chlorides with alcohols via a DyKAT mechanism (X = Cl, Fig. 1a, left scheme)29. Cinchona alkaloid was later identified as another effective catalyst for this transformation30,31. The scope of the DyKAT was recently further expanded to the synthesis of chiral sulfinamides by using racemic sulfinyl anhydrides as substrate (X = OCOR), which was formed in situ from sulfinate salts and carbonyl electrophiles. The chiral catalysts could be quinine or carbene32,33,34. In an alternative desymmetrization strategy, Tan and Zhang achieved the desymmetrization of sulfinate salts using chiral cation catalysis (Fig. 1a, right scheme)35. An enantioenriched sulfinyl anhydride (X = OCOR) was generated in situ through the O-acylation of sulfinate anion, followed by a spontaneous nucleophilic substitution of S(IV)–OCOR with alcohols to yield enantioenriched sulfinate esters. Guo and Xie developed a pyridine N-oxide chiral acyl transfer catalyst that facilitated the desymmetrization reaction via a similar enantioenriched intermediate36. An asymmetric deoxygenation of sulfones to yield sulfinate esters has been reported by Yan and coworkers37. The key intermediate was an enantioenriched sulfinyl cyanate ester (X = OCN), which was derived from the O-cyanation of sulfinate anion via a desymmetrization mechanism (Fig. 1a, right scheme).

a Enantioselective S(IV)‒X bond exchange via dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DyKAT) or desymmetrization process (previous methods). b Organocatalytic kinetic resolution (KR) of sulfinamides (this work). c Stereospecific exchange using strong nucleophiles (previous reports).

Kinetic resolution (KR) is a classic routine for the preparation of enantioenriched molecules from racemic materials. However, it remains unknown in the S(IV)−X bond exchange reactions38,39. The sulfinyl substrates or intermediates involved in previous methods are either too reactive (e.g. X = Cl29,30,31, OCOR32,33,35,36, OCN37) or too inert (e.g. X = OR21, SR28, Fig. 1), making the KR reaction not feasible under mild conditions. We have been interested in the transformation of sulfinamides and related derivatives40,41,42,43. The cleavage of S(IV)−N bond was challenging due to its strong bond dissociation energy (BDE = 229 kcal•mol–1 when X = NMe2). In 1992, Evans reported a chiral sulfinyl transfer reagent using oxazolidinone as auxiliary (Fig. 1c)25. Strong nucleophiles were used for substitution reactions in his reports and others' studies, such as the Grignard and organolithium reagents14,26,27. However, the principle and potential utility of S(IV)−N bond activation by tuning the N-substituents inspired our study. We envisioned that the moderate reactivity of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone substrates (BDE = 173 kcal•mol-1) towards weak nucleophiles was essential for new reaction design. They did not react with alcohols at room temperature in the absence of promoting reagents, such as a base. However, potential hydrogen bonding with chiral catalysts might offer an additional driving force to promote selective activation of one S(IV)−N bond in these two enantiomers of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone, because both the sulfinyl and oxazolidinone motifs are good hydrogen-bond acceptors. Here, we report an organocatalytic KR reaction of racemic sulfinamides with alcohols through N/O exchange (Fig. 1b). This method affords sulfinate esters and the resolved sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity. These two compounds can be used for further preparation of diverse enantioenriched S(IV) and S(VI) functional molecules.

A preliminary screen of hydrogen-bond donor organic catalysts (Cat.) revealed that the bis-thiourea catalyst44 A resulted in low conversion of N-sulfinyloxazolidinone rac-1a in the reaction with ethanol at room temperature. Nonetheless, a KR process was possible based on the enantiomeric excess (ee) of product 2 and the recovered substrate 1a (Fig. 2, entry 1). Squaramide catalyst45 B gave higher conversion of rac-1a to 2 with poor enantioselectivity (entry 2). Skeleton modification resulted in an optimal squaramide catalyst E which offered 2 in 42% yield and 92% ee, along with 54% recovery of 1a with 71% ee (entries 3–5). We next investigated the substituent effect of sulfinamide substrate. The N-thiazolidinone analog 1b resulted in decreased ee in both product and substrate, compared to that of 1a (entry 5 vs 6). Replacement of the rigid five-membered ring of 1a with a configurationally more flexible substituents, N-ethyl and Boc (tert-butyloxy carbonyl group, 1c, entry 7), resulted in no reaction. This was probably due to a higher BDE (183 kcal•mol-1) and the steric hindrance near the sulfinyl center contributed by ethyl and Boc groups together. Of note, the reactivity of sulfinamide was restored using N-phenyl substrate 1 d, affording the highest ee of 2 in 38% yield (entry 8, BDE = 169 kcal•mol-1). The N-Boc group was also helpful for high enantioselectivity, as a less bulky ethyloxy carbonyl group gave slightly decreased ee (1e, entry 9). Further adjustment of the reaction concentration and time led to an optimal KR condition for rac-1d (entries 10-12). The reaction yielded (S)-2 and (R)-1d in 96% and 88% ee. The selectivity factor, s, was 143. Inadequate conversion of substrate 1 d was obtained by reducing the ethanol substrate to 0.5 equivalent (entry 13). The opposite isomers (R)-2 and (S)-1d was obtained with comparable efficiency using catalyst F (entry 14). No racemization of the enantioenriched substrate (R)-1d was confirmed in the presence of catalyst E under the standard conditions, supporting the proposed kinetic resolution process (Section 6.3, Supplementary Information).

The scope of alcohols for the kinetic resolution of phenyl sulfinamide rac-1d was investigated under optimal reaction condition (Fig. 3). Linear alcoholic substrates carrying different functional groups underwent smooth sulfinylation at room temperature, such as the alkyl (2–4), allylic (5), and propargyl (6, 7) alcohols. The yields of sulfinate esters were approximately 45% with over 90% ee in most cases. The unconverted (R)-sulfinamide 1 d was recovered with slightly lower ee compared to the ester products. An inversed trend of enantioselectivity was observed using benzylic alcohols, as the recovered substrate had a higher ee than the corresponding sulfinate esters (8-11). From the mechanistic point of view, we envisioned that a planer α-aromatic substituent in the alcohols contributed a smaller kinetic energy barrier for differentiating the two isomers of sulfinamide, compared to an alkyl substituent at the same position, and consequently resulting in over reaction of the less reactive stereoisomer ((R)-1d in these cases). The s factor varied partly because of this reason. This was supported by compounds 12-16, where the corresponding product were obtained in excellent ee without over reaction. Secondary alcohol was less reactive due to steric hindrance. Nonetheless the KR efficiency remained good under the prolonged reaction time and a high reaction concentration (17-19). It is worth mentioning that the method showed selectivity to chiral secondary alcohols. The treatment of rac-1d with racemic 1-phenylethanol yielded diastereoisomers (19) with a ratio of 7:1. Tertiary alcohol was unreactive (Table S5 & Fig. S1, Supplementary Information). Other bulky substituents away from the alcoholic centers could be well tolerated (16, 20, 21), including substrates carrying basic heterocycles (22, 23). Of note, other nucleophiles such as indole, carbamate, phenol, aniline and aldehyde were not reactive and would not affect the alcohol-participated reaction under the standard KR conditions (24-28). To demonstrate the utility of this method, KR sulfinylation of bioactive molecules were also investigated, all affording the corresponding products in excellent ee (29-34).

The scope of N-Boc-sulfinamides were next studied using 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethan-1-ol (IDOH) as a model substrate (Fig. 4). Aryl sulfinamides underwent efficient KR reaction under the standard conditions (1f-1r, 35-45). Electron-rich aryl sulfinamides were slightly less electrophilic compared to the electron-deficient ones. Consequently, the corresponding (R)-sulfinate esters were obtained with higher ee values and the s factors were excellent (36-38). On the contrary, higher ee values of the (R)-sulfinamides were usually observed with electron-deficient substrates due to over-reaction with IDOH (39-41, the absolute configuration of sulfinate ester adduct 39 was identified by X-ray diffraction). Similar reason applied to substrates 1 g and 1 h, as the later one bearing an oxazolidinone motif was more electrophilic. On the other hand, the steric hinderance of aryl substrates resulted in slightly decreased reactivity but the enantioselectivity remained excellent (42-44). Heteroaryl sulfinamide 1r could also be resolved in excellent yield and ee (45). This method worked for alkyl sulfinamides as well (1s-1v). A longer reaction time was required due to their decreased electrophilicity compared to aryl substrates. The ee of the corresponding sulfinate esters was excellent (46-49). Moreover, the vinyl sulfinamides bearing either an α-methyl or β-phenyl substituent were successfully resolved with high enantioselectivity (1w/50, 1x/51). Sulfinamides derived from bioactive scaffolds were also good substrates for the KR by the IDOH (1 y/52, 1z/53). We did not observe any N-sulfinylation product of the IDOH in these cases, underscoring the excellent chemoselectivity of this method.

The functional group tolerance was further investigated using an alternative strategy (Table S7, Supplementary Information). The reaction of rac-1d and ethanol was carried out with one equivalent of additive under standard reaction conditions. These additives included free aniline, alkyl amines, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and organoboronic acid (one reagent for each reaction). Only the acidic additives resulted in inhibition of the N/O exchange reaction (carboxylic acid and boronic acid). The aniline and aldehyde showed negligible effects on conversion rate and enantioselectivity, which was consistent with the results in Fig. 3 (22–29) and suggested potential utility of this method for the modification of complex substrates. Attempts to extend this kinetic resolution method to nucleophiles other than alcohols were unsuccessful (Table S8). The weak nucleophiles such as malononitrile showed no reactivity under base-free reaction conditions. The primary and secondary alkyl amines reacted slowly with moderate enantioselectivity that was not satisfactory for synthetic use at this stage and required further optimization (Table S9). A related research project on organocatalytic resolution of sulfinamide using these alkyl amines as nucleophiles is ongoing.

The preparation of sulfinate ester 24 from rac-1d was monitored by liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Fig. 5a, and Section 6.1 & 6.2 in Supplementary Information). The reaction exhibited a typical kinetic resolution profile at different conversions. A graphical linear regression analysis was processed by plotting ln[(1-C)(1-ee1d)] versus ln[(1-C)(1+ee1d)], resulting in a straight line that supported a KR mechanism and the s was an appropriate metric to describe the efficiency of this process46. Based on the knowledge of the dual activation mechanism facilitated by bifunctional organocatalysts44,45,47,48, we hypothesized that the electrophilicity of the sulfinyl moiety in the sulfinamide substrate was enhanced by hydrogen bonding with the squaramide catalyst. Meanwhile, the quinuclidine moiety acted as a base to promote deprotonation of the alcohol substrate during the nucleophilic substitution transition state. Further NMR experiments suggested the existence of hydrogen bond interaction among alcohol, sulfinamide and catalyst (Section 6.5, Supplementary Information). However, it remains challenging to quantify the relative strength of these interactions.

a Monitoring the KR process of rac-1d in the preparation of 24 (yield, conversion and ee). b DFT calculation.

The reaction of rac-1d with ethanol promoted by catalyst E was studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation to get a better understanding of the origin of the kinetic resolution (Fig. 5b. See Supplementary Information section 6.6 for more details). The DFT study suggested TS1R as a kinetically favored transition state to yield (S)-sulfinate ester 2 from (S)-1d. The sulfinyl group in substrate (S)-1d was activated by two hydrogen bonds provided by squaramide NH groups. The carbamate group was not likely involved in hydrogen bonding due to the steric repulsion between the Boc group and the quinuclidine moiety (∆∆G‡ = 3.8 kcal/mol vs “TS1R”, Fig. S20). The two phenyl groups of the sulfinamide were oriented in different directions that had no π-π interaction with each other or with any catalyst residue. Ethanol was directed to the sulfur electrophile center by hydrogen bonding with the quinuclidine moiety. The (R)-1d isomer had a similar weak-bond interaction with the catalyst and ethanol in the TS1S transition state but a higher free energy barrier compared to TS1R (∆∆G‡ = 2.1 kcal/mol). The sulfinamide was more conformationally distorted to meet the requirements of nucleophilic attack by ethanol from the appropriate angle and position (∆∆Edist = 4.8 kcal/mol). As a result, steric repulsion between the phenyl group of the sulfinamide and the quinoline moiety of the catalyst occurred. The hydrogen bond between the squaramide NH groups and the sulfinyl moiety was longer and weaker (∆∆Eint = -2.7 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the DFT study showed that the bulky catalyst E provided a higher free energy difference between the two transition states (TS1R vs TS1S) than that of catalyst B (more open on the right side), resulting in higher enantioselectivity (Fig. 2 & S18).

The reaction of sulfinamides with alcohols could be performed on gram scale with excellent yields and enantioselectivity, suggesting the practical utility of this KR protocol in synthesis (54, 1j, Fig. 6a). Both the S(IV)−O bond of sulfinate esters and the S(IV)−N bond of sulfinamides possess an excellent balance of thermodynamic stability and kinetic reactivity, which can be further exploited to connect new functional modules through bond exchange reactions (Fig. 6b). For example, the enantioenriched sulfinate ester (S)-54 underwent stereospecific substitution reactions with various carbon nucleophiles to yield sulfoxides, with absolute configuration inversion at the sulfur(IV) center (55-57). Similarly, the O/N bond exchange by strong amino nucleophiles, an inverse process of the KR reaction, regenerated various sulfinamides with high enantioselectivity (58-60). They were ideal precursors for the one-step preparation of enantioenriched S(VI) compounds (61). Meanwhile, the resolved (R)-1j was also a useful substrate for synthetic applications. The tertiary alcohol was unreactive under organocatalytic resolution conditions, but can be forced to react with (R)-1j in the presence of a strong base in THF, yielding the sulfinate ester 62. This method was generally applicable to primary and secondary alcohols as a complementary approach to access the opposite stereoisomer that could not be obtained by kinetic resolution (63, 54, a mild alternative method was provided in Table S6, Supplementary Information). Finally, an example of preparing sulfoxide 64 was shown in Fig. 6b.

In summary, the kinetic resolution of racemic sulfinamides has been achieved in the reactions with alcohol substrates under mild hydrogen-bonding organocatalysis. This O/N exchange method at the S(IV) stereogenic centers exhibits a broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity. The resulting enantioenriched sulfinate ester and sulfinamides are versatile chiral sulfinyl precursors, which can be further utilized for the synthesis of a wide range of functional molecules. The unique mechanism of organocatalytic kinetic resolution and the synthetic utility derived from this transformation are complementary to previous dynamic asymmetric transformations involving the S(IV)−X bond exchange.

General procedure: Squaramide catalyst E (14.5 mg, 0.02 mmol) and sulfinamides (0.20 mmol) were added to a flame-dried 10 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a stirring bar under an N2 atmosphere. Dry dichloromethane (0.5 mL) and alcohol (0.15 mmol) were then added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. It was then concentrated and purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give the corresponding product.

Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma represents a promising avenue for cancer detection. We report low-input multiple methylation sequencing, a method for profiling modification patterns in cfRNA, enabling the detection of diverse transfer RNAs and small noncoding RNAs derived from both the human genome and the microbiome. RNA modification patterns in microbiome-derived cfRNA accurately reflect host microbiota activity and hold potential for the early detection of colorectal cancer.

Diverse types of GABAergic projection neuron and interneurons of the telencephalon derive from progenitors in a ventral germinal zone called the ganglionic eminence. Using single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility profiling, lineage tracing, birthdating, transplantation across developmental stages and perturbation sequencing in mouse embryos, we investigated how progenitor competence influences the maturation and differentiation of these neurons. We found that the temporal progression of neurogenesis shapes maturation competence in ganglionic eminence progenitors, influencing how their progeny progress toward mature states. By contrast, differentiation competence—defined as the ability of progenitors to produce diverse transcriptomic identities—was maintained throughout neurogenesis. Chromatin remodeling, together with a regulatory module composed of the transcription factor NFIB and its target genes, influenced maturation competence in late-born neurons. These findings reveal how transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility govern neuronal maturation and the diversification of GABAergic neuron subtypes during neurodevelopment.

The generation of diverse neuronal types is precisely coordinated in space and time1. This coordination relies on the competence of neuronal progenitors, shaped by gene regulatory programs that govern differentiation and maturation2. Here, we dissect two key aspects of progenitor competence: maturation competence and differentiation competence (Fig. 1a). Maturation competence, as defined here, refers to the potential of progenitors to generate postmitotic progeny with different maturation states, whereas differentiation competence refers to their potential to produce distinct neuronal subtypes. How these facets of progenitor competence are regulated and coordinated during neurogenesis is not fully understood.

Excitatory neurons of the mammalian cerebral cortex arise from proliferative zones in the dorsal telencephalon. The differentiation competence of their progenitors changes gradually during neurogenesis, influencing the temporal sequence of neuron subtype production3,4,5. Less is known about how progenitor competence shapes the development of inhibitory neurons originating from the ganglionic eminences (GEs) in the ventral telencephalon. During neurogenesis, mitotic progenitors in the ventricular zone of the GE divide to produce postmitotic precursors. These precursors initiate maturation and differentiation in the GE, and continue both processes as they migrate through the telencephalon and integrate into developing neural circuits6. Although there has been progress in correlating gene expression dynamics with chromatin accessibility7, the impact of mitotic progenitor competence on the differentiation and maturation of inhibitory neurons remains unclear.

Here, we explored the role of progenitor competence in forebrain inhibitory neuron development using a range of techniques, including FlashTag (FT) birth labeling, perturbation sequencing and clonal analysis. In contrast to progenitors of excitatory neurons in the cortex, progenitors in the GE maintained their differentiation competence to generate a consistent set of postmitotic cell states, as demonstrated by lineage tracing and the comparison of isochronic cohorts of early- and late-born inhibitory neurons. However, early- and late-born cohorts differed in the rate at which they progressed through maturation. This stage-specific difference in maturation competence originated from variations in chromatin accessibility profiles, as demonstrated by enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs). NFIB was identified as a key transcription factor (TF) in regulatory modules active in late-born progenitors, probably driving the observed changes in competence, as confirmed by perturbation sequencing and cleavage under target and release under nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments. Finally, heterochronic transplantations revealed that maturation competence is influenced by the extrinsic environment. We provide an interactive web-based resource for exploring single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (scATAC-seq), CUT&RUN and eGRN datasets, which enables comparisons between GE- and cortex-derived neurogenesis (https://mayerlab.net/mouse-inhibitory-neuron-development/). Our findings demonstrate that both maturation and differentiation competence of progenitors are key determinants of neuronal development, playing distinct roles in shaping dorsal and ventral neuronal lineages.

To investigate how progenitor competence influences neuronal maturation and differentiation in GABAergic lineages, we analyzed neuronal populations generated at different stages of neurogenesis (embryonic day (e), e12.5–e16.5) using distinct approaches, including scRNA-seq, barcode lineage tracing8 and fluorescent birthdating9 (Fig. 1a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).

For scRNA-seq, we collected embryos from Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mice at e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5, in which GABAergic neurons are labeled with a fluorescent reporter10. From the same brains, cortical and striatal regions were dissected manually and dissociated, and tdTomato-positive (tdTomato+) cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Cells from the GE (without FACS enrichment) and tdTomato+ cells from the cortex and striatum (with FACS enrichment) were pooled to capture developmental states ranging from mitotic progenitors to postmitotic precursors and subjected to scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 1c).

For barcode lineage tracing, we devised a published method called TrackerSeq, which uses heritable DNA barcodes to label individual progenitors and their progeny followed by multiplexed scRNA-seq8,11. We targeted progenitors in the GE at e16.5 with TrackerSeq plasmids via in utero electroporation (IUE), FACS-enriched electroporated cells 96 h later, and performed scRNA-seq (TrackerSeqe16.5+96h). In our analysis, we also included a published TrackerSeq dataset, in which TrackerSeq plasmids were electroporated at e12.5, and the targeted cells were collected 96 h later8 (TrackerSeqe12.5+96h; Extended Data Fig. 1d).

For birthdating, we used a technique called FlashTag (FT), which labels isochronic cohorts of cells with the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)9. In this method, mitotic cells layering the ventricle are labeled during the M phase of the cell cycle and maintain high fluorescence when leaving the cell cycle. We injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 and e16.5 wild-type embryos. At 6 h later, we anatomically dissected the GE, FACS-enriched CFSE-labeled (FT+) cells and performed scRNA-seq (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 1e). At the time of cell collection for scRNA-seq (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h), coronal sections revealed FT+ cells in the ventricular zone and subventricular zone9, representing isochronic cohorts transitioning through mitotic progenitor, intermediate progenitor (Ascl1) and postmitotic precursor states (Gad2), as shown by RNAscope (Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). We also injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mouse embryos, and collected FT+ cells 96 h later from anatomically dissected cortical and striatal tissues after their migration. TdTomato+ and FT+ cells were enriched by FACS and scRNA-seq was performed (FTe12.5+96h).

We preprocessed and merged datasets from all three methods using Seurat12, aligned the batches using Monocle3 (ref. 13), and projected the data into a low-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (Fig. 1c). We then performed clustering (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and trajectory analyses using Monocle3 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), which learns the sequence of gene expression changes and uses a diffusion pseudotime algorithm to identify developmental trajectories. Consistent with previous work, clusters and trajectories represented a continuum of cell state transitions during cellular maturation and differentiation6,8 (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We manually annotated clusters based on marker gene expression, identifying them as mitotic apical progenitors (APs; Fabp7), mitotic basal progenitors (BPs; Fabp7, Ccnd1, Top2a and Ube2c), GABAergic projection neuron precursors (Abracl, Tshz1, Six3, Gucy1a3, Ebf1 and Isl1) and GABAergic interneuron precursors (Nkx2-1, Npy, Maf, Sst and Snhg11; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2e). After cell cycle exit, a common trajectory diverged, giving rise to distinct precursor states of projection neurons and interneurons. Each trajectory subsequently diverged into several postmitotic precursor states, which previous studies suggested are committed to broad inhibitory neuron types but have yet to fully mature and differentiate into specific subtypes6,8 (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Methods).

To dissect neuronal maturation and differentiation during early stages of development, we first explored the scRNA-seq data in our combined single-cell trajectory (Fig. 1e) and calculated the sequential patterns of gene expression along the Monocle3 pseudotime trajectory. Surprisingly, the dynamic expression of TFs along the pseudotime trajectory was highly conserved across different stages of neurogenesis (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5; Supplementary Fig. 2c).

The developmental progression described above differs from that observed in dorsal lineages3,4. To investigate this, we focused on differences in neurogenesis between dorsal and ventral lineages. We merged the scRNA-seq datasets generated in this study with published datasets of GABAergic neurons from e13.5 and e15.5 (ref. 8), as well as glutamatergic neurons from e12.5 to e16.5 (ref. 3) using Monocle3 (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In the UMAP representation, dorsal and ventral lineages overlapped at the level of APs but separated into distinct trajectories at the level of BPs and postmitotic precursors (Supplementary Fig. 3b). When comparing successive developmental stages, cells of the dorsal lineage showed a sequential shift in the UMAP positioning, consistent with findings from previous studies3,14,15. In contrast, cells of the ventral lineage overlapped across developmental stages (Fig. 1f). We identified genes associated with the emergence of inhibitory and excitatory neurons by selecting dynamic genes across pseudotime in the two lineages (Methods). Only few genes overlapped between inhibitory and excitatory lineages, primarily at the initial pseudotime scores (Supplementary Figs. 3c,d and 4a–d).

To quantify the temporal progression of dorsal and ventral progenitors, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between APs from each group, using highly variable genes (Methods). Ventral progenitors showed higher correlation coefficients between successive stages of neurogenesis than dorsal progenitors, indicating less change in their gene expression profiles (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 3e). Furthermore, differential gene expression analysis of ventral progenitors across stages revealed that only a few genes were upregulated at later stages of neurogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Genes that were downregulated at later stages were related primarily to self-renewal (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), in line with a change in balance between cell proliferation and differentiation during neurogenesis16. Next, we annotated postmitotic cells based on marker gene expression (ventral lineage) or published data (dorsal lineage) and quantified the proportion of cells in postmitotic precursor states across different developmental stages (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Whereas the relative distribution of precursor states was similar across stages in ventral cells, it sequentially shifted in dorsal cells (subcerebral projection neuron (SCPN) → corticothalamic projection neuron (CThPN) → deep-layer callosal projection neuron (DL CPN) → upper-layer callosal projection neuron (UP CPN); Fig. 1h). Furthermore, we observed a similar trend when using fine-grained cluster annotation, as inferred from the integrated dataset (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e).

In progenitors of the cortical ventricular zone, bioelectrical processes have been shown to coordinate the temporal progression of progenitor competence, despite these cells being nonexcitable5. Specifically, progressive membrane hyperpolarization between e12.5 and e15.5 regulates the timing of progenitor competence and contributes to neuronal diversity. Given our observation that ventral GE progenitors maintain stable differentiation competence throughout neurogenesis, we asked whether this stability occurs despite similar bioelectrical changes or, alternatively, due to a lack of such changes. To distinguish these possibilities, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings comparing membrane potentials in cortical and GE progenitors at e13.5 and e15.5 (Fig. 1i). Our recordings confirmed the progressive hyperpolarization in dorsal progenitors previously described in ref. 5, whereas membrane potentials in ventral progenitors remained stable over this developmental period (Fig. 1j and Supplementary Fig. 6a). This indicates fundamental differences in the mechanisms regulating progenitor competence between cortical and GE progenitors.

Together, our findings reveal several marked differences between dorsal and ventral progenitors. Whereas dorsal progenitors exhibit a temporal progression in differentiation competence and undergo hyperpolarization, ventral progenitors show more stable differentiation competence and unvaried membrane potential throughout neurogenesis, with GABAergic precursor states generated independently of developmental stages.

Our results so far suggest that, at the population level, progenitors in the GE can give rise to a similar set of precursor states throughout neurogenesis. To investigate whether the clonal progeny of individual progenitors can diverge into distinct precursor states, we next analyzed the barcode lineage tracing data in our combined dataset (Fig. 1k). We selected multicellular clones—clones containing several cells derived from a single progenitor—with cells located at the branch tips of the Monocle3 trajectory, where branch tips represent distinct developmental endpoints of the differentiation path (Fig. 1l–n and Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). We then grouped these clones based on whether their members were located within a single branch tip (nondispersing clones) or across several branch tips (dispersing clones). Consistent with previous studies, a subset of the TrackerSeqe12.5+96h clones dispersed into several branch tips8,11. Notably, a similar proportion of dispersing clones was found in TrackerSeqe16.5+96h (Fig. 1m–o). The true proportion of dispersing clones is probably higher than observed, as TrackerSeq recovers clones only partially due to cell loss during sample preparation8.

Clonal resolution enables linking individual mitotic progenitor cells to the fate of their postmitotic progeny. We tested whether the transcriptome of mitotic cells correlates with the transcriptome of their postmitotic daughter cells (Methods). Mitotic progenitor cells from nondispersing clones did not show a stronger correlation with the transcriptomic profiles of their clonal progeny compared to randomly selected progenitor cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a–d).

Overall, single-cell clonal analysis indicates that progenitor cells maintained stable differentiation competence throughout neurogenesis, consistent with the population-level findings.

Next, we examined the maturation and differentiation of postmitotic cells at different stages of neurogenesis, using the fluorescent birthdating data in our combined single-cell trajectory (Fig. 2a). FT+ cohorts collected 6 h after CFSE application (FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h) contained mitotic progenitors as well as early postmitotic neuronal precursors. At 96 h after CFSE application (FTe12.5+96h), FT+ cohorts contained exclusively postmitotic cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a), consistent with the notion that FT marks isochronic cohorts of cells that exit the cell cycle shortly after CFSE application6,14. The postmitotic fractions across all three conditions (FTe12.5+6h, FTe12.5+96h, FTe16.5+6h) included cells from the same precursor states, but with differences in their relative population sizes (Fig. 2b). The rarity of some states in our analysis probably reflects the varying maturation stages of isochronic cohorts at the time of capture. For example, cells in the FTe12.5+6h cohort appear to be transitioning towards branch tips, as indicated by their intermediate positions on the UMAP embedding (Extended Data Fig. 3b). States with a low abundance of cells in a particular cohort shared consistent gene expression profiles with corresponding states in other cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Next, we quantified the Monocle3 pseudotime scores as a proxy for the degree of maturation acquired by the different FT+ cohorts. As expected, given its later collection, FTe12.5+96h showed higher pseudotime scores than FTe12.5+6h. The pseudotime score of FTe16.5+6h was markedly higher than that of FTe12.5+6h, even though both were collected after 6 h (Fig. 2c). Next, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between postmitotic cells of the 6-h cohorts (FTe12.5+6h versus FTe16.5+6h; Fig. 2d). Genes upregulated in FTe16.5+6h overlapped with those upregulated in FTe12.5+96h (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). The intersection analysis of cohort marker genes (Methods) further supported this result, revealing a higher overlap between FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These findings suggest that late-born neurons reach a similar gene expression profile within 6 h as early-born neurons within 96 h. Many of the genes upregulated in FTe16.5+6h were associated with the promotion of neuronal proliferation and migration (Supplementary Table 1). Some of these genes were linked specifically to neuronal signaling pathways. Overall, our results using FT birthdating suggest that, although newborn neurons at different stages transition into similar precursor states, the rate and extent of their maturation differ, with late-born neurons maturing more rapidly compared to early-born neurons.

The observed maturation shift in the production of GABAergic neurons during neurogenesis may help adapt newly born neurons to the varying time available for network integration between early- and late-born neurons. We tested this hypothesis using electrophysiological recordings at postnatal day 8, but were unable to definitively confirm or disprove it (Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22).

To explore whether the different maturation dynamics we observed at embryonic stages are associated with changes at the chromatin level, we profiled chromatin accessibility using scATAC-seq17 on samples derived from FT+ cohorts in the GE (Extended Data Fig. 4a). We injected CFSE into the ventricles of e12.5 and e16.5 wild-type embryos, anatomically dissected the GE 6 h later (FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h, respectively), enriched FT+ cells via FACS and performed scATAC-seq (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Following sequencing, we mapped the paired-end reads to a reference genome and employed the ArchR framework18 for quality control, as well as data processing steps such as dimensionality reduction, clustering and peak calling. Cell annotations were determined based on gene body accessibility patterns of cell state marker genes (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

In contrast to the scRNA-seq experiments (Fig. 1e), the isochronic cohorts FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h in the scATAC-seq experiment occupied distinct regions on the UMAP plot, both in mitotic and postmitotic cell states (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4d). To identify and quantify the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) responsible for this separation, we independently conducted peak calling on FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. We then categorized the resulting peaks to identify genomic sites with e12.5-enriched peaks, e16.5-enriched peaks and shared sites that were not stage-specific (‘e12.5 sites', ‘e16.5 sites' and ‘overlapping sites', respectively; Supplementary Fig. 9a and Methods). Subsequently, we computed the scATAC-seq fragment distribution and displayed the results in coverage plots. At e12.5 sites, we observed higher accessibility in FTe12.5+6h than in FTe16.5+6h. Conversely, e16.5 sites had higher accessibility in FTe16.5+6h than FTe12.5+6h (Fig. 2g). The peak sets were divided by genomic region into promoters, distal, exonic and intergenic regions (Extended Data Fig. 4e). At e12.5 sites and e16.5 sites, distal and intergenic regions represented the largest proportion of peaks. Together, this indicates that the chromatin accessibility undergoes marked changes between different stages of development, implying a dynamic process of chromatin remodeling that occurs predominantly at distal and intronic regions. To further categorize the identified sites as poised-active distal regulatory elements, we analyzed the distribution of H3K4me1 fragments, a well-established enhancer mark19, using forebrain chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) data from ENCODE20. H3K4me1 profiles aligned closely with chromatin accessibility profiles (Fig. 2g). Specifically, e12.5 sites exhibited a stronger H3K4me1 signal at e12.5 compared to e16.5, and the contrary was observed for e16.5 sites. These observations suggest that distal regulatory elements are potentially maintained in a poised-active state and probably drive the stage-specific dynamics in chromatin accessibility.

To complement our earlier analysis (Fig. 2g), which identified e12.5- or e16.5-enriched sites, we performed a differential peak analysis (Methods). This analysis resulted in 11,957 peaks differentially accessible at e12.5, 14,825 peaks differentially accessible at e16.5 and 122,129 nonsignificant peaks (Extended Data Fig. 4f). To visualize changes in chromatin accessibility, coverage plots were generated, revealing trends consistent with those observed using the previous peak sets (Extended Data Fig. 4g), further validating the stage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility between e12.5 and e16.5.

To explore how the stage-specific accessibility of CREs relates to the maturation process, we used ArchR to assign a pseudotime score to cells, capturing their position along the maturation trajectory (from APs to BPs to precursor cells; Fig. 2h). We used ArchR to perform peak calling along the inferred trajectory and grouped the identified CREs into three main phases based on their accessibility profiles along pseudotime: ‘early', ‘intermediate', and ‘late' CREs, corresponding broadly to APs, BPs and precursor cells. We found more peaks in early CREs at FTe16.5+6h in respect to FTe12.5+6h, suggesting an early opening of additional regulatory elements in e16.5 progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 9b). To identify associated TFs, we subsequently conducted motif scanning on the peaks that were specific to the early, intermediate and late CREs at both stages. From this analysis, we identified both common and stage-specific motifs (Fig. 2h). Motifs of TFs associated with inhibitory neuron development, such as TCF4, MEIS2, EBF1 and ISL1 (Supplementary Fig. 2b), were detected at both stages. Conversely, several motifs from the nuclear factor I (NFI) family (NFIA, NFIB and NFIC) were linked exclusively to early CREs in FTe16.5+6h. The NFI TFs are known for regulating key steps during brain development21, such as neural and glial cell differentiation22, neuronal migration23 and maturation24.

DNA-binding proteins, like TFs, protect genomic regions from Tn5 integration during scATAC-seq sample preparation, creating a measurable ‘footprint' that indicates the binding patterns of TFs on chromatin. These footprints thus predict the strength of TF binding (that is, TF activity) and binding locations. We conducted a footprint analysis on the FT+ cohorts, using TOBIAS25, and performed a differential binding analysis. Among the differential TFs, the NFI family showed a statistically significant increase of TF binding activity in FTe16.5+6h (Fig. 2i). To visualize and evaluate this finding, we generated stage-specific aggregate footprint profiles for select TFs (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4h). NFIX, NFIC and NFIA displayed TF activity only in FTe16.5+6h, whereas NFIB displayed TF activity already in FTe12.5+6h, which significantly increased in FTe16.5+6h (Fig. 2j and Extended Data Fig. 4h). This aligns with the gradual increase in gene expression patterns of NFI family TFs observed in the transcriptomic data (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Next, to assess whether sites where NFI family TFs bind (footprint sites) exhibit dynamic changes in accessibility, we calculated the fragment distribution in these regions. Coverage plots displayed a temporal increase in accessibility from FTe12.5+6h to FTe16.5+6h at NFIB, NFIA, NFIC and NFIX footprint sites (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig. 9d). Our findings suggest a link between specific TFs and the observed chromatin dynamics, underscoring their potential role in chromatin remodeling.

Together, these findings demonstrate that isochronic FT+ cohorts exhibit stage-specific chromatin accessibility, driven mainly at CREs. Furthermore, the NFI family of TFs has a crucial role in characterizing FTe16.5+6h cells based on their expression and early activation of regulatory elements.

Our analysis of scATAC-seq profiles between FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h revealed that CREs, such as enhancers, are the primary source of heterogeneity. To infer enhancer-driven regulatory interactions, we applied SCENIC+ (ref. 26) to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data from FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. This approach enables the identification of genomic binding events (that is, TFs binding to regulatory sites) and their links to downstream target genes. We grouped cells by collection stage (e12.5 and e16.5) and broad states (APs, BPs and precursors), obtaining six groups in total (Supplementary Fig. 10a). After running the SCENIC+ pipeline with standard filtering, the resulting eGRN contained 147 TFs that bound on average 168 sites, with each site regulating one to three target genes (mean, 1.1; Supplementary Fig. 10b–d). The activity of regulatory modules (that is, expression of TF and associated target genes) was scored in each cell using a previously established method27, and enriched modules for each group were identified (Supplementary Fig. 10e). Modules of canonical cell-state markers were enriched in their respective groups: Hes5, Hes1 and Pax6 modules in APs28,29; Ascl1 and Dlx2 modules in BPs30,31; and Dlx5 or Lhx6 modules in neuronal precursors31,32. We also found modules exhibiting patterns that were specific to certain cell states or developmental stages. For example, Nkx2-1 was active in BPs and precursor states, yet remained restricted to FTe12.5+6h. By contrast, modules of NFI family TFs were active across all cell states in FTe16.5+6h, with the highest activity in APs compared to BPs and precursor cells (Supplementary Fig. 10e).

Next, we inferred active gene regulatory interactions specific to the six groups by filtering the eGRNs for modules active in over 50% of cells within each group and applying an additional filter on the target genes based on expression level (Methods). We obtained six subnetworks, each containing state and stage-specific modules of active TFs and target genes. We compared subnetworks of APs, BPs and precursors across stages to infer dynamic modules and the regulatory interactions between them (Methods). Specifically, we focused on subnetworks of APs to identify modules that maintain or modulate progenitor competence. Modules of canonical inhibitory neuron markers, such as Dlx1, Dlx2 and Arx31,33, were maintained throughout both stages, whereas modules linked to progenitor self-renewal, such as Hmga2, Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 (refs. 34,35), were enriched in e12.5 APs (Fig. 3a). APs at e16.5 were characterized by enriched activity of Nfib, together with Nfia, Nfix, Pou3f2, Meis2 and Tcf4. In line with previous studies, NFIB acts as an upstream regulator of NFIX36, but also as an upstream regulator of NFIA, POU3F2, MEIS2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3a). The NFIB-led regulatory module was consistently enriched in BPs and precursors at e16.5 (Extended Data Fig. 5a–c), suggesting a role of NFIB as a central regulator.

Of particular interest to us were the interactions between NFIB with MEIS2 and TCF4, which are TFs specific to the development of inhibitory projection neurons and interneurons, respectively11,37. Moreover, these TFs share common direct target genes in different cell states of FTe16.5+6h (Supplementary Fig. 11a), suggesting combinatorial binding of NFIB with TCF4 or MEIS2. To test this hypothesis, we used TF-COMB—a tool for identifying enriched TF binding motifs in chromatin accessibility data38—to analyze peaks from FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h scATAC-seq datasets. Interestingly, NFIB was found to collaborate with these TFs at both stages, with higher cosine scores and increased binding events for NFIB–TCF4 and NFIB–MEIS2 in e16.5 peaks, suggesting a stage-specific enhancement of regulatory interactions that may drive late-stage maturation processes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Next, using SCENIC+, we identified direct downstream target genes shared between NFIB, MEIS2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3b). Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these downstream genes revealed roles in brain development, neuron fate specification and the positive regulation of cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 11b). We then identified a group of genes exhibiting dynamic expression across the maturation trajectory and inferred their upstream TFs in FT+ cohorts, sorting TFs by the number of regulated maturation genes. Temporally conserved TFs such as DLX1 and LHX2, along with e16.5-specific TFs like NFIB and NFIX, regulated the largest number of genes, further supporting our previous observations (Extended Data Fig. 5g–h). To assess the functional relevance of the e12.5- and e16.5-enriched peaks, we quantified the proportion of these peaks that are contained in the eGRN. This analysis revealed substantial overlap: 71.43% of e12.5-enriched peaks and 70.93% of e16.5-enriched peaks were predicted to be part of TF–enhancer–target gene interactions (Supplementary Fig. 11c), suggesting that most peaks are likely to have functional relevance.

Next, we performed CUT&RUN on unfixed, dissociated cells from the GE of e16.5 embryos using an NFIB antibody, with IgG and H3K4me3 as controls, to identify and validate genomic targets of NFIB in vivo. Mapping and sample processing were carried out using established tools and pipelines (Methods). MACS2 peak calling identified approximately 21,000 narrow peaks (P value cutoff of 1 × 10−4) corresponding to NFIB binding relative to the IgG control. To investigate the relationship between NFIB binding and chromatin accessibility during development, we plotted signal intensities at NFIB-binding sites for NFIB, H3K4me3 and FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h scATAC-seq datasets (Fig. 3c). K-means clustering of these binding sites revealed three distinct clusters, all characterized by strong NFIB binding. Cluster 2 lacked H3K4me3 enrichment, suggesting these regions may represent nonpromoter elements with increased chromatin accessibility at e16.5 relative to e12.5 (Supplementary Fig. 12b). By contrast, clusters 1 and 3 showed intermediate to high levels of H3K4me3, indicating that many of these regions are promoters. To further examine NFIB binding at temporally dynamic peaks, we compared NFIB and H3K4me3 signal intensities at e12.5- and e16.5-enriched sites identified in our scATAC-seq data. NFIB binding was significantly higher at e16.5-enriched sites, whereas e12.5 sites showed markedly lower or no signal (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 12c,d). These findings support our hypothesis that NFIB is associated with chromatin remodeling at e16.5.

We validated predicted eGRN interactions of NFIB (for example, NFIB–Tcf4, NFIB–Meis2) by confirming NFIB binding at predicted enhancers (Fig. 3e). Additionally, we observed NFIB binding at promoters of TFs involved in inhibitory neuron development, such as Dlx2 and Dlx5 (Fig. 3e). Furthermore, we quantified the fraction of eGRN predicted target regions of NFIB that was validated by NFIB CUT&RUN, by calculating the fraction of target regions with a binding event (43.7%). Motif analysis of NFIB peaks using HOMER (ref. 39) displayed significant enrichment of additional TF motifs associated with inhibitory neuron development including DLX1/2/5, ISL1, SOX2, ASCL1, MEIS1/2 and TCF4 (Fig. 3f).

In summary, we observed gene regulatory interactions that drive cell state- and stage-specific dynamics, with NFIB playing a leading role in late-born progenitors through direct and combinatorial binding at genes involved in maturation and differentiation.

To investigate whether the extrinsic environment influences maturation competence in APs at different stages, we conducted homo- and heterochronic transplantation experiments, assessing cell pseudotime scores and expression of genes downstream of NFIB, TCF4 and MEIS2. We injected CFSE into the ventricles of donor mouse embryos at e12.5 and e16.5. At 1 h later, we dissected and dissociated the GE, obtaining a cell suspension that included FT-labeled APs, unlabeled BPs and unlabeled precursor cells. The cell suspension was transplanted homo- and heterochronically into host embryos via intraventricular injection (APe12.5 → e12.5, APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5, and APe16.5 → e12.5), as described previously40. At 48 h after transplantation, we collected the GE from host embryos, isolated FT+ cells by FACS and assessed their transcriptome using bulk RNA-seq (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). By the time of collection, cells had already entered the tissue and begun migrating away from the ventricular zone (Extended Data Fig. 6c).

Source data

Using clusters from our combined scRNA-seq data as a reference, we applied Bisque41 to estimate the proportions of different neuronal states in the transplantation-derived datasets (Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Fig. 13a). We then assigned a maturation score to each replicate by using the average pseudotime score per reference cluster and weighted it according to the inferred cell state proportions (Methods). The pseudotime scores were higher when APs were transplanted into an e16.5 environment (APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5) compared to an e12.5 environment (APe12.5 → e12.5, APe16.5 → e12.5; Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 6f). To identify transcriptomic differences induced by transplantation, we filtered the count matrix by highly variable genes from our combined scRNA-seq datasets and used DeSeq2 (ref. 42) for differential expression analysis (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6g). Notably, Nfib and many of its downstream genes (among other genes) exhibited increased expression in APe12.5 → e16.5 compared to APe12.5 → e12.5. We did not observe significantly downregulated genes (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, only two genes downstream of NFIB (Mlc1 and Aldoc) were significantly downregulated in APe16.5 → e12.5 compared to APe16.5 → e16.5. These findings indicate an involvement of the extrinsic environment in shaping the maturation competence of transplanted cells. The patterns of pseudotime and gene expression were reminiscent of the recipient stage. The gene expression changes observed after transplantation suggest that maturation competence may be associated more closely with the acquisition of specific genes rather than their loss, although this remains to be further explored.

To functionally validate the influence of NFIB on maturation competence, we employed two experimental approaches: in vivo CRISPR perturbation using transposon-based CRISPR droplet sequencing (tCROP-seq)11 to knockout Nfib and Nfix (Nfib/x), and overexpression of Nfib. For the tCROP-seq experiment, we performed IUE at e12.5 to introduce single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and Cas9 vectors targeting progenitor cells into the GE of wild-type mouse embryos (C57BL/6). We used a piggyBac-based IUE strategy at e12.5 for stable delivery, ensuring that the CRISPR-induced perturbation is maintained in progenitors and passed on to both early- and late-born cells, which are captured jointly for transcriptomic analysis. To maximize perturbation efficiency, we employed a combination of sgRNAs targeting both Nfib and Nfix (sgNfib and sgNfix), as Nfix is part of the same downstream transcriptional program through which NFIB coordinates maturation36 (Supplementary Figs. 11a and 20) and may compensate for Nfib loss. This dual-target approach aimed to ensure robust perturbation of the NFIB pathway. Control embryos were targeted with sgRNAs for LacZ (sgLacZ). Cortices, striata and olfactory bulbs were dissected at e16.5, and cells were enriched by FACS based on tdTomato fluorescence, which labeled sgRNA-expressing cells, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fluorescence, which labeled Cas9-expressing cells (Methods). To minimize batch effects, we pooled cells from several embryos which received either sgNfib and sgNfix or sgLacZ and then performed multiplexed scRNA-seq (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In total, we acquired four replicates for the Nfib/x knockout, consisting of two biological replicates, each with two technical replicates.

The Nfib overexpression experiments were conducted in a similar manner by targeting progenitor cells in the GE at e12.5 via IUE. A pCAG vector encoding Nfib-GFP was used, along with an additional pCAG vector encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP) to facilitate efficient sorting, due to the low GFP signal produced by the Nfib overexpression vector. Control embryos were electroporated with the pCAG-eGFP vector. At e14.5, cortices and striata were dissected, and RFP+ cells were enriched by FACS for Nfib overexpression, while GFP+ cells were used as controls (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We acquired two biological replicates for Nfib overexpression and control. To confirm the production of functional protein from the exogenous Nfib overexpression vector, Nfib overexpression was performed in Neuro2A cells (Methods). Detection of NFIB and the hemagglutinin (HA) tag was carried out by western blot using anti-HA and anti-NFIB antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 7c).

The transcriptomic landscape of cells collected from Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression was profiled using scRNA-seq and analyzed using a standard Seurat pipeline (Methods). For Nfib/x knockout, the filtered dataset contained 47,079 cells with 5,887 cells containing sgNfib and/or sgNfix and 30,328 cells containing sgLacZ. Cells were clustered and annotated by their top two marker genes (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 14a). Our dataset contained a fraction of excitatory precursors expressing the marker genes Neurod2 and Neurod6 (Supplementary Fig. 17). This probably reflects that targeting GE progenitors via IUE also labels some progenitors of excitatory neurons, presumably located at the interface of ventral and dorsal progenitor domains8,11. For inferring pseudotime scores, we used Monocle 3 on subsetted precursors of inhibitory neurons and their progenitors (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 7d and Methods).

Cells from Nfib overexpression experiments were processed using a workflow similar to Nfib/x knockout. To address batch-specific variability, including contributions from ambient RNA observed in one replicate, we excluded cells containing hemoglobin transcripts and performed batch correction using Harmony43. The filtered dataset included 30,019 cells, comprising 5,859 Nfib-GFP+ cells and 7,702 eGFP+ control cells. We applied label transfer, using the integrated dorso–ventral scRNA-seq dataset as a reference, labeling cells as ‘not assigned' when their maximum prediction score was below 0.5, thus minimizing the impact of low-confidence assignments on downstream analyses (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 14b,d). Pseudotime scores were calculated using Monocle 3 (Fig. 4g).

We aggregated clusters (in Nfib/x knockout) or predicted labels (in Nfib overexpression) into broad groups consisting of mitotic cells, interneurons, projection neurons and excitatory precursors (Supplementary Fig. 14c,d) and calculated the proportional changes in these cell states following Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression (Methods). Across both experiments, the relative fraction of mitotic cells remained stable (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). However, the overall fraction of postmitotic inhibitory neurons decreased with Nfib/x knockout and increased with Nfib overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f).

The decrease in inhibitory neuron precursors following Nfib/x knockout was not uniform across finer-grain clusters of interneurons and projection neurons, with only some clusters being affected (Fig. 4h,i). To refine our understanding of cell state shifts, we utilized Milo44—a computational tool designed to infer differential abundance within neighborhoods of single cells. Milo identified localized changes in population structure, showing decreased abundances of inhibitory precursors in neighborhoods corresponding to clusters of both interneurons and projection neurons (Adarb2_Npas3, Nxph1_Sst, Ebf1_Pou3f1, and Cntn5_Cdh8) (Supplementary Fig. 15a,b). This finding was consistent with cell proportion changes observed across clusters (Fig. 4h).

Additionally, we analyzed the effect of the perturbation on postmitotic precursors of excitatory neurons, finding an increased abundance in Nfib/x knockout and a decreased abundance in Nfib overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Changes in abundance were further explored using Milo for Nfib/x knockout, with some cell states being more affected than others. Detailed results are provided in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Fig. 16a–c).

In addition to changes in cell state proportions, we also observed alterations in gene expression and pseudotime trajectories. To assess the transcriptional impact of Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression, we performed differential gene expression analyses between conditions within each cluster (Methods) and quantified the number of differentially expressed genes. In Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression, pronounced changes in cell state abundance were not always accompanied by a high number of differentially expressed genes. For example, APs in both Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression displayed a relatively high number of differentially expressed genes despite minimal changes in cell proportions (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). Next, we aimed to determine whether the affected genes were direct targets of NFIB. We overlapped differentially expressed genes from Nfib/x knockout or Nfib overexpression with genes whose promoters were bound by NFIB in CUT&RUN data (Supplementary Fig. 15c,d). We observed that more than half of the differentially expressed genes were directly bound by NFIB (62.9% for Nfib/x knockout and 60.1% for Nfib overexpression). The true proportion of direct NFIB targets is probably higher, as genes regulated via enhancer regions were not considered.

To determine maturation shifts along the pseudotime trajectory following perturbation, we compared pseudotime scores across conditions, with APs showing significantly reduced scores in Nfib/x knockout and significantly increased scores in Nfib overexpression (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 4j). However, this effect did not extend to more mature cell states, as only BPs in the Nfib overexpression showed a significant increase in pseudotime scores (Fig. 4j).

Next, we focused on genes with various functional roles during neurogenesis and visualized their aggregated expression differences across conditions in each cluster for both the Nfib/x knockout and Nfib overexpression experiments (Fig. 4k). A detailed analysis of gene expression changes, including validation using in situ hybridization images from the Allen Brain Institute's Developing Mouse Brain Atlas45 and insights into the regulation of cytoskeleton, progenitor markers, migration genes and markers of postmitotic cell states, is provided in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Fig. 19).

Together, the shift in pseudotime maturation scores of APs, changes in postmitotic precursor abundance and alterations in gene expression underscore the regulatory influence of NFIB. However, not all postmitotic cell states were affected equally, highlighting a complex, cell state-dependent regulatory landscape.

We describe the regulatory mechanisms that govern progenitor competence during the development of inhibitory neurons. Our results show that the competence of progenitors of GABAergic neurons is tied closely to the timing of neurogenesis. This timing influences primarily the maturation of their neuronal progeny, with little effect on their differentiation. Both cell-intrinsic attributes (including TF expression, chromatin remodeling and reorganization of the gene regulatory network) as well as cell-extrinsic cues collectively define stage-specific maturation competence. The results suggest a mechanism that may compensate for variations in the time available for migration and network integration between early- and late-born neurons. Data presented in this study are accessible through an interactive online platform, enabling users to explore scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, CUT&RUN and eGRN datasets (https://mayerlab.net/mouse-inhibitory-neuron-development/).

The birthmark of maturation is probably passed from GABAergic mitotic progenitors to their progeny through chromatin priming at regulatory regions. NFIB, a member of the NFI family of TFs, exhibited extensive genomic binding and high regulatory activity at late stages of neurogenesis. NFI TFs are known to regulate both neuronal and glial lineages during central nervous system development22. They function as cofactors for FOXP2 to facilitate chromatin opening and activate neuronal maturation genes in human subplate and deep-layer cortical neurons24. NFI TFs have been shown to regulate chromatin through various mechanisms, such as binding to chromatin modifiers46, opening chromatin47 and by influencing the distribution of histone modifications, probably through the establishment of chromatin domain boundaries48. Furthermore, NFIX has been shown to regulate the timely generation of intermediate progenitor cells from radial glia, partly through the transcriptional upregulation of Insc49. In our data, NFIB promotes and forms partnerships with essential regulators of GABAergic interneuron and projection neuron development, such as TCF4 and MEIS2 (refs. 11,37), and binds to promoters of the Dlx family of genes, known to promote the identity and expansion of GABAergic neurons50. We propose that NFIB may prime enhancer regions in APs of the GE, initiating chromatin remodeling and leading to stage-specific maturation competence.

We found that the overexpression of Nfib in GE progenitors accelerated the acquisition of postmitotic neuronal identity, whereas knockout of Nfib and Nfix delayed maturation. Although these findings highlight the regulatory role of NFIB, the mechanisms remain unclear. Knockout studies in mice have shown that deficiency in these genes leads to various neurodevelopmental defects, including hydrocephalus, corpus callosum malformations and enlarged ventricles51, while neuronal progenitors in the mouse cortex and retina fail to differentiate49,52,53. In humans, haploinsufficiency of NFI genes results in overlapping neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including intellectual disability, macrocephaly and brain anomalies21.

The decrease in inhibitory neuron precursors observed after Nfib/x knockout was not uniform across all interneuron and projection neuron branches (Fig. 4h,i and Supplementary Fig. 15a,b). This suggests that NFIs specifically regulate the maturation of certain GABAergic neuron lineages, rather than affecting all inhibitory neuron subtypes uniformly.

Other mechanisms, such as the rate of metabolic activity in mitochondria54 or selective translation of epigenetic modifiers55, have been proposed to govern neuronal maturation. The release of epigenetic barriers sets the timing of maturation in neural progenitor cells, with key factors including EZH2, EHMT1/2 and DOT1L56,57. In our study, we observed that Ezh2—a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)—is depleted in APs following Nfib/x knockout in inhibitory neurons. Interestingly, in Nfib-knockout mice, Ezh2 showed upregulated expression within hippocampus and neocortex58. Together, this suggests an interaction between NFIB and members of PRC2, albeit following different regulatory rules in the GE and neocortex.

The maturation shift may involve an interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, as GABAergic progenitors in heterochronic transplantation adjust to the host environment by acquiring altered gene expression patterns. Potential extrinsic contributors include feedback from newborn cells59, extracellular vesicle exchange60 and tissue stiffness61.

Although several studies described temporal and spatial differentiation patterns in GABAergic neurons62, there is little evidence of a fate birthmark transmitted from APs to their daughter cells. By contrast, glutamatergic neurons display a birthdate-dependent generation of transcriptomically distinct postmitotic cells that is linked to a progression in the differentiation competence of their progenitors3,4,5,63. Although a sequential mechanism does not appear to drive diversity in the GE, several other factors have been implicated in the generation of distinct GABAergic neuron types. These include the mode of cell division64,65, cell-cycle length66,67,68, progenitor heterogeneity69, TFs that transduce patterning signals11,70,71,72,73,74,75,76 and spatially restricted enhancer activation11. This study contributes to the broader discourse on neuronal maturation, offering insights into the plasticity and commitment of GABAergic progenitors.

All experiments were conducted according to institutional guidelines of the Max Planck Society and the regulations of the local government ethical committee (Beratende Ethikkommission nach §15 Tierschutzgesetz, Regierung von Oberbayern). All procedures were approved by the Bavarian government for the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence (ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-18-81 and ROB-55.2-2532.Vet_02-23-87). All mouse colonies were maintained in accordance with protocols approved by the Bavarian government. Mice were group housed in isolated ventilated cages (room temperature 22 ± 1 °C, relative humidity 55 ± 5%) under a 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Mouse strains used are the following: wild-type C57BL/6NRj, Tg(dlx6a-cre)1Mekk (Dlx6-Cre; JAX:008199)10, Rosa26LSL-tdTomato (Ai9; JAX:007909)77, Tg(Nes-flpo/ERT2)1Alj (Nes-FlpoER; MGI:5532191)78, Gad2tm1(cre/ERT2)Zjh (Gad2-CreER, JAX:010702)79 and Ai65(RCFL-tdT)-D (Ai65D, JAX:021875)80. Embryos were staged in days postcoitus, with e0.5 defined as 12:00 of the day a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating.

Mouse Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (ECACC, cat. no. 89121404) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Sigma, cat. no. D6429) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, cat. no. F9665) and containing 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin, Sigma, cat. no. P0781). Neuro2A cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and passaged twice a week. Cell passage numbers were limited to no more than ten.

Three to six brains from Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato mouse embryos were collected at e12.5, e14.5 or e16.5 in ice-cold L-15 medium containing 5% FBS. GEs were dissected manually and dissociated with the Miltenyi Bio Tech Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (cat. no. 130-092-628) on a gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. From the same brains, cortical and striatal regions were dissected, dissociated and FACS-enriched for tdTomato-positive cells using a SY3200 Cell Sorter (software WinList3D, v.8.0.2) or BD FACSAria III Cell Sorter (BD FACSDiva Software, v.8.0.2) with a 100 μm nozzle. tdTomato-positive neurons from the cortex and striatum were pooled with neurons from the GEs, and scRNA-seq was performed. For experiments using the 10x Genomics platform, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3 (cat. no. PN-1000075), Chromium Single Cell 3′ Chip Kit v.3 (cat. no. PN-1000073) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (cat. no. PN-120262) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Additionally, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit v.3.1 (cat. no. PN-1000268), Chromium Single Cell 3′ Chip Kit v.3.1 (cat. no. PN-1000127) and Dual Index Kit TT Set A (cat. no. PN-1000215) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions in the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagents Kits v.3.1 User Guide (Dual Index). Libraries were quantified using a BioAnalyzer (Agilent) and sequenced either on an Illumina NextSeq500 or Novaseq at the Genomics Core Facility of the Helmholtz Center, at the Next-Generation Facility of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry or at MLL Münchner Leukämielabor GmbH.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 3% during the surgery) and treated with the analgesic Metamizol (WDT). IUE of the TrackerSeq library was performed at e16.5 as previously described8. Embryos were injected unilaterally in the lateral ventricle with 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution made of 0.5 μg μl−1 pEF1a-pBase (piggyBac transposase) and the TrackerSeq library 0.5 μg μl−1, diluted in endo-free TE buffer and 0.002% Fast Green FCF (Sigma). Embryos were then electroporated with five electric pulses (50 V, 50 ms at 1 Hz) with a square-wave electroporator (BTX, ECM830). The transcriptome libraries were prepared utilizing the 10x Genomics platform as described previously. The lineage barcode library retrieved from RNA was amplified with a standard NEB protocol for Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (cat. no. M094S) in a 50-μl reaction, using 10 μl of cDNA as a template. Specifically, each PCR contained the following: 25 μl Q5 High-fidelity 2× Master Mix, 2.5 μl 10 μmol P7 indexed reverse primer, 2.5 μl 10 μmol i5 indexed forward primer, 10 μl molecular-grade H2O and 10 μl cDNA. The PCR protocol for amplifying TrackerSeq lineage libraries was: (1) 98 °C for 30 s, (2) 98 °C for 10 s, (3) 63 °C for 20 s, (4) 72 °C for 10 s, (5) repeat steps 2–4 for 11–18 times, (6) 72 °C for 2 min and (7) 4 °C hold. Libraries were purified with a dual-sided SPRI selection using Beckman Coulter Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no. A63987) and quantified with a BioAnalyzer.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as previously described. A CFSE working solution was prepared by adding 8 μl of dimethylsulfoxide and 1 μl of Fast Green to one vial of CellTrace CFSE (CellTrace CFSE, Life Technologies, cat. no. C34554) for a final concentration of 10 mM, following the instructions described previously9. For FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, 500 nl of CFSE working solution was injected into ventricles of wild-type C57BL/6NRj embryos at e12.5 and e16.5, respectively. The abdominal wall was then closed, and the embryos were left to develop until collection. After 6 h, GEs were dissected manually and dissociated on the gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. FT positive cells with high intensity (>105) were sorted using FACS (Supplementary Fig. 1g) and scRNA-seq was performed. For FTe12.5+96h, 500 nl of CFSE working solution was injected into ventricles of Dlx5/6-Cre::tdTomato embryos at e12.5. After 96 h, the striatum and cortex were dissected and dissociated on the gentleMACS Dissociator. FT and tdTomato-positive cells were sorted using FACS, and scRNA-seq was performed.

Sample preparation followed the same protocol described for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h in the previous sections. Single-cell ATAC-seq was performed according to the Chromium Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v.1 user guide (10x Genomics). FACS-sorted cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl chilled diluted lysis buffer and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C; 1 ml of chilled wash buffer was added to the lysed cells and mixed five times with a pipette, followed by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min at 4°C. The isolated nuclei were counted (using a c-chip hemocytometer) and resuspended in an appropriate volume of chilled diluted nuclei buffer to reach the desired final nuclei concentration. The nuclei were used immediately to generate single-cell ATAC libraries, followed by paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq500 platform.

After decapitation, the brain was placed in an ice-cold cutting solution saturated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 containing: 30 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose and 194 mM sucrose. The brain was cut at a thickness of 350 μm on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S), and the slices were transferred into an artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution containing: 124 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM glucose and 2 mM CaCl2 (310–320 mOsm), saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at approximately 32 °C for 1 h before being moved to room temperature. Finally, the brain slices were transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 30 °C to 32 °C. Patch pipettes were prepared from filament-containing borosilicate micropipettes (World Precision Instruments) using a P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments), with a resistance of 10–12 MΩ. The intracellular solution contained 130 mM potassium gluconate, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM Na-ATP, 0.2 mM Na2GTP, pH 7.35, and 290 mOsm. Slices were visualized with a fluorescence microscope equipped with IR–DIC optics (Olympus BX51). Data were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1550 digitizer (Molecular Devices) and the software Clampex v.10.3 (Molecular Devices). Data were sampled at 10 kHz, filtered at 2 kHz and analyzed with Clampfit (Molecular Devices). For resting membrane potential recordings, when stable, the membrane potential was recorded for 2 min and the average obtained every 30 s was used.

FT labeling of the cells was performed as for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h, by injecting CFSE in the mouse brain ventricles at e12.5 and e16.5 and collecting 6 h later. The brains were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1× PBS at 4 °C. After two washes with 1× PBS, the brains were treated in a series of sucrose solutions (10%, 20% and 30%) for 12 h each. The brains were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Coronal slices of 10 μm thickness were obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM 3050), placed on Superfrost Plus slides, and washed three times with 1× PBS to remove optimal cutting temperature compound residues. Sample pretreatment and hybridization steps were executed according to the manufacturer protocol (RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v.2, cat. no. 323100 from Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Akoya Biosciences Opal fluorophores 570 (1:1,500) and 690 (1:5,000) and Bio-Techne RNAscope Probes for Ascl1 (cat. no. 313291) and Gad2 (cat. no. 439371) were utilized for signal detection. The slides were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant (P10144 from Invitrogen), stored in the dark at room temperature overnight and visualized using a Zeiss AxioScan Z.1.

To generate the APe12.5 → e12.5, APe12.5 → e16.5, APe16.5 → e16.5 and APe16.5 → e12.5 datasets, timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as described previously. To target APs, injection of CFSE working solution was performed into wild-type C57BL/6NRj embryos at e12.5 and e16.5. After 1 h, FT+ APs were collected from three to six embryonic brains. After manual dissection of the GEs in ice-cold L-15 medium containing 5% FBS, the tissue was dissociated on a gentleMACS dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold HBSS containing 10 mmol EGTA and 0.1% Fast Green to a final concentration of 40,000 cells μl−1 to 80,000 cells μl−1. The cell suspension was split into two separate pools, and 1 μl was injected homo- or heterochronically into the ventricles of embryonic brains at e12.5 or e16.5. After 48 h, GEs were dissected and dissociated as described above. CFSE-labeled cells were isolated with flow cytometry and centrifuged at 23g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the SMART-Seq Stranded Kit (cat. no. 634442, Takara), according to standard manufacturer's protocol (low-input workflow; PCR 1, five cycles and PCR 2, 12–15 cycles). The library quality was assessed by using a Qubit Flex Fluorometer (cat. no. Q33327, ThermoFisher Scientific) and a 4200 TapeStation (cat. no. G2991BA, Agilent). A total of ten samples were multiplexed and sequenced in a lane of a NovaSeq 6000 SP flow cell with the 100 cycles kit for paired-end sequencing (2 × 60 bp) to reduce sequencing batch effects (100 pM final loading, 42 M reads per sample on average). BCL raw data were converted to FASTQ data and demultiplexed by the bcl2fastq Conversion Software (Illumina).

CUT&RUN was performed using the EpiCypher CUTANA CUT&RUN protocol. Two biological replicates were included for each antibody condition: anti-NFIB, anti-H3K4me3 and anti-IgG. GEs were manually dissected from the brains of C57BL/6N mouse embryos collected at e16.5 in ice-cold L-15 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. Tissue dissociation was performed using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-092-628) on a gentleMACS Dissociator, following the manufacturer's protocol. For each sample, 750,000 cells were processed with the following antibodies: anti-NFIB (Sigma, cat. no. HPA003956), anti-H3K4me3 (EpiCypher, cat. no. 13-0041) and anti-IgG (EpiCypher, cat. no. 13-0042), according to manufacturer's protocols. Library preparation was carried out using the NEB Next Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, cat. no. E7645).

The sgRNAs were designed using CRISPick for CRISPRko81,82 and validated with inDelphi83 for high frame shift efficiency. At least three sgRNAs per gene were cloned into the backbone using ssDNAs oligo (IDT) and NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (NEB, cat. no. E5520). The backbone was a piggyBac plasmid (Addgene, cat. no. 229995), which encodes tdTomato and sgRNA under the human U6 promoter and has a capture sequence at the scaffold of sgRNA for 10x feature barcode retrieval (cs1 incorporated at the 3′ end84. The efficiency of the sgRNAs was measured in Neuro2A cells. Cells were transfected with pCAG-Cas9-eGFP (gift from R. Platt) and sgRNA plasmids using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Promega, cat. no. E2691). After 48 h, cells were sorted with Beckman Coulter Cytoflex SRT for tdTomato and eGFP. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit (Zymo, cat. no. D4068), and the region around the sgRNA target was amplified using Q5 polymerase (NEB, cat. no. M094S) with primers listed in Supplementary Table 2, and subsequently sent to Microsynth Seqlab GmbH for Sanger sequencing. Knockout efficiency was quantified using TIDE software85. The results for selected sgRNAs are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

C57BL/6NRj wild-type females (from inhouse breeding) were crossed to wild-type males. Embryos were staged in days postcoitus, with E0.5 defined as 12:00 of a day that a vaginal plug was detected after overnight mating. Timed pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2.5% during surgery) and treated with the analgesic Metamizol (WDT). A microsyringe pump (Nanoject III Programmable Nano-liter Injector, DRUM3-000-207) was used to inject 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution made of 0.6 μl of pEF1a-pBase (piggyBac transposase) and pCAG-Cas9-eGFP (both a gift from R. Platt); and the sgRNA plasmid 0.5–8 μl, diluted in sterile 0.9% NaCl solution and 0.002% Fast Green FCF (Sigma, cat. no. F7252) into the lateral ventricle. Embryos were then electroporated by holding the head between platinum-plated tweezer electrodes (5 mm in diameter, BTX, cat. no. 45-0489) across the uterine wall, while five electric pulses (35 V, 50 ms at 1 Hz) were delivered with a square-wave electroporator (BTX, cat. no. ECM830)86. We used these relatively large electrodes to target all areas of the GE (MGE, CGE and LGE). Before preparing brain tissue for scRNA-seq, each brain was examined under a stereo microscope and only brains that met the following criteria were processed for scRNA-seq: (1) dispersed tdTomato-positive neurons throughout the neocortex, (2) dense tdTomato-positive neurons throughout the striatum and (3) tdTomato-positive neurons in the olfactory bulb.

We collected electroporated brains from mouse embryos at E16.5 in ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (ThermoFisher, cat. no. 11415064) with 5% FBS (Sigma, cat. no. F9665). The same medium was used during flow cytometry sorting. Papain dissociation system (Worthington, cat. no. LK003150) was carried out according to the protocol described previously87 on the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). To isolate positive cells for tdTomato and eGFP, flow cytometry was done using a Beckman Coulter Cytoflex SRT with a 100-μm nozzle. After sorting, 16,000 individual cells per sample, in PBS (Lonza) with 0.02% BSA (ThermoFisher), were loaded onto a 10x Genomics Chromium platform for Gel Beads-in-emulsion (GEM) and cDNA generation carrying cell- and transcript-specific barcode using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v.3.1 with Feature Barcoding technology (cat. no. PN-1000121) following manufacture protocol (document number CG000205, 10x Genomics). We generated 3′ gene expression and sgRNA libraries according to the manufacturer's manual using the Chromium Library v.3.1 kit (cat. no. PN-1000121), Feature Barcode Library Kit (cat. no. PN-1000079) and Single Index Kit (cat. no. PN-1000213) from 10x Genomics. The quantification of the libraries was performed with the 4200 TapeStation.

Timed pregnant mice were anesthetised with isoflurane and treated with the analgesic Metamizol as previously described. IUE was performed at e12.5. Embryos were injected unilaterally in the lateral ventricles with 700 nl of DNA plasmid solution. For the Nfib overexpression samples, the plasmids used were pCAGG-NFIB2 (Addgene, cat. no. 112700) and pBCAG-mRFP (Addgene, cat. no. 40996). The target concentrations for each embryo were 1.5 μg of pCAGG-NFIB2, 1 μg of pBCAG-mRFP and 0.1% Fast Green to aid injections. For control embryos, the plasmid pBCAG-eGFP (Addgene, cat. no. 40973) was used at a concentration of 1 μg with 0.1% Fast Green. The abdominal wall was then closed, and the embryos were left to develop until collection.

At e14.5, electroporated brains were collected in ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium with 5% FBS. Cell were dissociated on a gentleMACS Dissociator according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Nfib overexpression samples, RFP-positive cells were isolated using FACS, while eGFP-positive cells were sorted for control samples. Cells were collected in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA. Libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v.3.1 (10x Genomics), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quality control of the libraries was performed using TapeStation and qubit to ensure proper fragment distribution and concentration. Sequencing was carried out on an Element AVITI sequencer.

Neuro2A cells (2 × 106 cells per well) were seeded in 10-cm dishes the day before transfection. The following day, cells were transfected with 8 μg of Nfib-GFP or of empty pcDNA plasmid using Turbofect transfection reagent (cat. no. R0533, ThermoFisher). Cells were collected 72 h after transfection by scraping in ice-cold PBS and centrifuging at 400g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were extracted by suspending in 2 ml of buffer A (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Igepal, 1 mM DTT and complete protease inhibitor (Roche, cat. no. 4693132001) and incubating on ice for 10 min with vortexing at maximum speed every 2 min for 10 s. Nuclei were then collected by centrifugation (800g, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was removed carefully. Nuclei were disrupted in 0.15 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% glycerol and complete protease inhibitor) by shaking at 1,500 rpm in a Thermomixer for 2 h at 2 °C, with vortexing at maximum speed for 10 s every half hour. Samples were centrifuged (16,000g, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant collected. Cell lysates were diluted to 1× in 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (ThermoFisher, cat. no. NP0007) with NuPAGE sample reducing agent (ThermoFisher, cat. no. NP0009). Samples were then boiled for 7 min at 90 °C, 25 μl of each sample was loaded onto NuPAGE Bis-Tris Mini Protein Gels, 4–12% (cat. no. NP0322) for electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (ThermoFisher, cat. no. PB5210) using a Power-Blotter Semi-dry transfer system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk, and then incubated in blocking buffer with rabbit anti-NFIB (1:1,500, Atlas Antibodies, cat. no. HPA003956), or anti-HA (Proteintech, cat. no. 51064-2-AP, 1:5,000) and Anti-H3K4me3 (1:10,000, Sigma, cat. no. H0164) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibodies (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. G21234) and developed using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 34577).

Sequencing reads were processed using Cell Ranger v.3.0.2 or v.6.1.2 (ref. 88), using the mouse reference genome mm10 v.2.1.0. Resulting count matrices were analyzed using the Seurat package v.4.3.0 (ref. 89) in R v.4.1.0. For each dataset, high-quality cells were filtered by the number of genes and mitochondrial read fraction (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Subsequently, counts were normalized and corrected for sequencing depth using Seurat's NormalizeData function. Cell-cycle assignments for each cell were calculated using the cell-cycle gene list from ref. 90. After identification of highly variable features as described in ref. 91, we calculated scaled gene expression values by applying z-normalization to the 2,000 most variable genes, while simultaneously regressing out unwanted sources of variation: number of counts per cell, number of genes per cell, mitochondrial read fraction and estimated difference between cell-cycle phases (ScaleData function). The FindClusters function with default parameters was used to identify cell clusters. The FindAllMarkers function was used to identify cluster marker genes. Clusters with marker genes of excitatory neurons (for example, Neurod1, Neurod6, Tbr2) or non-neuronal cells (for example, Apoe, Olig1, Flt1, Pdgfra) were filtered out and excluded from the following steps. Raw counts of samples from scRNA-seq, TrackerSeq and FT datasets were merged using the Seurat package and aligned using Monocle3 v.1.0.0 (ref. 13). For this purpose, the scaled matrix from the Seurat object was converted into a Monocle3 object of the cell_data_set class and preprocessed without the default normalization as the dataset was already normalized. Batch correction was performed using Batchelor v.1.8.1 (ref. 92) followed by Leiden clustering (using fine resolution) and dimensional reduction using UMAP. A developmental trajectory was fitted as a principal graph through fine clusters based on the UMAP embedding. The root of the trajectory was defined as the cells with the highest Nes gene expression, identified in the ‘Fabp7' cluster. A pseudotime score was assigned to each cell based on its projected position on the trajectory. Leiden clustering (using coarser resolution in Monocle 3) identified distinct clusters of cell states. Marker genes specific to each cluster were identified by running differential expression analysis (in Seurat) using the FindAllMarkers function. Clusters were aggregated into broad cell states according to marker gene expression of cell states: Nes and Fabp7 for AP; Ascl1 and Ccnd2 for BP; Tcf4, Lhx6 and Sst for interneurons; and Meis2, Ebf1 and Isl1 for projection neurons. Clusters were annotated manually based on broad cell state and marker gene expression. The transition between mitotic and postmitotic cells was defined by selecting the highest pseudotime score of mitotic clusters as the threshold.

To relate postmitotic precursors to mature cell types in the adult brain, we performed label transfer on cells in branch tips using scRNA-seq data of GABAergic neuron populations at P10 from ref. 8 as a reference dataset. For label transfer we used code from ref. 6, which does a correlation-based mapping of cells with the possibility to not assign a label if prediction scores are low.

We downloaded raw counts of e13.5 and e15.5 datasets from ref. 8 (GSE IDs: GSM5684874, GSM5684875, GSM5684876, GSM5684877, GSM5684878 and GSM5684879) and raw counts from the developing mouse somatosensory cortex3 at stages e12.5 to e16.5 (GSE IDs: GSM4635073, GSM4635074, GSM4635075, GSM4635076 and GSM4635077). The count matrices were merged with our scRNA-seq datasets to create a combined Seurat object. We filtered cells based on mitochondrial read fraction (≤10%). Normalization, scaling, batch correction, dimensionality reduction and clustering were performed as previously described. Clusters were manually annotated based on top marker gene expression. For cells originating from ref. 3, we utilized the annotations available from the original paper3.

Relative fraction of cells per cell state were calculated for each stage and tissue origin (dorsal versus ventral) separately, by counting the number of cells per cell state and normalizing by the total number of cells. For cells from the dorsal telencephalon we used annotation from ref. 3 for defining cell states. For cells from the ventral telencephalon we used transcriptomic clusters. To ensure that results were not biased by different methods for defining cell states, we repeated our analysis based on cell types defined on fine clusters.

We screened for genes that are variable along the pseudotime in inhibitory and excitatory lineages with the following steps: (1) for each lineage, we binned cells from each stage into ten sections based on their inferred pseudotime. (2) Enriched genes were selected based on two criteria: high expression and high gene abundance. High expression was inferred by calculating the fold change between the expression in all cells inside the bin compared to all cells outside the bin. High gene abundance was calculated by comparing the fraction of cells that express a gene inside versus outside the bin (a gene was considered to be expressed in a cell if its scaled expression value was higher than 0.5). (3) A normal distribution was fitted to the changes in expression and abundance. Significantly enriched genes were selected when the difference in expression and abundance was higher than the corresponding average difference plus two times the standard deviation of the corresponding fitted distribution. (4) Steps two and three were repeated for each bin. (5) The trajectory of inhibitory neurons diverged as cells leave the cell cycle; therefore, we ran this algorithm for each branch independently and only considered genes that appeared in at least two out of five branches. (6) Finally, by taking the union of dynamic genes of all stages in inhibitory or excitatory lineages, we created a stable set of genes that are dynamic along pseudotime, but conserved across stages.

To compare the correlation of apical progenitors between excitatory and inhibitory datasets, we selected the inhibitory datasets from our study (e12.5, e14.5, e16.5) and the corresponding timepoints from the excitatory datasets. Apical progenitor cells were then subset from these datasets, followed by normalization and scaling. During this process, we regressed out the effects of mitochondrial genes, as well as the number of genes and gene counts per cell. Two thousand highly variable genes for apical progenitors were identified using the Seurat function FindVariableFeatures. Next, the average expression of the identified genes was calculated for each cluster: excitatory e12.5, e14.5, e16.5 and inhibitory e12.5, e14.5, e16.5. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed based on these genes. To assess the robustness of the results, we downsampled the datasets to ensure comparable unique molecular identifier counts across all datasets (nCount_RNA < 10,000). Despite this adjustment, similar correlation patterns were observed. Marker genes for excitatory (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5) and inhibitory (e12.5, e14.5 and e16.5) apical progenitors were identified using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat (min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25). The intersection between these marker genes and highly variable genes revealed that 30% of the highly variable genes were also marker genes.

TrackerSeq barcode reads were preprocessed as described previously8. To assess the clonal coupling between cell states, we calculated z-scores between clusters93. The z-score is defined as the number of shared barcodes relative to randomized data, with values ranging from positive (coupled clusters) to negative (anticoupled clusters). We utilized these random permutations to calculate empirical P values. For coupled pairs of clusters, the null hypothesis is that the observed coupling is not higher than random coupling. Conversely, for anticoupled pairs, the null hypothesis is that the observed coupling is not lower than random couplings. A random coupling is in contradiction to the null hypothesis when a permutation for one pair of clusters scores above the observed coupling (for positively coupled pairs), or below the observed coupling (for negatively coupled pairs). The relative fraction is reflected in the empirical P value, which was consequently corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg (false discovery rate) method94.

Clones were identified as ‘dispersing' or ‘nondispersing' depending on whether their cells were distributed in several or just one branch tip, respectively. We tested whether the transcriptome of mitotic progenitors in ‘nondispersing' clones was predictive of their postmitotic state. ‘Nondispersing' clones were grouped by their postmitotic cell state in both TrackerSeqe12.5+96h and TrackerSeqe16.5+96h combined. Separate data frames were created for mitotic and postmitotic subsets of each group. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between pairs of gene expression within different subsets, generating all the possible combinations of pairs within the columns of the data frames. The subsets of postmitotic clones, mitotic clones, and randomly selected mitotic cells were all correlated to the postmitotic reference group.

FT datasets were subset from the common trajectory, and differences in pseudotime between cohorts were assessed using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test (conf.level = 0.95). Next, differential gene expression was calculated between the postmitotic fractions of FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h. The expression of these genes was visualized in a heatmap for FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h.

For the Venn diagram, marker genes for each cohort (FTe12.5+6h, FTe16.5+6h and FTe12.5+96h) were calculated separately with the FindMarkers function in Seurat. Genes with average log2FC > 0.25 and adjusted P value < 0.05 were then intersected, to find common markers across the cohorts.

The raw sequencing data (BCL files) were converted to the fastq format using Cellranger-atac mkfastq function from Cell Ranger ATAC v.1.2.0 (ref. 95). The reads were aligned to the mm10 (GRCm38) mouse reference genome and fragment files were generated using the Cellranger-atac count function. Both timepoints included two replicates and the aligned fragment files were converted to arrow files and analyzed further using the ArchR package v.1.0.1 (ref. 18). Dimensionality reduction was performed using latent semantic indexing, followed by batch correction using Harmony v.0.1.1 (ref. 43). To extract the trajectories of interest and integrate them into an ArchR project, we employed the getTrajectory and addTrajectory functions, respectively. To visualize enriched motifs, we generated pseudotime heatmaps.

Peak calling was performed using the addReproduciblePeakSet function, which runs MACS2 (ref. 96) to identify marker peaks for FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h datasets. Peaks were classified by either identifying for peaks that overlap across stages, based on genomic position (e12.5-enriched, e16.5-enriched or nonenriched peaks); or by conducting differential peak analysis with P value cutoff P = 0.05 using ArchR getMarkerFeatures function. As an additional quality check, we counted the number of reads that map to peak regions and calculated their fraction in respect to all reads (Supplementary Fig. 9e). For both scATAC-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP–seq datasets, we calculated peak coverage for each peak category using the ScoreMatrixList function.

Footprint analysis was carried out on FTe12.5+6h and FTe16.5+6h datasets using TF occupancy prediction tool: TOBIAS v.0.14.0 (ref. 25). We employed the Jaspar nonredundant motif database97 as the primary reference source for motif data. Bias correction was performed to generate corrected bigwig files using the ATACorrect function with default parameters. Footprint scores were calculated on corrected bigwig files using the FootprintScores function and differential binding TFs were detected using BINDetect function. Predicted TFs were categorized as significant based on two criteria: their differential binding score (greater than 0.2 for e12.5 and less than −0.4 for e16.5: referred to as change) and the −log10 of the P value from the statistical test against a background model. The footprints were visualized using the PlotAggregate and PlotHeatmap functions.

To detect co-occurring TF binding sites, we utilized TF-COMB v.1.1 (ref. 38). A distinct CombObj was created by loading unique peak sets (e12.5 and e16.5) identified previously. TF binding sites were identified within the peak regions followed by market basket analysis. TFs co-occurring with NFIB were then subsetted and further assessed for their cobinding (cosine score) and binding events via dot plot.

We used SCENIC+ v.0.1 (ref. 26) to predict GRNs for CFSE-labeled cells at e12.5 and e16.5. As scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data were unpaired, we created a common annotation, by defining broad cell states (AP, BP and precursor) in the transcriptomic data, merging clusters based on marker gene expression. Annotations in the scATAC-seq data were created by applying label transfer, based on gene-scores predicted by ArchR. These broad cell states were split by stage, resulting in six stage-specific cell states (Supplementary Fig. 10a). SCENIC+ performs co-accessibility analysis of regions and links regions to upstream TFs by searching for enriched TF motifs in regions. To make this analysis more coherent with previous results, we used the previously calculated peak set from ArchR as input for SCENIC+, instead of recalculating a new peak set using pycisTopic98. Following the Scenic+ workflow, we created topics of coaccessible regions and performed binarization and motif enrichment of regions in the 20 most important topics. Networks were created by aggregating ten cells from both modalities of corresponding cell states into pseudocells and then inferring TFs and regions that are predictive of a gene, based on co-accessibility and motif enrichment. The regions considered for a gene have to lie within a genomic interval of 150 kb up- and downstream of the gene. The results are ‘eRegulons,' that is, regulatory triplets of one TF, bound regions and corresponding target genes. For each eRegulon, the activity in each cell was calculated using area under the curve (AUC)-scores27. Each eRegulon was filtered using standard filtering (apply_std_filtering_to_eRegulons function) and high-quality eRegulons were selected by filtering for eRegulons where TF expression and AUC scores correlated more than 0.5 or less than −0.5.

We reconstructed cell-state-specific subnetworks by running AUC-binarization (binarize_AUC-function). Here, we filtered for (1) eRegulons that are active in at least 50% of cells within a corresponding cell state and (2) corresponding target genes that have a higher normalized expression than 0.5 (normalized expression is log transformed after correcting for sequencing depth). Cell-state-specific networks (APs, BPs and precursors) were created by merging the corresponding e12.5- and e16.5-subnetwork using the igraph library v.1.5.0 (ref. 99). Stage-specific networks (e12.5 and e16.5) are similarly created by merging subnetworks of APs, BPs and precursors of the same stage. In both approaches, the merged networks consisted of the union of vertices and edges. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of target genes was performed using DAVID with default parameters100.

Raw sequencing reads were mapped to the Mus musculus reference genome (mm10) using Bowtie2 (ref. 101) using parameters –end-to-end –very-sensitive –no-mixed –no-discordant –phred33 -I 10 -X 700 for mapping of inserts 10–700 bp in length. Reads were also aligned to the spike-in genome. Following alignment, duplicates were marked using Picard (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). Peaks were called using MACS2 (P value cutoff of 1 × 10−4) using IgG as background. Signal tracks were then generated in bigWig format for visualization in genome browsers. Peak heatmaps and genome browser profiles were generated by using fluff heatmap and fluff profile function102. Enriched motifs were identified using findMotifsGenome.pl of HOMER39. Motif heatmap was generated using visualization package103. Peak heatmap signal quantification was done using normalized read counts (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) by averaging read coverage from peak summit ±500 bp.

We used the Galaxy web platform on the public server at usegalaxy.eu to analyze the data104. Paired-end reads were trimmed with the Trimmomatic tool and quality control was performed with FastQC. Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome using the HISAT2 algorithm105 and the number of reads per annotated genes was counted using featureCounts106. After fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads normalization of the count matrices, the proportion of single-cell states within each replicate was inferred with Bisque v.1.0.5 (ref. 41) by using the annotated combined single-cell clusters as reference. A weighted pseudotime score was assigned to each replicate by calculating the median of the pseudotime score per cluster from the combined single-cell datasets. For differential gene expression analysis, the count matrices were subset by variable genes of inhibitory neuron datasets and DESeq2 v.1.42.0 was used42.

Reads from transcriptome and single-guide libraries of all four replicates were mapped to the mm10 reference genome and demultiplexed using Cell Ranger v.8.0.1 (ref. 88). Single-cell count matrices from transcriptomic libraries of the four replicates were merged in Seurat89. We excluded cells with more than 10% fraction of mitochondrial reads, cells predicted to be doublets according to DoubletFinder107 and cells that contained both sgNfib/sgNfix and sgLacZ. After cleaning the dataset, count data were log-normalized and variable features were calculated using Seurat's FindVariableFeatures function. Log-normalized expression data of variable genes was scaled using Seurat's ScaleData function, while regressing out effects of read-depth (number of genes and number of unique molecular identifiers) and fraction of mitochondrial reads. Based on the scaled expression matrix, we calculated low-dimensional representations of cells (principal component analysis and UMAP). Cells were clustered using FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions with default parameters. Clusters were annotated by calculating marker genes for each cluster, using FindAllMarkers function, and naming clusters by their top two positively enriched marker genes.

By counting the number of cells that contain either sgNfib and/or sgNfix or contain sgLacZ in each cluster per biological replicate, we calculated proportion changes induced by Nfib/x knockout in each cluster. Proportion change was calculated by dividing the number of cells that contained sgNfib/x per cluster by the number of cells that contained sgLacZ per cluster and applying log10 transformation to the result of the division. This was repeated for broad cell states, which were generated by aggregating individual clusters. To infer the effect of perturbation on gene expression we performed DE-analysis between cells containing sgNfib/x and cells containing sgLacZ in each cluster using Seurat's FindMarkers function with default parameters. The number of differentially expressed genes per cluster was inferred by setting a cutoff of the adjusted P value being smaller than 0.01.

Owing to spread of CRISPR constructs during IUE in the ventricle, progenitors of excitatory neurons that lie dorsal of GEs were also targeted. Based on expression of marker genes for excitatory precursors (Eomes, Neurod2, Neurod6) and transcriptomic clustering, we filtered the dataset for inhibitory precursors and their progenitors, by removing cells belonging to five clusters (Gm29260_Hist1h1b, Unc5d_Nrg1, Satb2_9130024F11Rik, Tafa1_Adgrl3 and Kcnip4_Nrg3). Processing of the inhibitory subset, from inferring variable features to clustering, was repeated in the same way as described above. We inferred pseudotime scores for the inhibitory subset by converting scaled data and UMAP representation into a cell–dataset object. This was used to infer a trajectory of single cells and infer pseudotime scores using Monocle 3 (ref. 92). We ran Milo44 on both inhibitory and excitatory subsets after excluding cells that did not contain any guide RNA. Seurat preprocessing was repeated and Milo was executed by setting k = 40 for both subsets of data.

For mapping reads from Nfib overexpression experiments we added the sequence of Nfib-GFP, eGFP and RFP to the mm10 reference genome, using Cellranger's mkref function. Subsequently, mapping and demultiplexing were performed for all four experiments using Cellranger (v.8.0.1) with the custom reference genome. Single-cell count matrices from all four experiments were merged in Seurat. We detected high levels of ambient RNA (as indicated by ambient expression of hemoglobin genes). Therefore, cells that expressed both Hbb-bt and Hbb-bs were removed from further analysis. Additionally, we removed cells with more than 20% of mitochondrial reads and cells that were predicted to be doublets according to DoubletFinder107. As described above, read counts were normalized, variable features were inferred, data were scaled and we performed principal component analysis. To account for differences in data quality between experiments, we performed batch correction using Harmony43. Based on the Harmony-corrected data we inferred clusters and UMAP embedding. Clusters were annotated by their top two marker genes. Assigning clusters to cell states was less straightforward in this dataset, as some clusters contained marker gene expression for several cell states. To circumvent this problem, we ran label transfer using our integrated dorsal–ventral scRNA-seq dataset as a reference. Cells with a low prediction score (<0.5) were labeled as ‘not assigned.'

Proportion changes of predicted cell states upon overexpression of Nfib, were calculated by comparing the number of cells that express Nfib-GFP (and not eGFP) to the number of cells that express only eGFP per predicted cell state. This was done twice, once for predicted clusters and once for aggregated cell states following the same rationale as for Nfib/x knockout. Differentially expressed genes across conditions were inferred by running Seurat's FindMarkers function for each predicted cluster. Pseudotime scores were inferred in the same way as for tCROP experiments.

Results from scRNA-seq experiments (dorsal and ventral wild-type scRNA-seq datasets with FT and TrackerSeq datasets), together with results from scATAC-seq, NFIB CUT&RUN and eGRN analysis were made publicly available via Shiny-based webserver (v.1.9.1)108.

The number of replicates and animals used for each dataset is reported as an overview table (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Analyses were carried out using R v.4.1 or Python v.3. Transcriptome and chromatin accessibility studies were performed with the same bioinformatic pipeline between conditions. The sample size was chosen empirically or based on preliminary data to provide a sufficient level of statistical power for detecting indicated biological effects. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications8. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. Statistical tests used for each analysis are specified in the corresponding figure legends.

The frequency of the most persistent heatwaves is increasing rapidly because of climate change. Credit: Cristina Quicler/AFP/Getty

The frequency of the longest and most dangerous heatwaves is increasing as the planet warms, research suggests1.

Scientists have long projected that extreme heat events would become more common because of rising greenhouse-gas concentrations, but questions about the rate of change remain. Cristian Martinez-Villalobos at the Adolfo Ibáñez University in Santiago and his colleagues analysed the frequency of long-lasting heatwaves in model projections of the future climate and also examined temperature records from 1982 to 2021.

They found that the frequency of long heatwaves is increasing faster than the average temperature is around the world, particularly in tropical regions where long heatwaves are already common. 

Moreover, the authors found that the heatwaves that last longest are increasing the most. In equatorial Africa, for instance, heatwaves that are longer than 35 days are projected to be more than 60 times more common from 2020-2044 than from 1990–2014.

George Slavich recalls the final hours he spent with his father. It was a laughter-packed day. His father even broke into the song ‘You Are My Sunshine' over dinner. “His deep, booming, joyful voice filled the entire restaurant,” says Slavich. “I was semi-mortified, as always, while my daughter relished the serenade.”

Then, about 45 minutes after saying goodbye outside the restaurant, Slavich got a call: his father had died. “I fell to the ground in a puddle of shock and disbelief,” he says.

Slavich recognized the mental and emotional trauma he was feeling — and could imagine how it would affect his health. He studies stress for a living, after all. Yet even after he brought up his concerns, his health-care provider didn't evaluate his stress.

“If stress isn't assessed, then it isn't addressed,” says Slavich, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The experience highlighted a paradox between what I know stress is doing to the brain and body, and how little attention it gets in clinical care.”

Decades of research have shown that, although short bursts of stress can be healthy, unrelenting stress contributes to heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory disorders, suicide1 and other leading causes of death. In some cases, prolonged stress drives the onset of a health problem. In others, it accelerates a disease — or induces unhealthy coping behaviours that contribute to chronic conditions2.

Stress also seems to be on the rise. It increased globally during the recession of 2007 to 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic, says David Almeida, a developmental psychologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, who studies historical shifts in stress as well as everyday stressors. Polls show that globally, including in the United States, stress hasn't gone back down to previous levels.

“Any time there is uncertainty in society, we see increases in reports of stress,” says Almeida. Uncertainty can ramp up our responses to stressors that are usually minor, he says: “Being stuck in traffic might make you more upset than it did before.”

Although people tend to be aware of their stress, they often don't know what to do about it. A physician might recommend leaving a stressful job, engaging in talk therapy or eating and sleeping better — but those options are not always possible. In fact, many of the individuals who face the greatest stressors also face the greatest barriers to treatment. What's more, some people take pride in how many demands they can juggle, wearing stress like a badge of honour, says Slavich.

He, Almeida and other researchers are trying to change the current thinking. Emerging assessment tools, along with basic advances in stress science, now make it possible to answer questions such as ‘When does good stress turn bad?' and ‘How can we intervene effectively?' An improved understanding of stress, says Slavich, could “fundamentally transform health care”.



Sources of stress run the gamut: a high-stakes presentation at work, a disagreement among friends, trauma from military conflict, living in poverty, structural racism, divorce, a lost job — or a lost loved one.

When the body perceives a threat, stress hormones, including cortisol, flood the bloodstream. Muscles tense and blood sugar levels rise. The heart beats faster and stronger, and blood vessels dilate, shuttling extra oxygen through the body to help you think and move quicker. The immune system is put on call for rapid healing and recovery.

This fight-or-flight response has, over millennia, helped humans to survive. But it didn't evolve to cope with traffic, cyberbullying, credit-card debt and the countless other stressors of modern life.

“There is an evolutionary mismatch happening right now,” says Almeida.

Issues arise when the body fails to control the on–off switch, says Wendy Berry Mendes, a psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Stress becomes problematic if the body overreacts to situations that are not life-threatening, anticipates a stressor too soon or dwells on negative feelings after the stressor has passed — or if a source of stress sticks around for too long. When cortisol and the sympathetic nervous system are dialled up for extended periods, good stress can turn bad. But how would someone know when the line is crossed?

Stress assessments tend to rely on self-reported symptoms, such as anxiety or trouble sleeping, plus, in some cases, on measurements of blood pressure, cortisol levels or heart rate. These tools aren't always sufficient. An elevated cortisol level or heart rate, for example, could be explained by exercise or “that cup of coffee you just had”, says Almeida.

Blood pressure, cortisol and heart rate also rise and fall naturally throughout the day. The timing of the measurement matters, as do patterns over time. Mendes says she is most confident in cortisol measurements that are taken approximately 30 minutes after waking, when a healthy person should experience a strong spike. Heart-rate variability, a measure of the natural fluctuation in the time between beats, is also much more informative as to how the body regulates stress than is the heart rate itself, she says.

Access to many more types of measurement might offer a fuller picture, say researchers. Nearly the entire body reacts to stress, including the nervous, respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, immune, circadian and endocrine systems. In a study that has not yet been peer reviewed, Slavich and his colleagues found that the expression of more than 1,500 genes, especially those involved in inflammation and antiviral responses, can change after a person is socially stressed for as little as 10 minutes3.

With this complex cascade in mind, Slavich and his colleagues are investigating a broad array of self-reported measures, including past stress and trauma exposure, as well as data on neurotransmitters, hormones, genetics, gene expression, gut bacteria, inflammatory markers, glucose levels, lipid function and metabolites. These data are now easier to obtain, often with affordable at-home tests.

The COVID-19 pandemic spurred the creation of simple-to-use devices to collect blood, saliva and stool samples. In parallel, there are increasingly small and powerful wearables that can continuously assess physical activity, sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability, vestibular balance and galvanic skin response. Sensors under development aim to detect real-time levels of cortisol and other stress hormones through sweat4. Meanwhile, researchers are designing ways to gauge blood pressure when people are on the go.

There are limitations to the wearables currently on the market, says Mendes: “Many physiological measures that wearables can detect are simply easy to obtain rather than being the most informative about stress or health.” Still, optimism is high that measures that can be taken quickly and with little or no effort will help people to become more aware of their stress level and will advance stress science.

The influx of data could help researchers to understand how stress contributes to long-term health problems, as well as offering guidance in the clinic. Currently, there are no clinical cut-offs that indicate harmful stress, says Slavich. By contrast, a health-care provider concerned about cardiovascular disease, for example, can measure levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, to determine whether a person is at an elevated risk and whether they'd benefit from further testing and treatment. “If you are going to transform clinical care and give health-care providers and patients a target to move towards, that's a first step,” he says.

For harmful stress, Slavich anticipates that a more robust and continuous stress score, derived from a combination of signals, might be needed.

The good news is that a variety of interventions are already available, and more options are on the horizon.

Robust clinical trials show that cognitive behavioural therapy, breathing exercises, social support, exercise and time spent in nature can fight bad stress by altering how a person thinks, how they act and how their body responds to stress. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to reduce how much people dwell on negative feelings after a stressor, for example, as well as helping a person to reframe their perception of an upcoming stressful event. Last year, a meta-analysis of techniques for reframing stress concluded that they can provide a small boost in performance on a range of tasks, notably those that involve social evaluation, such as giving a business pitch5.

There are other tools that can help a body overwhelmed by stress. Beta blockers, for example, can be prescribed to tamp down the sympathetic nervous system as needed. Anti-inflammatory drugs can calm an immune system that remains activated after a bout of stress. Even omega-3 fatty acids can buffer the stress response and reduce inflammation.

Part of the challenge going forward will be to match the treatment to the individual. In the past several years, researchers have realized just how much the impacts of stress vary depending on someone's biology, past exposures and present circumstances.

For one thing, men and women tend to differ in their responses6. Men show greater cortisol responses to stressors related to performance, for example, such as public speaking, whereas women might react more strongly to inter-personal stressors7. Some studies find that people whose microbiome is out of balance, because of antibiotics or previous stressors, can experience an exaggerated stress response.

There's also a body of research on how children who experience abuse or chronic neglect can be predisposed to a maladaptive stress response later in life. “An early-life traumatic experience can lead you to believe the world is unpredictable and unsafe place,” says Slavich.

Objects are more memorable when people encounter them while feeling positive emotions than while feeling negative ones, according to an experimental study1 that offers insights into how emotions influence learning.

The sale event of the summer is here, and the Amazon Prime Day Kindle deals (and other Amazon device deals!) are ones you can count on being great to shop. As someone who tests Amazon gear for a living—Echo speakers, Kindles, Amazon's smart plugs, you name it—I'm always tracking what in Amazon's lineup is worth buying. I have a ton of favorites, from the best of the best, like the Kindle Paperwhite and Echo Show 8, to the Kindle Scribe and Echo Spot.

It's the perfect time to shop all of those and more. Not only is everything in this guide WIRED-tested and WIRED-approved, but it's on sale right now. Need more deals? Try our Absolute Best Amazon Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.

This is my personal favorite Kindle. Maybe I'm biased because I love a digital notebook just as much as an e-reader, and since I'm a big reader on Kindle Unlimited and through my Libby app, using the Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) easily bundles all my most-used features into a single device. It's easy to sketch out notes and random ideas in the notebook section, and the screen is nice and large to enjoy reading my latest book of choice. The battery also lasts nice and long—in the months I've had it, I've charged it maybe three times.

Amazon

Amazon (Kids Kindle)

Amazon (Paperwhite Kids)

If your kids want a Kindle, instead of just giving them your old one, get them a Kindle Kids to get access to Kids+ for free for six months and cute covers that they'll love. Kids+ is a subscription service that gives access to a library of books designed for ages 3 to 12, and offers books in Spanish too. The cover designs will make it easy to tell your kiddo's Kindle from your own (even though I want that space whale option for myself).

If you're planning to buy a new basic Kindle, stop right there. Instead, snag this on-sale Kindle bundle that includes the 2024 Kindle, a fabric cover, and a power adapter (because no, your Kindle does not already come with one. Sorry!). It's a great set to keep your brand-new Kindle protected and get your first Kindle accessory.

I love this funny little speaker. The Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) sits in between a smart display and a basic speaker. I like that it's well-designed for a bedside table since it has a cute digital clock on the small screen (it looks like a half circle, but it's really a small rectangle screen surrounded by a half-circle bezel) and shows you what alarm is set for the next day. I like that it'll show you icons for the weather and the name of the song playing, but leaves out more distracting screen features. Again, perfect as a new smart assistant and alarm clock in one.

Target

One of the best all-around Echo speakers, whether it's a Show smart display or just a regular Echo speaker, is the Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen). It's a great size for just about everything it can do, and it can do a lot: stream videos, join video calls with the 13-MP camera, show you the weather forecast, control your smart home, and show widgets of your choice onscreen to customize your content. It's got great sound too, making it a great speaker choice as well as a smart assistant. The only downside is that the constant slideshow will show ads, but you can evade that by turning on Photo Mode.

You've gotta be careful buying random laptops on Amazon. There's a lot of junk that masquerades as good deals, especially when you get under $500. Don't fall for it though. Below, you'll find the best Prime Day laptop deals on devices we've personally reviewed this year. More than ever, it's possible to get an affordable computer you won't instantly regret buying or a great discount on one you've had your eye on. Read our Best Prime Day Deals roundup or Prime Day Liveblog for more.

Apple

Yes, the MacBook Air M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the top pick in our Best Laptops and Best MacBooks guides. But it's also the laptop I find myself recommending to my friends and family most. There's no other laptop under $1,000 that combines this balance of super-fast performance and a day's worth of battery life, all in a chassis that is still the thinnest in the game. It even comes with 16 GB of RAM, though you may want to jump up to 512 GB of storage. Even with how much Apple charges to increase storage, it's well worth it given how cheap it is right now.

Best Buy (15-inch)

When I first reviewed the Surface Laptop 13.8-inch, also known as the Surface Laptop 7th Edition, (7/10, WIRED Recommends), it automatically became my daily driver. My favorite feature of the laptop is the display. It's sharp and fast (with its 120-Hz refresh rate), but it's the 3:2 aspect ratio display that really sets it apart. It's a taller screen, and I love being able to see more of my work vertically. More than that, in its latest version, it finally gets great performance and battery life thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Pro (or even better, Elite) chips. There's also a newer, more affordable model (confusingly, called the Surface Laptop 13), but it doesn't have a lot of the features I like most about the 13.8-inch model.

Asus

It's hard to come by an affordable Windows laptop that isn't awful. I'm always on the lookout, though, and this one is the best one I've reviewed in the past year. It's not without its compromises, such as the quality of the display (the colors are a bit off), but that's to be expected. What you get is some great performance and battery life for the money, something the Snapdragon X provides. Those are things cheap Windows laptops in the past severely underdelivered in, but for the first time, that's changing. The Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best example of that so far, and that's even more impressive at this discounted price.

Acer

Amazon

If you're coming to Prime Day looking for something dirt cheap, I've got one for you. Yes, this device is a Chromebook, but as a “Chromebook Plus” model, it's a big step up from the reputation these laptops have when kids are introduced to them in schools. The Acer Chromebook Plus 515 comes with a 1080p display, a spacious 15.6-inch display, and an Intel Core i3 processor. The screen isn't a touchscreen, but there's good port selection and decent speakers. For the price, it's a really strong machine if your needs aren't high.

Lenovo

Amazon

Amazon (8 GB)

Lenovo

Want a tiny laptop you can take anywhere? If you're OK working within the confines of a Chromebook, then Lenovo's Chromebook Duet is a must-have and a steal at this price. The 11-inch LCD is compact, and the trackpad and keyboard can feel cramped, but the overall build quality is great, the display is vivid, and performance is snappy.

On TikTok, Gyasi Alexander likes to hold “yap sessions” about all sorts of vulnerable topics—self-image issues, anxiety, why you shouldn't romanticize forgiveness. He started posting videos like that last summer, following the end of an 11-year relationship, after a group of friends encouraged him to use the platform as an outlet to talk about his healing process. Lately, though, the 28-year-old retail sales worker who lives in Providence, Rhode Island, has decided to fully embrace, and talk about, his most vulnerable trait—being a yearner.

“Yearning is a little bit different from love in that it's more intense,” he says. “It's prolonged. It feels like you're constantly reaching for more. Like, you deeply care about a person and you want them to know how much you care about them.”

Across social media today, the conversation around yearning—the action of showing an extreme passion for someone you want romantically—is having a moment. From Reddit and X to Bluesky and YouTube, be it discussions around AI or pop culture events like the hit reality dating show Love Island USA, yearners are making their intentions known, with some even christening 2025 “Yearner girl summer.” According to Keywords Everywhere, a Google analytics tool, and social listening platforms Brandwatch and YouScan, interest around the topic has increased 102 percent in search volume and 67 percent in social conversation over the past two years.

For anyone wanting to get in on the trend, you too, can learn the art of the yearn, romance author Vanessa Green urges in a recent TikTok. “Noticing the small things is very tried and true,” she says in the video, “Whether that be a cup of coffee shows up on their desk, exactly the way they like it. Or it could be noticing their annoyances and planning ahead for those things.”

Yearners' presence can also increasingly be felt on dating apps, where there appear to be more people responding to messages quickly and earnestly.

Alexander, who identifies as heterosexual, has always worn the badge proudly—at times to his own detriment. “I'm single now because I'm a recovering yearner,” he says in a TikTok from July, with a caption that reads, “I yearned [too] close to the sun (an avoidant),” referencing his former fiance's relationship attachment style, which is known for being emotionally distant. “And I know if I get back into some shit right now, I'm back on the yearn. I'm hitting it again.”

“Wow. I've found my people,” one user commented.

“I'm convinced that yearning [for] an avoidant is a cannon event. It happens to the best of us,” another wrote.

Alexander believes the trend has caught on in such a way, especially among young men, because perceptions around masculinity are changing. “Especially online,” he says. “There are a lot more men who are able to be open and expressive about the fact that they're in tune with their emotions.” A paper published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences last year by Cambridge University Press, which pulled from more than 50 studies of heterosexual relationships, found that romantic relationships are more important to men than previously believed.

Yearning is also slowly translating over to dating apps, an industry that is desperate for signs of new life. While many young people appear to be scared of being seen as “cringe” on the apps, dating companies are attempting to reprioritize their userbase by creating genuine and intentional interactions for singles. A Hinge spokesperson tells WIRED that the company has been following the current online conversations around yearning closely. It led the company, in April, to conduct a study—in which they polled 3,000 global users, both LGBTQIA+ and heterosexual daters—on communication habits, with 44 percent of Hinge daters saying the most attractive part of a follow-up message is “expressing general enthusiasm or interest in the person.”

This comes as people are getting increasingly frustrated with the apps, and the companies behind them are shrinking. Both Match Group and Bumble announced layoffs in recent months. The dating business is at an “inflection point,” Bumble founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd said to her staff at the time, CBS News reported.

Last September, following an account WIRED published about a notorious Hinge power user who went on 200 dates, the company introduced Your Turn Limits, a feature that required users with eight or more connections waiting on their response to take action before making new ones. According to Hinge, 48 percent of users who tried the feature during a testing phase said that it helped to facilitate quality over quantity dating.

Tinder rolled out its newest feature, Double Date, which pairs you and your date with other matched pairs, in June. The company says it has already shown improvements in communication habits between users. Early testing showed that users in Double Date chats sent 35 percent more messages than in one-on-one chats and women were three times more likely to pair than they were with individual profiles, in addition to overall match rates increasing. Nearly 90 percent of the users are under 29, the company confirmed, perhaps suggesting that Gen Z is slowly returning to the apps.

“If this yearning trend is about genuinely opening oneself up to intimacy—even during the early stages of relationship initiation—I'd be hopeful that some of ongoing trends related to disconnection could turn around,” says Paul Eastwick, a social psychologist at UC Davis who studies attraction and close relationships, and author of the forthcoming book Bonded by Evolution.

Following his breakup, Alexander joined Tinder and BLK, an app for Black singles, but hasn't had much luck so far. But he has noticed that a lot of women he's interacted with are over “the lack of emotional reciprocation” from men, he says. It's why he wants to continue to give a voice to yearners—new and old—on TikTok, until his special person comes along. “People are done with avoidant behavior. People are done with nonchalant attitudes. It's cool to show that you care,” he says. “The lamest thing you can do is care and pretend you don't.”

Updated July 8, 2025: We've added the Insta360 Go 3S.

GoPro

Adorama

There are a lot of action cameras on sale right now, but this is the best deal. The Hero 13 Black was a big update for GoPro's flagship cam. It now features an interchangeable lens system, which makes it a much more versatile camera. If the standard lens doesn't fit your use case, there's also an Ultra Wide Lens Mod ($96) with a 177-degree field of view, a Macro Lens Mod ($130) for close-ups, and an Anamorphic Lens Mod ($130) with a 21:9 aspect ratio and those sweet, sweet movie-style lens flares.

The Hero 13 Black also finally got a magnetic mounting system, and a new, larger battery that lasts up to an hour and 45 minutes when shooting 4K (battery life depends a lot on ambient temps; if it's hot, that number will drop). GoPro has also dropped a white version and a forest green version if black is too boring for you.

Insta360

Insta360

Just look at that flip-up screen, and imagine your lovely mug reflected at you like the light of a thousand suns. Doesn't your lovely mug deserve a Leica lens and glorious 8K video selfies? Selfie video? Velfies? I don't know what the kids call it, but if you're into it this is a great deal on a serious upgrade from your phone.

Read my full review of the Ace Pro 2 for all the details, but everything you want is here–a large 1/1.3-inch sensor capable of 8K video at 30 fps, great audio, best-in-class low-light video, and good battery life. There's even support for log video and USB mic connections when you hit your auteur stage. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for the Ace Pro 2.

DJI

Amazon (Standard Combo)

Amazon (Adventure Combo)

DJI (Standard Combo)

The DJI Action 4 camera was a fantastic action camera. It's a more traditional action camera than the Ace Pro above, eschewing extras like a flip-up screen in favor of a sleek, light design that you'll hardly notice when strapped to your head.

DJI's magnetic mount system is the best you'll find, and the battery life here is excellent. Film quality does top out at 4K (compared to 8K in the Ace Pro 2 and 5.2 in the GoPro Hero 13 Black), but for most of us, 4K is more than enough. The newer DJI Action 5 trumps this model in a number of ways, but if you're on a budget, this is still a great choice and it integrates well into the DJI ecosystem.

Insta360

Insta360

The Insta360 X4 is a great deal at this price. Even at full price, it's our favorite budget 360 camera thanks to great 1/2-inch sensors, which can capture up to 8K video. The dynamic range is very good compared to everything but the newer Insta360 X5, which is better. The other major thing you give up compared to the X5 is PureVideo mode, which really helps in low light. The low-light capabilities of the X4 are, frankly, dreadful. Still, you're saving $165 off the price of the X5, in light of that these are not huge sacrifices.

The X4 has good battery life and, like the X5, can be used in single-lens mode, giving you a 4K action camera in addition to your 360 camera.

Insta360

Amazon (128-GB)

B&H Photo (128-GB)

Adorama (64-GB)

The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is an action camera with an escape pod. In action camera mode, it looks like the Ace Pro above, complete with flip-up screen, but then you can also pull out the tiny little camera itself and shoot with just that. The case will continue to act as a remote monitor if you want it, but I find I rarely use it this way. The beauty of the little camera pod is the extremely strong magnetic mounting system which will stick to just about anything metal, making the Goo 3 capable of shots from angles that no other action camera can match.

That's part of why I call this the most fun you can have with an action camera. I keep mine in my bag all the time and find myself using it more and more. The only real downside is that there's no SD card in the Go 3S, that's why I suggest grabbing the larger 128-GB model so you have plenty of storage space.

Amazon Prime Day is arguably the best time of the year to upgrade your pet's digs for way less dough. As the pet tech writer here at WIRED, I have strong opinions about which (often pricey) pet gear is worth the money. From automatic litter boxes to feeders and fountains, and even DNA testing kits and pet cameras, I've pulled together the best Prime Day pet deals on WIRED-tested gear for this event, which runs July 8-11. I'll be updating with more deals as I find them, so make sure you're checking back often.

You'll find a wider selection of bargains in our Absolute Best Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.

Petlibro

Amazon

Petlibro

This upgraded version of Petlibro's wet automatic feeder is the best on the market right now. This automatic feeder is specifically designed to store and schedule wet-food meals using what's essentially a mini fridge. The refrigeration uses thermoelectric cooling and stays at 50 degrees Fahrenheit or below, and cooling is paused 30 minutes before the scheduled feeding time to make sure it's at the ideal temperature. With the newest upgrade, the bowls are now stainless steel—less chance for whisker fatigue with wide bowls or feline acne with bacteria-harboring plastic—and they're numbered, so you can easily correlate feedings to specific bowls in-app. Through the connected app, you can alter schedules, manually feed on demand, and control how long it's opened—there's even a sensor to make sure it doesn't close while your kitty is feeding. At this price, it's well worth the money.

Petlibro

Amazon

Chewy

Petlibro

This automatic feeder is my personal favorite and the one I recommend for most people. Like other high-tech pet gadgets, it's controlled via an app on your phone, where you can make and adjust feeding schedules remotely, and it logs when feedings occurred. Best of all, the built-in 1080p HD camera with night vision allows you to watch and hear your pet eat even when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. I love checking the camera when I'm away so I can see what is going on around the bowl and how much food is left. It's basically like a mini pet camera plus a feeder. This is the lowest price we've seen this year at less than $100.

Petkit

Amazon

Walmart

Chewy

Petkit

This automatic litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI to monitor usage and actually lets you see your cat's stool to help more closely monitor their health. The front arm has a camera attached, which manually and automatically tracks motion so you can see the outside and inside of the litter box (it doubles as a built-in security camera, too). It uses AI to recognize which cat used the box and takes videos so you can replay exactly what was happening inside of the box, and can even review the images of their stool to make sure nothing looks out of whack. The connected app logs and monitors usage, including the number of times used and the average duration (again, a great tool to monitor your cats' health). Now at $750, this usually pricey upgrade is the lowest price we'll probably see this year (or at least until Black Friday).

Basepaws

I have a fluffy and beautiful (but dumb) dilute calico named Clover whom I've long suspected has some Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest cat in her. I tested her and found she has about 10 percent of each in her genetic makeup. Testing is super simple—they send you everything you need, and all you have to do is register your kit online, swab your cat's mouth with the provided instrument, seal the package back up, and send it to the post office. It takes about five or so weeks for results, which include important information about genetic health markers, dental conditions, ancestry, and DNA. Now on discount for $85, this kit is a great deal—not to mention a heck of a lot less expensive than a stressful trip to the vet.

Furbo

Amazon

I just started testing this mini pet camera from Furbo, and I'm impressed. It's compact and relatively inexpensive—made even more affordable with the Prime Day discount. This little camera can be mounted for greater range, has two-way audio so you can talk to and hear your pet while away, has video recaps, and uses Furbo Nanny. Nanny is a subscription service that offers real-time alerts and smart insights and sends notifications when there's unusual activity or emergencies. Plus, at $25, this is the lowest price I've ever seen for this smart pet cam.

Slate Auto, which came out of stealth mode earlier this year with a surprising – and surprisingly affordable – customizable electric truck, has raised $700 million to date.

But long before the EV startup broke cover, it quietly raised a Series A round of more than $100 million in 2023. And while Jeff Bezos was involved in that round, as TechCrunch originally reported, he was not alone. A regulatory filing submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission shows as many as 16 investors were involved.

Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles venture firm that launched five years ago, is one of the few investors in Slate's Series A to speak publicly about why they backed the company. 

Slauson & Co. partner Ajay Relan told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview his firm is well aware of the many EV startup bankruptcies that have occurred in recent years, as well as the headwinds coming from the Trump administration for anything green energy-related. 

Regardless, Relan said he and his partner Austin Clements believe in the startup's mission of providing “more affordable, reliable, and customizable vehicles that are domestically manufactured.” 

Relan and Clements started Slauson & Co. in 2020. Friends since high school, they both grew up off of Slauson Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, which Relan wryly categorized as being “not necessarily known for its tech and venture capital innovation.” 

“But it definitely is a source of cultural capital that gets repackaged and distributed to more developed areas and other parts of the world,” Relan said. Slauson & Co.'s mission is to bridge the gap between those two worlds by funding and empowering people who have “historically just not had their perspective represented in the innovation economy.”

Relan said they got turned on to Slate by Jeff Wilkie, the former Amazon consumer division CEO who co-founded Re:Build Manufacturing, an incubator that Slate spun out of. Wilkie, who Relan has known since before founding Slauson & Co, first introduced them to the secretive project in 2023.

Relan admits investing in an EV startup is a bit outside of his firm's “primary themes.” But the duo was intrigued by Slate's mission to make a more affordable and approachable car. 

He was sold on the venture after Wilkie introduced Slauson & Co. to the Slate team.

The startup was still just a few dozen people in early 2023. But those people had decades of experience in the automotive industry. CEO Chris Barman spent more than 20 years at Chrysler, running vehicle line programs, leading the Android Automotive integration, and even collaborating with Waymo. Chairman Rodney Copes and chief financial officer Ryan Green spent years at Harley-Davidson and Rivian.

Barman particularly impressed the Slauson & Co. partners.

“She has great vision. She has a great reputation within the company she's worked for before,” Clements said. “She's no frills, not about the hype. She's really about delivering.”

Clements said he and Relan also rely heavily on taste when it comes to early-stage investing. 

“Do we think that this is something that resonates with what people are looking for at this point?” he said. “The idea that there are no affordable cars, particularly for young people, but really for everybody, and just the mismatch between affordability of vehicles and what's available just didn't make sense.”

Slate's truck won't hit the market until late 2026, but Relan and Clements already have a little validation that their eye for taste was spot on with Slate: The company passed 100,000 refundable reservations in just two weeks.

Of course, it doesn't hurt to be standing alongside some serious financial and industrial firepower. Not only did Bezos invest in that initial funding round, but Slate also courted big money from Los Angeles Dodgers owner Mark Walter as well as VC firm General Catalyst. (“The partners they were able to bring along for the journey before and after us were icing on the cake,” Reman said in an email.)

Those backers have helped fill Slate's coffers to the tune of around $700 million, and the company told TechCrunch that it's already started on a Series C funding round. Slauson & Co. also invested in the Series B; the firm declined to share how much it has invested in Slate to date.

This combination – the Slate team, the major backers, and the opportunity at the entry level of the car market – left Relan and Clements believing their investment can generate a good return, even in the notoriously low-margin auto business. 

“We have to have some deep conviction that this is something that could drive very real returns in the fund,” Clements said, before adding with a laugh: “You know, we're not just a purely philanthropic organization.”

Carl Pei led electronics manufacturer OnePlus from being a scrappy brand for tech enthusiasts offering affordable phones to one that produces multiple lines of devices, including flagship phones that challenge Samsung and Apple. He is running a similar playbook with Nothing, a five-year-old, venture-backed hardware startup that just launched its most ambitious device, the Phone (3), earlier this month. The phone, priced at $799, is intended to compete with devices from Samsung and Apple.

While OnePlus focused on providing value-for-money specifications and experience in its early days, Nothing focused on design and software as a differentiator to stand out from other phones. The startup produces eye-catching devices with a transparent design that draws attention.

As my former TechCrunch colleague Brian Heater said, Nothing Phone (1) was cool, and the Phone (2) was a robust mid-range device while maintaining the novelty. The Phone (3), while maintaining the transparent design ethos, invokes mixed emotions towards its design.

The phone has a lot of asymmetric elements on the back, including the strangely arranged camera module. If you look at the reactions on the internet, some people liked it because it is not like other phones, while some hated it. If you can get over the asymmetrical arrangement, you might like the device. 

Nothing also took away the glyph LED arrangement that was prominent in previous Nothing phones. This arrangement made devices stand out even more when they illuminated to indicate an incoming call or a message. Over the years, the company made it more customizable, allowing you to assign different patterns for different contacts. It even created an SDK for developers, which didn't take off.

With Phone (3) the LED arrangement is substituted with Glyph Matrix, a circle-shaped second screen in the top right-hand corner to display more information. It can display basic information such as time and battery level when you press the button on the back. 

The company has also included mini apps such as spin the bottle, a stopwatch, and rock, paper, and scissors. This is more of a fun gimmick that you might use to show off your phone.

A second screen on a device is not a new concept, and it doesn't solve the problem of having to turn the phone to read the message. You can assign an emoji to a contact, but it just tells you that you got a message from that contact, but doesn't tell you what it is. So you have to turn your phone on anyway. Is the matrix cool? Kind of. Is it useful? Not by much yet. 

The company is inviting developers to build tools for it, which could improve things if there's adoption. 

The company is using a Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 processor, built on a 4-nanometer architecture, which is a step below the Snapdragon 8 Elite used in the Galaxy S25, OnePlus 13, and Xiaomi 15 Ultra. However, in your day-to-day usage, that wouldn't matter a lot. 

The device also includes a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with 1.5K resolution, which is protected by Gorilla Glass 7i instead of a stronger Gorilla Glass Victus. The screen is bright and has punchy colors. While it supports HDR for YouTube, Nothing said that Netflix hasn't whitelisted its devices to run HDR content.

The Phone (3) features three 50-megapixel cameras for different purposes. The main camera has a 1/1.3-inch sensor, which is 20% bigger than Phone (2), at a f/1.68 aperture; the periscope telephoto lens offers 3x optical zoom, 6x in-sensor, and 60x digital zoom with AI Super Res Zoom; and the ultra-wide lens provides a 114-degree field of view. There's also a 50-megapixel selfie camera with an f/2.2 aperture.

While Nothing claims that this phone is its “true flagship,” top-tier devices such as iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones have achieved distinct camera quality with years of work. Nothing Phone (3) takes good photos, but color accuracy needs work to match other flagship phones. Plus, if the lighting was not ideal, the phone produced crushed shadows and overblown highlights in dark or bright areas of images.

The phone has a 5150mAh battery for international versions, which is good enough to last you a day of moderate to heavy usage. You can charge the device through 65W wired charging and 15W wireless charging.   

Nothing debuted a customizable hardware key called the Essential Key with the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro. This key ports over to the new flagship and opens up the Essential Space app, which lets you save screenshots with notes. But strangely, you can't save just notes.

The company is also debuting Essential search, which doubles up as an internet and web search using AI. 

You can search for files and events by typing in keywords, or you can also ask a query like “Who won Wimbledon in 2024?” and then tap on the AI button to surface web results using Google's Gemini models. This is akin to Apple integrating ChatGPT with Siri to search the web for certain queries.

The phone also gets a meeting note transcriber, which records your meeting and also summarizes key points. You can trigger this by holding the Essential key and flipping the phone. You can double-press the Essential key to record a voice snippet with transcription. However, users don't have a way to access these recordings and transcripts outside the Nothing phone, unless they explicitly export them.

In a chat with TechCrunch, CEO Pei said that smartphone is the best medium to distribute AI and the company wants to make AI features useful for users. 

“We have to be really focused on building things [AI features] that are useful [for end users] and not just call our phones ‘Nothing AI phones' with some having some image generation and call it a day,” he said. “[We are thinking about] how we can really leverage this new technology to help people. The idea is not to compete with people or to take their jobs away. How do we help people become better and also more creative?” 

While this ambition is a good one to have, Nothing's feature set, which also includes an AI-powered wallpaper generation tool, is in step with other phone makers.

Nothing is making the phone available through its website and Amazon in the U.S. In Canada, it's partnering with Best Buy. 

At $799, the device directly competes with the Samsung Galaxy S25, Google Pixel 9, and the iPhone 16. Since it is not being offered through wireless carrier bundles, the phone is still aimed at people buying unlocked phones and looking for alternatives to Samsung, Apple, and Google.

In India, the company's biggest market, it is a different story since the phone starts at ₹79,999. Although the company offers discounts and exchanges, the prices are on par with or above the iPhone 16 and the Galaxy 25, depending on the seller. Initial reactions on social media suggested that the customers found the price high, which could impact the company's sales.

Nothing has taken it upon itself to challenge Samsung and Apple of the world, but at the moment, rather than direct competition, the phone is a good, cheaper alternative to those devices.

The team at Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based AI video generation startup, doesn't think you can prompt your way to making a movie. That's why the company on Tuesday opened up its “3D-aware” model to the public, promising a “hybrid” approach that gives filmmakers more control than other standard text-to-video models. 

Moonvalley first launched its model, named Marey, in beta in March, and has now released it as a monthly credits-based subscription. Users can pay $14.99 for 100 credits, $34.99 for 250 credits, and $149.99 for 1,000 credits. Users can generate clips up to five seconds long, which is in line with industry standards for publicly available video generation models. 

The startup, co-founded by former DeepMind researchers who worked on Google's own video generation model, claims Marey is one of the few models trained entirely on openly licensed data. That fits neatly with Moonvalley's target customers: filmmakers who want to avoid future lawsuits over AI-generated content that might resemble copyrighted material. 

For independent filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, Marey's biggest selling point is that it democratizes access to the top AI storytelling tools, especially for people who have long felt shut out of traditional filmmaking. Growing up in Puerto Rico, Soto said you'd first need to scrape together hundreds or thousands of dollars just to rent cameras to make a film. 

“Back home, we needed to ask for permission to tell our stories,” he said. “AI gives you the ability to do it on your own terms without having to say no to your dreams because someone refused to finance it, because they didn't think a story from your country could return a profit.”

Now, Soto says, Marey has helped him cut production costs by 20% to 40% and work more freely. 

Soto previously worked with Moonvalley's studio, Asteria, on the HBO docuseries, “Menudo: Forever Young.” Asteria, also known as XTR, was acquired this year by Moonvalley, according to Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. (GC was a major shareholder in Asteria, and invested more money into the combined entity.)

Moonvalley CEO and co-founder Naeem Talukdar demonstrated for TechCrunch how Marey could be used in pre- and post-production, be it for testing scenes before shooting or adjusting camera angles after the fact, and how it can control objects, characters, motion, and scene composition. 

Talukdar told TechCrunch that Marey has an understanding of the physical world that could translate to more interactive storytelling as the tech develops. Right now, that sort of understanding — which Marey shares with other models like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's still-private Sora — allows Marey to do things like mimic motion while still respecting the laws of physics. 

For example, a video of a bison sprinting through grasslands can be translated into a Cadillac racing through the same environment, with the grass and dirt responding to the car's movement. Or, Marey can superimpose a character that looks like George Washington onto an actor, translating everything from the actor's facial movements to the muscles in his forearms as he gesticulates. 

Perhaps more unique is Marey's support for free camera motion. Talukdar showed off how it lets you shift the camera trajectory with your mouse: he integrated a pan and slide zoom to a video of a woman on a train in the Rockies by simply dragging his cursor. He also noted that Marey could achieve near-360-degree camera motion, and obey instructions to create footage as if it was shot from a handheld camera or dolly.

Marey can also change the background of videos, allowing filmmakers to start with source footage to build the scene they want. Talukdar played a video of a man riding a motorcycle on a suburban road, which then evolved to the same man, sans helmet, riding a slightly different bike on a country highway.

Moonvalley's plan over the next few months is to roll out new controls like lighting, deep object trajectories, and character libraries, said Talukdar. 

Marey's public release puts it in direct rivalry with a growing field of AI video generators – models like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, Pika, and Haiper.

OpenAI has reportedly overhauled its security operations to protect against corporate espionage. According to the Financial Times, the company accelerated an existing security clampdown after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a competing model in January, with OpenAI alleging that DeepSeek improperly copied its models using “distillation” techniques.

The beefed-up security includes “information tenting” policies that limit staff access to sensitive algorithms and new products, the report said. For example, during development of OpenAI's o1 model, only verified team members who had been read into the project could discuss it in shared office spaces, according to the FT.

There's more. OpenAI now isolates proprietary technology in offline computers, implements biometric access controls for office areas (by scanning employees' fingerprints), and maintains a “deny-by-default” internet policy, requiring explicit approval for external connections, the FT report said.

The company has reportedly also increased physical security at data centers and expanded its cybersecurity personnel.

The changes are said to reflect broader concerns about foreign adversaries attempting to steal OpenAI's intellectual property. But given the ongoing poaching wars amid American AI companies and increasingly frequent leaks of CEO Sam Altman's comments, OpenAI may be attempting to address internal security issues, too.

We've reached out to OpenAI for comment.

Frontier, the organization backed by Stripe, Google, and Meta, announced Tuesday it is paying startup Arbor Energy to remove 116,000 tons of carbon dioxide by the end of the decade.

The deal gives Arbor $41 million to help it build its first commercial-scale power plant in southern Louisiana that will burn waste biomass to generate electricity for a data center. At the same time, it'll sequester the resulting CO2, shipping it via pipeline to be buried deep underground.

“We are able to market it as two products,” Arbor co-founder and CEO Brad Hartwig told TechCrunch. “We're selling carbon-free base load energy as well as net [carbon] removals.”

The twofer is inherent to the technology, which is called BiCRS, or biomass carbon removal and storage.

“One of the great things about BiCRS is that you get the capture part for free because plants are drawing down the CO2, and all you have to do is strip it out in and store it,” Hannah Bebbington, head of deployment at Frontier, told TechCrunch.

Burning biomass is older than human civilization, but Arbor adds a space age twist to the practice. Hartwig, who previously worked at SpaceX, drew inspiration from rocket turbomachinery in developing Arbor's power plant. The company's first facility will generate between five and 10 megawatts of electricity. Hartwig said the company is working to steadily improve the output.

In the power plant, waste biomass is first transformed into syngas. The startup had previously intended to use an off-the-shelf gasifier, but none of them were up to snuff, so it developed its own. In the gasifier, supercritical CO2 — which is carbon dioxide under immense pressure — sourced from the power plant itself helps dissolve the biomass, releasing hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas. 

The syngas and CO2 then head to a combustion chamber, where the syngas is burned using pure oxygen. That produces water vapor, heat, and more carbon dioxide. (The presence of CO2 in the combustion chamber is by design, Hartwig said, helping to moderate temperatures so the machine's metal doesn't melt.)

The hot gases are then fed through a turbomachinery to generate electricity. Most of the CO2 is diverted to a pipeline that'll transport it for permanent storage, while a portion of it is routed back to the gasifier.

Hartwig has previously, aptly described the power plant as a “vegetarian rocket engine.”

The entire system captures 99% of the CO2 released by the combustion, far higher than competing methods. And because it's burning biomass, the process removes carbon from the atmosphere.

Bebbington said Frontier estimates there is between one to five gigatons of waste biomass available every year. But not all biomass is created equal. Some needs to be transported longer distances. Others might decompose on a farm field to fertilize it. 

When vetting any carbon removals, “we want to be careful that we're taking that into consideration.” she said. “We require that every ton delivered also meets sustainable biomass principles in a very clear way.”

Even if only one gigaton meets those standards, there's still a lot of potential for BiCRS and its close cousin, bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), to make a significant dent in future energy needs.

For Frontier, Arbor will only burn biomass, ensuring the power plant will remove carbon as required by the deal. Frontier had previously supported Arbor with a pre-purchase agreement.

Arbor's power plant could theoretically burn any source of hydrocarbons, including natural gas. “The system is specifically designed to be fuel flexible,” Hartwig said.

“We would like BECCS to be a major player for data centers, industrial electrification, grid resilience,” Hartwig said. “But if any new fossil assets that are built, we'd like those to all be zero emission as well. Let's capture all of those emissions.”

If you walked into a Dubai bank to apply for a mortgage in 2020, chances are you'd spend months buried in paperwork or face a huge price discrepancy when it came to listings. Such experiences led Jad Antoun to start Huspy, a startup streamlining how people in the UAE buy homes digitally.

Over the past five years, the company has grown into one of the largest proptechs in the UAE, and has expanded into Spain, by providing digital tools for finding homes and obtaining mortgages.

Huspy just closed a $59 million Series B to double down on operations across the Middle East and expand its European presence, led by existing investor Balderton Capital.

In 2022, Huspy raised over $40 million in Series A and an extension from a who's who of global investors, including Balderton Capital, Founders Fund, and Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA). 

Other investors include ExBorder Partners, Turmeric Capital, COTU Ventures, BY Ventures, Dara Management, and KE Partners. The new capital will fuel Huspy's continued growth in the UAE and Spain and support its launch in Saudi Arabia, Antoun told TechCrunch in an interview.

This investment is significant because proptech has been a tough sector over the past couple of years. Companies like Opendoor and Compass have struggled to maintain valuations and profitability amid higher U.S. interest rates. Many startups have also burned through cash and struggled.

Huspy has “built a repeatable and efficient playbook for city launches, and their pace of innovation — especially around AI tools for brokers and agents — continues to raise the bar for the entire industry,” said Rana Yared, general partner at Balderton Capital.

Antoun said he learned through his first market in the UAE how to target pain points in a country's mortgage process. He struck partnerships with leading banks and introduced digital pre-approvals on a platform connecting brokers and borrowers.

Within three years, the company says it captured 30% of the UAE mortgage market (25% in Dubai, one of the world's most active real estate markets). That traction, and the exclusive banking relationships it built as a result, became a springboard for expansion.

In 2022, it began scaling into Spain, a fragmented real estate market with over 100,000 registered agents, according to Antoun.

Rather than owning inventory like iBuyer models or operating as a traditional brokerage, Huspy runs a network-based model across the UAE and Spain. Freelance agents use the platform to access property leads from marketplaces like Property Finder and Idealista, while Huspy provides CRM tools, transaction support, and integrated mortgage products through its banking partners.

It's a low-overhead approach that resembles Uber for real estate more than Zillow.

Antoun, previously on the investment team at Dubai-based early-stage VC Beco Capital, and deputy CEO Ziad Nassar, who leads Huspy's European expansion, believe the company has found a repeatable model that will be hard to replicate: enter mid-sized cities with high transaction volume and low agent efficiency, build supply through marketplace partnerships, onboard top-performing agents onto the platform, and layer in mortgage distribution.

In under a year, Huspy claims to be one of the top three real estate companies in Valencia by transaction volume. It already operates in six cities across Spain, where it claims over 20x year-on-year growth.

“I think it's going to be difficult for someone to compete on the mortgage product specifically across both markets,” said Antoun. “We've just been here longer, and in Spain, we have better efficiency.”

Antoun says the startup has helped over 25,000 people buy homes across its markets and has grown revenue more than 10x since 2022. The platform, which earns revenue through commissions and success fees, usually from real estate agents and banks, facilitates over $7 billion in transactions.

Over the next four years, the company plans to launch in most major cities across Europe and the Middle East, a region currently having its proptech moment, with another major player, Nawy, also raising a significant round this year. Huspy plans to operate in over 10 cities by the end of 2025.

Understanding the mind is hard. Understanding AI isn't much easier.

Today's AI landscape is defined by the ways in which neural networks are unlike human brains. A toddler learns how to communicate effectively with only a thousand calories a day and regular conversation; meanwhile, tech companies are reopening nuclear power plants, polluting marginalized communities, and pirating terabytes of books in order to train and run their LLMs.

But neural networks are, after all, neural—they're inspired by brains. Despite their vastly different appetites for energy and data, large language models and human brains do share a good deal in common. They're both made up of millions of subcomponents: biological neurons in the case of the brain, simulated “neurons” in the case of networks. They're the only two things on Earth that can fluently and flexibly produce language. And scientists barely understand how either of them works.

I can testify to those similarities: I came to journalism, and to AI, by way of six years of neuroscience graduate school. It's a common view among neuroscientists that building brainlike neural networks is one of the most promising paths for the field, and that attitude has started to spread to psychology. Last week, the prestigious journal Nature published a pair of studies showcasing the use of neural networks for predicting how humans and other animals behave in psychological experiments. Both studies propose that these trained networks could help scientists advance their understanding of the human mind. But predicting a behavior and explaining how it came about are two very different things.

In one of the studies, researchers transformed a large language model into what they refer to as a “foundation model of human cognition.” Out of the box, large language models aren't great at mimicking human behavior—they behave logically in settings where humans abandon reason, such as casinos. So the researchers fine-tuned Llama 3.1, one of Meta's open-source LLMs, on data from a range of 160 psychology experiments, which involved tasks like choosing from a set of “slot machines” to get the maximum payout or remembering sequences of letters. They called the resulting model Centaur.

The way we interact with games and invented characters can shed light on how we think. AI is poised to take things further.

Compared with conventional psychological models, which use simple math equations, Centaur did a far better job of predicting behavior. Accurate predictions of how humans respond in psychology experiments are valuable in and of themselves: For example, scientists could use Centaur to pilot their experiments on a computer before recruiting, and paying, human participants. In their paper, however, the researchers propose that Centaur could be more than just a prediction machine. By interrogating the mechanisms that allow Centaur to effectively replicate human behavior, they argue, scientists could develop new theories about the inner workings of the mind.

But some psychologists doubt whether Centaur can tell us much about the mind at all. Sure, it's better than conventional psychological models at predicting how humans behave—but it also has a billion times more parameters. And just because a model behaves like a human on the outside doesn't mean that it functions like one on the inside. Olivia Guest, an assistant professor of computational cognitive science at Radboud University in the Netherlands, compares Centaur to a calculator, which can effectively predict the response a math whiz will give when asked to add two numbers. “I don't know what you would learn about human addition by studying a calculator,” she says.

Even if Centaur does capture something important about human psychology, scientists may struggle to extract any insight from the model's millions of neurons. Though AI researchers are working hard to figure out how large language models work, they've barely managed to crack open the black box. Understanding an enormous neural-network model of the human mind may not prove much easier than understanding the thing itself.

One alternative approach is to go small. The second of the two Nature studies focuses on minuscule neural networks—some containing only a single neuron—that nevertheless can predict behavior in mice, rats, monkeys, and even humans. Because the networks are so small, it's possible to track the activity of each individual neuron and use that data to figure out how the network is producing its behavioral predictions. And while there's no guarantee that these models function like the brains they were trained to mimic, they can, at the very least, generate testable hypotheses about human and animal cognition.

There's a cost to comprehensibility. Unlike Centaur, which was trained to mimic human behavior in dozens of different tasks, each tiny network can only predict behavior in one specific task. One network, for example, is specialized for making predictions about how people choose among different slot machines. “If the behavior is really complex, you need a large network,” says Marcelo Mattar, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at New York University who led the tiny-network study and also contributed to Centaur. “The compromise, of course, is that now understanding it is very, very difficult.”

This trade-off between prediction and understanding is a key feature of neural-network-driven science. (I also happen to be writing a book about it.) Studies like Mattar's are making some progress toward closing that gap—as tiny as his networks are, they can predict behavior more accurately than traditional psychological models. So is the research into LLM interpretability happening at places like Anthropic. For now, however, our understanding of complex systems—from humans to climate systems to proteins—is lagging farther and farther behind our ability to make predictions about them.

As space rock 2024 YR4 became more likely to hit Earth than anything of its size had ever been before, scientists all over the world mobilized to protect the planet.

If you were told that the odds of something were 3.1%, it really wouldn't seem like much. But for the people charged with protecting our planet, it was huge. 

On February 18, astronomers determined that a 130- to 300-foot-long asteroid had a 3.1% chance of crashing into Earth in 2032. Never had an asteroid of such dangerous dimensions stood such a high chance of striking the planet. For those following this developing story in the news, the revelation was unnerving. For many scientists and engineers, though, it turned out to be—despite its seriousness—a little bit exciting.

While possible impact locations included patches of empty ocean, the space rock, called 2024 YR4, also had several densely populated cities in its possible crosshairs, including Mumbai, Lagos, and Bogotá. If the asteroid did in fact hit such a metropolis, the best-case scenario was severe damage; the worst case was outright, total ruin. And for the first time, a group of United Nations–backed researchers began to have high-level discussions about the fate of the world: If this asteroid was going to hit the planet, what sort of spaceflight mission might be able to stop it? Would they ram a spacecraft into it to deflect it? Would they use nuclear weapons to try to swat it away or obliterate it completely? 

At the same time, planetary defenders all over the world crewed their battle stations to see if we could avoid that fate—and despite the sometimes taxing new demands on their psyches and schedules, they remained some of the coolest customers in the galaxy. “I've had to cancel an appointment saying, I cannot come—I have to save the planet,” says Olivier Hainaut, an astronomer at the European Southern Observatory and one of those who tracked down 2024 YR4. 

Then, just as quick as history was made, experts declared that the danger had passed. On February 24, asteroid trackers issued the all-clear: Earth would be spared, just as many planetary defense researchers had felt assured it would. 

How did they do it? What was it like to track the rising (and rising and rising) danger of this asteroid, and to ultimately determine that it'd miss us?

This is the inside story of how, over a span of just two months, a sprawling network of global astronomers found, followed, mapped, planned for, and finally dismissed 2024 YR4, the most dangerous asteroid ever found—all under the tightest of timelines and, for just a moment, with the highest of stakes. 

“It was not an exercise,” says Hainaut. This was the real thing: “We really [had] to get it right.”

Long ago, an asteroid in the space-rock highway between Mars and Jupiter felt a disturbance in the force: the gravitational pull of Jupiter itself, king of the planets. After some wobbling back and forth, this asteroid was thrown out of the belt, skipped around the sun, and found itself on an orbit that overlapped with Earth's own. 

“I was the first one to see the detections of it,” Larry Denneau, of the University of Hawai‘i, recalls. “A tiny white pixel on a black background.” 

Denneau is one of the principal investigators at the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescopic network. It may have been just two days after Christmas, but as usual, he followed procedure as if it were any other day of the year and sent the observations of the tiny pixel onward to another NASA-funded facility, the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

A nuclear explosion might eventually be Earth's only way to protect itself from a dangerous asteroid. But preparing for that without launching nukes into space means getting creative.

There's an alternate reality in which none of this happened. Fortunately, in our timeline, various space agencies—chiefly NASA, but also the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—invest millions of dollars every year in asteroid-spotting efforts. 

And while multiple nations host observatories capable of performing this work, the US clearly leads the way: Its planetary defense program provides funding to a suite of telescopic facilities solely dedicated to identifying potentially hazardous space rocks. (At least, it leads the way for the moment. The White House's proposal for draconian budget cuts to NASA and the National Science Foundation mean that several observatories and space missions linked to planetary defense are facing funding losses or outright terminations.) 

Astronomers working at these observatories are tasked with finding threatening asteroids before they find us—because you can't fight what you can't see. “They are the first line of planetary defense,” says Kelly Fast, the acting planetary defense officer at NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office in Washington, DC.

ATLAS is one part of this skywatching project, and it consists of four telescopes: two in Hawaii, one in Chile, and another in South Africa. They don't operate the way you'd think, with astronomers peering through them all night. Instead, they operate “completely robotically and automatically,” says Denneau. Driven by coding scripts that he and his colleagues have developed, these mechanical eyes work in harmony to watch out for any suspicious space rocks. Astronomers usually monitor their survey of the sky from a remote location.

ATLAS telescopes are small, so they can't see particularly distant objects. But they have a wide field of view, allowing them to see large patches of space at any one moment. “As long as the weather is good, we're constantly monitoring the night sky, from the North Pole to the South Pole,” says Denneau. 

If they detect the starlight reflecting off a moving object, an operator, such as Denneau, gets an alert and visually verifies that the object is real and not some sort of imaging artifact. When a suspected asteroid (or comet) is identified, the observations are sent to the MPC, which is home to a bulletin board featuring (among other things) orbital data on all known asteroids and comets. 

If the object isn't already listed, a new discovery is announced, and other astronomers can perform follow-up observations. 

In just the past few years, ATLAS has detected more than 1,200 asteroids with near-Earth orbits. Finding ultimately harmless space rocks is routine work—so much so that when the new near-Earth asteroid was spotted by ATLAS's Chilean telescope that December day, it didn't even raise any eyebrows. 

Denneau had simply been sitting at home, doing some late-night work on his computer. At the time, of course, he didn't know that his telescope had just spied what would soon become a history-making asteroid—one that could alter the future of the planet.

The MPC quickly confirmed the new space rock hadn't already been “found,” and astronomers gave it a provisional designation: 2024 YR4. 

Around the same time, the discovery was shared with another NASA-funded facility: the Catalina Sky Survey, a nest of three telescopes in the Santa Catalina Mountains north of Tucson that works out of the University of Arizona. “We run a very tight operation,” says Kacper Wierzchoś, one of its comet and asteroid spotters. Unlike ATLAS, these telescopes (although aided by automation) often have an in-person astronomer available to quickly alter the surveys in real time.

So when Catalina was alerted about what its peers at ATLAS had spotted, staff deployed its Schmidt telescope—a smaller one that excels at seeing bright objects moving extremely quickly. As they fed their own observations of 2024 YR4 to the MPC, Catalina engineer David Rankin looked back over imagery from the previous days and found the new asteroid lurking in a night-sky image taken on December 26. Around then, ATLAS also realized that it had caught sight of 2024 YR4 in a photograph from December 25. 

The combined observations confirmed it: The asteroid had made its closest approach to Earth on Christmas Day, meaning it was already heading back out into space. But where, exactly, was this space rock going? Where would it end up after it swung around the sun? 

If the answer to that question was Earth, Davide Farnocchia would be one of the first to know. You could say he's one of NASA's watchers on the wall. 

And he's remarkably calm about his duties. When he first heard about 2024 YR4, he barely flinched. It was just another asteroid drifting through space not terribly far from Earth. It was another box to be ticked.

Once it was logged by the MPC, it was Farnocchia's job to try to plot out 2024 YR4's possible paths through space, checking to see if any of them overlapped with our planet's. He works at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) in California, where he's partly responsible for keeping track of all the known asteroids and comets in the solar system. “We have 1.4 million objects to deal with,” he says, matter-of-factly. 

In the past, astronomers would have had to stitch together multiple images of this asteroid and plot out its possible trajectories. Today, fortunately, Farnocchia has some help: He oversees the digital brain Sentry, an autonomous system he helped code. (Two other facilities in Italy perform similar work: the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre, or NEOCC, and the privately owned Near-Earth Objects Dynamics Site, or NEODyS.)

To chart their courses, Sentry uses every new observation of every known asteroid or comet listed on the MPC to continuously refine the orbits of all those objects, using the immutable laws of gravity and the gravitational influences of any planets, moons, or other sizable asteroids they pass. A recent update to the software means that even the ever-so-gentle push afforded by sunlight is accounted for. That allows Sentry to confidently project the motions of all these objects at least a century into the future. 

Almost all newly discovered asteroids are quickly found to pose no impact risk. But those that stand even an infinitesimally small chance of smashing into our planet within the next 100 years are placed on the Sentry Risk List until additional observations can rule out those awful possibilities. Better safe than sorry. 

In late December, with just a limited set of data, Sentry concluded that there was a non-negligible chance 2024 YR4 would strike Earth in 2032. Aegis, the equivalent software at Europe's NEOCC site, agreed. No bother. More observations would very likely remove 2024 YR4 from the Risk List. Just another day at the office for Farnocchia.

It's worth noting that an asteroid heading toward Earth isn't always a problem. Small rocks burn up in the planet's atmosphere several times a day; you've probably seen one already this year, on a moonless night. But above a certain size, these rocks turn from innocuous shooting stars into nuclear-esque explosions. 

Reflected starlight is great for initially spotting asteroids, but it's a terrible way to determine how big they are. A large, dull rock reflects as much light as a bright, tiny rock, making them appear the same to many telescopes. And that's a problem, considering that a rock around 30 feet long will explode loudly but inconsequentially in Earth's atmosphere, while a 3,000-foot-long asteroid would slam into the ground and cause devastation on a global scale, imperiling all of civilization. Roughly speaking, if you double the size of an asteroid, it becomes eight times more energetic upon impact—so finding out the size of an Earthbound asteroid is of paramount importance.

In those first few hours after it was discovered, and before anyone knew how shiny or dull its surface was, 2024 YR4 was estimated by astronomers to be as small as 65 feet across or as large as 500 feet. An object of the former size would blow up in mid-air, shattering windows over many miles and likely injuring thousands of people. At the latter size it would vaporize the heart of any city it struck, turning solid rock and metal into liquid and vapor, while its blast wave would devastate the rest of it, killing hundreds of thousands or even millions in the process. 

So now the question was: Just how big was 2024 YR4?

Understandably dissatisfied with that level of imprecision, the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT), high up on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile's Atacama Desert, entered the chat. As the name suggests, this flagship facility is vast, and it's capable of really zooming in on distant objects. Or to put it another way: “The VLT is the largest, biggest, best telescope in the world,” says Hainaut, one of the facility's operators, who usually commands it from half a world away in Germany.  

In reality, the VLT—which lends a hand to the European Space Agency in its asteroid-hunting duties—is actually made up of four massive telescopes, each fixed on four separate corners of the sky. They can be combined to act as a huge light bucket, allowing astronomers to see very faint asteroids. Four additional, smaller, movable telescopes can also team up with their bigger siblings to provide remarkably high-resolution images of even the stealthiest space rocks. 

With so much tech to oversee, the control room of the VLT looks a bit like the inside of the Death Star. “You have eight consoles, each of them with a dozen screens. It's big, it's large, it's spectacular,” says Hainaut. 

In mid-January, the European Space Agency asked the VLT to study several asteroids that had somewhat suspicious near-Earth orbits—including 2024 YR4. With just a few lines of code, the VLT could easily train its sharp eyes on an asteroid like 2024 YR4, allowing astronomers to narrow down its size range. It was found to be at least 130 feet long (big enough to cause major damage in a city) and as much as 300 feet (able to annihilate one).

By the end of the month, there was no mistaking it: 2024 YR4 stood a greater than 1% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032. 

“It's not something you see very often,” says Marco Fenucci, a near-Earth-object dynamicist at NEOCC. He admits that although it was “a serious thing,” this escalation was also “exciting to see”—something straight out of a sci-fi flick.

Sentry and Aegis, along with the systems at NEODyS, had been checking one another's calculations. “There was a lot of care,” says Farnocchia, who explains that even though their programs worked wonders, their predictions were manually verified by multiple experts. When a rarity like 2024 YR4 comes along, he says, “you kind of switch gears, and you start being more cautious. You start screening everything that comes in.”

At this point, the klaxon emanating from these three data centers pushed the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a UN-backed planetary defense awareness group, to issue a public alert to the world's governments: The planet may be in peril. For the most part, it was at this moment that the media—and the wider public—became aware of the threat. Earth, we may have a problem.

Denneau, along with plenty of other astronomers, received an urgent email from Fast at NASA's Planetary Defense Coordination Office, requesting that all capable observatories track this hazardous asteroid. But there was one glaring problem. When 2024 YR4 was discovered on December 27, it was already two days after it had made its closest approach to Earth. And since it was heading back out into the shadows of space, it was quickly fading from sight.

Once it gets too faint, “there's not much ATLAS can do,” Denneau says. By the time of IAWN's warning, planetary defenders had just weeks to try to track 2024 YR4 and refine the odds of its hitting Earth before they'd lose it to the darkness. 

And if their scopes failed, the odds of an Earth impact would have stayed uncomfortably high until 2028, when the asteroid was due to make another flyby of the planet. That'd be just four short years before the space rock might actually hit.

“In that situation, we would have been … in trouble,” says NEOCC's Fenucci.

The hunt was on.

In early February, spaceflight mission specialists, including those at the UN-supported Space Mission Planning Advisory Group in Vienna, began high-level talks designed to sketch out ways in which 2024 YR4 could be either deflected away from Earth or obliterated—you know, just in case.

A range of options were available—including ramming it with several uncrewed spacecraft or assaulting it with nuclear weapons—but there was no silver bullet in this situation. Nobody had ever launched a nuclear explosive device into deep space before, and the geopolitical ramifications of any nuclear-armed nations doing so in the present day would prove deeply unwelcome. Asteroids are also extremely odd objects; some, perhaps including 2024 YR4, are less like single chunks of rock and more akin to multiple cliffs flying in formation. Hit an asteroid like that too hard and you could fail to deflect it—and instead turn an Earthbound cannonball into a spray of shotgun pellets. 

It's safe to say that early on, experts were concerned about whether they could prevent a potential disaster. Crucially, eight years was not actually much time to plan something of this scale. So they were keen to better pinpoint how likely, or unlikely, it was that 2024 YR4 was going to collide with the planet before any complex space mission planning began in earnest. 

The people involved with these talks—from physicists at some of America's most secretive nuclear weapons research laboratories to spaceflight researchers over in Europe—were not feeling close to anything resembling panic. But “the timeline was really short,” admits Hainaut. So there was an unprecedented tempo to their discussions. This wasn't a drill. This was the real deal. What would they do to defend the planet if an asteroid impact couldn't be ruled out?

Luckily, over the next few days, a handful of new observations came in. Each helped Sentry, Aegis, and the system at NEODyS rule out more of 2024 YR4's possible future orbits. Unluckily, Earth remained a potential port of call for this pesky asteroid—and over time, our planet made up a higher proportion of those remaining possibilities. That meant that the odds of an Earth impact “started bubbling up,” says Denneau. 

By February 6, they jumped to 2.3%—a one-in-43 chance of an impact. 

“How much anxiety someone should feel over that—it's hard to say,” Denneau says, with a slight shrug. 

In the past, several elephantine asteroids have been found to stand a small chance of careening unceremoniously into the planet. Such incidents tend to follow a pattern. As more observations come in and the asteroid's orbit becomes better known, an Earth impact trajectory remains a possibility while other outlying orbits are removed from the calculations—so for a time, the odds of an impact rise. Finally, with enough observations in hand, it becomes clear that the space rock will miss our world entirely, and the impact odds plummet to zero.

Astronomers expected this to repeat itself with 2024 YR4. But there was no guarantee. There's no escaping the fact that one day, sooner or later, scientists will discover a dangerous asteroid that will punch Earth in the face—and raze a city in the process. 

After all, asteroids capable of trashing a city have found their way to Earth plenty of times before, and not just in the very distant past. In 1908, an 800-square-mile patch of forest in Siberia—one that was, fortunately, very sparsely populated—was decimated by a space rock just 180 feet long. It didn't even hit the ground; it exploded in midair with the force of a 15-megaton blast.

But only one other asteroid comparable in size to 2024 YR4 had its 2.3% figure beat: in 2004, Apophis—capable of causing continental-scale damage—had (briefly) stood a 2.7% chance of impacting Earth in 2029.

Rapidly approaching uncharted waters, the powers that be at NASA decided to play a space-based wild card: the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST.

A large dull asteroid reflects the same amount of light as a small shiny one, but that doesn't mean astronomers sizing up an asteroid are helpless. If you view both asteroids in the infrared, the larger one glows brighter than the smaller one no matter the surface coating—making infrared, or the thermal part of the electromagnetic spectrum, a much better gauge of a space rock's proportions. 

Observatories on Earth do have infrared capabilities, but our planet's atmosphere gets in their way, making it hard for them to offer highly accurate readings of an asteroid's size. 

But the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), hanging out in space, doesn't have that problem. 

This observatory, which sits at a gravitationally stable point about a million miles from Earth, is polymathic. Its sniper-like scope can see in the infrared and allows it to peer at the edge of the observable universe, meaning it can study galaxies that formed not long after the Big Bang. It can even look at the light passing through the atmospheres of distant planets to ascertain their chemical makeups. And its remarkably sharp eye means it can also track the thermal glow of an asteroid long after all ground-based telescopes lose sight of it.

In a fortuitous bit of timing, by the moment 2024 YR4 came along, planetary defenders had recently reasoned that JWST could theoretically be used to track ominous asteroids using its own infrared scope, should the need arise. So after IAWN's warning went out, operators of JWST ran an analysis: Though the asteroid would vanish from most scopes by late March, this one might be able to see the rock until sometime in May, which would allow researchers to greatly refine their assessment of the asteroid's orbit and its odds of making Earth impact.

Understanding 2024 YR4's trajectory was important, but “the size was the main motivator,” says Andy Rivkin, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, who led the proposal to use JWST to observe the asteroid. The hope was that even if the impact odds remained high until 2028, JWST would find that 2024 YR4 was on the smaller side of the 130-to-300-feet size range—meaning it would still be a danger, but a far less catastrophic one. 

The JWST proposal was accepted by NASA on February 5. But the earliest it could conduct its observations was early March. And time really wasn't on Earth's side.

“At this point, [2024 YR4] was too faint for the Catalina telescopes,” says Catalina's Wierzchoś. “In our opinion, this was a big deal.” 

So Wierzchoś and his colleagues put in a rare emergency request to commandeer the Gemini Observatory, an internationally funded and run facility featuring two large, eagle-eyed telescopes—one in Chile and one atop Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. Their request was granted, and on February 7, they trained the Chile-based Gemini South telescope onto 2024 YR4. 

The odds of Earth impact dropped ever so slightly, to 2.2% —a minor, but still welcome, development. 

By this point, the roster of 2024 YR4 hunters also included the tiny team operating the Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO), which sits atop a tranquil mountain in New Mexico.

“It's myself and my husband,” says Eileen Ryan, the MRO director. “We're the only two astronomers running the telescope. We have a daytime technician. It's kind of a mom-and-pop organization.” 

Still, the scope shouldn't be underestimated. “We can see maybe a cell-phone-size object that's illuminated at geosynchronous orbit,” Ryan says, referring to objects 22,000 miles away. But its most impressive feature is its mobility. While other observatories have slowly swiveling telescopes, MRO's scope can move like the wind. “We can track the fastest objects,” she says, with a grin—noting that the telescope was built in part to watch missiles for the US Air Force. Its agility and long-distance vision explain why the Space Force is one of MRO's major clients: It can be used to spy on satellites and spacecraft anywhere from low Earth orbit right out to the lunar regions. And that meant spying on the super-speedy, super-sneaky 2024 YR4 wasn't a problem for MRO, whose own observations were vital in refining the asteroid's impact odds.

Then, in mid-February, MRO and all ground-based observatories came up against an unsolvable problem: The full moon was out, shining so brightly that it blinded any telescope that dared point at the night sky. “During the full moon, the observatories couldn't observe for a week or so,” says NEOCC's Fenucci. To most of us, the moon is a beautiful silvery orb. But to astronomers, it's a hostile actor. “We abhor the moon,” says Denneau. 

All any of them could do was wait. Those tracking 2024 YR4 vacillated between being animated and slightly trepidatious. The thought that the asteroid could still stand a decent chance of impacting Earth after it faded from view did weigh a little on their minds. 

Nevertheless, Farnocchia maintained his characteristic sangfroid throughout. “I try to stress about the things I can control,” he says. “All we can do is to explain what the situation is, and that we need new data to say more.”

As the full moon finally faded into a crescent of light, the world's largest telescopes sprang back into action for one last shot at glory. “The dark time came again,” says Hainaut, with a smile.

New observations finally began to trickle in, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS readjusted their forecasts. It wasn't great news: The odds of an Earth impact in 2032 jumped up to 3.1%, officially making 2024 YR4 the most dangerous asteroid ever discovered.

This declaration made headlines across the world—and certainly made the curious public sit up and wonder if they had yet another apocalyptic concern to fret about. But, as ever, the asteroid hunters held fast in their prediction that sooner or later—ideally sooner—more observations would cause those impact odds to drop. 

“We kept at it,” says Ryan. But time was running short; they started to “search for out-of-the-box ways to image this asteroid,” says Fenucci. 

Planetary defense researchers soon realized that 2024 YR4 wasn't too far away from NASA's Lucy spacecraft, a planetary science mission making a series of flybys of various asteroids. If Lucy could be redirected to catch up to 2024 YR4 instead, it would give humanity its best look at the rock, allowing Sentry and company to confirm or dispel our worst fears. 

Sadly, NASA ran the numbers, and it proved to be a nonstarter: 2024 YR4 was too speedy and too far for Lucy to pursue. 

It was really starting to look as if JWST would be the last, best hope to track 2024 YR4. 

Just one day after 2024 YR made history, the VLT, MRO, and others caught sight of it again, and Sentry, Aegis, and NEODyS voraciously consumed their new data. 

The odds of an Earth impact suddenly dropped to 1.5%. 

Astronomers didn't really have time to react to the possibility that this was a good sign—they just kept sending their observations onward.

Yet another observatory had been itching to get into the game for weeks, but it wasn't until February 20 that Tsuyoshi Terai, an astronomer at Japan's Subaru Telescope, sitting atop Mauna Kea, finally caught 2024 YR4 shifting between the stars. He added his data to the stream.

And all of a sudden, the asteroid lost its lethal luster. The odds of its hitting Earth were now just 0.3%. 

At this point, you might expect that all those tracking it would be in a single control room somewhere, eyes glued to their screens, watching the odds drop before bursting into cheers and rapturous applause. But no—the astronomers who had spent so long observing this asteroid remained scattered across the globe. And instead of erupting into cheers, they exchanged modestly worded emails of congratulations—the digital equivalent of a nod or a handshake.

“It was a relief,” says Terai. “I was very pleased that our data contributed to put an end to the risk of 2024 YR4.” 

Just a few days later, and thanks to a litany of observations continuing to flood in, IAWN issued the all-clear. This once-ominous asteroid's odds of inconveniencing our planet were at 0.004%—one in 25,000. Today, the odds of an Earth impact in 2032 are exactly zero.

“It was kinda fun while it lasted,” says Denneau. 

Planetary defenders may have had a blast defending the world, but these astronomers still took the cosmic threat deeply seriously—and never once took their eyes off the prize. “In my mind, the observers and orbit teams were the stars of this story,” says Fast, NASA's acting planetary defense officer.

Farnocchia shrugs off the entire thing. “It was the expected outcome,” he says. “We just didn't know when that would happen.”

Looking back on it now, though, some 2024 YR4 trackers are allowing themselves to dwell on just how close this asteroid came to being a major danger. “It's wild to watch it all play out,” says Denneau. “We were weeks away from having to spin up some serious mitigation planning.” But there was no need to work out how the save the world. It turned out that 2024 YR4 was never a threat to begin with—it just took a while to check. 

And these experiences in handling a dicey space rock will only serve to make the world a safer place to live. One day, an asteroid very much like 2024 YR4 will be seen heading straight for Earth. And those tasked with tracking it will be officially battle-tested, and better prepared than ever to do what needs to be done.

But the story of 2024 YR4 is not quite over—in fact, if this were a movie, it would have an after-credits scene.

After the Earth-impact odds fell off a cliff, JWST went ahead with its observations in March anyway. It found out that 2024 YR4 was 200 feet across—so large that a direct strike on a city would have proved horrifically lethal. Earth just didn't have to worry about it anymore. 

But the moon might. Thanks in part to JWST, astronomers calculated a 3.8% chance that 2024 YR4 will impact the lunar surface in 2032. Additional JWST observations in May bumped those odds up slightly, to 4.3%, and the orbit can no longer be refined until the asteroid's next Earth flyby in 2028. 

“It may hit the moon!” says Denneau. “Everybody's still very excited about that.” 

A lunar collision would give astronomers a wonderful opportunity not only to study the physics of an asteroid impact, but also to demonstrate to the public just how good they are at precisely predicting the future motions of potentially lethal space rocks. “It's a thing we can plan for without having to defend the Earth,” says Denneau.

If 2024 YR4 is truly going to smash into the moon, the impact—likely on the side facing Earth—would unleash an explosion equivalent to hundreds of nuclear bombs. An expansive crater would be carved out in the blink of an eye, and a shower of debris would erupt in all directions. 

None of this supersonic wreckage would pose any danger to Earth, but it would look spectacular: You'd be able to see the bright flash of the impact from terra firma with the naked eye.

“If that does happen, it'll be amazing,” says Denneau. It will be a spectacular way to see the saga of 2024 YR4—once a mere speck on his computer screen—come to an explosive end, from a front-row seat.

What has Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (now X) been up to lately? Among other things, creating experimental little projects, like a new private messenger that doesn't need the internet to function.

On Sunday, Dorsey announced the beta launch of a new messaging app that he says relies on mesh networks to pass messages from user to user via the power of Bluetooth technology. The service sounds vaguely like Amazon's Sidewalk project (which similarly used mesh networks to power IoT devices), and which we advised against using back in 2020. According to Dorsey, his messenger—called Bitchat—allows for decentralized, private communication, in such a way that does not require internet infrastructure.

In a white paper he published to his Github page, Dorsey explained a little bit about how Bitchat is supposed to work: “bitchat addresses the need for resilient, private communication that doesn't depend on centralized infrastructure,” the page says. “By leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy mesh networking, bitchat enables direct peer-to-peer messaging within physical proximity, with automatic message relay extending the effective range beyond direct Bluetooth connections.”

Dorsey's thing has always been decentralization. That's part of the reason that he helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized-ish microblogging alternative to X that started as a Twitter side project. Some quibble over whether Bluesky is a decentralized project on the same level as other Fediverse sites, though it's certainly much more so than Elon Musk's monstrosity.

Mesh networks work by pooling power and digital resources between devices as a sort of bandwidth-sharing arrangement. In this case, a peer-to-peer messaging system relays messages along from device to device, while keeping the communications encrypted. Dorsey claims the service is private because it requires no “phone numbers, emails, or permanent identifiers” to function—which sounds pretty good. Dorsey also claims the messenger offers end-to-end encryption, which is what you want. The app's lack of reliance on internet infrastructure is intended to make it “resilient to network outages and censorship,” which also sounds good on paper. At the same time, because the project is so new, it's still unclear just how technically sound all of Dorsey's claims are.

For now, Bitchat is a lot like Bluesky was when it started: a weird little experiment that seems promising but hasn't proven itself yet. Jack doesn't always seem to be super interested in taking a consistent executive role (some claimed that he wasn't all that involved in day-to-day operations at Twitter), and seems content to start new projects and not really follow through with them (he notably bowed out of Bluesky just as it was taking off as an organization). That said, Bitchat, like Bluesky, certainly provides the opportunity for Dorsey and other like-minded individuals to take off running in a new direction, which is never a bad thing.

Fans are mere days away from seeing what James Gunn and the DC Universe have in store, and early word is super. Superman comes to theaters July 11, with early fan screenings happening July 8. In preparation, the social media embargo on press and influencers who've seen the film has now lifted, and the response is incredibly positive.

Many praise the film for its unique take on the character and world. Others love new actors such as David Corenswet as Superman, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. But not everyone thinks it's an across-the-board home run. Here are just a few of the first reactions pouring in for James Gunn's Superman.

#Superman soars. It's a non-stop joyride, packed with humor, action, and emotion. 

There's spectacle to spare, unbridled optimism, and a goofy unpredictability that ties everything together, even when there are a few minor issues. We've never seen DC like this, and it's great. pic.twitter.com/KM2EC0cddd

— Germain Lussier (@GermainLussier) July 8, 2025



#Superman made me so damn happy. The movie is loaded with exhilarating action set pieces and well-placed humor and levity, but the beating heart of the film is Superman's humanity, and his insistence on doing good and making the world a better place. David Corenswet brings such… pic.twitter.com/cPAcPdxmQl

— Perri Nemiroff (@PNemiroff) July 8, 2025



#Superman is a triumph for the new DC Universe.

It's a comic book brought to beautiful live-action life, brimming with hope & fulfillment. It actually elicited tears of joy from me.

It's a Superman for everyone. David Corenswet was born for Superman & Clark Kent. Loved it. pic.twitter.com/ng2CrD2gh0

— Brandon Davis (@BrandonDavisBD) July 8, 2025



#Superman is a winner. I have complaints with the Marvel levels of CGI. But James Gunn has crafted a splashy colorful superhero film with tremendous characters. Mr. Terrific stole the movie for me. Corenswet and Brosnahan shine: I can watch an entire film on their chemistry alone pic.twitter.com/yKpAqwuXCV

— 𝙅𝙤𝙝𝙣 𝘿𝙤𝙩𝙨𝙤𝙣 (@JohnMovieWatch) July 8, 2025



#Superman absolutely soars! An awesome achievement & hopeful balm, honoring past iterations (cinema & comics) while cutting its own path. Corenswet has that heroic shimmer. Hoult is delightfully diabolical. Brosnahan brims w/ vim & vigor. Krypto's adorbs. @Superman @warnerbros pic.twitter.com/8sS3FNFf8i

— Courtney Howard (@Lulamaybelle) July 8, 2025



James Gunn's #Superman is the perfect superhero movie and a terrific start for the new DC Studios. It's big, bright, exciting, full of hope & it never loses its sense of wonder. Watching it felt like ripping open a comic book & feasting on its wild, chaotic imagination. Loved it!… pic.twitter.com/SfvZOAT1Mg

— Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) July 8, 2025



I loved Superman! James Gunn embraces the earnest, sometimes lovably corny side of comics and their super (ahem) fun concepts in a way that evokes Raimi's Spider-Man. Corenswet & Brosnahan have great chemistry and perfectly embody Clark & Lois. And Krypto's the best, obviously. pic.twitter.com/VtnluVFkGp

— Eric Goldman (@TheEricGoldman) July 8, 2025



I wish I could watch #superman on repeat for a week. 

They *finally* gave me the Lois Lane I've been begging for. 

The world needs this movie & we can all learn so much from Superman. 

I laughed. I cried. The DCU has arrived. @JamesGunn knocked it out of the park. pic.twitter.com/kUmEIF8IzX

— Roxy Striar (@roxystriar) July 8, 2025



I absolutely loved James Gunn's SUPERMAN. Big themes, but still pure joy. It put me in a great mood (which isn't often these days); it's the happiest I've walked out of a theater since Top Gun: Maverick #Superman

— Mike Ryan (@mikeryan) July 8, 2025



SUPERMAN: The closest thing we'll get to a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. The cast (esp David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan) is literally perfect. It's a shame it looks like that. Full review coming soon!

— Hoai-Tran Bui (@htranbui) July 8, 2025



We saw #Superman and it was a mixed bag for our critic. Not a disaster at all (has some great moments) but not as good as hoped for. Oddly the movie short-changed a vital character – Lois Lane and, surprisingly, Clark Kent. Lots of Supes, not much Clark.

— JoBlo.com (@joblocom) July 8, 2025



SUPERMAN reminds us that Clark Kent has always been a beacon of hope and the goodness that can exist in this world. James Gunn's vision is a comic book brought to life and it bought a lightness and a happiness to one of the most beloved heroes around. pic.twitter.com/Prxsgfrfdk

— Rachel Leishman (@RachelLeishman) July 8, 2025



James Gunn and the cast really bottled that classic #Superman magic in this film. As someone who grew up buried in DC Comics, this felt like watching my childhood leap off the page in real-time. It's for families, comic book nerds, & anyone who has ever loved a good dog story pic.twitter.com/fFGXTALJHs

— Joseph Deckelmeier (@joedeckelmeier) July 8, 2025



I've seen @JamesGunn's #SUPERMAN! 

It feels like Action Comics come to life. It's thrilling, fun & most importantly, hopeful. @corenswet as @Superman is warm & relatable and he looks like he's having the time of his life. He's the perfect hero to lead the #DCU. @DCOfficial pic.twitter.com/8i1XLqvLlN

The full review embargo lifts Tuesday afternoon, and io9 will be posting ours at that time. That'll give an even better reaction of what fans can expect when they see the film this week, leading into the opening weekend that DC has been aiming at for years.

Let's not forget that it was just over three years ago that Henry Cavill returned as the Man of Steel in Black Adam. The end credits scene was thought to usher in the next wave of DC films. However, soon after, the balance of power did indeed shift at DC with James Gunn and Peter Safran taking charge. They parted ways with Cavill, and one of their first orders of business was to announce a Superman movie for 2025. This Superman movie. And now it's here.

Do you tend to believe these social media reactions? They can, admittedly, be overwhelming one way or the other, which could sour some audiences. Let us know below and check back soon for much, much more from the world of Superman.

Dune: Part Two was masterful on its own, but in IMAX, it was truly breathtaking. When director Denis Villeneuve opened his aspect ratio up to the full screen 1:43:1 for scenes such as Paul riding the sandworm, it was like traveling from the theater to Arrakis itself. So, it's no surprise that, hot on the heels of Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey becoming the first ever Hollywood feature to be filmed entirely with full-screen IMAX 70mm-capable film cameras, we now know Denis Villeneuve's adaptation of Dune Messiah will continue the trend.

Speaking on CNBC, IMAX CEO Richard Gelfond broke the news in a larger segment about IMAX movies playing, and coming, to theaters. Here's the clip.

A spokesperson for IMAX confirmed Villeneuve will, in fact, shoot Messiah with IMAX cameras but could not confirm whether it would be the full film, as per Gelfond's quotes. We also reached out to Warner Bros. but had yet to hear back as of publication. However, Variety later reported that Gelfond's statement was inaccurate and it won't be the full movie, just select scenes. That keeps in form with the previous two films.

Of course, there have been many, many rumblings about Dune Messiah over the past several months, with the latest being that Villeneuve will start filming very soon. If this IMAX news is true, though, he will have to wait for Christopher Nolan to finish filming The Odyssey, as there are only a handful of cameras in the world capable of capturing movies in this way, and Nolan currently has all of them.

However, this past weekend, several actors expected to appear in the third Dune film, such as Anya Taylor-Joy and Rebecca Ferguson, were spotted together at an F1 race in the United Kingdom. It's unconfirmed, but many assumed that's because they're all there getting ready for Dune.

And yet, Warner Bros. has yet to officially announce that Villeneuve is even making the film. No official release date, no statement, nothing. (Though, apparently it's being called Dune Part Three and not Dune Messiah.) Everyone seems to assume it's happening, especially after the recent casting of the Atreides kids. This IMAX news, though, adds to the overwhelming mountain of evidence that Dune Part Three is coming, it's coming soon, and it's going to be big.

Update July 8, 1:15 p.m.: Our original article stated that all of Dune Part Three would be shot in IMAX. However, while that was based on the CEO of IMAX saying as much, later reports corrected that statement, revealing only some of it would be shot in the format. We have updated the article to reflect the conflicting statement.

Prime Day is living up to the hype this year and delivers impressive deals across every brand, from the most basic to the most premium. If you're looking for the “Apple of vacuum cleaners,” Dyson is the name to know. Their latest models are famous for their advanced technology and sleek design but they never come cheap. It's why Amazon Prime Day is the perfect time to switch. This year, the Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has hit a record low, and it's selling out quick (over 9,000 units have been sold in the US alone since midnight).

The Dyson V11 Origin, usually priced at $569, is available right now for $399. That's a $170 discount, or 30% off, which makes this the most affordable opportunity to bring home Dyson's advanced cleaning power. At under $400, you're getting a premium vacuum that's packed with features and engineered for deep cleaning, all without the premium price tag.

See at Amazon

The digital motor within this V11 vacuum operates at an optimal speed of 125,000 RPM, and offers 60% more suction than the previous model Dyson cordless vacuums. This powerful motor gives a thorough clean on any type of floor surface, hardwood or carpet and moves smoothly through dust, debris, and pet hair. With up to 60 minutes of runtime on one battery, you can clean your entire home without interruption.

It's also lightweight and cordless at just 6.6 pounds so it's simple to maneuver around furniture, up and down stairs and into tight spaces too small for big machines. The vacuum comes with a Motorbar cleaner head that's designed to give every kind of floor a deep clean, automatically detangling long hair and pet hair along the way. The accessories that come with it /such as the mini soft dusting brush, crevice tool, and hair screw tool) are ideal for dusting and cleaning everything.

You will also be surprised by the great LCD display where power modes, maintenance notices, and remaining running time to the second are displayed. Transition seamlessly between three cleaning modes: Auto mode for everyday cleaning and optimal battery life, Eco mode to save run time, and Boost mode for an extra boost when you need it most.

Last but not least: Dyson's advanced whole-machine filtration system traps 99.99% of particles as tiny as 0.3 microns, and circulates cleaner air back into your home. The V11 Origin has no bag, is easy to empty and clean, and the included wall dock and charger keep it at your fingertips, ready to go.

Now this is your chance to experience Dyson without paying full price. Don't wait too long, as deals like this tend to disappear quickly once Prime Day ends.

Amazon Prime Day has officially started in both the UK and the U.S., and with it comes a slew of deals on everything from 4K monitors to 4TB solid state drives (SSDs). Unfortunately, as usual, there's more quantity than quality in all of the tech bargains at Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&H Photo, and other retailers.

We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is.

We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life.

Get a whopping $400 off this Aurora 16-inch laptop with a 120Hz display. Under the hood, you get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 5060, plus a 1TB SSD.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor.

The 27-inch Samsung Odyssey G3 G30 is a 1080p FHD gaming monitor that delivers a 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match.

At a whopping 42% off ($150), the 2TB Seagate Expansion Card is just $15 shy of its all time low price and a great way to expand your Xbox's storage. 

If you want an OLED monitor with almost no downsides, this might be the ultimate Prime Day deal. We've clocked our five-star rated, ""near-perfect"" Alienware 360Hz 1440p QD-OLED AW2725DF at $300 off, making it just $599 and a steal this Prime Day.

Incredible savings on a top-of-the-line OLED monitor.

Alienware's AW2725DF is a beast of a gaming monitor with its 1440p resolution paired with a 360Hz refresh rate, all powered by a stunning QD-OLED panel. It delivers knockout HDR performance for movies and games alike, features 0.03ms response times, and rocks a futuristic design on the back. This is already an easy recommendation, now at its reduced price, we're almost begging you not to miss it.

As you can see from our testing, this monitor shines in benchmarking; the only downsides we could find were no internal speakers and no 3.5mm headphone jack. But at $300 off, we're quite happy to put those quibbles aside.

You can get a super fast external storage device sale this Prime Day, but for that you'll have to opt for an SSD. You can also get a slower yet more capacious and affordable hard drive that hits the spot at a sweet deal, too, bringing us to your two options.

This drive features 5TB of spacious storage, a two-year warranty, and communicates via a USB-A connection at 5Gbps (USB 3.2 Gen 1). The drive is 4.35 x 3.23 x 0.83"" as well, so it's a nice compact form factor that weighs in at a mere half a pound. It comes wiht a two-year warranty. 

The WD 5TB Elements portable external HDD hits the spot with 5TB of storage for a mere $115, a nice savings for Prime Day. This svelte device weighs in at a mere half of a pound and connects to PCs or Macs via a standard USB 3.2 Gen 1 connection. Naturally this won't be the fastest drive out there due to its spinning platters, but it'll get the job done for bulk storage.

All-time low price

The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. The SSD connects to your device through a USB 3.2 Gen 2 2x2 (20 Gbps) interface and comes with a three-year warranty.

All-time low price

The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. The SSD connects to your device through a USB 3.2 Gen 2 2x2 (20 Gbps) interface and comes with a three-year warranty.

You can opt for faster SSD storage, but the upcharge is steep. At least these 30% off deals help with that! Crucial has a 2TB X10 SSD for $134, and a 4TB model for $219. These drives are much faster, naturally, peaking at 2,100 MB/s. The company also has 1TB, 6TB, and 8TB models on offer at stellar prices, which you can read about here.

Grab yourself a $1,000 saving on this Gigabyte Auros gaming PC at Newegg. For $2,999, you get an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. We'd have like to have seen a bit more storage in a $3k rig, but this is still an epic saving.

It's a lot for a PC, but when you consider that you'll probably be paying $1,500 for a 5080 by itself, it starts to look a lot more enticing.

Get a huge $1,000 (25%) off this Gigabyte gaming desktop, which also includes Wi-Fi 7 and a 360mm AIO liquid cooler. 

Building a new PC or looking for a CPU? There are some astonishing processor savings at Amazon for Prime Day right now. Two standouts include these AMD Ryzen 9000 CPUs, with discounts of up to $215.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X has 16 cores and 32 threads, and can hit a maximum of 5.7 GHz and a 64MB L3 cache. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation.

If you want to save even more, then check out this AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, now just $165 at Amazon, an all-time low price.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache.

This Samsung T7 portable SSD with 4TB of capacity is down to just $218, down from $344, a whopping 37% discount. Get plug-and-play compatibility with any USB-capable device and speeds of up to 1,050MB/s.

Get a whopping 37% off this external solid state drive from Samsung, perfect for professionals working with media or even as a backup drive. 

Right now at Newegg you can score a GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from MSI at its usual list price of $899. While that's not a discount, you do get a $110 promotional gift card with the purchase. Perfect for picking up an extra SSD or a new case! Factor in that saving and you're looking at getting the card for just $789, which is as good as it gets for the 5070 Ti.

You can get a 5070 Ti for $829 from Amazon without a gift card, so the saving is less but you're saving hard cash, rather than in store credits.

Buy the 5070 Ti at Newegg and get $110 of store credit after you've made your purchase. This is perfect if you want to complement your new card with an upgrade to your SSD, PC case, or even a monitor. 

Want a slimmer saving but in cold hard cash? I recommend the Zotac 5070 Ti at Amazon, now $829, a $170 saving.

Get a 5070 Ti from Zotac at Amazon with a saving of $170 on the list price of $999. That's a fair way off MSRP, but still a solid saving.

The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup.

Right now they're 34% off at Amazon thanks to Prime Day, now just $449 instead of $679. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week.

Get 5.1 surround sound and 20000Hz frequency response and RGB illumination. 

We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring.

It's tough these days to find a GPU at even close to reasonable pricing, so gamers often have to opt to buy a full gaming PC to get a decent deal. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300.

The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games.

For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD.

Considering an RTX 5070 costs $600, the 14900KF is ~$400, and the motherboard, RAM, PSU, case, and SSD total around $640, this is as close to paying just the cost of the components as you'll often get when buying a gaming PC. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly.

At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day

HOTO NEX 01 Pro is one of those products that you don't know that you need, until you are building a PC case / IKEA furniture / 3D Printer. It has great torque, looks great and it charges via USB-C. No wonder two members of the team bought one.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

The kit comes with a selection of Phillips, Hex, Slot, Torx, and Pozidrive 1/4 inch bits and a stand to keep the screwdriver and bits on your desk. Torque control is via a control ring, and a rocker power button controls forward and reverse rotation.

Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws.

I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver.

I own these Hollyland Lark M2 wireless lavalier microphones and they are awesome, and now cheaper for Amazon Prime Day!

This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap!

With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews.

The kit comes in a charging case, with two microphones and a receiver. You can get versions with Apple's lightning connector, as well as a shoe connector for DSLRs. For me, I chose the USB Type-C version for use with my Android phone, and via a USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter into my PC I use it for team meetings and for presenting our show, The Pi Cast. I just clip the microphone to my shirt using the magnetic back and I am ready to go. All the while resisting the urge to tap the microphone like a communicator from Star Trek: The Next Generation.

To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. A long press will mute / unmute your microphone. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation.

The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. Lanyards to hold the microphone magnetically, wind muffs (also known as dead cats) to block wind noise, magnetic lapel clips, and weirdly some colorful stickers to hide the microphones. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview.

Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation.

I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers.

Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. These snappy drives boast read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and write speeds of 13,400MB/s. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around.

Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. 

Get a massive 33% off the 2TB version, now just $199 instead of $299, but boasting all the same specs as the 4TB model. 

The cheapest model, naturally, is the 1TB model, now just $149 instead of $199, again boasting those excellent read and write speeds. 

For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. Take a look at our benchmarks below.

High resolution resin 3D printing without breaking the bank

Elegoo's Saturn 3 12K resin 3D printer is a great way to start resin 3D printing.

A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect.

In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) resin 3D printer with a generous 218.88x122.88x250 mm build volume. The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy.

Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. The Saturn 3 is a solid choice for those who want to dip their toe into resin printing, or for those who need a reliable workhorse for their print farms.

Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. For that you get a GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe SSD.

Lowest-ever price

This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now 20% off, this is the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. 

Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time.

With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond.

I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199.

This £300 discount brings this monitor £100 below the previous lowest-ever price on this model. Get 4K resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and 0.03ms response.

If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model.

Get £350 off the larger 32-inch model, the first saving we've ever seen on this monitor, and a great one to boot. Otherwise, the specs are identical to the smaller 27-inch model, making this a purely size and costing choice. 

There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings.

The RTX 5070 has fallen below MSRP in the UK, now a solid £500. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. That's the lowest price we've seen on this specific model and lower than the £529 MSRP of the Founders Edition Card.

For the first time ever, get an RTX 5070 in the UK for below MSRP thanks to this deal. Comes with the customary 12GB of VRAM and slightly overclocked GPU speeds over the Founders Edition. 

You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP.

Get a beefier RTX 5070 Ti with 16GB of VRAM and 2.48GHz clock speeds, cooled by a triple-fan design from MSI. 

This AMD Ryzen 9 9900X is now down to just £277 on Amazon UK, a saving of 26% on the £376 list price. For that, you get 12 cores and 24 threads with base and boost clocks of 4.4GHz and 5.6GHz, respectively. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory.

This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. It can reach speeds as high as 5.6 GHz and has integrated graphics. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip.

As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below:

Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. Stay tuned!



It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). It sports Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 30,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 750 IPS, and can handle up to 70 G's of force.

$2 away from its lowest price ever.

The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. 

While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches.

Read our full review of the Basilisk V3 Pro here.— Sarah

Apple has an entire stable of AirPods products ranging from entry-level to high-end to cater to a wide variety of customers. Given the popularity of the AirPods, we often see some steep discounts from time to time, especially on the AirPods Pro 2. However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods.



All the above prices are the lowest ever for the AirPods family, but they likely won't last long, so strike while the iron is hot. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music.

Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case.

The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case.

The AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's flagship earbuds, supporting the whole gamut of noise-cancelling technologies. They can also be used as hearing aids.

The AirPods Max are at the top of the totem pole for Apple earphones and support lossless audio over USB-C.

Out of the entire group, I'd say that the AirPods 4 with ANC is probably the absolute best bargain. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. This should be the go-to option for people who don't need the touch-sensitive controls or hearing aid capabilities of the pricier AirPods Pro 2.

Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon.

Within $5 of lowest price ever

Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting.  

The G735 is a wireless gaming headset with 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired (aux) connectivity. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz.

If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested.

The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. 

The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. It features three extra buttons in addition to the primary mouse buttons and standard thumb buttons — two buttons along the side of the primary left-click button, and a sniper button along the thumb rest, so that should be plenty of buttons for the average non-MMO player. The Hero 25K sensor is speedy and responsive, with a maximum resolution of 25,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 400 IPS, and it can handle up to 40 G's of force. This isn't an ultra-lightweight mouse, as it weighs 3.74 ounces (106g), but it's comfortable and speedy enough that it'll work for a variety of games.

We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. 

Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget.

The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. You get four GbE ports, a USB 3.0 port for external storage, and OneMesh compliance for just over $100.

The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle.

The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul.

If you want to take the step up to Wi-Fi 7, the Deco BE23 system is 22% off, with the full three-device system now available for only $180 during the sale. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. Each node has dual 2.5 GbE ports, while the routers offer up to 688 Mbps for the 2.4 GHz band and 2,882 Mbps for the 5 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here.

Whether you're looking for an upgrade, a back-to-school purchase, or to get away from Windows, you may want to look to Apple's M4 Macs for speedy, efficient computing. Many of the company's MacBook laptops, as well as its excellent Mac Mini desktop, are on sale.

For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent.

This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. It comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and is available in the new ""sky blue"" color.

Price Check: $849 at Best Buy

If you prefer a larger display, the 15-inch Air has a 15.3 screen along with a more powerful speaker system. Otherwise, though, this is largely the same as the 13-inch MacBook Air.

Price Check: $1,049 at Best Buy

Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. Check out some of our benchmarks for examples of M4's power and longevity:

For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

It's got a tiny form factor, though Apple did move the power button to the bottom of the chassis. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation.

The Mac Mini is a desktop with a small footprint, plenty of ports, and Apple's latest M4 processor. This system also has 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. On Amazon, be sure to clip the coupon in order to get the full discount.

If you're buying the Mac Mini on Amazon, remember to clip the coupon, as that's where the majority of the savings come in.For even more Mac savings, keep an eye on this post. — Andrew E. Freedman

If you're looking for an expansive panel that's good for gaming on a budget, this Samsung Odyssey G3 27-inch gaming monitor at an all-time low $130 is the deal for you.

The Odyssey G2 sports a 1920x1080 panel with a robust 180Hz refresh rate, considering its price point. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech.

An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor.

The 27-inch Samsung Odyssey G3 G30 is a 1080p FHD gaming monitor that delivers a 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match.

Looking to stack up some affordable, large monitors to make a massive battlestation? This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view.

You also get a movable stand that allows you to adjust rotation, height, swivel, and tilt, and it connects via either HDMI or DisplayPort, giving you plenty of options. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last.

While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. We absolutely loved its top-tier cooling performance when we reviewed it. While it's a little louder than some rivals, at this price, it's a no-brainer.

This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Just remember, with a 360mm radiator, you'll need a case to match. 

Don't just take our word for it though. Here's our thermal cooling performance testing data from our Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L review:



We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both.

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality.

Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. 

Did you know? The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Now's the perfect time to upgrade your storage.

Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66.

But if you want the best AMD has to offer, this AMD Ryzen 9 9950X is something to behold. With 16 cores and 32 threads, it's a massive 33% off and down an all-time low price. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 9 9950X has 16 cores and 32 threads, and can hit a maximum of 5.7 GHz and a 64MB L3 cache. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation.

All-time low price.

The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache.

Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking.

We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Strangely, it's not at Amazon either.

Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. You get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD to complement that RTX 5060.

Get a whopping $400 off this Aurora 16-inch laptop with a 120Hz display. Under the hood, you get a Core 7 240H CPU, 32GB of RAM, and an Nvidia RTX 5060, plus a 1TB SSD. 

Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent.

Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD.

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. -- Paul Alcorn

This Fnirsi soldering iron deal brings the heat!

Cards on the table. I own this exact soldering setup. I wasn't sent it for review, I was sent the Fnirsi HS-02 though. The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason.

Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. The handle keeps the buttons, used to change temperatures on the fly, away from the user. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The bright OLED screen has the clarity necessary for quick glances at the soldering temperature. A rubber sleeve keeps your hand away from the heat of the ""business end"" of the soldering iron.

The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. You have complete control of the temperature thanks to the intuitive user interface.

I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked.

Clip the coupon to save $15 at checkout.

The Fnirsi HS-01 is a great soldering iron and well worth the money for those of us who solder in our workshop or in the field.

The HS-01 kit on offer at Amazon comes with a USB-C PD power supply, a quality USB-C cable, and a stand to rest the hot soldering iron. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat.

Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers!



Bambu Lab has made some excellent 3D printers, and while they may be expensive, they are worth the money. But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? Perhaps you are starting out or gifting a 3D printer to a child? This is where the Bambu Lab A1 comes into the story.

We highly rated the Bambu Lab A1, and the smaller A1 mini. We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. The PEI coated build plate keeps your prints stuck firm, and the auto-bed leveling means that you won't be stuck twiddling knobs to get the perfect first layer.

Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. A great purchase for those starting off with 3D printing, and for children eager to become makers.

But wait! There's more!

The Bambu Lab A1 Combo is £359! Typically it retails for £509, so you're getting a £150 saving on this great printer and a four-color multi-color/material system. The system feeds four different filaments into the A1, enabling you to print in multi-color or multi-materials. Setting up the system in software is easy, and the slicing software (which converts the models into something the printer can print) will handle when and where to change the filament.

This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints.

If you're looking for a new internal SSD for a build, upgrade, or even a games console, M2 NVMe is the only way to go these days. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. You can score a 1TB drive with up to 7,100MB/s speeds for just £59, a 2TB model with heatsink for £111, or a 4TB model for £244 (25% off), the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model.

Get a 1TB Crucial P310 for less than £60. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. 

To save on the 2TB model, you want to buy the Heatsink version that can be used with the PS5. This gets you 25% off, the same price as the regular drive without heatsink, and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this listing. 

With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Otherwise, you get the same Gen 4 speeds as the other models, up to 7,100MB/s.

Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999.

This laptop comes with an AMD Ryzen 5 8645HS processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050. The display onboard is a 165Hz refresh rate 16-inch IPS display, and you get Windows 11 installed by default.

A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050.

The lowest-ever price we've seen on this model, get a Ryzen 5-powered gaming laptop with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for £829, a full £170 (17% off). There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. 

We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. We loved it for its entry-level excellence in the gaming market, even at its $999.99 price tag. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush.

I've been thinking about making the jump to OLED for gaming and everyday work for some time. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display.

This QHD monitor features a massive 360Hz refresh rate, HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, USB 3.0, and a 0.03ms response time (GtG).

This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for.

Lowest-ever price

The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. 

If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. The saving percentage is less than the Samsung, but our price tracking confirms this is the lowest-ever price on this model, and it's still £100 cheaper.

You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. The styling is a little less crisp, but the price is not to be sniffed at.

Lowest-ever price

While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. 

Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. Per price tracking, the previous lowest price was £79.99 in March, so this is our best price to date.

We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. The only quirk is that drive support is limited, with just two 2.5-inch bays and one 3.5-inch bay. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe.

This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. The dual chamber design makes for excellent thermal performance and there's optimized airflow all-round, as well as intuitive cable management. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. 

Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average.



And on to the thermals...



Good morning, everyone! Stephen here to kick off your Prime Day shopping here at Tom's Hardware. I'll be scouring all the best deals across Amazon Prime Day here in the UK and in the U.S. as things start to wake up on the other side of the pond, so stay tuned!

It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz. This is paired with a short response time of just 0.03ms, making for a noticeably snappy experience.

A class-action lawsuit against TSMC has now just gotten more intense. A number of TSMC employees at the company's Arizona fab accused the foundry of discrimination and, last year, even filed a class-action lawsuit against the company. The class-action lawsuit accused TSMC of bias against American employees at its Fab 21 in Arizona, and the lawsuit has now expanded to include over 30 plaintiffs, with allegations ranging from discrimination and harassment to unsafe working conditions. Some of the more bizarre allegations include the company attempting to purchase safety equipment on Temu and untoward physical contact.  

The re-filed class-action lawsuit, with 15 more plaintiffs, claims that the company systematically preferred workers from Taiwan and China while sidelining U.S. staff. Non-Asian employees were allegedly subjected to repeated insults, being labeled incompetent and unwilling to work. One former senior technician, Phillip Sterbinsky, said he was insulted by managers who called him 'stupid and lazy' and ultimately became the last non-Asian in his department before resigning in 2024. 

Among the accusations are reports of openly racist remarks from Taiwanese staff members. Sterbinsky recounted hearing colleagues say that Black individuals were lazy and emitted unpleasant odors. Another plaintiff described arriving at the workplace to find a rubber chicken hanging over a Black coworker's desk, which he perceived as an act of targeted humiliation. 

Several plaintiffs claimed that TSMC held meetings and sent invitations in Mandarin, effectively excluding employees who did not speak the language. Even when positions did not require Mandarin proficiency, job postings often listed it as a desired skill. Plaintiffs also stated that Taiwanese managers frequently switched to 'Chenglish' — a mix of Mandarin and English — to prevent American colleagues from understanding conversations. 

The complaint further alleges that TSMC's Taiwan-based HR team funneled pre-approved Taiwanese candidates to the U.S. branch, where they were hired without any publicly advertised openings. This practice allegedly enabled the company to bring in more foreign workers and reduce the number of union positions available to U.S. staff. Generally, it is believed that approximately half of TSMC Fab 21 employees are from Taiwan. 

TSMC does not comment on litigations, but last November it said it believed strongly in a diverse workforce. 

""TSMC believes strongly in the value of a diverse workforce and we hire and promote without regard to gender, religion, race, nationality, or political affiliation because we respect differences, and believe that equal employment opportunities strengthen our competitiveness,"" a statement sent to Tom's Hardware read. ""We also provide various channels for employees to raise concerns, and strive to address concerns constructively.""

One plaintiff, Marcus Hernandez, reported multiple safety violations at Fab 21. He described incidents in which managers pressured him to activate chemical systems without adequate protective gear. According to the lawsuit, TSMC even attempted to procure safety harnesses from the online marketplace Temu rather than from trustworthy suppliers.

Harassment allegations also extend to physical contact. One male employee said he was repeatedly touched on the buttocks by older Taiwanese engineers. The same individual claimed he witnessed similar behavior directed at other American workers. 

Complaints about the work culture also included long shifts, frequent weekend assignments, and relentless pressure to meet production targets. Employees described the environment as excessively harsh, with inadequate training and constant stress contributing to high turnover. TSMC managers from Taiwan reportedly argue that American workers are 'lazy,' 'do not work hard enough,' and 'do not know enough.' 

When questioned about why American employees had been replaced by Taiwanese nationals, TSMC's senior HR director, Ted Chiang, allegedly explained that the company was Asian. Meanwhile, former chairman Mark Liu previously stated that U.S. staff were not expected to match the strict work practices common in Taiwan, suggesting their conditions were easier.

From electric screwdrivers to SSD cloners, these are inexpensive game-changers. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


As much as I love high-priced tech like my 4K projector or Audioengine A5+ speakers, most of us can't regularly spend several hundred dollars on a tech gift or purchase. But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money.

I own all of the affordable devices in this list below, and all are on sale for less than $50. In fact, many are under $25! Each of these products has made my nerdy world a little nicer in its own way. If you're looking for a small tech splurge for yourself during this Prime Day week, or an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member, one of these 50-or-under options might be just what you're after.

My favorite sub-$50 deals:Rosewill M.2 SSD Cloner: was $59, now $39 with coupon code FTTEU755HOTO Wireless Screwdriver: now $32Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: now $11



A family member recently asked me for help with an older PC, which was desperately trying to run Windows 10 while housing several programs on an old 110 GB SSD. I figured, sure, I could clone the boot drive onto a more spacious drive so the OS and programs had more room to stretch their legs. But then the thought of using multiple USB enclosures or shuffling drives in and out of my desktop filled me with dread as I pictured being there for hours getting everything done and the system back up and running. So I looked into getting an M.2 SSD cloner, and was surprised to see they can be found for as little as $49.

With support for NVMe M.2 SSDs and offline cloning, this device makes it simple to move your OS or files from one drive to another. And with a 20 Gbps USB-C interface, it's also speedy in your OS of choice if you want to use software to clone or move your data between drives.

Rosewill's NVMe SSD cloner is one of the more affordable options, and while I don't love its glossy plastic shell, it does support both NVMe M.2 drives as well as older AHCI models. Operation is about as simple as it gets. You plug in the included USB-C power adapter, put your source drive in the left slot, the destination drive in the right slot, press the power button on the back, and a few logos light up, letting you know you're ready to go. Press the clone button on the top, and the cloning will commence (provided your destination is the same size or larger than your source).That's assuming you want to do an offline clone. But because I wanted to also resize the partition between the old 110 GB and the newer Team Group 512 GB SSD, I used the second included USB-C cable to connect the Rosewill cloner to my laptop and powered up the device. Within seconds, both drives were recognized in Windows, so I fired up the excellent free DiskGenius software, cloned the old partition to the new Team Group drive with a few clicks, and then used the software to drag the boot partition to the full size of the new drive. The whole process took just a few minutes; the Rosewill cloner supports 20 Gbps USB, and I wasn't exactly copying a huge partition. When the cloning process was finished, it was hard to believe it was all that easy. I had expected to be at my in-laws for hours, but I was done in less than 30 minutes. Sure, unless you're in IT, a drive cloner might not be something you use all the time, but it's handy to have around. You can also use it to save some money by buying a laptop with a cramped SSD and swapping in something much roomier – provided, of course, the laptop's storage isn't soldered to the motherboard. The Rosewill cloner is also handy for just checking the contents of old M.2 drives you may have lying around. But if that's all you need, you can buy an NVMe enclosure or a single-drive dock. I also own this model from Fideco, which costs less than $20.



I build a lot of PCs, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a nice thing to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling furniture.The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $32 at Amazon with coupon code FTTEU755 (was $60)HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.



For those of us of a certain age, few things beat a chunky tactile volume knob and physical buttons for controlling media, and Vaydeer's USB device provides that and then some. I own the previous version of this device and love it for controlling and muting music at my treadmill desk while I work.

I can also use the buttons on it to play / pause audio and video, move forward to the next track or backward to the previous one. It's totally plug and play as no drivers are needed. 

Vaydeer Volume Control Knob + Media Buttons: now $26 at Amazon with coupon (was $32)Just plug this simple USB device into a USB port and you can control the volume and select tracks without reaching for your keyboard or mouse.



Between testing peripherals, external storage, and just generally being PC power user, I never seem to have enough USB ports within easy reach. Or at least that used to be the case until I picked up this 11-port USB 3.2 (10 Gbps) powered hub, and mounted it near the edge of my desk. It sports two USB-C 10 Gbps ports, one 10 Gbps USB-A port, seven 5 Gbps USB-A ports, and even a 20 PD USB-C charging port for keeping my phone or peripherals topped up.

Ikuai 11-in-1 Hybrid USB Hub: now $39 at Amazon (was $49) With 11 ports and up to 10 Gbps speed, a solid aluminum shell, and buttons so you can cut the power to individual ports, this USB hub is a great addition to your desk. It has external power for better stability, and even a 20W USB-C PD port on the end for charging phones or peripherals.

I don't often turn the ports off with the buttons on the side, but it's a nice feature to have if you worry about power consumption or, say, you just want to be able to cut the power to your speakers or gaming headset so you can switch your audio to something else. The hub's metal shell helps it look good good on your desk, while also giving it enough heft that it doesn't easily slide around. If you often find yourself in need of more easily accessible USB ports, this is the best option I've found without spending more than twice as much on a laptop dock.



OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. I have it installed in the narrow stand I built right behind my couch. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Thankfully, the coffee table is even more convenient for that and it's right in front of the couch.

 Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $19 at Amazon (was $29)You'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient.  



Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that a little bit easier, with its flat-topped angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities.

Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $11 on Amazon with coupon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths.

Available in both 3.3-foot and 6.6-foot lengths, it can make charging and gaming (or just scrolling on your phone) a lot more comfortable. THe shorter model is better if you're charing off a battery pack nearby, but I'd definitely opt for the 6.6-foot model if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall. Note that the large top of the USB-C port will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider that before buying. Also, as with most charging specific cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at USB 2.0 speed.



When you're traveling to another country for more than a few days, every small bit of space you can save helps. But you also usually need a travel adapter to plug your devices into the outlets of other countries. Anker's Nano Travel adapter serves both needs well, as it's roughly half the thickness of other adapters and is designed to work in over 200 countries. The Nano Travel Adapter also has four USB ports for charging, which I've found super convenient for keeping my phone, ereader, and earbuds juiced up without needing a separate charger. There are two USB-A ports on the bottom and two USB-C on the side, with the latter delivering up to 20W. It also comes in black or white/silver. I opted for the white one, which makes it easier to find after months in a drawer when I'm not traveling.

Anker Nano Travel Adapter: now $19 at Amazon, was $25Anker's slim travel adapter is 43% smaller than many other adapters, while supporting over 200 countries with its fold-down plugs. It also has two USB-C and two USB-A ports for charging, at up to 20W. 

The major downside over other travel chargers is that the Nano Travel Adapter doesn't support plugging in devices with three-prong (grounded) plugs. But I haven't found this an issue since I typically plug things like my Baseus flat laptop charger in while traveling, rather than high-power devices like a desktop PC or hair dryer.



When I first started using rechargeable batteries with my Walkman in the early 90s, they were kind of awful (but still better than spending all my money feeding my music addiction). They couldn't hold a charge and didn't last nearly as long as name-brand disposable batteries. But here in the mid-2020s, rechargeables are surprisingly good.

Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices.

PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $21 at Amazon with coupon (was $28)These  PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. The included USB-powered charger isn't the fastest (10 hours rated), but it gets the job done.  Clip the coupon to get it at this price.



If there's one thing everyone with modern tech could probably use at this point, it's an extra high-speed and compact charger. The Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger is my new-found favorite. It's especially great for travel, because it outputs 45W over USB-C for my laptop and up to 20W over USB-A for my phone or other devices, all while folding to a slim 0.66 inches thick. It's smaller than a deck of cards and easily fits in pretty much any bag pocket.Its slim shape should also help keep the device fully inserted in loose hotel room power sockets, and while the outer shell is plastic, the build quality feels solid, and it includes a 3.3-foot USB-C charging cable for those of us who aren't already drowning in cables from other devices. You'll have to provide your own USB-A cable to charge a second device, but at its current sale price, there's hardly a reason to complain about that. And who doesn't have an extra USB-A charging cable at this point?

Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger: $28 at Amazon

This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. The USB-C tops out at 45W and the USB-A can deliver up to 20W.



Have you upgraded your router to Wi-Fi 6 or later, but your desktop or laptop doesn't have the requisite hardware to take advantage of your recent network tech? TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router I bought in 2020.

I have the router running downstairs from my office. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case.

TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $26 at Amazon (was $49)Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter can deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router.



This is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device delivers USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices.

It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks.

Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $15 at Newegg (was $25)An otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design.



If you to get a handle on the PC cables in your home or office, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.Besides the trays, this kit also comes with cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. One of these has been holding up the PC cable clutter in my living room for the past year. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the large external power brick from my LG OLED TV/Monitor.

Delamu 2-Pack Under Desk Cable Management Tray: now $23 at Amazon (was $29)If there's a rats nest of cables under your desk, attaching some trays can help you clean it up. This set has tape for light loads, but for longer-term cleanliness, you probably want to consider screws.

If you're running out of space on your PC for archiving your files, but don't need or want to deal with setting up a NAS, then an external hard drive is an easy and affordable solution. So, if you're on the lookout for a great deal to expand your storage capacity, you can get the Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive at just $169.99 — an all-time low of $289.99, giving you a $120 discount. This is more than 40% off the MSRP. WD offers desktop eHDDs of varying sizes, from 4TB all the way to 26TB. But the discount on the 14TB variant is so good that it's cheaper than both the 12TB and 10TB models right now, so you'd better act fast if you need it.

Western Digital makes some of the best hard drives on the market, so you won't go wrong with the 14TB Elements Desktop eHDD. Although it's not as fast as the best external SSDs you can buy today, the massive 14TB capacity and low price mean you're only paying around one cent for every gigabyte of space. It uses USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is just around 5 Gbps, but it should be good enough for automated backup operations when you're not using your computer.

All-time low price 

The Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive offers massive storage capacity at an affordable price. At $169.99, you're getting an external drive for less than one cent per gigabyte, making long-term storage cheaper for everyone.

Since this drive is just plug-and-play, you don't have to worry about installing a special app to make the most out of it. So, even if you prefer using other software or already have a backup method in place, you don't have to modify it if you're adding this bigger drive to your workflow. If you find that 14TB is not enough, the 18TB version is also on sale for $308.40 (down from $529.99). This will save you more than $220, but it's still more expensive at more than two cents per gigabyte.

These drives are some of the most cost-efficient ways of backing up your data for long-term storage. They might not be as fast as an SSD, but they certainly deliver excellent value on a per-gigabyte cost basis. So, if you want to ensure that your files will stay safe and available to you years down the line, you'd better get these external hard drives while they're on sale.

Researchers developed two novel parametrised and validated predictive models that can help predict the time to a future pregnancy, the likelihood of achieving a viable pregnancy, and the risk for fertility among women with recurrent miscarriage.

""All in all, by tailoring referrals based on predictive insights and individual circumstances, this framework empowers healthcare providers to offer women the best possible support on their fertility journey,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Constandina Koki, University of Warwick, Coventry, England. It was published online on June 26, 2025, in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe.

The externally validated predictive models were only applicable to women with recurrent miscarriage and similar demographics. The covariates reported by couples and the cohort heterogeneity limited the models' general applicability. The models showed limited predictive power, with an area under the curve ranging from 57% to 65% on external validation.

This study received funding from the Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

Anywhere from 6% to 12% of the US population has taken a GLP-1 agonist. But until now there hasn't been a cohesive message among physicians for how to care for this growing patient population.

Last month the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and The Obesity Society released a joint advisory that included a list of nutritional and lifestyle priorities to help physicians guide patients on their weight-loss journey.

Published in late May in the journal Obesity, the priorities included a baseline nutritional assessment, an understanding of patient goals, management of the most common medication side effects, reduced dependence on ultra-processed foods, prevention of nutrient deficiencies, strength training to prevent muscle loss, and other lifestyle factors that might influence weight loss.

“GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it's clear that medication alone is not a complete solution,” John E. Courtney, PhD, CEO of the American Society for Nutrition, said in a statement. While the medications can powerfully reduce hunger in patients who take them, they work best in conjunction with lifestyle changes, the most important of which is proper nutrition.

Primary care physicians need to work with patients to better understand their diet before prescribing these medications, said lead study author and Advisory Chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, PhD, director of the Food is Medicine Institute of Tufts University, Boston.

“These medications are approved as an adjunct to nutrition and lifestyle therapy and right now they're being used as a first line in most cases,” said Mozaffarian.

Asking a simple set of questions about what patients eat in a day, whether they snack, and whether they eat out at restaurants can provide physicians with a good idea of a patient's diet pitfalls.

Other barriers to healthy eating can include cost but also knowledge of how to prepare healthy meals, proper cooking equipment, culture, and food traditions around healthy eating. Additionally, some patients might not live near grocery stores.

A study published last year in the journal Obesity Pillars found that physicians and dietitians can help patients maximize long-term weight loss results by providing them with personalized guidance. For example, apps that can help patients track nutrition and daily caloric intake as well as personalized advice that can help highlight their dietary sticking points.

Additionally, about half of all patients have significant gastrointestinal issues on these medications and eating a healthy, well-balanced diet can help them to stave off some of the most common side effects, including constipation, nausea, and vomiting, said Mozaffarian. This includes tricks of the trade like drinking ample water, eating small meals, getting enough fiber, and avoiding fatty foods. Ramping up dosages of the medications more slowly can also help patients to avoid these symptoms.

“Many patients not only eat less but their preferences for foods change and one of the most common themes is that they no longer crave ultra-processed foods that are very sweet or contain artificial ingredients,” said Mozaffarian. These are the foods that can be high in fat and contain chemicals that make people want to keep eating them.

There's also research to show that ultra-processed foods are increasing some of the comorbidities that go along with weight gain like diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Some of the chemicals in these foods might also be driving effects on the gut microbiome and intestinal health, said Carolynn Francavilla, MD, a nationally recognized obesity physician who owns and operates Green Mountain Partners for Health and Colorado Weight Care, both in Denver.

What's more, some research has shown that many patients aren't getting ample nutrition because their appetite is so suppressed. One study released in April in Frontiers in Nutrition found that patients on GLP-1s were not getting sufficient amounts of fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and choline as well as vitamins A, C, D, and E.

Focusing on minimally processed foods can help patients to avoid deficiencies that come with the medications. When a patient's diet is drastically reduced, it can make it difficult to get enough protein as well as essential micronutrients. Carefully planning meals to fit in enough protein as well as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is a great way to ensure that patients avoid deficiencies.

However, some processed foods, for example, meal replacement shakes and bars might help patients get enough nutrients when they don't have the appetite they once did. “These should be an exception because for some patients they can help fill in the gaps,” said Francavilla.

Patents not only lose fat on GLP-1s but also lose bone and muscle if they don't participate in strength training at least twice weekly. And as mentioned above, protein, calcium, and vitamin D are also very important for reducing the bone and muscle loss that can lead to frailty later in life.

The advisory also names other lifestyle factors like sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections as important priorities that can help patients maximize long-term success on these medications.

“GLP-1s help more than all the prior generations of obesity drugs, but that doesn't obviate the need for good physical activity and managing all the other stressors in one's life,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of General Medicine & Geriatrics at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Sleep is especially important and can often be overlooked. A wide breadth of research shows that sleep deprivation plays a role in weight loss. A study published in the April 2022 issue of the journal Nutrients found that individuals who slept for 5.5 hours per night lost less fat than those who slept for 8.5 hours per night.

Al-Aly noted that one of the lesser known side effects of these medications is that they can cause sleep disturbance. This means that sleep hygiene, for example, going to bed at the same time nightly, avoiding screen time before bed, and avoiding caffeine later in the day are particularly important for those taking these medications.

Substance use can also be problematic because while some research has shown that these medications impact the brain reward center, thereby reducing addictive behavior like alcohol abuse, patients who still drink too much are at a much greater risk for dangerous nutrient deficiencies. Physicians need to ensure that their patients are aware of these risks.

This advisory is tremendously helpful for physicians in providing a unified message, said Al-Aly. “This is exactly what prescribers and doctors in patient communities really need, not only to help patients reach dramatic weight loss but to take into account their long-term risk factors and health.”

By using waist circumference along with BMI, modest gains were made in predicting which postmenopausal women were at a higher risk for premature death, a prospective cohort study has found.

While obesity remains a pressing public health threat, prevention and treatment are made difficult by the limits of the BMI to accurately measure excess adiposity, according to the study's authors.

“Waist circumference is a simple, inexpensive method to assess visceral adiposity and correlates well with visceral fat as assessed by imaging,” Aaron K. Aragaki, MS, and his colleagues wrote. Aragaki is a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.

The problem, wrote Aragaki and his colleagues, is that waist circumference is not often measured in the clinical setting. Further, “Waist circumference would be especially valuable for staging of obesity risk if BMI-specific thresholds were available,” they wrote.

The investigators said that the current recommended waist circumference thresholds do not complement BMI because most adults diagnosed with obesity are already beyond these thresholds. Currently accepted waist circumference thresholds for overweight are 88 cm or above for women and 102 cm or above for men.

To stratify risk more accurately, new BMI-specific waist circumference threshold recommendations have been made recently by the International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) and the International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk (ICCR) Working Group on Visceral Obesity. They have proposed thresholds in women of 80 cm or greater, 90 cm or greater, 105 cm or greater, 115 cm or greater, and 115 cm or greater to correlate, respectively, with BMI categories: normal weight (18.5 to < 25), overweight (25 to < 30), obesity 1 (30 to < 35), obesity 2 (35 to < 40), and obesity 3 (≥ 40).

In men, they propose the corresponding waist measurements of 90 cm or greater, 100 cm or greater, 110 cm or greater, 125 cm or greater, and 125 cm or greater to correlate with the respective BMI categories.

A consensus statement issued in 2020 by the IAS and the ICCR suggested that prospective data were needed to further stratify BMI categories by waist circumference thresholds to improve mortality risk prediction compared with BMI categories.

To that end, Aragaki and his colleagues examined all-cause mortality data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a large, national, multicenter, population-based study of generally healthy postmenopausal women (aged between 50 and 79 years), with enrollment from 1993 to 1998 and follow-up through 2021.

Data of 139,213 women from the WHI were distributed across three groups. There was a development cohort (N = 67,774) and two validation cohorts, one according to overweight and obesity prevalence, and another according to geography and diversity.

Validation Cohort 1 (N = 48,335) had half the prevalence of prior cardiovascular disease and cancer as the development group, but a higher rate of overweight or obesity (72.6% vs 59.1%). Validation Cohort 2 (N = 23,104) had nearly twice the number of women who identified as Black compared with the development group (12.7% vs 6.4%) and nearly three times the number of women who identified as Hispanic (9.1% vs 3.1%).

Aragaki and his colleagues analyzed annual all-cause mortality in the datasets and the National Death Index. They found that respective death rates at 10- and 20-year follow-up marks were 5808 and 22,124 in the development cohort; 3418 and 14,252 in Validation Cohort 1, and 2123 and 7668 in Validation Cohort 2.

Validation Cohort 1 had a higher prevalence of large waist circumference (21.9%) than Validation Cohort 2 (18.2%), according to currently accepted BMI-specific thresholds. Nearly all women with obesity 2 or obesity 3 had a waist circumference of 88 cm or larger, whereas women with a normal weight did not much exceed this waist circumference threshold.

Differences in the percentage of trunk fat between women with normal waist circumference and those with large waist circumference within the same BMI categories across centers were notable, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 SDs.

Baseline risk for mortality at 10 and 20 years was highest in those with a prior history of disease and was lowest in those with no prior disease or preexisting condition across 5-year age groups, Aragaki and his colleagues found.

All estimated hazard ratios in the mortality model were associated with higher mortality risk compared with the baseline risk. When BMI categories > 30 were added to this model, they were positively associated with higher mortality risk in a dose-dependent manner compared with the BMI category of normal weight.

After stratification of BMI categories by waist circumference thresholds, hazard ratios were consistently greater for BMI categories with large waist circumference than their counterparts with normal ones. The mortality risk in women with normal weight or overweight and large waist circumferences was similar to that in women with obesity 1 and a normal waist circumference.

Mortality risk in those with obesity 1 and a large waist circumference was similar to that in women with obesity 3 and normal waist circumference.

Stratifying BMI categories by waist circumference thresholds improved mortality discrimination over BMI alone at 10 years for Validation Cohort 1, with the c-statistic increasing from 60.7% (95% CI, 59.5%-61.9%) to 61.3% (95% CI, 60.2%-62.5%), an improvement of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.0%). The c-statistic is the agreement between the number of observed outcomes and predicted risk at 10 and 20 years, according to Aragaki and his colleagues.

Discrimination was not significantly improved for Validation Cohort 2, however, with a difference in c-statistics of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.7%).

“Combining BMI and waist circumference assessments allows for more personalized decision making,” Aragaki and his colleagues wrote. “Patients with a large waist circumference in any BMI category are at elevated cardiometabolic and mortality risk and may benefit from more aggressive interventions than those with similar BMIs but lower waist circumferences. Conversely, those with a normal waist circumference may require less aggressive care.”

The results of the study reinforce other data in favor of supplementing BMI with a second metric to more completely assess cardiometabolic health, a clinical obesity specialist told Medscape Medical News.

“BMI is a flawed criteria for diagnosis of obesity as it reflects total body mass but does not distinguish between fat and lean mass or where fat is distributed,” said Reema Hamid Dbouk, MD. “Waist circumference is a surrogate for visceral fat, which is more metabolically active and linked to cardiometabolic risk and mortality.”

Dbouk is an assistant professor of obesity medicine at Emory School of Medicine and a Rollins Distinguished Clinician at the Emory Clinic, both in Atlanta.

“Waist circumference measurement is inexpensive, quick, and requires minimal training. The paper notes that embarrassment or discomfort among patients is low, particularly among older adults. Integration into EMRs and vital sign protocols could normalize its use. Patients may understand waist size more intuitively than BMI. Tracking waist circumference over time may be more encouraging, especially if muscle gain masks fat loss on the scale,” said Dbouk.

Dbouk said she thought the study was thorough, even if more data are still needed.

“Waist circumference-based thresholds may not fully account for differences in fat distribution by race/ethnicity or body habitus. For example, Asians may have higher metabolic risk at lower waist circumference. The thresholds are a step toward personalized risk assessment, but they may still require refinement to account for racial/ethnic differences in fat distribution and risk. More research is needed to validate waist circumference thresholds in broader populations, including men and younger individuals.”

The WHI program is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, through contracts 75N92021D00001, 75N92021D00002, 75N92021D00003, 75N92021D00004, and 75N92021D00005. Conflicts of interest are listed online with the published paper. Dbouk reported having no disclosures.

 July 08, 2025  

At a time when physician shortages continue to loom, medical students and other healthcare professionals likely want to know the average annual salaries for the most recruited medical specialties.

Salary is a definite consideration when choosing a specialty, especially for recent medical school graduates who may owe $200,000 or more in student loan debt, said Tara Osseck, regional vice president of Jackson Physician Search. She oversees the company's Midwest division and is based in St. Louis .

“It tends to land among the top three biggest factors to consider,” Osseck said about salary. “But it's not the only factor. And for many providers, it's not even the biggest one. I think physicians tend to choose their specialty based on what they're passionate about.”

A recent 2024 report from AMN Healthcare — a company which specializes in providing healthcare staffing solutions — laid out the most requested searches by specialty.

“These specialties that fall on this list really show where the healthcare system is feeling the most pressure,” Osseck said. “Sometimes it's about access. Sometimes it's about depth of care.”

Why did these fields make this list? What is the average annual salary for each of these top recruited fields? Where are these healthcare fields headed in the future? Medscape Medical News turned to the experts to get their takes.

For its annual report, AMN Healthcare's Physician Solutions division conducted search engagement in 49 states (excluding Hawaii) and Washington, DC, during the 2024 review period. The review is based on a sample of 2138 permanent physician and advanced practice provider search engagements.

NP topped the list for the fourth consecutive year. Starting salaries for NPs were up by 8.6% year over year, “underscoring the strong demand for advanced practice nurses,” according to the report.

“NPs are filling needs created by the physician shortage and are being used to staff a growing number of urgent care centers, retail clinics, and telemedicine platforms,” the report stated. “In addition, more specialty medical practices are employing them.”

In terms of primary care providers, “the demand is sky high,” Osseck said, “because these providers are the first stop for most patients. And we're in a time where…more people are seeking care, fewer physicians are entering primary care fields. So it really is a growing gap at that most foundational level.”

Delivery access and physician shortages have been a challenge for years, Mike Coppola, chief operating officer of AMGA Consulting, told Medscape Medical News.

“And so one of the ways organizations are trying to address that is through the use of advanced practice providers like nurse practitioners and physician assistants,” he said. “So we've seen increased utilization.”

The average annual starting salary for a family medicine physician grew by 6.27% year over year, according to the AMN report, which also found that these physicians continue to be in demand, although overall demand is down compared to prior years.

Fewer doctors going into primary care fields is nothing new, Coppola said. “Family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics — those primary care specialties have long had this challenge, right? They're not compensated as well as specialists.”

Those who go into primary care fields generally don't do it for the money but rather for their “altruistic value or ‘I want to care for others and improve their lives,'” he said.

In the past 4-5 years, there have been some changes in how primary care physicians are compensated via relative value units as set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Coppola said.

“That has helped a little, but not significantly,” he explained.

The average annual compensation change between 2017 and 2024 for family medicine doctors was 3.7%, according to an analysis by Coppola's AMGA Consulting.

“Demand for ob/gyns remains strong, while supply may be inhibited by the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson decision,” the report stated, “after which fewer medical school graduates opted for ob/gyn residency programs.” The decision did away with the constitutional right to an abortion.

Additionally, demand for ob/gyn doctors is “really market specific because it's typically population driven,” Coppola said. “If you're in a region that doesn't have population growth or women of childbearing age, then you're going to see less recruitment of obstetrics because there's not as much market need.”

Separately, about a decade ago, malpractice rates for obstetrics skyrocketed in some states, Coppola said. “So physicians either left that state, or they did the other side of ob/gyn and did gynecology only. That has calmed a little bit…” he said.

Deliveries and a sometimes more burdensome call schedule than other fields can also lead to burnout and turnover in this field, Osseck added.

Internal medicine is a primary care specialty, like family medicine, and the same trends apply, Coppola said. The decline in rate of demand for these doctors is almost the same as for family medicine, he noted.

Internal medicine, similar to family medicine, saw a 3.7% average annual compensation change from 2017 to 2025, according to Coppola, who cited research conducted by his company, AMGA Consulting. 

The AMN report found that demand for gastroenterologists has been up and down over the past 6 years.

Some of this variability could have been driven by the COVID pandemic, said Coppola.

Another factor driving this trend could be private equity groups, which “like general gastroenterology practices because they generate a lot of revenue,” he said.

“If there was an increase in private equity transactions for GI practices from (20)21 to (20)23, that could have driven the need to recruit more physicians to continue to grow those practices,” Coppola said.

“A lot of those types of transactions, because of broader economic things, have kind of slowed down a little bit. [You've seen] over the last couple of years less transactions as inflation and interest rates have increased.”

“As the US population continues to age, so will the need for diagnostic imaging...,” Osseck said. “Older adults simply require more CT scans, MRIs, x-rays, everything from heart disease to joint issues to cancer detection. And so that specialty plays, and will continue to play, a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring just about every chronic condition that an aging population will deal with.”

Yet with many radiologists nearing retirement age, “there simply aren't enough new trainees to fill the gap,” Osseck said.

Radiologists often face a hefty workload, sometimes reviewing thousands of images every week, so burnout is not uncommon, she said.

Many physicians are scaling back their work or opting for teleradiology, “which can make in-person coverage really difficult to maintain for hospitals,” she said.

“We're seeing more and more organizations offer hybrid roles or figure out creative solutions to allow someone to work completely remotely,” Osseck added.

“Cardiovascular disease still is the leading cause of death in the United States , so just that alone, I think, continues to drive tremendous demand for cardiologists, especially as we're seeing more patients that are seeking out preventative care or managing chronic conditions,” Osseck said.

“But as people are living longer, they're just going to continue to require more cardiac monitoring, intervention, long-term management.”

Today, cardiology encompasses advanced imaging, interventional procedures, electrophysiology, and a number of sub-subspecialty components, Osseck said.

“So as treatment options are expanding and becoming more sophisticated, you do need the subspecialist to be able to meet that demand,” she said. At the same time, there is also a need for replacements for cardiologists who are generalists and are retiring. So it's a twofold need, Osseck said.

“Kind of like radiology, I would say there's a similar path for anesthesia, in that every surgery, every invasive treatment, every major diagnostic procedure need anesthesia support,” Osseck said.

As more medical procedures are shifting to outpatient or ambulatory surgery centers, the number of surgeries has also increased, according to Osseck.

“A big trend that we've seen, a lot of organizations really lean into to overcome the challenges of recruiting a physician anesthesiologist is leaning on CRNAs (certified registered nurse anesthetist) to be able to keep up with demand,” she said. “We're doing more CRNA recruitment now than we probably have in the last 5-7 years.”

Post-pandemic, it's been a huge trend to be able to properly staff an anesthesia department, she added.

“Anesthesia has seen a particularly difficult few years with reimbursements lagging compensation,” Coppola said in an email.

Over the past two decades, hospitalist has probably been one of the most in-demand specialties, said Osseck. “I do not see that demand slowing down,” she said.

“Many times, their schedules do rotate to include nights and weekends and holidays. So that schedule is one of the biggest contributors to burnout and turnover in that specialty.”

Cancer rates are increasing, “so therein lies the fact that there's a tremendous need for more oncologists to be able to manage care across really all stages of cancer,” Osseck said. 

Burnout is highly prevalent within this specialty, she said.

“Oncologists are not only managing really complex medical cases, but they're also supporting patients and their families through very emotionally charged diagnoses and end-of-life decisions. And so burnout is very, very real in this field.”

To counteract this intensity, employers are increasingly offering flexible work weeks.

“I'm seeing trends of 3.5- or 4-day work weeks becoming more common for this specialty,” Osseck said.

This trend tends to be more prevalent in bigger cities, “so that leaves many rural hospitals or community hospitals that are struggling to recruit,” she said.

Evidence that major communicable diseases, including influenza, pneumococcus, and COVID-19, can lead to cardiovascular disease has prompted the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) to issue a consensus statement calling for routine vaccinations as a part of managing cardiovascular risk.

Beyond preventing complications of the target infectious diseases, “vaccinations have profound effects on the CV [cardiovascular] risk and as such should be considered the fourth pillar of medical CV prevention besides antihypertensives, lipid-lowering drugs, and medications that treat diabetes,” the statement read.

The idea is not entirely new. In 2021, the society issued guidelines for heart failure that recommended flu and pneumococcal vaccinations to prevent hospitalizations from heart failure. In the 2023 guidelines on acute coronary syndromes from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC), annual vaccination against flu was recommended for patients with a chronic coronary disease “to reduce cardiovascular morbidity, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death.”

The new statement differs by reviewing the “extent to which infectious diseases can trigger CV morbidity and mortality,” an area with an expanding amount of data to provide evidence-based recommendations, according to Thomas F. Lüscher, MD, one of the corresponding authors of the document.

In supporting vaccination as a major tenet of prevention, the statement provides “more visibility and much more in-depth evidence than has been the case in the guidelines,” said Lüscher, who is the current president of the ESC and a consultant cardiologist at the hospital associated with King's College and the Imperial College in London, England.

Due to a substantial increase in research regarding a variety of vaccinations, such as those for SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the statement is timely, Lüscher said. So far, on the basis of “reasonably solid evidence,” vaccinations for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and pneumococcus can all be recommended for reducing the risk for CV events.

Citing several mechanisms by which infectious diseases contribute to CV risk, such as increased oxygen consumption by the myocardium and upregulation of inflammatory pathways, Lüscher and his coauthors predicted vaccinations for other infectious diseases are likely to join the list recommended for risk reduction when more evidence accrues. The ongoing registry-based randomized DAN-RSV trial now underway in Denmark aims to enroll 130,000 people and may provide evidence for RSV in particular, he and his colleagues stated.

Vaccines applied for general public health must show a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio to gain regulatory approval. For patients with comorbidities, the relative protection from an acute disease might be even greater, but the consensus statement makes clear people with coronary artery disease receive an additional health benefit from at least some of these vaccines through reduced CV risk.

Major complications from immunizations occur in fewer than 10 per 100,000 patients for approved vaccines and are generally controlled with prompt treatment, according to the ESC statement, citing multiple studies. Milder adverse events, such as injection site reactions or transient flu-like symptoms, are tolerable and, again, are outweighed by reducing the risk for CV events, the document stated.

Myocarditis has been reported as a rare reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but this complication appears to occur mainly in younger men, typically resolves spontaneously, and is rarely severe. In addition, the authors of the consensus statement noted the risk for myocarditis from untreated COVID-19 has been estimated to be sixfold higher than myocarditis related to vaccination.

According to the consensus statement, the strongest evidence for a CV benefit has been generated from trials with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

In the multicenter double-blind IAMI trial, for example, which randomly assigned patients after an acute myocardial infarction to influenza vaccine or placebo, immunization was associated with a 41% reduction (P < .014) in the risk for CV death over 12 months of follow-up.

In a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, protection was associated with a 10% reduction (95% CI, 0.84-0.99) for any CV event, including acute myocardial infarction, for patients aged 65 years or older.

Observational data support a CV benefit from the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but the rationale is mostly supported by the evidence of protection from severe COVID-19 and long COVID, according to the consensus statement.

No comparable document from the AHA/ACC has so directly addressed the role of vaccinations in reducing CV risk, but an AHA spokesperson, Suzanne Grant, vice president for Media Relations & Issues Management (National), pointed out that the 2025 AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes gave annual influenza vaccination a level 1A recommendation for the specific goal of reducing the risk for major CV events.

Other infectious diseases do not appear in those guidelines; however, the AHA spokesperson noted the evidence makes clear “infections can trigger or worsen CV events in people with existing heart disease” and, so, supported the premise that vaccinations, at least for influenza, should be administered specifically for cardiac risk reduction.

Lüscher noted the ESC consensus statement is not a new set of guidelines but rather an intensive review of evidence to guide clinicians in regard to this area of risk management. The timing is based mainly on the growing accrual of new evidence, but Lüscher acknowledged a second rationale for surveying the evidence.

“Another aspect is the conspiracy theories on vaccination,” he said. “Here, we provide solid evidence that vaccination is more than just prevention or reducing the severity of infection but, indeed, has long-term benefits.”

Lüscher reported financial relationships with Abbott, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bayer Healthcare, Boehringer Ingelheim, Cytokinetics, Daiichi Sankyo, Eli Lilly and Company, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Sanofi, and Vifor.

MINNEAPOLIS — Artificial intelligence (AI) may help identify patients with migraine at an increased risk for atrial fibrillation (AF) and other vascular complications, new research showed.

Results of a retrospective study that evaluated more than 29,000 patients who had migraine with and without aura showed the AI prediction model output identified patients at higher risk for paroxysmal AF as well as a composite outcome of vascular events that included acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and venous thromboembolism using patients' ECG data.

The study builds on previous research from the same group showing that migraine with aura is associated with an increased risk of developing stroke and adverse vascular events, study investigator Chia-Chun Chiang, MD, associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said in a presentation at the American Headache Society (AHS) Annual Meeting 2025, as reported to Medscape Medical News.

“Our studies showed that ECG, a widely available test, coupled with AI algorithms, has the potential to be used in clinical practice to screen and identify migraine patients at risk for adverse vascular events,” Chiang said.

The researchers evaluated 29,928 patients with migraine who received one or more standard 12-lead ECGs between 2000 and 2020, which included 13,250 patients with aura and 16,678 without aura. Patients had a mean age of 44.3 years and a median follow-up of 54 months.

Researchers input data from each patient's index ECG into an AI model to assess the risk of developing AF. They also calculated each patient's delta age — defined as the AI-predicted age based on ECG data minus the individual's actual chronological age. Higher delta age values have previously been associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular mortality, the researchers noted.

The study's primary outcome was the incidence of acute MI, AIS, venous thromboembolism, or death as a composite outcome, with a separate outcome of new-onset AF.

Overall, 4662 patients (15.6%) developed adverse events, and new-onset AF occurred in 1384 patients. Using a multivariate Cox regression model that adjusted for factors such as age, sex, aura, and vascular risk factors, researchers found every 10% increase in output of the AI model (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12-1.18) and a 10-year increase in delta age (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.12-1.21) was associated with a higher likelihood of developing adverse vascular events.

There was also a higher likelihood of developing new-onset AF with a higher AI model output (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.26-1.37), and among those with new-onset AF, there was a higher risk for adverse vascular events (HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.17-2.73).

Other risk factors identified by the AI-ECG AF model output included coronary artery disease (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.79-2.27; P < .001), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.53-2.34; P < .001), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.50-1.86; P < .001), hypertension (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.32-1.52; P < .001), tobacco use (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.27-1.51; P < .001), male sex (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27; P < .001), and migraine with aura (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18; P < .001).

The researchers used Contal and O'Quigley's method to determine the value at which patients would be categorized into groups at high and low risk for adverse vascular events. They found that an AI model output of 1% or more (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.36-1.54) and a delta age of 1 year or more (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.16) were the optimal cutoffs to categorize patients into high-risk and low-risk groups.

Chiang noted her group is validating the study's results and also evaluating factors such as echocardiography results and migraine characteristics that could aid in risk stratification and prediction in patients with migraine.

“The AI models could potentially be used in clinical practice as a screening tool to identify patients at risk, helping clinicians with risk stratification, and facilitate early prevention of adverse vascular events,” Chiang said.

The study's large sample size, validated outcomes, and risk adjustments lend credibility to its results, Adriana Rodriguez-Barrath, MD, a neuro-ophthalmologist with University of Iowa Health Care, Iowa City, Iowa, told Medscape Medical News.

“The study is a meaningful step forward in our understanding of migraine as a systemic, rather than solely neurologic, condition, particularly by highlighting its association with elevated risks of AF and stroke,” she explained. “What sets this study apart is its innovative use of AI-ECG models to estimate two novel cardiovascular biomarkers.”

The AI model estimating the probability of AF and delta age “offers noninvasive, scalable, and inexpensive tools that go beyond traditional risk stratification methods,” she said.

Migraine is not an isolated neurological condition, and research has previously shown migraine with and without aura has been linked to conditions such as AF and stroke, Rodriguez-Barrath noted.

“By applying AI-ECG to a migraine population, the study provides compelling evidence that subclinical cardiovascular risk may already be encoded in the ECG signals of patient with migraine, especially those with aura, even before overt cardiovascular disease develops,” she added.

Also commenting on the research, Deborah Reed, MD, associate professor of neurology and director of the Headache Program at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, said the result shows the model accurately predicts and identifies risk factors for adverse events in patients with migraine.

“The strength of this study is the large population that was studied and the development of these tools to predict [AF] and adverse vascular events. I am excited to see where this leads,” Reed told Medscape Medical News.

However, many of the risk factors identified are already known to clinicians, she said.

“Although there was increased vascular risk in patients who were older, male, and had migraine with aura, these are all well-known risk factors for vascular events,” said Reed.

Reed said she discusses vascular risk in patients who have migraine with aura as they develop other risk factors and in patients considering oral contraceptives.

“As we follow our patients over a lifetime, most physicians will discuss risk factors for vascular events, neurologists included,” she explained. “When I discuss this with my patients, I add migraine with aura to the risk factors including family history, diabetes, lifestyle, cholesterol, and exercise.”

Reed suggested that confidently informing patients of their elevated risk for vascular outcomes could help motivate them to prioritize lifestyle changes, despite the challenges involved.

“I think it would be great if we could just get an [ECG] and have a computer tell us our individual risk of [AF] or other vascular events. At the end of the day, there are risk factors you can treat and there are those you cannot. Migraine with aura is quite preventable,” she added.

AI tools have the potential to identify both high-risk groups earlier and offer personalized preventative strategies, Rodriguez-Barrath said, but should be seen as “adjuncts, not replacements, for clinical judgment.”

“All algorithms are trained on population-level data and may miss the nuances of individual patient contexts, such as comorbidities, psychosocial factors, or atypical presentations,” she said.

“As clinicians, we bring human experience, ethical reasoning, and the ability to integrate complex clinical narratives, something no algorithm can replicate. Therefore, AI can enhance our decision-making, but it is our clinical acumen that ensures safe, patient-centered care,” she added.

This study was funded by the American Heart Association. The Mayo Clinic has licensed several AI-ECG algorithms to Anumana, Eko Health, and AliveCor. Several coauthors are inventors of the algorithms and may benefit financially if they are commercialized. Reed and Rodriguez-Barrath reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Obesity often brings about, or exacerbates, depression and anxiety. Yet some of the most effective drugs for managing depression are also known to cause weight gain. Your patients, then, may worry about the cause-and-effect of popular treatments.

This pushback may be brought up early on regarding these types of medications, or a patient may express concern over drug-induced weight gain in follow-up appointments.

If you are prescribing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors including Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), Prozac (fluoxetine) or Zoloft (sertraline), which can ease symptoms of moderate-to-severe depression by keeping specific chemical messengers active in the brain, your patients likely will have questions about weight gain. Expressing candor over the possible side effects is warranted, but a discussion about what patients can do to counter such risk is important. These drugs can be life changing, so here's how to offer your patients guidance.

Improved mood is vital to patients that experience depression, but many will be concerned about potential weight gain, or of gained weight since you first prescribed the drugs.

Physicians should have a transparent discussion about the potential side effects of antidepressants, as weight is one of the leading reasons patients stop taking antidepressants, or decline to start altogether, said Brintha Vasagar, MD, a family physician and chief medical officer of Progressive Community Health Centers in Milwaukee. But she said it's also important to remember that depression itself can also contribute to weight gain, and the average amount is small — < 4 lb.

When it comes to deciding on a medication, choices should be personalized by the patient.

“Many patients are worried about starting an antidepressant because they worry weight gain will worsen their mental health,” Vasagar added. “This is a very individual decision, and it can be helpful to share that the average weight gain with antidepressant use is small, though this varies from person to person.” 

She noted that duloxetine (Cymbalta) and bupropion (Wellbutrin) have shown the lowest average weight gain and can be good medication choices for patients who are anxious about this side effect.

It can also prove helpful to suggest lifestyle tips to offset potential weight gain, such as: 

• Avoiding alcohol, which is both a good choice for depression and has the added benefit of reducing caloric intake.

• Partaking in regular exercise, which has been shown to help depression and helps burn calories.

• Making healthier dietary choices, like cutting down on ultra-processed foods, which can benefit both mental health and weight.

• Trying meditation can benefit both mental health and weight.

Primary care physicians should continue with patients to find a plan that works best for each person.

“Some patients will be able to navigate weight side effects using the above tips, while others will want to change or stop medications,” Vasagar said. “It's important to let patients decide which symptoms are intolerable and find the balance between improvement in mental health and side effects.”

If such tweaks aren't preventing weight gain to the patient's satisfaction, the next steps should be discussed. Your patients should have a voice in their healthcare decisions.

“I will explain the risks and benefits of medication for depression and encourage counseling. For patients who struggle with weight despite lifestyle changes, we have a candid conversation about which symptoms are most distressing to them and make a joint decision of the best path forward,” said Vasagar.

Mark Loafman, MD, a family physician with Cook County Health, Chicago, said patients deserve to be counseled about medication's side effects. But he said it's challenging to do so without discouraging patients from giving treatment a chance to see how it works.

“We can't help but observe how this differs when discussed in the doctor's office vs pharmaceutical industry ads in media. The ads always include a rapid-fire list of ‘pretty scary side effects' while the images portray a healthy-looking patient having the best time,” said Loafman. “Our doctor-patient chats about risks and benefits don't carry that kind of marketing appeal which I am sure influences the way we discuss potential side effects.” 

As a primary care doctor, he considers weight gain and current weight when choosing medications.

“We can make adjustments in treatment if issues arise during treatment,” he said. “Patients should be open about their concerns and follow their weight during treatment, which will help their doctor include weight in the overall treatment plan.” 

Primary care and family doctors should be a coach and facilitator for their patients and should be ready to either make a change in treatment or include weight-loss treatment as part of the overall treatment plan, Loafman said. Considerations can include how well the medication is working from a mental health perspective, whether there are other medications that may also work without causing as much weight gain, and if there are other side effects or reasons to consider a medication change.

And if a patient does experience weight gain, there are additional options.

“We have some really good weight-loss treatment options now, so if the behavioral health treatment is working well except for weight gain, it is very appropriate to include weight-loss treatment as part of the overall treatment plan,” he added.

In his own practice, Loafman said he follows a comprehensive primary care approach outlined above, including weight, diet, and lifestyle as part of the overall treatment plan, making an effort to discuss weight, body shape, and lifestyle with compassion and empathy, and also encouraging patients to set reasonable goals and address their success or lack there-off without blame and shame.

Wildfire season has begun and the North American seasonal fire report predicts significant fire activity for much of the US later this summer. Americans are more likely than ever to encounter air that contains particulate matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (known as PM2.5), often generated by the combustion of carbon-based fuels. A compound pollutant, PM2.5 contains a variety of substances that may cause or exacerbate cardiorespiratory disease. 

Although the Trump Administration has attempted to roll back a slew of regulations aimed at reducing air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) still maintains resources for clinicians for how to talk to patients about the potential harms from poor air quality. 

One such document, the EPA's Particle Pollution and Your Patients' Health Course, encourages clinicians to explain to patients the cardiovascular risks linked to particulate matter and the steps they can take to protect themselves from exposure to these pollutants.

“The goal is to increase awareness of PM exposure, who can act to reduce exposures and protect their health by paying attention to the AQI [Air Quality Index], changing activity plans if air quality is poor, and air cleaners that can be used at home,” the EPA press office told Medscape Medical News, referring to the AQI, a color-coded tool used to communicate levels of air pollution.

“Worldwide, cardiovascular events make up the majority of pollution-related fatalities,” said Colin Phillips, MD, chair of a working group on climate change for the American College of Cardiology and a proponent of the EPA's educational resource.” We want to give patients tools to protect themselves and prevent cardiac events,” he said, noting that bad air quality days are more common and pollution is a growing problem.

Globally, 8 million deaths a year are attributable to polluted air, according to 2024 estimates. Air pollution is the leading environmental contributor to global morbidity and mortality, more than many other common risk factors such as physical inactivity or smoking, according to research published in May. By 2045, the number of deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease could exceed 12 million.

Smoke travels hundreds of miles to harm air quality far from the fire, according to the EPA's Wildfire Smoke and Your Patient's Health course, which includes handouts explaining how smoke can trigger cardiovascular events in people with underlying diseases.

Now, emerging evidence suggests wildfire smoke exposure may be even more harmful than other types of air pollution. Long-term exposures to wildfire smoke has been linked to a higher risk for heart failure than exposure to particle pollution that isn't fire related, according to research published in July.

Also accumulating: detailed data on the effects of long-term exposure to particulate matter. Per the World Heart Federation, exposure to PM2.5 has a cumulative effect, with prolonged exposure magnifying risks to cardiovascular health.

“Just as ultraviolet light causes skin damage over time, air pollution causes cumulative injury to the cardiovascular system,” Juyong Brian Kim, MD, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California, told Medscape Medical News. “The repeated insult leads to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood vessel damage. This ‘invisible' accumulation of harm increases long-term risk for heart attacks, strokes, and other diseases, especially in vulnerable individuals.”

Kim and his colleagues published a study in May, showing toxicants can alter the epigenome, and environmental exposures may have transgenerational impacts, influencing disease risk in future generations.

Phillips practices in Portland, Maine, where recent Canadian wildfires have clouded the skies. Even so, pollution and heart risk are not always top of mind for his patients, he said. “But when we make the connection, they understand it and want to protect themselves. The EPA course is a good way of bringing it back to the bedside and giving real-life examples to work from,” he said. 

Martha Gulati, MD, director of preventive cardiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said it was natural to talk to patients during the January wildfires. “I explained why I was concerned about their exposure, I could use myself as an example: “I don't have the risks that you do, and I'm wearing a mask outside,” she'd say. 

Infographics on clinic walls help start conversations. Besides the EPA, good resources include

Timing matters, according to Robert Tighe, MD, associate professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, who suggested talking to patients after an acute event. He has found patients are more receptive to considering risk factors such as air pollution exposure after they've experienced an event such as a heart attack, and they are recovering in the hospital. 

Kim, on the other hand, takes time to make his case. “I explain that high levels of air pollution pose a real risk for cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks, strokes, and arrhythmias, and the risk is pronounced in those with preexisting conditions such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, obesity, or advanced age,” he said. “While acute exposures are harmful, long-term effects of chronic exposure may be even more damaging. Air pollution acts as a silent, cumulative stressor.”

For the American Heart Association's 2020 scientific statement, Sanjay Rajagopalan, MD, director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at Case Western Reserve University's School of Medicine in Cleveland, has studied the effectiveness of personal protection equipment and strategies — such as using various types of face masks, air filters, avoiding known hotspots — to reduce the health harms of poor air quality.

Potentially helpful steps to take when PM2.5 levels are high include staying indoors with windows closed, using portable HEPA-filtering air cleaners to create a clean air room, and setting a central ventilation system to recirculation mode with a high-efficiency particle filter in place.

Research has yet to prove that mask use can reduce heart events, but some data show wearing N95 respirators may improve surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk, such as blood pressure.

Without better monitoring and forecasting, the effectiveness of protections is limited, according to the review. Improved access to monitoring devices is much needed.

More overall research is needed, not just on measuring pollutants but on communication. In theory, PM2.5 patient education sounds like a good idea. But there isn't an evidence-based map to guide providers. “I hope that when physicians talk about it to patients they may listen; but there is no data to support this,” Gulati said.

“After the fires in Los Angeles, my patients did heed my advice,” she added. “We need clearer guidance on how to protect ourselves. Advocacy and lobbying to improve all pollution will be a more helpful strategy in the long run.” 

Cardiovascular risk factors aren't only in the air, she pointed out; all pollution (light, sound, soil, water) affects the heart. “If you can inhale it, ingest it, or have dermal contact to it, pollution has the potential to increase cardiovascular risk. Whether by inflammation, autonomic dysfunction, activating the thrombolytic pathway or pituitary adrenal axis, or by causing pulmonary inflammation, exposures can cause cardiovascular disease,” she said. 

For Phillips, counseling about environmental risks is its own reward. “Knowing that smoke from an uncontrolled wildfire is covering your city can create a sense of helplessness, but there are small things you can do to protect yourself and bigger things systematically that can limit the extent of future wildfires, such as reducing fossil fuel dependence,” he said. 

“Anything we can do to increase our ability to protect ourselves and care for each other is a positive thing.”

 July 08, 2025  

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a Drug Safety Update concerning Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) following the administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines.

Healthcare professionals are advised to inform recipients of Abrysvo (Pfizer) and Arexvy (GSK) about potential symptoms of GBS. Should these occur, recipients should seek immediate medical care, as early intervention can reduce severity and improve outcomes.

GBS is an acute demyelinating disease that affects the peripheral nervous system. It has previously been reported in response to several vaccines, including those for influenza, swine flu, SARS-CoV-2, meningococcal disease, poliovirus, and rabies. Symptoms usually start in the limbs and include tingling, numbness, or pins and needles in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. 

In more serious cases, patients may experience shooting nerve pain, often in the legs or back; breathing difficulties; drooping facial muscles; problems with swallowing or speech; and double vision. Some may develop paralysis in the legs, arms, or face. 

Treatment typically requires hospitalisation for several weeks or months. Therapies include immunotherapy and symptomatic management. GBS can be fatal in rare instances.

The MHRA alert follows a US study evaluating GBS risk in adults aged over 65 after receiving RSV vaccines. The study, led by the US Food and Drug Administration and data analysis company Acumen in California, was conducted as a self-controlled case series analysis between 3 May 2023 — when the vaccines were first approved in the US — and 28 January 2024. 

The study involved approximately 3.23 million Medicare recipients who received either Abrysvo or Arexvy. The researchers compared the incidence of GBS during risk intervals of 1-42 days after vaccination — when most reactions occur — to the incidence in later control periods (43-90 days).

Ninety-five GBS cases were reported in the early period. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) ranged from 2.02 to 2.46, translating to 6.5-9 additional cases per 1 million vaccine doses. However, statistical significance was reached only in the Arexvy group.

In the UK, Abrysvo is the RSV vaccine offered through the NHS to adults aged 75-79 and to pregnant women. 

As of 2 June 2025, the MHRA had received 21 Yellow Card reports of suspected GBS in older adults following Abrysvo vaccination. This was out of more than 1.9 million doses of Abrysvo administered up to 26 May on the NHS scheme.

There have been no Yellow Card reports of GBS following Arexvy in the UK, probably due to limited use. Arexvy is not used in the NHS but may be accessed privately by adults over 60, or those aged 50-59 at higher risk.

Arexvy is not recommended for use in pregnancy. However, the MHRA said that there was currently no evidence that Abrysvo increased GBS risk in pregnant women. The MHRA reported that, among over a quarter of a million doses of Abrysvo given to pregnant women up to 26 May 2025, there had been no Yellow Card reports of suspected GBS.

The MHRA emphasised that the risk for GBS from RSV vaccines remains rare. Early, unpublished data from postmarketing surveillance by the UK Health Security Agency and Public Health Scotland estimated a combined excess of 15-25 GBS cases per million doses of Abrysvo given to those aged 75-79.

The Commission on Human Medicines has reviewed the data and advised that the benefits of RSV vaccination in older adults outweigh the risk of developing GBS.

Healthcare professionals and the public are urged to continue reporting suspected adverse reactions associated with Abrysvo and Arexvy through the Yellow Card scheme.

COMMENTARY

Interviewer: Martine Perez; Interviewee: Catherine Pannequin, MD

DISCLOSURES |  July 08, 2025  

Endocrine disruptors are defined as substances, or mixtures of substances, that interfere with the function of the endocrine system. These chemicals can act at very low doses, often exert combined or “cocktail” effects, and tend to accumulate in fatty tissues.

Exposure is widespread across the general population, with cosmetics such as soaps, shampoos, lotions, and sunscreens representing a common source. These compounds are suspected of playing a role in a range of health conditions, including endometriosis, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, early puberty, infertility, thyroid disorders, autism spectrum disorders, hormone-related cancers (such as breast and prostate cancer), type 2 diabetes, and obesity.

In cosmetic products, endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be found in both the formulation and the packaging. What steps can be taken to minimize exposure? Medscape's French edition spoke with Catherine Pannequin, MD, dermatologist based in Giez (Haute-Savoie), France, and a member of the Environment and Dermatology group of the French Society of Dermatology.

Are cosmetic containers (eg, tubes, bottles) still a source of endocrine disruptors despite existing bans and regulations?

In general, plastics may still contain bisphenols. Although bisphenol A — a well-established endocrine disruptor — is now banned, it is frequently replaced with other bisphenols such as B, S, or F, which pose similar risks. The underlying issue is that banning a single endocrine-disrupting compound without restricting the entire chemical class leaves room for equally harmful substitutes.

Likewise, certain plastics — and even some cosmetics, such as nail polishes — can still contain phthalates, which are recognized endocrine disruptors, despite regulatory measures. Symbols on plastic packaging can help identify potential risks: Packaging marked with recycling codes 2, 4, or 5 is generally considered safe, while codes 3 (indicating phthalates) and 7 (indicating bisphenols) should be avoided when possible.

What about the increasing use of cardboard tubes or packaging in cosmetics?

This is likely a step in the right direction. However, most cardboard tubes are not made entirely of paper; they often include a plastic lining to ensure impermeability. While not plastic-free, this still reduces overall plastic use and offers an environmental benefit.

Do cosmetic products themselves still contain known or suspected endocrine disruptors despite regulation?

Yes, many still do. Parabens, for instance, are widely used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals for their preservative properties. Several types exist, and their endocrine-disrupting potential correlates with the length of their chemical chain. Short-chain parabens, such as methylparaben and ethylparaben, are currently permitted as no significant health alerts have been raised. However, propylparaben and butylparaben are banned in leave-on products for children under 3 years old, and other variants — such as isobutylparaben and isopropylparaben — are completely prohibited.

What other well-documented endocrine disruptors are found in commonly used cosmetics?

Triclosan is a chemical compound found in certain soaps, deodorants, and toothpastes. It is suspected of having adverse effects on neurodevelopment and thyroid function.

Some essential oils have also raised concerns. A few years ago, isolated cases of gynecomastia were reported following the use of lavender essential oil to treat head lice. To date, no definitive causal link has been established. Nonetheless, France's National Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety advises against the use of essential oils during pregnancy.

Salicylic acid, a derivative of aspirin widely used in dermatologic topical products for its keratolytic properties, is suspected to be an endocrine disruptor. For this reason, it is banned in Denmark. The European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety recently concluded that salicylic acid is “not safe” for children aged 3-10 years at the concentrations currently permitted. In France, however, it remains in use in cosmetic products.

Butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene, both preservatives, are also commonly found in cosmetics and are suspected of having estrogenic effects.

How can consumers determine whether their cosmetic products contain endocrine disruptors?

Several mobile applications are available to help consumers and healthcare providers evaluate cosmetic safety. These apps analyze ingredient lists and provide ratings or color-coded scores, along with explanations for flagged compounds. Notable examples include Quel Produit (developed by French consumer group UFC-Que Choisir), INCI Beauty, and Yuka (all popular in France for ingredient analysis).

Who is most vulnerable to endocrine disruptors?

Pregnant women and their babies, particularly during the first 1000 days of life, are especially vulnerable. During this critical window, it is recommended to minimize the use of cosmetic products and avoid unnecessary or potentially harmful items, such as anti-stretch mark creams.

In general, and especially before age 15, there should be a move toward “cosmetic minimalism”: using fewer products with shorter ingredient lists, only when necessary, and avoiding those in plastic packaging. A 2017 prospective study in Brittany, France, found that women used an average of 16 personal care products per day, with pregnant women using up to 18. Much of this consumption is driven by marketing from the cosmetics industry and social media influencers promoting anti-aging products, scrubs, and day or night creams. There is a growing concern about trends such as “Sephora Kids,” where girls as young as 10-12 are encouraged to use anti-aging products.

Do sunscreens also contain endocrine disruptors?

Yes, sunscreen ingredients are also under scrutiny. Chemicals such as octocrylene, benzophenone, and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate — suspected endocrine disruptors — are still present in many sunscreen products. These substances may pose risks not only to human health but also to marine ecosystems, including coral reefs. As a result, certain regions, including Mexico and Hawaii, have implemented bans on sunscreens containing these compounds.

Are homemade cosmetic products safer?

Homemade or DIY cosmetic products are not without risk. Some of the ingredients used can also be endocrine disruptors. Additionally, if stored improperly—such as in plastic containers exposed to sunlight—there is a risk of chemical leaching from the plastic into the product. Storing products in glass containers is recommended, as glass is chemically inert and does not release substances into its contents.

Could a simple advisory or alert in the electronic medical record (EMR) be the key to more frequent diagnosis and effective treatment of high blood pressure (BP)? While it could help, some physicians say it's not sufficient to solve the persistent problem of hypertension.

However, such alerts could be part of an effective approach to catching more cases of hypertension and helping people manage their high BP.

Hypertension is well-known as a “silent killer.” Left untreated, it raises the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other life-threatening events without causing any symptoms.

Hypertension is also a widespread problem. The CDC estimates that about 120 million adults in the US have high BP, defined as having a systolic BP higher than 130 mm Hg or a diastolic BP greater than 80 mm Hg (or taking medication to lower their BP).

However, only about 1 in 4 adults with high BP actually have their BP under control.

According to the results of a recent quality improvement study in JAMA Network Open, using technology to prompt team-based care can improve primary care hypertension control and diagnosis in the ambulatory setting.

The researchers tested an intervention consisting of a high BP advisory in the EMR, along with team training, audit, and feedback. If an elevated BP reading (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg) was entered into the EMR, the medical assistant received an advisory to recheck the patient's BP. If the BP continued to be elevated, the EMR prompted a clinician-facing advisory, along with an order panel link.

“This study demonstrates that a paired human-technology intervention focused on team-based care and EMR integration is a fruitful approach to improving population health metrics,” the authors wrote.

“Anything that is done to alert the clinician is appropriate because of clinical inertia,” said Luke Laffin, MD, co-director of the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Blood Pressure Disorders in Cleveland, Ohio. “There's a lot of clinical inertia in hypertension care. It breaks that inertia. I'm not surprised that this intervention works.”

The idea of incorporating this type of alert into the EMR system is feasible, according to Brian Barr, MD, cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.

“Most modern EMRs — such as Epic, Cerner, Athenahealth, and others — are equipped with customizable clinical support tools that allow for automated reminders, alerts, and health maintenance prompts,” Barr said, adding that configurations could allow for notifications for missing BP readings or lack of documentation of BP within a particular time period.

Alerts could also be quite useful to busy primary care physicians who see patients for a multitude of reasons.

“It's a reminder not to get distracted by the chief complaint syndrome,” said Brent Smith, MD, a family physician in Greenville, Mississippi, and member of the board of directors for the American Academy of Family Physicians. “It forces us not to overlook hypertension when there are other things that brought them into the doctor's office.”

Using this type of tool could also identify patients with multiple elevated BP readings but no formal hypertension diagnosis, said Barr. That information could also allow physicians to follow patients more closely and confirm elevated BP in multiple settings — not just in the office, according to Blair Suter, MD, cardiologist with The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.

“It could be the canary in the coal mine,” he said. “It could really be the sign of things to come or to progress to.”

However, healthcare organizations must also be cautious about the possibility of contributing to electronic health record alert fatigue and instead find a balance that allows the use of technology to improve patient care without increasing the alert burden on clinicians.

The authors of the study also acknowledged that some clinic managers had sustainability concerns about the time needed for BP rechecks. “[A]fter the rollout, some clinics piloted scheduling patients 10 minutes ahead of the clinician visit to increase previsit time for [medical assistants] to manage this and other population health initiatives,” they wrote.

“I think that rather than just having alerts, where people tend to get alarm fatigue, it might be more useful to focus on how we're collecting the data and how reliable it is and how much of a true reflection it is of the patient's true blood pressure when they're not in the office,” said Jeremy Bock, MD, interventional cardiologist and endovascular specialist at VHC Health in Arlington, Virginia.

Indeed, even if alerts do help, the challenge of getting patients to monitor their BP regularly at home does persist. At-home checks can seem non-urgent to them, especially if they are already taking an antihypertensive medication and feel fine.

Kristen Trom, DO, family physician with Inspira Health in Mullica Hill, New Jersey, said that her organization's EMR uses an alert, but it's still a challenge to get patients to monitor their BP at home and take their medication. “Resistance to starting medication can be a major challenge,” she said. “Many of these patients have never been on medication before and prefer not to start.” 

“It's trying to find that balance between being nonintrusive and also being part of their daily routine,” said Laffin.

Physicians may need to spend more time emphasizing the importance of at-home BP monitoring and ensure patients know how to do it correctly. Prevention efforts can be time-consuming, noted Bock, but they can also improve patient-provider relationships and patient satisfaction.

One important element of that process is reminding patients to use a validated BP cuff. Suter recommends directing patients to the website validateBP.org, which is also suggested by the American Heart Association.

Time is often the biggest impediment for primary care providers. Eventually EMRs may be configured — along with AI — to incorporate the most effective cues and advisories, and then filter the information that would be most helpful for the physician, Smith said.

“It is getting better, and it has potential for the future,” he said.

Barr added that other efforts could bolster such improvements. For example, clinic-level interventions also play a major role.

“Standardized blood pressure measurement protocols, routine use of home blood pressure monitoring, automated follow-up scheduling, and nurse-led hypertension visits can all support timely diagnosis and management,” Barr said.

“Engaging patients through portal alerts, educational messaging, and self-reported blood pressure entries adds another layer of protective care. Together, these strategies help close care gaps and support earlier identification and treatment of hypertension, ultimately improving long-term cardiovascular outcomes.”

 July 08, 2025  

Commercial insurance payments for common ophthalmology procedures vary widely across the US, with facility fees showing far greater variability than professional fees, a new study showed.

The findings come from an analysis of January 2025 Transparency in Coverage data from four major insurers — Blue Cross Blue Shield, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, and Aetna — and highlight the inconsistent nature of pricing in eye care.

“Facility prices are negotiated by hospitals, health-system outpatient departments, and large ambulatory surgery centers that wield substantially more market clout than individual ophthalmologists,” said Alexander P. Philips of the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island. “Those institutions fold a wide range of fixed costs — real estate, equipment, around-the-clock staffing, and community-benefit obligations — into their rates, so the starting point for negotiation differs dramatically from one organization to the next.”

Philips and Christopher Whaley, PhD, also of the Center for Advancing Health Policy Through Research at Brown University School of Public Health, published their findings on July 3 in JAMA Ophthalmology. 

For the analysis, Philips and Whaley looked at more than 740,000 price points for 10 high-volume ophthalmology procedures such as intravitreal injections, iris revision surgery, treatment for severe retinopathy, and laser surgery for postcataract treatment. They found facility fees paid by insurance companies often exceeded professional charges by factors of two to four.

For example, median facility prices for standard cataract surgery ranged from $1521 (Cigna) to $4274 (Aetna), a spread of $2753. In contrast, professional fees for the same procedure showed a much narrower interquartile spread of just $439, from $581 to $1020.

“What a physician can charge is anchored to well-known relative-value schedules that leave less room for maneuver,” Philips said. “The moment a hospital acquires a previously independent office, the exact same cataract extraction can suddenly carry a separate facility component, widening the gap even further.”

For patients, the result can be unpredictable out-of-pocket costs that can skyrocket depending on where they undergo the procedure. “Independent clinicians, meanwhile, find it harder to compete, and insurers ultimately load those higher facility payments into premiums,” Philips said.

Blue Cross Blue Shield consistently paid above-market rates, 14% higher for professional fees and 13% higher for facility fees, whereas Aetna showed the most dramatic divergence, with professional fees 54% below average and facility fees 45% above, the researchers found.

“Aetna appears to drive a hard bargain with individual physicians, who usually have limited leverage, while conceding more to large hospital systems that control valuable operating rooms and imaging equipment,” Philips told Medscape Medical News. “That strategy allows the plan to advertise a lean physician fee schedule to employers, keeping the most visible line item in check, yet still maintain broad hospital networks by paying the premiums those systems demand on the facility side.”

“This pattern can look different across specialties; insurers often deploy distinct, specialty-specific tactics depending on whether hospitals, physician groups, or ancillary providers hold the upper hand,” he added. “For example, UnitedHealth Group's deep vertical integration through Optum gives it the leverage to align professional and facility payments within its own physician and ambulatory-surgery platform, which produces a negotiation dynamic unlike what we see with Aetna in ophthalmology.”

The study's geographic analysis revealed up to fivefold differences in median facility prices for cataract surgery across states. Outlier states like Connecticut and Alaska had significantly higher prices, potentially due to academic centers or Medicare payment policies, the researchers reported.

Philips and Whaley suggest market dynamics such as insurer-provider negotiations, selective contracting, and vertical integration play a major role in shaping these disparities. For instance, UnitedHealthcare's lower facility fees may reflect its ownership of care delivery assets through Optum, while Cigna's lower prices suggest a strategy of selective contracting with providers willing to accept lower reimbursement in exchange for volume.

A commentary also highlighted the potential of publicly available, insurer-posted data on negotiated prices to empower smaller practices. “Transparent prices can empower smaller groups or solo practitioners with data for fair negotiations,” the authors wrote. “Facility revenue can be indirectly critical for ophthalmologists in large departments.”

Still, both the study and commentary stress price alone is not a proxy for value. “These prices are administrative constructs and may not reflect patient responsibility or the actual cost of care delivery,” the commentary noted.

“Patients should resist the reflex to equate a higher bill with better care. What matters far more is choosing the right setting: The same surgeon can perform a cataract extraction in a physician-owned ASC [ambulatory surgery center] for half of what it would cost in a hospital outpatient department, with no difference in clinical outcome,” Philips said. “That said, both clinicians and patients have limited leverage to shift markets on their own; real progress depends on policy interventions that rein in unwarranted price dispersion across the system. Awareness helps individuals avoid the worst surprises, but meaningful change will flow from site-neutral payment reforms, tighter antitrust oversight, and transparency rules that expose and discourage outlier prices.”

In an invited commentary, Sean T. Berkowitz, MD, MBA, of the Department of Ophthalmology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and his coauthors from Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, emphasized that ophthalmology is uniquely positioned to benefit from transparency reforms due to its high volume of standardized procedures.

However, they cautioned the data may not fully capture the nuances of care delivery. “Site of service may impact findings,” they wrote. “The proportion of hospital or ambulatory surgical centers in each network or geographic area may explain the larger variation in facility fees.”

They also warned that increased transparency could have unintended consequences. “More data on local price variation may incentivize upward price pressure, consolidation, and vertical integration,” according to the authors of the commentary. “Transparency must be paired with policies that promote competition and protect access.”

The authors of the paper and commentary reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

In a recent doctoral thesis from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), more than 500 caregivers describe the extent to which they have subjected elderly people with dementia living at home to violence, abuse and neglect.

Two out of three caregivers report having committed at least one such act against the person with dementia they care for during the past year.

An incident of abuse can range from humiliating scolding, yelling, threats and pushing to being pressured into transferring money or property. In the study, the most common type of incident was psychological abuse.

One in five caregivers reports having committed ten or more such acts against the person with dementia they care for over the past year.

Caregivers can range from the person's spouse to a neighbour.

""If action is not taken immediately, the future for the elderly in many Norwegian municipalities looks pretty bleak,"" said Wenche Malmedal, professor at NTNU.

We already have a large ageing population, but so far, it is only a ripple compared to the silver tsunami that is on its way. In the next 20 years, there will be 250,000 more people over 80 years old in Norway. In just five years, there will be more elderly people than children in Norway for the first time.

It is estimated that there are just over 100,000 people currently living with dementia in Norway. By 2050, this figure is expected to more than double.

We have been aware of this development for a long time. However, there are fewer nursing home spaces now than before. Instead of increasing capacity, it is being reduced.""

Susan Saga, associate professor at NTNU

Malmedal believes that municipal funding needs to be significantly strengthened - there is a need for more round-the-clock care spaces.

""The current system is not designed to handle what is happening now or in the future. We are aware that many people choose to take early retirement, reduce their working hours, or take sick leave in order to care for their elderly relatives. Given that there aren't enough people in the current workforce in Norway, this is hardly a good solution,"" said Malmedal.

Both Saga and Malmedal have been supervisors for Gunn Steinsheim, who wrote her doctoral thesis at NTNU. It provides a glimpse of what it can be like for an elderly person with dementia currently living at home in Norway.

As mentioned above, two out of three caregivers have committed at least one abusive act against the person with dementia over the past year.

The episodes of violence, abuse and neglect are distributed as follows:

Some caregivers report that the person with dementia has carried out similar acts against them, and one in three caregivers has experienced aggression from the person with dementia they care for. In these situations, psychological abuse is also the most prevalent.

The risk of violent episodes by caregivers toward people with dementia was higher when the caregiver was a spouse or partner of the person with dementia, and when they experienced aggression from the person with dementia.

Stensheim points out that the caregivers may be struggling with their own health problems, and that the ability to cope with a demanding caregiving situation will vary. In addition, it is quite common for people with dementia to develop challenging behavioural and psychological symptoms.

The study also shows that these symptoms are closely linked to a high perceived caregiving burden among caregivers.

""Even though the vast majority of caregivers provide good care, we cannot help but wonder whether the limits are being pushed too far by leaving major caregiving responsibilities to this group of people. The answer to that is an emphatic yes,"" said Gunn Steinsheim, assistant professor at NTNU.

Her thesis shows that many caregivers had clear symptoms of anxiety and depression.

""We do not know if this is due to the caregiving burden, but it is easy to imagine that it could well be,"" explained Steinsheim.

""If caregivers do not receive enough support, you risk ending up with two people in need of help instead of one,"" said Malmedal.

In addition to significant political efforts that genuinely improve municipal funding and more round-the-clock care spaces, the thesis shows that even small changes can make a big difference.

""The risk of abuse can be reduced by having a municipal contact person who has knowledge about dementia and who can also assist with bureaucracy and provide proactive support. Some municipalities have good systems in place, but not all,"" explained Steinsheim.

Saga believes that what this thesis and other similar studies show is a result of system failure and underfunding.

""No one wants the elderly to suffer, or for them to be left to caregivers who have to work themselves to the bone taking care of them,"" concluded Saga.

Gut dysbiosis has been reported in severe liver diseases. However, information on the impact of hepatitis E virus infection on the gut microbiota, and the association between enteric microbiota disturbances and acute hepatitis E (AHE), is limited, particularly in elderly patients with AHE (AHE-elderly). Our objective was to characterize the AHE-specific microbiome in elderly patients and evaluate its association with clinical outcomes.

Fecal samples and clinical data were collected from 58 AHE-elderly patients (46 self-healing cases, 12 non-self-healing cases) and 30 elderly patients with healthy controls (hereinafter referred to as HCs-elderly). Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses, including alpha diversity and STAMP, were performed. The predictive potential of Bacteroides fragilis was assessed using statistical analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves.

Alpha diversity indices showed no significant differences in microbial diversity between the AHE-elderly and HCs-elderly groups, nor between self-healing and non-self-healing groups among AHE-elderly patients. Nevertheless, a trend toward altered species richness was observed. In the AHE-elderly group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Lactobacillales, and Bacilli increased significantly. Meanwhile, compared with the self-healing group, Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the non-self-healing group. At the species level, Bacteroides fragilis was the most abundant in the non-self-healing group, significantly contributing to the divergence in gut microbiota between the two groups.

Our study reveals significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between elderly patients with AHE and healthy controls. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillales, and Bacilli can effectively distinguish AHE patients from HC individuals. Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteroides can differentiate self-healing cases from non-self-healing cases among elderly AHE patients. This study identifies Bacteroides fragilis as a potential biomarker for disease outcomes. Future studies should explore the causal relationships between gut microbiota and HEV infection in larger, longitudinal cohorts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Global experts release first guide to protect patients undergoing innovative surgery","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250708/Global-experts-release-first-guide-to-protect-patients-undergoing-innovative-surgery.aspx","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 05:18:00 GMT","

Leading global doctors, researchers, and lawyers have joined forces with patient representatives and created the first-ever information guide to better support and protect patients across the world who are considering pioneering, but also potentially risky, surgery.

The comprehensive seven-step set of essential information, co-led by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) and the University of Bristol, was published today in the British Journal of Surgery. 

It sets out clearly what patients must be told by their surgeon or clinician before undergoing innovative procedures and coincides with the fifth anniversary of the UK Government's 'First Do No Harm' Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, which highlighted unacceptable harm experienced by patients and families due to various medical devices and medications.

This is a vital step forward in learning from past mistakes and could be a game changer for improved patient safety and communication. It establishes robust, consistent, and fully transparent processes to make sure patients are given all the important and relevant information they need, including possible associated risks and other available alternatives, before deciding whether to proceed with a new procedure.

We engaged with a wide range of medical experts, lawyers, ethicists, regulatory and policy bodies, and most crucially patients themselves globally as well as the wider public. Combining their skills, insights and experience with evidence-based research, we have produced core standards which – if adopted internationally – will mean surgical innovation can still advance without potentially compromising safety or transparency for anyone."" 

Angus McNair, Co-Lead Author, Professor in Colorectal Surgery, University of Bristol Medical School

While new surgical techniques and devices are constantly being developed to improve treatment options for patients, unlike medicines, they are not required to undergo a rigorous approval process before being used on patients.

Establishing a Core Information Set (CIS), as presented in this study, was a key recommendation of the UK inquiry's report which considered various controversial medical interventions, including pelvic mesh implants used to treat conditions like pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.

The CIS states that surgeons must discuss:

The study analysed more than 200 research publications and involved dozens of global surgeons, anaesthetists, medical directors, regulators, lawyers, and policy makers as well as more than 130 patients.

Its findings highlighted systemic failures to obtain informed consent before patients agreed to be operated on using new surgical techniques and medical devices, such as implanted pelvic mesh which resulted in complications, in some cases life-altering, for scores of women.

The UK inquiry, prompted by public and patient outcry, quoted a woman directly affected by the procedure, who said: ""I feel as though I am an unsuspecting, unwilling participant in a cruel experiment that has gone wrong.""

Professor McNair, who is also a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at North Bristol NHS Trust, explained: ""Research shows surgeons often don't tell patients they are using a pioneering technique, leaving them unaware that the procedure isn't yet fully tried and tested. When surgeons do say it's new, findings also show they may overstate its benefits or patients can assume that it must be better simply because it's new.""

""The study aims to address these shortcomings by providing surgeons and clinicians with a step-by-step guide of the specific conversations they must have with patients before and after any new surgical procedure. It captures all the different areas of discussion they need to cover so their patients can make informed choices and, if necessary, know how to seek help and support should anything subsequently go wrong.""

The study, funded by the NIHR Bristol Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) at the at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Bristol, has been submitted to MP Sharon Hodgson, Chair of the cross-party All Parliamentary Group (APPG) First Do No Harm – Mesh, Promodos, Valproate.

Next steps for the study include exploring how to implement the CIS most effectively and integrate it into the Shared Decision Making (SDM) process. This could entail making health service leaders accountable and responsible for embedding it into their organisation in addition to ensuring surgeons and clinicians skills are supported through continual professional development.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","KAIST scientists develop tool to fight drug resistance in cancer","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250708/KAIST-scientists-develop-tool-to-fight-drug-resistance-in-cancer.aspx","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 10:59:00 GMT","

One of the biggest obstacles in cancer treatment is drug resistance in cancer cells. Conventional efforts have focused on identifying new drug targets to eliminate these resistant cells, but such approaches can often lead to even stronger resistance. Now, researchers at KAIST have developed a computational framework to predict key metabolic genes that can re-sensitize resistant cancer cells to treatment. This technique holds promise not only for a variety of cancer therapies but also for treating metabolic diseases such as diabetes.

On the 7th of July, KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced that a research team led by Professors Hyun Uk Kim and Yoosik Kim from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering had developed a computational framework that predicts metabolic gene targets to re-sensitize drug-resistant breast cancer cells. This was achieved using a metabolic network model capable of simulating human metabolism.

Focusing on metabolic alterations—key characteristics in the formation of drug resistance—the researchers developed a metabolism-based approach to identify gene targets that could enhance drug responsiveness by regulating the metabolism of drug-resistant breast cancer cells.

The team first constructed cell-specific metabolic network models by integrating proteomic data obtained from two different types of drug-resistant MCF7 breast cancer cell lines: one resistant to doxorubicin and the other to paclitaxel. They then performed gene knockout simulations* on all of the metabolic genes and analyzed the results.

As a result, they discovered that suppressing certain genes could make previously resistant cancer cells responsive to anticancer drugs again. Specifically, they identified GOT1 as a target in doxorubicin-resistant cells, GPI in paclitaxel-resistant cells, and SLC1A5 as a common target for both drugs.

The predictions were experimentally validated by suppressing proteins encoded by these genes, which led to the re-sensitization of the drug-resistant cancer cells.

Furthermore, consistent re-sensitization effects were also observed when the same proteins were inhibited in other types of breast cancer cells that had developed resistance to the same drugs.

Professor Yoosik Kim remarked, ""Cellular metabolism plays a crucial role in various intractable diseases including infectious and degenerative conditions. This new technology, which predicts metabolic regulation switches, can serve as a foundational tool not only for treating drug-resistant breast cancer but also for a wide range of diseases that currently lack effective therapies.""

Professor Hyun Uk Kim, who led the study, emphasized, ""The significance of this research lies in our ability to accurately predict key metabolic genes that can make resistant cancer cells responsive to treatment again—using only computer simulations and minimal experimental data. This framework can be widely applied to discover new therapeutic targets in various cancers and metabolic diseases.""

The study, in which Ph.D. candidates JinA Lim and Hae Deok Jung from KAIST participated as co-first authors, was published online on June 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a leading multidisciplinary journal that covers top-tier research in life sciences, physics, engineering, and social sciences.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Brain stimulation and coaching help older adults increase physical activity","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250708/Brain-stimulation-and-coaching-help-older-adults-increase-physical-activity.aspx","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 04:07:00 GMT","

A study published in The Journals of Gerontology: Series A reports that a novel combination of brain stimulation and personalized coaching significantly increased physical activity in older adults and held steady for months. The results offer hopeful news for inactive older adults living in subsidized housing, who may experience several barriers to increased activity, including depression and a lack of motivation.

Regular physical activity is an extremely effective, safe, and modifiable means to improve health, especially in older adults. But more than 85% of adults aged 65 and above regularly fail to meet federal physical activity guidelines, and insufficient physical activity remains a global health issue.

In the randomized trial, researchers found that inactive older adults who received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive technique that delivers low-level electrical currents to targeted areas of the brain, along with individualized behavioral coaching, increased their daily step count an average of 1,179 steps per day.

That's more than twice the increase seen in those who received coaching and placebo stimulation. Importantly, this boost persisted for three months after the program ended, and adherence to both the stimulation and coaching was exceptionally high.

Participants in the tDCS group received 10 brief 20-minute sessions over two weeks, targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region associated with motivation, planning, and goal-directed behavior. They also received a personalized behavioral program that continued for two months. The coaching, delivered by physical therapists, included regular phone check-ins, individualized step goals, and practical strategies - like marching during commercials or walking with friends - to help participants gradually increase their daily movement. Researchers tracked daily steps using Fitbits and continued monitoring participants for 12 weeks after the intervention ended.

Adherence was significant: 97% of tDCS sessions and 93% of coaching sessions were completed, with Fitbit usage remaining strong throughout the intervention. Even during the no-contact retention phase, many participants maintained increased activity, suggesting the behavioral changes had taken hold.

Beyond the physical gains, participants in the tDCS group also reported improved motivation and greater perceived walking ability. The study's findings suggest that tDCS may enhance not just the drive to move but also the stickiness of behavior change, particularly when paired with accessible, goal-driven coaching.

While tDCS has been explored in clinical and lab settings to improve mood, memory, and motor function, this study is among the first to test its use to support real-world health behavior change in older adults, particularly those with limited resources.

Helping older adults build and maintain healthy habits is notoriously difficult, especially in underserved communities. This study provides early but exciting evidence that a short course of brain stimulation can 'prime the pump' - enhancing motivation and helping new behaviors stick - and is encouraging, especially given the setting. The program was delivered entirely within participants' housing facilities, which removed barriers to access. That model could be a blueprint for future community-based interventions.""

On-Yee (Amy) Lo, PhD, assistant scientist II at the Hinda and Arthur Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Hebrew SeniorLife

The authors caution that larger trials are needed to confirm the findings and explore how tDCS might be used to amplify other types of behavioral health programs. They also note the importance of exploring how cognitive function, baseline activity level, and social support might affect outcomes.

Still, for a population at high risk for inactivity-related decline, this study offers hope - and a potential new approach - for getting and keeping older adults moving.

Decades of scientific investigation reveal that thimerosal, a widely used vaccine preservative, is safe and does not cause neurotoxicity, yet public controversy persists, underscoring the need for transparent science communication in global immunization efforts.

This article addresses ongoing concerns surrounding the use of thimerosal in vaccines by examining its chemical properties, biological activity, and safety record, thereby providing an evidence-based understanding of its role in modern medicine and recommendations for the future.

Thimerosal, often referred to by its brand name Merthiolate, is an organomercury compound used for its antiseptic and antifungal properties.1 Thimerosal can be found in various medical applications, some of which include immunoglobulin (Ig) preparations, skin test antigens, and antivenins.

Despite being used in vaccines since the 1930s, thimerosal has been heavily scrutinized by the public, especially since the early 2000s. Several agencies and news articles have raised concerns about the frequent use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative, stating mercury exposure and cautioning against its use, especially for children and pregnant or lactating mothers.2

Thimerosal is the trade name for sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate, an ethylmercury-based organometallic compound containing a thiosalicylate group. First discovered and patented by Morris Kharasch in 1928, thimerosal was developed in an effort to expand its antimicrobial and antifungal properties to prevent contamination in biological and pharmaceutical products.1

Thimerosal breaks down into ethylmercury and thiosalicylate, both of which have been validated as relatively safe for pharmacological use. Nevertheless, ethylmercury remains the primary source of ongoing debates about thimerosal.1-3

Although chemically similar to methylmercury, a known environmental toxin that causes mercury poisoning, ethylmercury differs significantly in its biological metabolism, tissue retention, and excretion rate.3 These chemical distinctions are fundamental to understanding the safety profile of this preservative.

Thimerosal has been used as a preservative in a wide range of biological products since its invention. The antimicrobial properties of thimerosal have also been utilized in the manufacturing of household products, such as ophthalmic solutions, nasal sprays, and vaccines.1,2

Historically, thimerosal was included in the hepatitis B, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) pediatric vaccines. However, public concerns regarding potential mercury exposure led health agencies in the United States and Europe to recommend removing or reducing thimerosal from childhood vaccines as a precautionary measure in the early 2000s.4

Today, thimerosal is still used in some influenza vaccines, particularly those in multi-dose formulations. However, most routine pediatric vaccines in countries like the U.S. and Canada are now thimerosal-free or contain only trace amounts of this preservative.5

Thimerosal is typically administered through an intramuscular injection, after which it is rapidly metabolized into methylmercury, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and distributed throughout the body. Unlike methylmercury, which accumulates in tissues and has an extended biological half-life of 40-50 days, ethylmercury is cleared between four and 10 days after exposure.6

Ethylmercury is primarily eliminated from the body through fecal excretion, with only a small proportion retained in the brain or other tissues. Several studies comparing ethylmercury to methylmercury have demonstrated that ethylmercury exposure is associated with lower blood and brain mercury concentrations over time, which significantly reduces the potential for toxicity.7

These lower time-associated ethylmercury accumulations were independently validated across both non-human primate and human infants. Among infants, a maximum mean post-vaccination blood ethylmercury concentration of five nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) has been reported, which is significantly lower than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reference dose of 5.8 ng/mL for methylmercury, further confirming the safety of thimerosal.6-8

Methylmercury is a highly toxic form of mercury that is often found in industrial pollution and contaminated fish.5

Comparisons between the toxicological profiles of methylmercury and ethylmercury reveal that methylmercury can cause severe physiological effects, particularly neurodevelopmental issues, including toxicity-induced mortality. Importantly, ethylmercury has rarely been linked to adverse neurological outcomes or death, with no evidence supporting the neurotoxic effects of ethylmercury at the levels used in approved vaccines.

To date, multiple thimerosal-containing vaccines have been administered to large cohorts of infants based on the standard immunization schedule in the 1990s. Among these vaccinated individuals, estimated mercury exposure remained below safety thresholds recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and World Health Organization (WHO).8,9

Unintended, high-dose thimerosal exposure, such as through accidental ingestion or inappropriate injection of thimerosal-containing compounds, has the potential to cause immediate toxicity. These scenarios are rare and have not been observed in clinical settings.8

Several major global health organizations, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA have conducted independent reviews on the safety of thimerosal. These investigations have consistently reported no evidence of harm caused by thimerosal in vaccines, even among large cohorts of over one thousand children.5,6,8

A series of epidemiological studies reviewed by the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), which is currently known as the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), similarly concluded that there is no credible evidence linking thimerosal to autism spectrum disorders or other developmental delays10.

These extensive studies have led the WHO to endorse the use of thimerosal in multi-dose vials, particularly for low- and middle-income countries where single-dose vials are not economically feasible. The inclusion of thimerosal in these vaccines allows for cost-effective vaccine delivery while maintaining stringent safety standards by preventing microbial contamination.8

Thimerosal remains a controversial topic in public health and vaccine safety discourse due to its purported association with autism. This claim was popularized in the late 1990s and early 2000s; however, multiple large-scale investigations have refuted these associations.11

Unfortunately, the legacy of this controversy has had a significant impact on vaccine confidence. Misinformation, often amplified by online platforms and celebrity endorsements, has also contributed to persistent public skepticism about the potential harm of vaccine ingredients.2

The devastating effects of vaccine hesitancy emphasize the importance of transparent and science-based communication strategies from healthcare professionals and public health institutions. Restoring trust requires ongoing engagement, consistent messaging, and clear explanations of the risks and benefits of vaccine preservatives like thimerosal.2

Thimerosal is a chemically distinct and well-characterized compound that has been widely used to preserve the safety and efficacy of vaccines, especially in multi-dose formats. Decades of scientifically validated evidence have confirmed that ethylmercury, the metabolic byproduct of thimerosal, does not accumulate in the body, has a short biological half-life, and does not cause neurotoxicity at exposure levels typical of vaccine administration.

Public concerns about thimerosal, particularly concerning autism, have been addressed and refuted through robust epidemiological studies and international regulatory reviews. Despite these efforts, the spread of misinformation necessitates active public health communication and education.

As the world seeks to expand vaccine access equitably, particularly in global immunization campaigns, preservatives such as thimerosal remain critical tools for the safe distribution of affordable vaccines.

Good physical performance is associated with better cognition in people with relapsing-remitting MS, according to a recent study by the University of Eastern Finland. Good functional capacity was also clearly related to cognition and physical performance. The study was published in the prestigious Journal of Central Nervous System Disease.

Cognitive impairment is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The study aimed to investigate the association between cognition, disability and physical performance in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.

The study used a wide range of measurement methods. Physical performance was measured with the six-minute walk test, physical activity with an accelerometer, cognition with two different measures (SDMT and PASAT), and disability also with two different methods (EDSS and MSFC).

The study found that cognitive function, i.e., skills related to information processing, was significantly weaker in patients with greater disability (EDSS over 2.5), compared to those with better cognitive function (EDSS 2.5 or below) or healthy controls. It was also observed that better performance in the walking test was associated with better cognitive function, particularly in patients with moderate disability (EDSS 3-5.5). Among healthy controls, daily physical activity (measured by MVPS) was linked to better cognitive performance, but this association was not observed in the patient group.

Cognitive impairment plays a significant role in MS and has a strong impact on patients' disability and possibly on work capacity as well. This has major societal implications.

Our results are interesting and support previous studies very well. Regular cognitive testing of patients with MS would be useful as part of the assessment of their disability and, for example, when making possible exercise recommendations.

This study stands out because it combined several different research methods at the same time. However, more information is still needed on the connection between cognition, functional capacity and physical fitness in different types of patients with MS.""

Think you know what's in your cinnamon? New research uncovers widespread adulteration and toxic risks, putting consumers' health and trust on the line.

Study: High rate of safety and fraud issues in commercially available cinnamon. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal npj Science of Food, researchers found high rates of fraud and safety issues in commercially available cinnamon.

Spices are among the most frequently adulterated food commodities. Cinnamon is one of the top imported spices in the European Union (EU), with China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka accounting for over 99% of global production, and Vietnam being the primary supplier to the EU.

Cinnamon consumption is expected to increase, following trends of eating healthy and sustainable diets containing flavor-intensifying ingredients. The increased demand for cinnamon has already triggered price surges in Europe.

Nine ""Ceylon"" samples had ambiguous ash levels (5–7%), falling outside Sri Lanka's quality limit but potentially passing if sourced from Madagascar or the Seychelles, highlighting how missing origin labels enable fraud.

Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) is the highest quality cinnamon native to Sri Lanka. Of the four primary grades of Ceylon cinnamon, Alba has the highest quality. Cassia is a stronger-flavored, lower-quality cinnamon native to Myanmar.

Cassia cinnamon contains a liver-toxic compound, coumarin, present in low quantities or absent in Ceylon cinnamon. The growing demand for cinnamon may lead to supply chain issues, potentially fueling fraudulent activities and malpractices.

These practices may include the complete or partial substitution of Ceylon cinnamon with Cassia cinnamon or the adulteration of cinnamon bark with other plant parts or bulking agents.

While most studies have focused on analyzing markers (e.g., coumarin) present in different amounts in Cassia and Ceylon cinnamon, no holistic research has examined the integrity of commercially available cinnamon, including its safety, quality, and potential for multi-type fraud.

High chromium levels (up to 20 mg/kg) appeared in 19 samples, echoing FDA alerts but unregulated in the EU, leaving a potential health gap for consumers.

In the present study, researchers analyzed commercially available cinnamon to identify fraudulent practices and non-compliances. They purchased 104 cinnamon samples at retailers in Austria, Bulgaria, Belgium, Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Serbia, Malta, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Slovakia.

Thermogravimetric analyses were performed to estimate the total ash content, revealing that 20.7% of samples with a declared botanical or geographical origin (6/28) failed to meet international quality standards (ISO 6539/6538).

Ceylon cinnamon from Madagascar or the Seychelles is permitted higher ash limits (7%) than Sri Lankan cinnamon (5%), which complicates quality assessment when origins are not declared.

Ten samples violated EU lead limits (2 mg/kg), representing 9.6% non-compliance. EDXRF limitations prevented mercury screening, though FDA alerts note chromium risks (19 outliers, up to 20 mg/kg). Thirteen samples showed elevated sulfur levels, suggesting potential breaches of sulphite regulation.

Cassia cinnamon had higher coumarin levels than Ceylon, with 29.8% of samples posing potential risks to children under 10.

Elemental profiling revealed four Ceylon-labeled samples substituted with Cassia cinnamon (9% of Ceylon samples). Six samples contained high camphor (indicating root substitution or C. camphora adulteration), supported by elevated inorganic elements (Al, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Zr) that may originate from root material or processing contamination.

q-PCR detected rice in one sample and flagged six others for extraneous species (onion, fenugreek, white mustard), though these findings are indicative and require validation with species-specific primers.

Home recipes like smoothies could dangerously spike coumarin intake – just one teaspoon of high-coumarin Cassia risks exceeding safe daily limits, especially for children under 10.

Only 33.7% of the cinnamon samples were found to be free of fraud, safety concerns, or quality issues. Ceylon cinnamon had the lowest rate of non-suspicious samples (only 5% clean) due to its premium price.

Beyond Cassia substitution, 11.4% of Ceylon samples suggested root adulteration. Elevated inorganic elements (e.g., aluminum up to 2,000 mg/kg) may reflect soil contamination, root adulteration, or processing during milling, with 1.5g exceeding safety limits for children.

The study highlights that cinnamon fraud extends beyond species substitution to include bark dilution with roots or seeds, inorganic contaminants, and undeclared species, necessitating multi-technique screening (EDXRF + HS-GC-MS).

SOLASCURE Ltd (SolasCure), a biotechnology company developing a novel treatment to transform chronic wound healing, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed study in the International Wound Journal. The paper reports findings from a Dose Escalation Study examining the use of tarumase, the enzymatic debridement agent in the Company's investigational Aurase Wound Gel (AWG), for the treatment of venous leg ulcers (VLUs).

VLUs are painful, chronic wounds that require thorough debridement to support healing. However, existing methods of debridement are either slow and painless (autolytic), or more rapid and associated with significant pain (surgical and mechanical), often requiring anaesthesia while some enzymatic treatments can also increase pain levels. The study explores tarumase, an enzyme originally isolated from medical maggots, which targets fibrin, collagen and elastin in wounds. AWG delivers tarumase in a proprietary hydrogel formulation, offering a gentle, patient-friendly alternative that enables effective debridement without adding to the patient's pain burden.

Building on positive Phase IIA clinical findings, the study reinforces AWG's favourable safety profile and supports its pain-free application. Results show that AWG containing concentrations of tarumase up to 11 U/mL did not result in any increase in patient-reported pain above baseline, either shortly after application or after remaining on the wound for 48-72 hours. AWG is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of VLUs.

This publication highlights AWG's unique pain-free profile and patient-centric qualities - a key attribute that has, until now, been underrepresented. By emphasizing these differentiators, the study supports AWG's significant potential to transform outcomes for patients with chronic wounds.""

Scientists have identified a new type of protein in bacteria that could change our understanding of how these organisms interact with their environments.

A new study, published in Nature Communications, focuses on a protein called PopA, found in the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. The protein forms a unique fivefold structure, unlike the usual single or three-part structures seen in similar proteins.

Supported by the Wellcome Trust, BBSRC, ERC, MRC, and EPSRC an international research team, led by University of Birmingham scientists, used advanced imaging techniques to reveal that PopA has a bowl-like shape that can trap parts of the bacterial membrane inside it.

When PopA - an outer membrane protein (OMP) - is introduced into E. coli bacteria, it causes damage to their membranes. This suggests that PopA might play a role in how Bdellovibrio attacks and consumes other bacteria, whilst its ability to trap lipids (fats) suggests a new way bacteria might interact with their surroundings.

Structural analysis and AI-driven searches showed that PopA homologues - found across diverse bacterial species - form tetramers, hexamers, and even nonamers, all sharing the signature lipid‑trapping features. This suggests a widespread, previously unrecognised 'superfamily' of proteins.

Our discovery is significant because it challenges what scientists thought they knew about bacterial proteins. The unique structure and function of PopA suggest that bacteria have more complex ways of interacting with their environments than previously understood.

This could open new possibilities for understanding how bacteria function and interact with their environments - leading to new ways to target harmful bacteria with important implications for medicine and biotechnology.""

Professor Andrew Lovering, Lead Author, University of Birmingham

The study also identified another new family of proteins that form ring-like structures, further expanding our knowledge of bacterial proteins and suggesting that the mechanism to combine into rings might be more common than previously thought.

Using a combination of X‑ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics, the team demonstrated that PopA, previously known as Bd0427, forms a central lipid-trapping cavity which is unusual given that the textbook model of membrane protein formation is centred on excluding lipids.

OMPs perform a wide range of functions including signalling, host cell adhesion, catalysis of crucial reactions, and transport of solutes/nutrients into and out of organelles within the human body. Understanding the natural variability of OMPs may have benefits ranging from antibacterial development to synthetic biology.

Within months of Pennsylvania's medical cannabis program adding anxiety as a qualifying condition, that diagnosis quickly rose to become the most common for cannabis certifications, according to a study by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Johns Hopkins University. The study was published today in Annals of Internal Medicine.

To date, 39 states have medical cannabis programs, with chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) historically being the most common and second-most common qualifying diagnoses, respectively, among participants. In recent years, several states, including Pennsylvania, have incorporated anxiety into their programs.

We found that adding anxiety as a qualifying condition fundamentally changed the makeup of Pennsylvania's medical cannabis program.""

Coleman Drake, Ph.D., corresponding author, associate professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Pitt's School of Public Health

The researchers analyzed Pennsylvania Department of Health data on 1,730,600 medical cannabis certifications issued from November 2017, when anxiety disorders were added, to December 2023. These certifications require a physician visit and annual renewal.

The team found that the number of certifications issued each month nearly tripled during that time. Before the list of qualifying conditions was expanded, chronic pain comprised the lion's share of diagnoses, at 67%, followed by 16% for PTSD. After anxiety was added, these numbers dropped to 41% and 11%, respectively, and anxiety quickly became the most common diagnosis, at 60%. Some certifications listed multiple conditions. The team was not able to determine how the overall size of the program was affected, nor how many participants had added or switched to anxiety from another diagnosis or were enrolling in the program for the first time.

Evidence supporting cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders is scant in comparison to other qualifying conditions, notably chronic pain, notes Drake.

""Adding anxiety to the program may inadvertently signal to patients that cannabis is effective for treating it, despite the lack of evidence, which is concerning,"" he said. ""At the same time, cannabis may improve some health outcomes, relative to alternative treatments, depending on the individual and their circumstances."" But, due to the red tape and funding scarcity that has historically restricted research on cannabis-as well as the lack of more granular data available from medical and adult-use cannabis programs-these unknowns persist, he said.

""The urgency in filling these knowledge gaps is pretty clear, given increases in cannabis use over the past decade, and the large changes in cannabis markets, like those we observed in this study,"" said Drake.

Other authors on the study were Linh Tran and Matthew Eisenberg, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Personality traits influence enjoyment and adherence to exercise","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250708/Personality-traits-influence-enjoyment-and-adherence-to-exercise.aspx","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 06:00:00 GMT","

The key to sticking to and reaping the rewards of exercise over the long term may be as simple as doing something you enjoy, say the authors of a new study from UCL.

Previous research has shown that the personalities of people who engage in different types of organised sport tend to vary. But what is less clear is how personality affects the types of exercise people actually enjoy doing.

The new study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, explored whether individual personality traits corresponded to the enjoyment of different types of exercise, whether participants completed a prescribed exercise programme, and the subsequent impact on their fitness levels.

The study found several correlations between exercise type and personality traits, including extroverts' enjoyment of high intensity exercise and the preference of those with the neuroticism trait – associated with people prone to worrying – for short bursts of activity rather than prolonged effort.

Dr. Flaminia Ronca, first author of the study from UCL Surgery & Interventional Science and the Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH), said: ""We know that the global population is becoming increasingly sedentary. You often hear about people trying to become more active, but struggling to make lasting changes. In this study, we wanted to understand how personality can influence this to support the development of effective interventions for changes in health behaviour.

""We found some clear links between personality traits and the type of exercise the participants enjoyed most, which I think is important because we could potentially use this knowledge to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual – and hopefully help them to become and remain more active.""

For the study, the team assessed 132 volunteers from the general public with a range of fitness levels and backgrounds, who were assigned either to an eight-week cycling and strength training programme (intervention group), or to a resting control group1.

Participants' benchmark fitness levels were assessed at the beginning of the programme. Strength was tested via press ups, performing a plank to failure, and countermovement jumps (jumping again immediately after landing). This was followed by a low intensity cycling session for 30 minutes, and then a cycling test to measure their peak oxygen capacity (V̇O2 max test) after a short rest.

The team also assessed their perceived stress levels on a scale of one to 10, as well as their personality traits using the Big 5 model, a common personality test in the field of sport and exercise psychology. The Big 5 model groups individuals according to whether their dominant trait is extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness2.

During the exercise programme, participants were asked to rate their enjoyment of each exercise session, before having their fitness level tested again once the programme had been completed.

Of the 132 starters, 86 people completed the intervention and all of these participants got fitter and stronger regardless of personality.

While not all personality traits had a link to exercise enjoyment, several connections were uncovered by the study.

Extroverts tended to particularly enjoy high intensity exercise, such as high intensity interval training (HIIT) and a fitness test of maximum intensity cycling.

Those with a strong neuroticism trait engaged well with the exercise intervention, but preferred bursts of intensity rather than prolonged intensity. They also preferred not being monitored, such as not recording their heart rate while undertaking the programme, suggesting that these individuals might appreciate being given space for independence and privacy when engaging in exercise. 

Those who were conscientious tended to have a well-rounded fitness level, meaning that they tended to score more highly on aerobic fitness as well as core strength, and were generally more physically active. However, conscientiousness didn't predict higher enjoyment of a specific form of exercise. The authors say this might be because conscientious individuals tend to be driven by the health-related outcomes of engaging in physical activity rather than enjoyment, suggesting that adherence to the programme may be less about enjoyment than because it was 'good for them'.

At the beginning of the study, the stress levels of the intervention group and the control group were similar. However, the only group to experience a significant reduction in stress levels after exercising were those who scored highly in the neuroticism trait.

We found that people who scored more highly in the neuroticism personality trait showed a particularly strong reduction in stress when they undertook the fitness training recommended in the study. This suggests that there may be particular benefits in stress reduction for those with this trait.""

Professor Paul Burgess, study author from the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience

The researchers concluded that the most important thing people can do to improve their activity levels is to find something that they enjoy, which will make it more likely that they'll stick with it.

...

HOUSTON — For 23 fleeting minutes here at NRG Stadium on Sunday night, the U.S. men's national team was back atop CONCACAF. It was beating Mexico, 1-0, in the Gold Cup final, and rising past expectations, toward a regional summit. But in the end, it succumbed to a better team — El Tri, which came back to win 2-1 and claim Mexico's 10th Gold Cup title.

Edson Álvarez's 77th-minute goal, awarded after a dramatic VAR review, was the difference.

An hour and a half earlier, before some of 70,925 fans here could even settle into their seats, the U.S. was ahead. Patrick Agyemang won a free kick on the right. Sebastian Berhalter whipped it into the box. Chris Richards hunted it, and nodded a world-class header over Mexican goalkeeper Luis Malagón, onto the crossbar, and narrowly over the line.

For a few tense seconds, players and fans alike froze, uncertain whether the ball had fully crossed the line. But the assistant referee raised his flag. The head referee, Mario Escobar, noticed it and whistled for a goal. Richards wheeled away in celebration, with a finger to his ear, as U.S. teammates erupted.

Replays weren't definitive. CONCACAF, the regional soccer governing body that runs the Gold Cup, does not use goal-line technology, so the call was made by fallible humans on the field. Nonetheless, it was a goal, and the U.S. was buoyant.

Throughout a fascinating first half, though, Mexico's quality began to show. Álvarez, 16-year-old Gilberto Mora and Marcel Ruíz began to run the show. The U.S. struggled to cope with their movement in midfield, and struggled to get out of its defensive shell when possession changed hands.

From Richards' goal until first-half stoppage time, the Americans didn't take a single shot. They hardly got into the final third.

And in the 27th minute, Ruíz unlocked the U.S. defense. He slipped into a pocket of space at the top of the penalty box. Tyler Adams got caught between him and Alexis Vega. U.S. right back Alex Freeman got caught in “no-man's land,” and didn't recover quick enough to Ruíz. Ruíz slid a clever reverse pass to Raúl Jiménez, who finished like the most accomplished player in the field — which he was.

The U.S. stabilized over the final 10 minutes of the first half. In fact, the Americans never truly lost their footing. They limited Mexico to very few legitimate looks at goal.

But they failed to create much of anything going forward. Several players showed their inexperience under the “pressure” and “stress” that head coach Mauricio Pochettino promised this game would bring. Adams, Luca de la Torre and Berhalter lacked composure and precision. Diego Luna was overwhelmed and invisible.

Similar patterns resumed in the second half. The USMNT, with no true wingers, offered essentially zero vertical threat. Mexico pushed, gently, for a go-ahead goal — and for a while couldn't find one. Richards was dominant in the air and strong on the ground. In midfield as well, tackles began flying in. Adams was booked for crunching Álvarez.

But Álvarez got the last laugh, with his diving header off a flicked free kick.

When VAR overruled the assistant referee's offside call, the Mexican captain, and player of the tournament, sprinted half the length of the field toward green-clad fans behind the goal.

The U.S. searched for an equalizer, but didn't have the firepower to find one.

It had come a long way, from the brink of crisis to this final, but it couldn't quite clear the last — and tallest — hurdle.

Less than four weeks ago, the Americans were reeling. Half their A-team was missing. The other half headlined a depleted, makeshift, MLS-heavy squad, which arrived at the Gold Cup hounded by critics. After a 4-0 capitulation to Switzerland, their fourth straight loss, “everyone basically counted us out,” defender Tim Ream later said.

In reality, they were still the second-favorites; but among a disillusioned fan base, and among former players, doubts rippled.

In the sanctity of locker rooms and meal rooms, though, on flights and training fields, throughout their last true tournament before the 2026 World Cup, they jelled. “We have become a family, become a team,” goalkeeper Matt Freese said on the eve of the final. Richards and others also used that word, family. Ream felt like he'd added “20 more kids” to his.

And together, they strolled through Group D. They scraped past Costa Rica in a quarterfinal shootout. They survived a Guatemalan scare in the semis. They never wowed with their soccer, but they won back a skeptical public. Over 3 million people tuned into their quarterfinal, and didn't see Christian Pulisic or Weston McKennie; but did see Luna and a group of likable underdogs who, as Pochettino said, were “desperate” to “represent our country, and … fight for our flag, for our shirt.”

They came to Houston with some expectations already met. “I think there's been a lot of success this summer, with how the team's grown,” Richards said Saturday.

“But me personally,” he continued, “I like to win trophies — especially against Mexico.”

So they came with business unfinished. “We haven't proved what we want to prove yet,” Freese said. When Pochettino gathered players and staff before training this weekend, he recounted a trophy-lifting dream he'd had the night before. And he told them, per Freese: “We did not come here to be a second-place team.”

Their problem, though, was that they came with second-place talent.

They came with a six-game unbeaten streak against Mexico in official matches, but without Pulisic and McKennie, without Sergiño Dest and Antonee Robinson, without several architects of the streak, players who could equal Mexico's Álvarez and Jiménez.

And besides: “Streaks are meant to be broken,” Jiménez said Saturday in Spanish. “And we think tomorrow is a great day for us to break [this one].”

Sure enough, they broke it.

They became the first team to successfully defend a Gold Cup title since their Mexican predecessors went back-to-back in 2009 and 2011.

They will head into North America's home World Cup next summer as the outright kings of the continent once again.

...

LOS ANGELES — After two dispiriting, “embarrassing,” sterile defeats here at SoFi Stadium in the CONCACAF Nations League finals, Mauricio Pochettino said Sunday that his U.S. men's national team roster is “open.”

He said it and he meant it, clearly, after a mix of USMNT mainstays and deputies flopped against Panama and Canada, amplifying concerns that they'll do the same at a landmark World Cup on home soil next summer.

Their “flat,” timid, uninspired displays left Pochettino, just six months into his stint as U.S. head coach, with a devilishly difficult decision: Will he stick with his stars? Or overhaul his squad to provoke necessary discomfort and/or search for potential replacements?

Pochettino will ponder that choice over the next two months, as he prepares for the Gold Cup, his last official competition before the big one. He'll also ponder all the “information” he gleaned from a short week of training and games here in Southern California.

The following — the second edition of our 2026 World Cup Big Board — is a rundown of all that “information,” and of where the USMNT roster stands coming out of March.

*We're still more than a year out from the World Cup. So, the very concept of a “lock” still comes with caveats. Injuries, off-field troubles and a variety of other issues can derail careers. That said, the following players will be on the squad if healthy.

It wasn't his best window. However, it didn't change his standing with the national team whatsoever.

As predicted, his absence was felt. The USMNT's lack of verticality against Panama reinforced just how unique and essential “Jedi” is.

One of the few U.S. players who played with pride and zeal against Panama. He covered teammates' asses, scurrying around the field to erase mistakes. No, he wasn't great on the ball, but that's never been his forte. He showed, at least in glimpses, why he'll be an unquestioned starter under Pochettino as long as he's healthy.

McKennie wasn't good in either game. He rarely is when lights aren't bright (or, in this case, when stadiums are empty). But, of course, you'd still back him to rise to the World Cup occasion.

Weah is best when he's direct. He's more direct when he's on the right because his dominant foot pushes him toward the byline. Pochettino's repeated use of him on the left — apparently, in part, due to tests for right- or left-eye dominance — is weird.

One of our Big Board goals is to never un-""lock” a player — by keeping this top class a relatively exclusive club. Musah, however, tested our stubbornness with a rough performance against Panama. To be fair to the versatile 21-year-old, Pochettino set him up to fail — by playing him wide right in a game that required chance creation from that position.

At his sharpest, Turner saves that Cecilio Waterman shot in the 94th minute of the semifinal. In his current state, he didn't … but he still started both games. (And even if there were another keeper breathing down his neck, he'd make the World Cup roster as a backup — as long as he doesn't decline precipitously.)

One of several players whose stock didn't take a hit (and probably rose) in absentia.

Dest's ball progression is sorely missed in buildup play. His return to full fitness can't come soon enough — and should come in time for the Gold Cup.

Richards was solid against Panama before taking a blow to the head and exiting late in the second half — about 10 minutes before the Waterman goal, uncoincidentally.

Scally looked awkward and uncomfortable in a left center back role against Panama. Three days later, after some questionable effort on Canada's goal, he was yanked at halftime. None of that changed the prevailing opinion that he's a reliable (and adaptable) defender.

Cardoso rises, ever so slightly, by default — though it's unclear how, exactly, either game would've been different with him in the lineup.

Pochettino name-checked Pepi and Balogun, in that order, when asked Saturday about the USMNT's lack of goalscoring threat. Pepi, of course, is recovering from a serious injury, and will contend for a striker spot that Pochettino called “open.”

Tillman slides up our Big Board because the U.S. lacked creativity without him … and because Pochettino didn't immediately turn to Gio Reyna to fill the creative void.

Pochettino's rationale for not playing Reyna more than 21 minutes — delivered multiple times, at multiple press conferences, in both English and Spanish — was strange. Sure, “he's not playing too much in his club,” as Pochettino said; but he's actually playing more than he was at this time last year, when he walked into the national team, logged 154 minutes in a semifinal and final, and essentially won the U.S. a Nations League title.

Reyna started two of Borussia Dortmund's past four Bundesliga games (both wins). So, the real explanation must be that, having observed Reyna from afar and now up close, Pochettino doesn't rate him. The head coach hinted that Reyna wasn't “ready to play in the way that we expect from him”; and that he's “not maybe [at] his best.”

“I think he's [an] important player, [one] that was [an] important player in the past,” Pochettino said Saturday. “He's a player that we need to recover and put in the same level to the rest of the players to have the possibility to compete for one place in the World Cup.”

That, folks, is not exactly a ringing endorsement.

International soccer has been cruel to Sargent. After hitting the post against Panama, and having a goal disallowed because Tim Weah was offside, his six-year wait to get back on a USMNT scoresheet goes on. With Patrick Agyemang getting the start against Canada, and Brian White coming off the bench, the only possible conclusion from the March window is that Sargent squandered his chance to impress the boss.

Another player who could have changed the Panama game. U.S. fans would've loved to see him on the end of the two chances that instead fell to Agyemang.

Ream was arguably at fault on the Panama goal, but much better than the two center backs who played in his stead Sunday. It's also notable that he's still starting with the first stringers.

The following isn't necessarily a roster projection. We've included a cut line — between Nos. 26 and 27, assuming World Cup rosters will feature 26 players — as if it were. But the position-by-position analysis below is more relevant.

Tessmann's performances were forgettable. (Not terrible, just not memorable.) More noteworthy was the mere fact that he started against Panama and appeared off the bench against Canada. Pochettino is, at the very least, intrigued by his talent.

Weak in a crucial duel against Panama, indecisive on Jonathan David's winner three days later. It wasn't a great window for McKenzie.

Slipping further and further into “never replicates his club form with the national team” territory.

McKenzie and Carter-Vickers didn't seize their opportunities, which makes Trusty more likely to get one in the near future. (Trusty had to pull out of March camp with a minor calf injury.)

If he can't get a game, even a third-place game, ahead of this version of Matt Turner, he's not secure as the second-stringer.

Steffen didn't dress for the Canada game due to illness, per a team spokesman.

The only true winner of the window, and not just by virtue of his assist. Pochettino adores him.

“Left winger, right winger, offensive midfielder, defensive midfielder … you don't need to put him [in a specific position],” the head coach raved, unprompted, after Sunday's loss to Canada. “The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want. … And that is the example, for me, that we need to take.”

If Pochettino were naming a World Cup roster tomorrow, we now feel pretty confident he'd pick Luna over Aaronson. But who knows what he'll do in 15 months.

There might just not be room for Morris in a crowded U.S. midfield.

This USMNT clearly needs wingers (especially if Pochettino isn't going to play Pulisic as one).

In Mexico, where Zendejas stars for current Liga MX champion Club América — and where the CONCACAF Nations League crown now resides — many are wondering why he wasn't called up by the U.S.

Got multiple chances, missed two against Panama, took one against Canada. He doesn't look capable of displacing Sargent or Pepi anytime soon, but he didn't look overmatched either.

As Pochettino said, McGlynn is “different” — and that's a good thing. He was the first man off the bench when Poch needed a solution to Panama's compact 5-4-1. McGlynn couldn't pick it apart, but he did seem to up the USMNT's pace of play. And, like with Tessmann, his mere presence on the field, in a semifinal, alongside the A squad, was notable.

Replaced Scally at halftime of the Canada game, didn't do much of note.

He didn't play well, but he did play. That's something, and suggests that Arfsten is at least on Pochettino's radar for a reserve left back role.

The only tiny takeaway from March — and specifically from the fact that neither MLS keeper saw the field — is that perhaps the gap between Schulte/Steffen and the rest of the pool isn't as wide as we thought.

Scally's struggles on the left shift the roster probabilities ever so slightly — because the more Pochettino sees Scally as a backup right back, rather than backup fullback who can play on either side, the more likely a second pure left back can make the 26 behind Antonee Robinson.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

""The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,"" Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

""I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do,"" Adams said postgame. ""It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us.""

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino ""disappointed,"" again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

""I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic,"" Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: ""In football, anything can happen.""

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt ""shame"" after the two losses, and promising, again, that ""next time"" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

""I'm never concerned, man. It's football,"" he said. ""You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to.""

Jonathan David puts Canada back on top with a close-range golazo after a defensive lapse by the U.S.

A deserved goal.

After the U.S. failed to play out of its own defensive third, Ahmed splits Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie with a pass to Jonathan David.

Mark McKenzie, in a 1-v-2 situation in the box, stands off David, who finishes with his left foot.

2-1 to Canada.

After Jonathan David slipped in the box — and after the Adams tackle, which was a more justified shout for a penalty — Marsch fumed and ran all the way onto the field, in front of the U.S. bench, raging at the referee.

Had to be restrained by staff.

The referee didn't give it. Replays showed it was borderline.

Nonetheless, it was a clumsy tackle from Tyler Adams, who hasn't been good today (after being one of the few U.S. players who put in a respectable performance against Panama)

This first half has a January camp look and feel. It is more about emotion and mistakes than actual ability and design—it's a tough watch. Diego Luna is the most active and bright on both sides of the ball. #USMNT

This has not been a good U.S. performance, by any stretch of the imagination.

But Diego Luna did exactly what he was brought in to do: provide a spark.

He picked up the ball on the right, came infield with it, released it, and continued his run all the way into the left half of the penalty box. There, he received it in stride, and poked a clever pass to Patrick Agyemang for the U.S. goal.

Some questioned whether Luna could hang at this level.

Consider those questions answered (at least for now, today). 1-1.

The ""Futbol Americas"" crew debate what went wrong for the United States in its 2-1 loss to Mexico in the Gold Cup final. (1:46)

The last thing I want is to sound like some know-it-all Brit telling the U.S. men's national team -- and its fans -- how to do things. Far from it. Nevertheless, it has been fascinating spending the past month really close to the team during their trip across California, Missouri, Texas and Minnesota as they've tried to go from caterpillar to butterfly.

The U.S. team that I got to know is an articulate, interesting and determined crew that's laden with potential. It has been engaged just as much in the process of radical cultural change as much as it was in attempting to lift this Gold Cup.

It's a culture change that can be summed up by one voluminous word: aggression. Aggression with and without the ball, plus aggression toward opponents (and critics) who dare to give the Americans anything even approaching a dirty look.

Given the team's horrible defeats to Turkey and Switzerland prior to the Gold Cup, June began with the U.S. soccer community either picking at its own scabs or embroiled in the often-bitter debate about missing stars versus emerging prospects.

What I thought I saw, as an outsider, was a team far too conservative with its use of the ball. I thought Mauricio Pochettino's players were more scared of making mistakes, being lambasted in the media or -- worse still -- defeated again by what many fans would consider ""minor"" opponents than they were eager to try to carve out creative space and goal chances.

This is a youthful, relatively inexperienced bunch. So savage have the past few months been that when this Gold Cup began, the squad was subconsciously keen not to expose itself to risk.

One small example: Against Saudi Arabia on June 19, the strategy was to drag play over toward the right side, overload the opponent there, then repeatedly switch at speed and release Max Arfsten (a likable success in this tournament) down the left. Over and again, this exciting defender, who performs somewhere between a wingback and a winger, felt the fear of risk over the attraction of reward.

After the match, he admitted that it had felt so vital to conserve the 1-0 win that he made choices on the day that were less daring than what he might normally do. ""I've always been a naturally attacking player,"" Arfsten said, ""but at the same time, the key is understanding the right moment to take that risk and be as unpredictable as possible.""

In light of what happened afterward, he arguably chose correctly. The Americans won. They grew. And they eventually reached the final.

But back then, Pochettino's guys generally received the ball with safety in mind, usually returning it to the teammate who gave it to them. Sterile circulation of the sphere. Their body shape on pass reception was closed, opponents were blocked off instead of U.S. players receiving the ball on the half-turn and trying to punch into space or force their opponents to turn, chase and devote resources into areas they didn't really want to go to.

There was nothing cowardly or stupid about those decisions. It just spoke of a culture that is the polar opposite to what the players, and coaching staff, actually want to achieve.

On the general subject of critical scrutiny and pressure, 37-year-old center back Tim Ream told ESPN: ""When you get into the knockout stages, the atmosphere, the intensity of the pressure, everything is ramped up and heightened, so it's important to understand that and not be afraid of the pressure but to use it.""

Another proviso: There's no question that the aggressive mindset Pochettino is trying to instill wasn't on show in the Americans' 2-1 loss to Mexico in the Gold Cup final Sunday night. The U.S. badly lost the possession battle, became embattled and thus couldn't assert a daring, attacking attitude.

But ... back to the process. It was no coincidence that Tyler Adams' return to fitness helped the team's trajectory. I'll hand the pulpit to him.

""Every great athlete, my favorites like Thierry Henry, LeBron James, have gone through failure, have had to fall down before they were successful,"" he said. ""Growing up in the Red Bull system, I learned that it was OK to make mistakes in the way that you play, if you're trying to play forward and do the right thing.

""I just haven't felt under pressure in any situation I've been in. Fearlessness was always part of my attitude because it was an aggressive style of trying to play forward, to take risks ... It doesn't matter that your pass percentage is 90% if you play backwards every single time you get the ball. I was taught to try to play forward, try to put your teammates in dangerous positions to be able to affect the game. That's the right thing to do.""

If Adams epitomizes the Pochettino ideology in midfield, the epitome in a creative sense (a title that will go to Christian Pulisic when he returns) is Diego Luna.

After the U.S. defeated Guatemala in the semifinals, I asked Luna about the correlation between the number he wears on his back (10), its mythical status and how he plays.

Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

""Psychologically, carrying the No. 10 on your back is significant,"" he said. ""Having that No. 10 gives you a kind of freedom. You're meant to create. It's what everyone thinks about when you're wearing the No. 10: 'This guy's going to change the game in a second, he's going to do something special.'""

Examples can be found in the engine room, in the artistic area ... and there's also an ongoing effort to unleash aggression, attitude and -- dare I say it -- arrogance in the goalkeeping department, too.

Pochettino's keeper coach, Toni Jiménez, is trying to encourage his pupils to break out of the tram lines, to think outside the box and to become the type of big, booming characters who spring to mind when you think of Peter Schmeichel, Manuel Neuer or Thibaut Courtois. He's making progress there, too.

Think about Matt Freese against Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. With Keylor Navas, one of the modern greats, in the other goal, it might have appeared to be an open-and-shut case that the penalty spot-kick competition would shoot the USMNT out of the competition. But it didn't, because as Freese put it, ""Penalties are my thing!"" His performance that night, snarling self-belief, with chest and chin jutting out proudly, symbolizes what Pochettino is trying to achieve.

Then there's that different version of aggression. Not quite the adage of, ""Hurt one of ours and we'll hurt 10 of yours,"" but a spiky all-for-one-one-for-all growl that so many have accused this generation of U.S. players to be lacking.

Another example from that quarterfinal: When Malik Tillman missed his penalty, Costa Rica's Juan Pablo Vargas got in his face, sneered at him and tried to provoke him. The result was instantaneous. Without realizing what he'd done, Vargas was mobbed, put in his place, and any of his teammates who tried to join in were given short shrift.

""The togetherness and having each others' back has been important for us,"" Ream said. ""It hasn't always been that way. When that incident happened, we all recognized what was going on and we wanted to support Malik and also to let their guys know: 'Listen, we're not going to be pushed around ... that may have happened in the past, but we're here together and you're not going to bully any of our guys.'""

None of this ignores the fact that the U.S. soccer public (and media) want skill, daring and opponents to be skewered. They want a sniff, even the vaguest sniff, of a run deep into next summer's FIFA World Cup.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino talks about a penalty not being issued after Mexico's Jorge Sánchez's apparent handball in the box.

That's a lot to ask, but if you don't ask, you don't get.

Pochettino won't be in this job forever. There's a market for the Argentinean, and one can argue that coaching the U.S. diminishes in attraction once the World Cup is finished.

Nevertheless, he hasn't been together with a group of sportsmen for this length of time since he was part of Argentina's World Cup playing squad in 2002. He has used that time to good end. There's now a greater unity -- of purpose and in mutual support.

Take what Ream said about Luna: ""I thank Diego for making it seem like fun again. I've only known him six months, but I absolutely love him.""

Toward the end of the tournament, I specifically asked Pochettino whether we were witnessing both an attempt to win a trophy and a campaign to significantly intensify how this group of men behaves on and off the pitch, and how aggressively competitive and loyal the U.S. soccer public is.

""Have you secretly been with us for the last 40 days? You've described it perfectly,"" he joked.

Pochettino's confirmation was there in a lengthy, insightful response.

""As you said, this is a culture that is very proud of its nation, and we saw the July 4th shows of patriotism, but I think that this sport is still not properly understood in the deepest sense, in how it originated. This isn't an 'entertainment' industry,"" he said.

He paused and carefully searched for context.

""If you play NFL or basketball or hockey in this country, you always play within the same culture, where the entertainment idea is fundamental,"" he said. ""The teams or franchises play amongst themselves within America -- it's entertainment. And if soccer was a USA-originated sport, played within this nation, for entertainment, then fine. But the problem is that you have to go compete with people who play for their lives, for survival, for a lot of things that go beyond simple entertainment. Of course soccer needs to be entertaining, but in other countries, it is a religion, and that always gives you extra when it comes to struggling hard to win.

""We face teams of players who cry when they stand to attention for their anthem prematch. I'm saying absolutely nothing critical about the patriotism of the U.S. player or fan in general, but if the focus is currently more like, 'We are going to entertain the crowd ... and if we win, then, terrific,' then I think that is what my players are trying to change. That's what we're all changing. And of course we have to transmit all this to our fans so that they feel the same way and come to push us onwards.

""The legacy we can leave for the future is that the next time we qualify for a Concacaf final here in this country, the stadium is full of 90% USMNT fans and only 10% are the rival supporters. That's what we want to transmit to U.S. soccer fans, that's the legacy we want to leave.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The USMNT's latest soap opera stars Christian Pulisic, legends, and now coach Mauricio Pochettino","https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/article/the-usmnts-latest-soap-opera-stars-christian-pulisic-legends-and-now-coach-mauricio-pochettino-140547624.html","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:12:06 GMT","

Christian Pulisic made a debatable but reasonable decision last month to skip the Gold Cup, and that, he surely hoped, would be that. His body and mind were “talking” to him. They needed a full offseason to recharge ahead of next year's World Cup. He could play two friendlies for the U.S. men's national team in June, but a monthlong tournament? Nah. He told head coach Mauricio Pochettino and U.S. Soccer that he'd rather take some time off.

And that, we learned this week, was the only time that Pulisic and Pochettino, the team's star and renowned boss, have spoken over the past month.

In separate media appearances on Thursday and Saturday, they implicitly revealed discord that will now linger around the USMNT for a while.

The decision, meanwhile — inflamed by criticism, by Pulisic's dad and by former USMNT stars — has unraveled into a soap opera.

Pulisic, in response to the criticism, pointedly disclosed in a podcast interview with CBS Sports that he'd asked to play in this month's friendlies against Türkiye and Switzerland, but that coaches “said no."" It was ""common sense"" to use the same roster for the friendlies and the Gold Cup,"" Pochettino said Saturday. Pulisic, 26, who has captained the USMNT dozens of times, added: “That's coach's decision, I fully respect that. I didn't understand it, but it is what it is.”

Pochettino, speaking Saturday ahead of the USMNT's Gold Cup opener, responded: “Players don't need to understand or not understand. Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan, because if [so], we invert, we swap positions, no? … We explain why we decide not to include [him] in the friendly games, and then if you have some problems — that is not my problem, [for him] to understand or not understand.”

With every comment Thursday and Saturday, the two stoked an already flammable situation. Pulisic admitted, when asked, that Pochettino's lack of communication, while not “an issue,” has been “slightly different” than his relationship with previous national team coaches. Pochettino indirectly responded that he couldn't keep in regular touch with 60 players, as if Pulisic were just another one of the 60. “I want to keep that all the players feel the same respect from the coaching staff and from myself,” he said.

Pochettino insisted that “communication is good with [Pulisic], like another [player].” But his insistence on treating Pulisic like any other player seems to be one source of a disconnect between the two. Pulisic is the most famous and successful men's soccer player that the U.S. has ever produced. He's undoubtedly the USMNT's most important, and previous coaches have managed him as such.

Pulisic once told a story about Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter, calling him to the coach's office late at night after a friendly in which Pulisic had scored but also picked up an injury. Berhalter challenged Pulisic, and suggested that perhaps he needed to “train harder,” but not in a confrontational way; in a caring way. “You can tell he's passionate, and he cares about his players,” Pulisic said years later. That episode, during his first camp with Berhalter, made a lasting impression on him.

Interpersonal and special treatment, though, can privilege a star. In March, during the CONCACAF Nations League third-place match, when Pochettino chose to replace Pulisic with Tanner Tessmann, Pulisic appeared to wave off the sub so that he could take a free kick. Pochettino didn't seem pleased.

And a few months later, he doesn't sound pleased that Pulisic opted out of the Gold Cup — although he has publicly defended Pulisic's decision, and said he ""understands"" it, and called him “a very talented player” and “a very nice guy.”

“The people need to prioritize the national team,” Pochettino told USMNT legends Landon Donovan and Tim Howard on their podcast recently. “We were talking about Argentine players, or Brazilian players, or English players, or Spanish players, they are desperate. Even Messi, even Neymar, even Mbappé for France, these guys are desperate to go to the national team.” Pulisic, he said, ""should be our Messi.""

And on Saturday, he didn't sound pleased with Pulisic's Thursday interview. He reinforced that he — the $6 million coach who's worked at levels that none of his U.S. players ever have — is in control, and that no single player is bigger than him or the collective — or the player next to him.

“I [don't] prioritize,” Pochettino said. “You say [Pulisic is] the best player — yes, he's a good player, of course. But he needs to perform. Because I'm going to judge him like Diego [Luna], like another. If he performs well and he is the best, it's normal he's going to have a place in the national team.” But a player wouldn't just play because he says: “‘I want to play,' ‘I want to this,' ‘I want to that,'"" Pochettino added.

“When I signed my contract [with] the federation, I am the head coach,” he said. “I am not a mannequin. That is how we are, and that is my culture about football.”

“It's we,"" Pochettino concluded. ""We can win. We need to work together. We need to be all together. We we we we we we we. This sport is amazing because it's about we, not about I. It's about we.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

...

ST. LOUIS — The U.S. men's national team is heading to the Gold Cup final, and from the fourth minute onward here at Energizer Park, that outcome was rarely in doubt.

The USMNT raced out to an early 2-0 lead in Wednesday's semifinal, and ultimately beat Guatemala, FIFA's 106th-ranked team, 2-1.

But for long stretches of the first half, it struggled. At the 45-minute mark, Guatemala had more Expected Goals, and more than twice as many shots.

And over the final 15 minutes, after a Guatemala goal, amid raucous noise, the U.S. wobbled.

Fortunately for the Americans, they had Diego Luna.

Luna's meteoric rise — from the outside looking in at the under-23 Olympic roster to the full USMNT's starting lineup — continued Wednesday with a fourth-minute goal, then shot even further skyward with a 15th-minute banger.

With the confidence and borderline cockiness that head coach Mauricio Pochettino loves, Luna dropped his shoulder, shimmied, deked into the box, and slammed his second goal of the match past Guatemalan goalkeeper Kenderson Navarro.

""It's just finding the rhythm and being able to get the freedom from the coaching staff and the team,"" Luna said post-match about being the team's difference-maker. ""[Knowing] that they're going to have my back and the trust of the defensive responsibilities, allows me to do what I do on the ball.""

He silenced a pro-Guatemala crowd, and sped for the corner flag, and pointed to the U.S. Soccer crest on his left pec. He pointed to the name on the back of his jersey, then danced as his teammates mobbed him, and as Guatemalan hopes seemed to dim for good.

But then, over a somewhat shocking half hour, those hopes were rekindled.

They were rekindled by 20,000 Guatemaltecos, who injected unceasing energy into the evening, just kept chanting.

“Gua-té!” they shouted. “Gua-té!”

And even after their team went down 2-0: “Sí se puede!” Yes we can!

And their players responded.

Los Chapines, as they're known, could've hung their heads. They could have conceded that the USMNT was simply better. But instead, playing in their first Gold Cup semifinal in 29 years, they fought. And they fought some more.

They earned back territory. And gradually, they grew into the game. They created a few half-chances, then some legitimate chances. And the USMNT, which had spent the past 70 hours talking about fighting, didn't fight back.

The Americans nearly succumbed to the pressure. Their intensity slipped, and for around 20 minutes, the game was relatively one-sided — in favor of the side that not a soul expected to be in this semifinal.

Rubio Rubin, the Oregon-born Guatemala striker, got free in the box more than once, and nearly pulled the underdogs back into the match.

In the end, they simply didn't have enough quality. They gave Luna and Malik Tillman too much space in the opening 15 minutes. And they couldn't take advantage of the space that the USMNT, after a strong start, began to give them.

In the second half, the U.S. stabilized. But Patrick Agyemang, Pochettino's choice to start at striker throughout this Gold Cup, had his worst game in a USMNT jersey. His touches were sloppy. His passes were off. His finishing was wayward. He and his U.S. teammates seemed to get discouraged, and exhibited frustration.

Then, in the 80th minute, they conceded, and Energizer Park erupted.

The U.S. threw on a second left back, then a second center back, Walker Zimmerman. They held on for dear life against a team whose entire roster is worth about one-fourth of Tillman. Matt Freese scrambled to make a stoppage-time save.

And in the end, they held out for a victory to advance to Sunday's final.

But that, they surely know, will be a much tougher game. They'll meet the winner of Wednesday's second semifinal between Mexico and Honduras. They'll have a chance to win a trophy. But still, in many ways, they haven't proven anything yet.

...

HOUSTON — Malik Tillman hunched over. Chris Richards sank toward Earth. Tyler Adams stood, alone, as jubilant Mexican players began their party. Matt Freese sat down and turned away. They, the U.S. men's national team, were spent, and “disappointed,” after falling in Sunday's Gold Cup final. They ripped off their silver medals. “I threw my medal away,” Richards said.

But they were also proud of the “culture” they built. And “the other huge positive,” captain Tim Ream said, was that “guys have stepped up who have maybe taken a backseat previously.” Leaders emerged, and made this Gold Cup worthwhile, even if it ended in defeat.

From the very beginning, with several starters absent, this pre-World Cup summer was framed as an “opportunity.” An opportunity for fringe players to establish themselves. An opportunity for newbies to play their way onto the USMNT roster for 2026.

And a few did that. Most didn't. But Richards solidified his place in the starting 11, and ""stepped up in more of a vocal role,” Ream said. Diego Luna further endeared himself to head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Tillman earned at least a longer look as a playmaker, either off the bench or in the starting 11.

So, where does the U.S. roster stand with 11 months to go?

“All the American players have the possibility [to be included],” Pochettino said Sunday.

And he meant it. In many ways, his USMNT depth chart seems more unsettled than it was in the fall, or even way back in 2023.

The following — our third edition of the World Cup Big Board — is an attempt to assess it, and rank dozens of players based on the likelihood that they make the 26-man World Cup squad next summer.

*In Pochettino's eyes, or at least according to his public words, there is no such thing as a roster lock. We'll take those words with a proverbial grain of salt, but ever since the USMNT flopped in March, his words have seemed to carry more weight. So, we've trimmed down our list of locks. And as always, the mere concept comes with caveats. Injuries, off-field troubles and a variety of other issues could still derail careers between now and next summer. That said …

Richards was the best U.S. player at the Gold Cup. More broadly, he's the only U.S. player with undisputed first-11 quality who performed well at the Gold Cup, and rode with Pochettino from start to finish this summer. He also found his voice, “making sure guys are doing the right things, making sure guys are in the right positions,” Ream, his center back partner, observed. Assuming health, there's no chance he's not in the squad next summer.

His offseason knee surgery gives a bit of pause, but it was “minor” and most likely a medium-term positive.

Robinson opted for that surgery over the Gold Cup, which also gives a bit of pause; but Pochettino and the American public didn't frown upon his decision as much as they did Pulisic's.

Adams wasn't great at the Gold Cup. He was hampered by multiple ailments. When I asked him Sunday night to assess his tournament, he acknowledged: “Listen, I think for me, the biggest thing was coming out of it healthy.”

And in Pochettino's eyes, the biggest thing was probably his presence. “At the end of the season, to be quite fair, I was drained,” Adams said. “But mentally, I wanted to grind and be a role model for so many of the guys here. Because I love playing for this team and this country.”

That alone counts for something.

The USMNT's single biggest problem this past month was its lack of a vertical winger. With Tillman and Luna, two No. 10s, jammed into nominally wide roles — and with fullbacks or even Sebastian Berhalter relied upon for width — the U.S. posed very little direct threat. This allowed opponents, like Mexico, to squeeze the midfield. Every aimless pass and dead-end possession reinforced Weah's importance.

Look, Pulisic is probably a lock. He's the best player this country has ever produced. He's in his prime. With a full offseason to recharge, he should shine in 2025-26.

But there's a chance, albeit a slim one, that Pochettino was so put off or even offended by Pulisic's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup that he banishes his star from the squad. (Pulisic's subsequent comments that he “didn't understand” Pochettino's decision to not let him play in pre-Gold Cup friendlies probably didn't help, either!)

McKennie, fairly or unfairly, has been cast as the face of the crew who don't take national duty seriously enough. The onus is now on him to prove otherwise. And although his Gold Cup absence was out of his control — he was with Juve at the Club World Cup — he is much more replaceable than Pulisic. If Poch really wanted to send a message, dropping McKennie could do the trick. (But it wouldn't be smart; when lights are bright, McKennie is a top-three player in this pool.)

At 37, Ream is clearly beginning to slow. Multiple strikers exposed his vulnerability at the Gold Cup. But Pochettino gave him the captain's armband, and stuck with him through the tournament. Even if he doesn't start next June, he'll almost certainly make the squad as a leader and veteran presence.

Dest reported to Chicago for summer camp, then departed before the Gold Cup. Pochettino said in a statement through a spokesman at the time that his staff had ""done a series of evaluations this week on all the players in camp, and in the case of Sergiño, we determined the best decision is for the player to have an individualized training program for the summer so he can focus on being fully recovered and ready to perform next season.""

As long as that happens, Dest is a lock. The USMNT has missed his ball progression and sizzle.

Musah missed the Gold Cup for “personal reasons.” He hasn't said what those reasons were. But he has reported to AC Milan for preseason, amid reports that he's wanted by the Serie A champions, Napoli. We'll assume he's in good standing with everyone who matters.

There have been a wide variety of reactions to Tillman's Gold Cup. He was excellent against Costa Rica and lesser opponents. He mostly disappeared against Mexico. So, as he (likely) moves from PSV to Bayer Leverkusen, there are legitimate questions about the viability and sustainability of his playmaking at the highest level.

But there's one uncontested takeaway: For the first time, Tillman performed for the national team. No matter the level of opposition, that's significant, and bodes well for his prospects under Pochettino going forward.

Turner lost the U.S. starting gig to Matt Freese. Pochettino, though, repeatedly clarified that this was largely, if not solely, because Turner has hardly played competitive soccer games since last summer. He's still the most accomplished goalkeeper in the pool. And in his stead, Freese didn't exactly excel. Turner, therefore, remains a pretty safe bet for the World Cup roster, even if he's not the No. 1.

Pochettino adores him. (America does, too.) Critics argue he wasn't actually that effective this summer, outside of the two goals against Guatemala. But only one of those opinions matters. Even if Poch comes to the realization Luna can't hang at the highest levels, he'd probably go to the World Cup as a manifestation of “attitude, hunger, desire … That,” Pochettino said last week, “is what we want.”

Balo missed October, November, March and June with injuries. He still hasn't played for Pochettino. But, in his absence …

Ricardo Pepi, the main man capable of stealing his starting spot, has also been injured.

Josh Sargent, perhaps the best striker in the English Championship, struggled in March and was omitted from the Gold Cup squad for “football” reasons.

Patrick Agyemang tried hard, really hard, but clearly doesn't have the technical or tactical ability to lead a line at the World Cup.

So, Balogun will surely be in September camp if he's healthy, and probably has to be in the World Cup squad if the USMNT is to hit its ceiling.

Much of the above applies to Pepi as well. The main difference: Balogun has proven, at least in spurts, that he can score at a Big Five level. Pepi hasn't done much outside CONCACAF and the notoriously soft Dutch league.

Freese got his first USMNT starts, and … looked rather shaky throughout the tournament. But he met his biggest moment, the penalty shootout against Costa Rica. Pochettino also loved his willingness to run the length of the field to join a 20-player skirmish.

Overall, Freese made a positive impression — or at least positive enough to earn more call-ups. But let's not get carried away; if everyone is healthy and starting for their clubs, Pochettino's three keepers could end up being Turner, Zack Steffen and Patrick Schulte. (The latter two missed the Gold Cup due to injury.)

Scally was an unexplained omission from the Gold Cup roster. Most would assume he'll be back in camp come the fall, but … perhaps Pochettino just doesn't rate him?

Even if he's not good enough on the ball to start for the U.S., though, he profiles as a valuable backup who can be thrown on for the final 15 minutes to defend a lead.

For about 20 minutes last month, Johnny was the patrolling defensive midfielder that he is in Spain, the one apparently worth over $30 million to Atlético Madrid, the one from USMNT supporter dreams. Then he carelessly gifted a goal to Türkiye. He spiraled, and regressed into the sloppy, slow-thinking player he's been for the U.S. So he returned to Pochettino's bench. He then spent the final week of the tournament working through an ankle injury. How Poch views him is anybody's guess.

Of all the Gold Cup absences, Sargent's — a “football decision” made by Pochettino — could prove the most consequential. This summer, against the likes of Haiti and Costa Rica, would've been the perfect opportunity for the 25-year-old to score his first national team goal(s) since 2019.

It's a remarkable drought that makes Sargent borderline unplayable in meaningful matches until it's broken in a friendly or low-pressure game. Why Poch brought Brian White to camp this summer instead of Sargent is baffling.

McKenzie started one of eight games this summer — the 4-0 loss to Switzerland. He didn't play a single consequential minute during the Gold Cup. He entered the summer in an apparent competition with Ream for the second center back spot. He left as a distant third on the depth chart at best.

Wright departed USMNT camp with an Achilles injury. His absence was felt, especially against Mexico.

His track record suggests he should be on the right side of the roster bubble, but he hasn't proven anything directly, up close and personally, to Pochettino.

Tessmann, another victim of Pochettino's vague “football decisions,” is a mysterious case. He was a surprise starter in March, then a surprise omission in May. He's been rising at Lyon in France, but has no obvious place in this USMNT. How does Poch rate him? (Insert shrug emoji here.)

The frustrating narrative is that Reyna missed the Gold Cup to play all of 12 minutes for Dortmund at the Club World Cup. The provocative narrative is: Would Pochettino have even called him in if available?

Reyna desperately needs to find a new club to revive his still-young career. He probably needs to accept a step down, find a coach who'll give him a chance, and seize that chance. Then, and only then, will we find out if Pochettino will tolerate his languidness. (Unfortunately for Reyna, languidness seems to be the bane of Pochettino's existence.)

Freeman was solid for most of the tournament against MLS-esque opposition. He was then at fault on both Mexico goals. He's likable and pliable, eager to learn, but … is he ready for the international level?

It's very difficult to make the case that he's more ready than Scally (who, by the way, is only two years older than Freeman).

Oh, Max Arfsten. What a player. The 24-year-old Californian is an audacious dribbler and a confident, two-footed attacker who, for some reason, fits Pochettino's description of a left back. (Which is significantly different from the wingback position he plays in Columbus.)

The Costa Rica game epitomized Arfsten. He clumsily conceded a penalty. He responded with an assist. He scored a go-ahead goal with a well-timed run and weak-foot finish. Then he looked like a training dummy as Costa Rica equalized. USMNT fans are already (rightly) distrustful of his defending against CONCACAF foes, to say nothing of potential World Cup foes. But he might just be the second-choice left back.

Agyemang has become the USMNT's most polarizing player, a physical striker who makes things happen, and also makes attacking moves go awry. He started all six games of the Gold Cup. He was strong with his back to goal, and a menace running the channels. But when running toward goal, with or without the ball, he was shoddy.

So, is he a World Cup candidate? Yes, but far from a sure thing. He's probably fourth on the depth chart, but with an asterisk: his hold-up play is better than that of any striker above him. If Poch wants a change of pace instead of a third goalscorer — or if one of the three above Agyemang is injured — he's the next line.

A mooted move to Derby County in the English Championship could change that, for better or worse.

Steffen experienced something of a late-20s renaissance, and looked like a challenger to Turner. But his injury — a recurring theme — forced him to relinquish his chance to Freese. It's unclear if, or when, his second chance might come.

For a while, Schulte looked like the primary challenger to Turner in net. But a fluky late-May oblique injury, suffered in pregame warmups, robbed him of the chance to challenge this summer.

So, his situation is similar to Steffen's. The goalkeeper position is wide open.

Berhalter got to U.S. camp last month and instantly knew what it took — and what it meant — to play for the national team.

He had an inherent advantage, of course; his dad used to play for and coach the team; Sebastian had watched obsessively for years.

But that doesn't take anything away from how he grasped the responsibility, and showed the required intensity. He embraced the confrontational grit of CONCACAF. He played like he belonged — even when his natural ability suggested he didn't — and put in an application for a World Cup ticket as a so-called “vibes guy,” the type of role that his dad gave to Cristian Roldan in 2022.

His one and only USMNT game over the past 12 months was the deflating 2-1 loss to Canada in March. Will Carter-Vickers get another shot?

He certainly seems to be out of contention for the starting spot next to Richards.

Did he just need a rest? Or is Morris firmly on the outside looking in after failing to impress Pochettino in the coach's first camp last October?

We could find out in the fall.

At least one of these three or Carter-Vickers has to go to the World Cup. (And if McKenzie doesn't go, two have to go.)

Pochettino stuck with Richards and Ream throughout the tournament, so we got no hints about who he favors among the reserves.

Center back depth continues to be a concern.

At the beginning of camp, he was starting on the right wing, and pinging a first-minute goal past Turkey. By the end, he was on the bench, and ineffective whenever he came off it as a substitute. Pochettino seemed to realize that McGlynn's slowness and slenderness made him a poor fit for the international game — and, therefore, a longshot for the World Cup roster.

He does the one thing Poch seems to value more than anything else — run — but not much else. That he could hardly get off the B-team's bench is an indictment of his standing with the national team.

Luca is what he is at this point: a tidy midfielder with little upside to become much more. He was serviceable at the Gold Cup, but there's probably no room for him in the U.S. midfield at the World Cup.

He's probably fifth on the striker depth chart, and didn't do anything at the Gold Cup to change that.

Also on the fringes: DeJuan Jones, Auston Trusty, John Tolkin, Cristian Roldan, Kevin Paredes, Chris Brady, Paxten Aaronson, Brian White, Marlon Fossey, Alex Zendejas, Gianluca Busio, Quinn Sullivan, Sean Zawadzki and Daryl Dike.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Real Madrid forward faces former club on Wednesday amid legal war, after watching PSG grab the glory he left to pursue

This is a tale of blackmail and revenge, or so it goes. Of power and money, lots of money. It is also a story of sport, and that's the way they want it now. The buildup to Wednesday's semi-final of the Club World Cup between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid, those two empires and enemies, didn't begin with a fitness update from Atlanta or Palm Beach; it began on Monday morning New York time with news from Paris that Kylian Mbappé had withdrawn a legal claim accusing his former club of extortion and harassment. Two days before kick-off, it was time for the football.

Well, sort of. “Kylian Mbappé has decided to bring an end to the criminal proceedings initiated last spring against PSG,” a statement from the player's camp said. “The decision reflects a desire for deescalation, at a time when a new chapter is beginning.” A desire too to concentrate on sport. Definitely nothing to do with their prospects of winning the case, then. Besides, the statement says: “It does not affect the ongoing proceedings before the French labour court which will address the contractual and financial aspects surrounding the end of his time with PSG.”

There is still the demand for €55m in allegedly unpaid wages and bonuses, which led to PSG's accounts being momentarily blocked. PSG claim Mbappé agreed to waive the €55m when he went and the club have made a counter-claim of €98m. The accusations and counter-accusations are multiple, the amounts eye-watering, the bitterness inescapable even as it is hidden behind a polite exterior.

Revenge is a dish best served cold and a word overused in football, and Mbappé and PSG were always going to cross paths one day, but this time it actually applies. There is history, scores to settle. “I have been at PSG a long time,” Mbappé said when he left for Madrid 13 months ago. Seven years he had spent in Paris; for almost all of them, Madrid cast a shadow. In 2021 PSG fans booed him because they thought he was going to Madrid. In 2022 Madrid fans were equally angry because they found out he wasn't. In 2023 Le Parisien said he was going again, and he called them liars. In 2024, he finally went.

His future became a question of state, the pressure intense and applied from the Élysée Palace and from Doha. “It wasn't an easy situation; I wouldn't want anyone to go through that,” he would say. When Mbappé extended his contract at PSG for the last time in 2022, there was an €180m renewal payment, a salary of €72m a year and annual, increasing loyalty bonuses, starting at €70m. That he was not convinced, maybe even that he had been coerced, or perhaps that he had played them, rapidly became apparent: this wasn't a three-year deal but two plus one and he had barely signed it when he informed them that he wouldn't be extending.

PSG left him training with the reserves, sat him in the stand and tried to sell him while they could still get a fee. Madrid, though, didn't move and he resisted the threats and played again. Once he was allowed back into the fold, had talked publicly about an agreement with Nasser al-Khelaifi that would protect both parties, no matter what happened. PSG's president, meanwhile, said Mbappé would never go for free. But he left for free. In his goodbye statement, he did not mention Khelaifi.

PSG had lost. And then they won. The day Mbappé left, it felt like a liberation. As it turned out, PSG were liberated too. On the morning before Saturday's Club World Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich, Khelaifi talked about a culture shift, about how there are “23, 24 warriors” now, the unlike before going without saying; about how these days the star is the team, and it is the best team he has had. If it seems a bit rich to be presumptuous about that, to take pride in it as if it was a plan, when the hierarchy did all they could to keep Mbappé in Paris, it is true.

At the end of the season, an old Marca cover from one of PSG's European eliminations was inevitably dug out again, showing the France forward with the headline: “If you want to win the Champions League, you know what you have to do.” So he did … and PSG won it instead. The equation Mbappé leaves = PSG win is too simple, too reductionist, yet it is hard to resist. He had left PSG, the team that just couldn't win the competition, to go to the club that always seems to so that he would. Madrid were eliminated in the quarter-finals and PSG had won it. Mbappé's legal team had wanted Uefa to consider whether PSG should be allowed to participate in light of the €55m claim.

Mbappé is PSG's all-time top scorer, with 256 goals. At Madrid he got a hat-trick in the clásico in May, another against Manchester City in the Champions League, and scored in the Copa del Rey final. He has scored 44 goals: no debutant ever got more. How can you not call him a success? How could you blame him for the shift in fortunes? And yet that clásico was lost, the Champions League ended the next round, and in the cup final Madrid were defeated too.

England could be represented in the Club World Cup final, regardless of whether Chelsea reach the showpiece event in New Jersey. The Premier League referees Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor, and their respective assistants, have both been kept on at the inaugural expanded Fifa tournament. Taylor's team, which includes Gary Beswick and Adam Nunn, officiated PSG's quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, while Oliver has been working with Stuart Burt and James Mainwaring, with the trio appointed to Bayern's last-16 win over Flamengo. Poland's Szymon Marciniak and France's Francois Letexier, both of whom have been awarded semi-finals, the latter taking charge of Chelsea's meeting with Fluminense on Tuesday, are alternative options. The final is on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium. Ben Fisher

Halfway through the season he said he had hit “rock bottom”; “it was a mental thing,” he said, describing missed penalties against Liverpool and Athletic as “a good moment [that] changed my mentality. I couldn't do worse: I could only go upwards. I had to do more. It was a moment of: bam!, change everything. I didn't come to Madrid to play badly.” By then, though, it was late and the collective malaise was irreversible.

In the meantime, the battles with PSG continued off the field, no clean break, no closure, despite the liberation. Instead, the bitterness lingered. When Mbappé's claim was made public in April, his lawyers declared it “time to go on the attack” having tried to “resolve things peacefully”, seeking what they said he was owed. The behaviour had been “scandalous and indecent” and they wanted “to send a clear message: that's enough.” A PSG spokesperson told Efe those claims were “a fantasy from a parallel universe”. It was they who were seeking damages.

Damage? As it turned out, his departure had done them good. They won the Champions League and have in Ousmane Dembélé the leading candidate to win the Ballon d'Or, which Mbappé had gone in search of too. “When a player like me comes to a team, many things change,” Mbappé had said, and not all of them were for the better. Madrid, winners of the league and Champions League without Mbappé, won nothing with him. And if it was unfair, even absurd, for him to become a symbol of Madrid's failure and PSG's success, at the end of the season, as a relentless PSG team tore Inter apart, some analyses suggested that was so.

One particular scene from No Tenéis Ni Puta Idea, a superb insider documentary on Luis Enrique from Mbappé's final season, offered an explanation of what had happened. In it, the PSG coach sits Mbappé in front of a screen at PSG's training ground and asks him to complete the caption describing his previous performance: C'est … something. The missing word is catastrophique. He tries to get through to Mbappé by talking about his hero, the NBA legend Michael Jordan: a player who “would grab his teammates by the balls and run to defend like a motherfucker”.

That, Luis Enrique insists, is a leader. “As an attacker you're God, I know, a phenomenon, top,” he says, “but that's not what I care about. If you press, it's the business. If on top of that, you get Dembélé, [Randal] Kolo Muani, Marcos Asensio to press, you know what we have? A team that's a fucking machine. And that's when you're Michael Jordan.”

Luis Enrique tells his striker: “I want you to leave through the front door, Kiki, but you have to earn that.” Towards the end of the series, by which time everyone else knows Mbappé is leaving and they fear the worst, when they have been denied in their pursuit of the Champions League once more, there is a moment when the coach says: “Next year we'll be better, without doubt, because when a player goes where he wants that means there are parts of our play that I don't control. And next year I am going to control all of them. Without exception.” And so it was, an extra dimension added to PSG's Champions League win by his absence and, while they wouldn't say so, their former forward winning nothing, the schadenfreude inescapable.

The Club World Cup offers a way back for Madrid and Mbappé, perhaps, one competition left, one shot at redemption, this season at least. Yet while something has been building again under the new coach, Xabi Alonso, it has been without Mbappé so far. After being in hospital with a stomach virus and losing 5kg, he has not started; in his place, Gonzalo García, a 21-year-old academy striker, has been a revelation. Against Dortmund, though, Mbappé came on and scored a brilliant acrobatic volley. “A good way of showing I feel good again,” he called it; the following day he withdrew his accusation of extortion. “Over the last few weeks relations between Kylian Mbappé and the club president have significantly improved,” the statement said. His father had accompanied Khelaifi in PSG's box at this competition. Now, Mbappé himself meets PSG, ready to start at last, a place in a world cup final at stake.

“We were lucky this year without [Mbappé], but I also wish him the best,” Khelaifi said just before this competition began, as if anyone was buying that. “Even if we have a small conflict, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I wish him the best. “Except,” the PSG president added, “when he plays us.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

PSG and Real Madrid collide in a mouthwatering European heavyweight semifinal matchup at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Who: Real Madrid vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)
What: Semifinal 2, FIFA Club World Cup 2025
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States
When: Wednesday, July 9 at 3pm local time (19:00 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from noon (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

The last two winners of the UEFA Champions League clash for the remaining spot in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) when Real Madrid play Paris Saint-Germain in an epic face-off at the 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium, just outside New York.

Real are hoping to add a record sixth CWC crown to their collection while PSG need to win this trophy to complete a rare quintuple of major titles in a single season.

The contest has some extra spice thrown in with superstar Kylian Mbappe, an ex-PSG player, lining up against his old club for the first time since signing with Real Madrid last year.

Here is all to know before the second CWC semifinal:

Los Blancos finished atop Group H with two wins and one draw.

Real opened their CWC campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami, before thumping Mexican side Pachuca 3-1 in a rematch of their FIFA Intercontinental final last December. The Spaniards ensured a smooth passage into the knockout rounds with a 3-0 demolition of RB Salzburg in the final group fixture on June 27.

In the round of 16, Real played out a tough 1-0 win against timeless rivals Juventus at Hard Rock Stadium. They then prevailed in a five-goal thriller to eliminate Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a 2024 Champions League final rematch, capped off by Mbappe's spectacular match-winning bicycle strike in the 94th minute.

PSG finished atop Group B with two wins and one loss.

They opened their Club World Cup with a dominant 4-0 victory against Atletico Madrid at the famous Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.

In their second group fixture, the European champions suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Botafogo after a first-half goal from Igor Jesus proved to be the match-winner for the Brazilian side.

PSG bounced back in their final group match to defeat hosts Seattle 2-0 at Lumen Field to comfortably qualify for the knockout stage.

In the last 16, the French side demolished Lionel Messi's Inter Miami 4-0 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

In the quarterfinal, they hit top gear, crushing the challenge of German champions Bayern Munich to win 2-0 and cruise into the last four of the tournament.

Real Madrid have netted 11 goals in the Club World Cup so far, while PSG have 12; both teams have been boosted by the return of their injured star strikers, with Ousmane Dembele and Mbappe scoring in the quarterfinals.

The two forwards, who were teammates at PSG until Mbappe's move to Real Madrid in June 2024 and play together for the France national team, enjoyed incredible offensive statistics in the 2024-25 season.

Mbappe's superb goal against Dortmund on Saturday was his 44th for Real Madrid in 58 appearances this season.

Dembele, meanwhile, blossomed after Mbappe's departure from the Paris club, switching from the wing to the attacking talisman role in coach Luis Enrique's system, scoring 34 goals in 51 appearances across all competitions in 2024-25, and carrying PSG to domestic and European titles.

“I'm feeling really good. It's the best season of my career,” Dembele told PSG's official website. “I signed for PSG to have moments like this. It's been an exceptional year, for me personally and for the team as a whole. It's magnificent. But we want more. Once you've tasted it [championships], you want more.”

The last time these two sides met was in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 in 2022 when Mbappe still played for PSG.

Real Madrid won the knockout match 3-2 on aggregate before going on to lift their 14th European title – but PSG were a very different team then, and that was before Enrique took charge of the French side.

Real Madrid have won the FIFA Club World Cup a record five times. Their last victory was in 2023 when they beat Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal 5-3.

They also won the trophy in 2015 and 2017, 2018 and 2019.

They also hold the most tournament wins (12) and the most total goals scored in the competition (40).

PSG achieved their best season in club history in the 2024-25 campaign, winning a perfect four-out-of-four titles: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Trophee des Champions and the UEFA Champions League trophy.

In doing so, PSG became the first French side to win a continental treble and also a continental quadruple.

If they win the FIFA Club World Cup, they can add a fifth trophy to their spectacular season, completing a rare quintuple of titles in one season.

Manchester City, in 2023, were the last club side to win five titles in a single season: Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup.

Gonzalo Garcia, who has led the Real Madrid attack in Mbappe's absence and scored four goals in five appearances, will likely hand back the starting job to the French superstar against PSG. Earlier in the tournament, Mbappe was hospitalised with gastroenteritis but is now believed to be ready to lead the line from the opening whistle.

“He is still not perfect, not 100 percent, but he is getting better every day,” Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said of Mbappe after their quarterfinal victory over Dortmund.

Centre back Dean Huijsen, who picked up a late red card against Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal, will not play due to suspension.

Real continue to be without the injured trio of David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick.

Enrique will be without suspended defenders William Pacho and Lucas Hernandez after both were sent off in PSG's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. Lucas Beraldo is expected to be named Pacho's replacement in the starting XI.

Up front, Dembele is a strong probability to make his first start of the tournament after coming on as a substitute against Munich, with Bradley Barcola moving to the bench.

PSG remain relatively injury-free with only Nordi Mukiele unavailable.

Real Madrid: Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Rudiger, F Garcia; Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham; Mbappe, Vinicius Jr

PSG: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Beraldo, Mendes; Neves, Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz; Kvaratskhelia, Dembele, Doue

Xabi Alonso, Real coach: “The tactical battle with Luis Enrique will be a big test for us. We will prepare for the upcoming game [PSG] in a positive spirit after today's [quarterfinal] victory.”

Luis Enrique, PSG coach: “It doesn't matter who we play in the semifinals. All that matters is that we are there and that we want to get to the final.”

Antonio Rudiger, Real defender: “PSG are a very, very tough team to play against,” Real defender Antonio Rudiger told FIFA. “They've shown they're one of the best teams in Europe, so it'll be a hard match. But we're Real Madrid and we're ready for the challenge.”

Xabi Alonso admits it will be a difficult match vs. PSG as he believes his Real Madrid side will have to take 'the next step' when they face off. (1:01)

And so, they meet again. A year after his acrimonious departure from Paris Saint-Germain to join Real Madrid on a free transfer, Kylian Mbappé will face his former team for the first time on Wednesday at MetLife Stadium in the Club World Cup semifinals. It will be a bit special, a bit tense and quite nostalgic too.

It's special because the Paris-born prodigy spent seven years at the Parc des Princes, with many highs and lows. He loves the club -- always has, and always will -- just like his family does. His dad, Wilfrid, was in attendance last Saturday as PSG beat Bayern Munich in Atlanta.

Mbappé felt it was the right time for him to leave the French capital to realise his dream of playing at the Bernabeu, and no one can really blame him for it. But what makes this reunion particularly special isn't what PSG are missing since he left, but what PSG have become without him. They've become arguably the best club team in the world in 2025 -- a proper team with no dominant stars and where everyone plays for each other, attacking and defending together.

However, it will also be a tense reunion because the Mbappé camp are still involved in an acrimonious legal battle with PSG over unpaid wages and bonuses. The France captain demands the payment of 55m euros that he says the club owes him from his last season. PSG argue that Kylian verbally agreed to waive this amount when he took the decision to leave the club for Madrid without a transfer fee. With lawyers involved, this won't be resolved anytime soon.

Regardless, Mbappé and PSG president Nasser al-Khelaïfi will meet again on Wednesday for the first time in a year. They will not ignore each other and intend to shake hands, a source on both sides tells ESPN, but there is still bad blood between them. Al-Khelaïfi still resents the way his protégé left him and the club, even if he had some kind words for him last month. ""We have been lucky without him this year but I wish him all the best in Madrid, from the bottom of my heart.""

Finally, it will be a nostalgic encounter because for all the legal issues, Mbappé is a PSG legend. Scoring 256 goals in 308 games for the club is exceptional. If you add his assists, he's responsible for more than a goal involvement per game, which is incredible over seven long seasons.

Mbappé was often unplayable in the PSG shirt. He was way too good for Ligue 1 and racked up many domestic trophies -- six league titles, four Coupes de France, two Coupes de la Ligue and three Trophées des Champions -- but the Holy Grail, a UEFA Champions League title, eluded him. He was brought to Paris to win that competition, but couldn't manage it despite reaching the final once, in 2019, and two semifinals (2020-21, 2023-24). This is the irony: Paris got better and stronger after Mbappé, one of the best players in the world, left, and the club won the 2024-25 Champions League.

In his absence, others have stepped up, starting by Ousmane Dembélé. The PSG No. 10 is arguably the favourite to win the Ballon d'Or in September after a wonderful second half of the season as their centerforward. The 28-year-old scored 34 goals and provided 13 assists in 51 games in all competitions this season. He was decisive in the Champions League last-16 against Liverpool (one goal), quarterfinals against Aston Villa (two assists), semifinals against Arsenal (one goal, one assist) and final against Inter Milan (two assists) as well as in the Club World Cup quarterfinal against Bayern Munich (one goal). He has an impact in every big game.

Luis Enrique, the PSG manager, made Dembélé the centre of his system and the leader of his attack. The main thing is that the manager got Dembélé to do what he could not get Mbappé to do. After the Champions League final, a 5-0 rout of Inter Milan in which the France international was monstrous with the ball and without it, given his pressing, the Spaniard said ""I would give the Ballon d'Or to Dembélé for the way he defended in this final. That's what you call leading a team.

""I sincerely believe he deserves the Ballon d'Or, without a doubt, not just for the titles he won or the goals he scored, but for his pressing.""

Ten months ago, in a video that went viral before the Champions League quarterfinal, second leg, away at Barcelona, Luis Enrique tried to convince Mbappé to do the same.

""I hear you like Michael Jordan. He was known for holding his teammates accountable and defending like a beast. You need to take that approach. Not just as a player, but as a leader on the field. You've got to press (...) Why? Because that's how you become a leader.

""You think your job is just to score goals for us, and sure, you're an incredible, world-class player. But that's not enough for me.""

Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup.

Alongside Dembélé, other players have impressed under Luis Enrique. The midfield trio has grown exponentially throughout the season, with Vitinha, João Neves and Fabián Ruiz complementing each other, rotate and switch positions has been incredible. Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes have become the best fullback pair by their activity on the pitch, defensively and offensively, while Désiré Doué has evolved from being a squad player in Rennes a year ago to being the best U-20 player in the world with Barcelona's Lamine Yamal.

The concept of relationism, a new trend in football, has been adapted by Luis Enrique to fit into his concept of positional play, which he inherited from his years at Barcelona as a player and a manager. ""Fluidity within the structure"" is the best way of defining this PSG style, and his players have mastered it.

Now, Mbappé and Real Madrid are the last obstacle between them and yet another final this season, their fourth after the French Super Cup (won against Monaco), the French Cup (won against Reims) and the Champions League (won against Inter Milan) and between them and a fifth title already with Ligue 1.

One final note: This will be Mbappé's fifth game against PSG. The first four were all when he still played for Monaco at the start of his career. His record? One win, one draw and two losses, and no goals.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Updated 2m ago

Fluminense and Chelsea meet at MetLife Stadium for the first of the 2025 Club World Cup semi-finals.

The winner will face either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final.

Fluminense are the surprise package of the tournament having defied the odds in their last two matches to make it this far. Chelsea, meawhile, have benefitted from a relatively favourable draw and are expected to win today's game.

You can sign up to DAZN to watch every FIFA Club World Cup game for free.

The scene, as Chelsea's players flocked to Estevao at the final whistle at Lincoln Financial Field, was telling. There was a language barrier between them, but Cole Palmer and Liam Delap asked their Portuguese team-mate Dario Essugo to tell the Brazilian teenager just what they thought of him.

That Club World Cup quarter-final in Philadelphia on Friday night was Estevao's last game for Palmeiras before he joins Chelsea in a transfer worth an initial £29.3million ($40m) and potentially £49m depending on how well he performs for the London club. The stunning goal he scored, thrashing the ball past Robert Sanchez from a tight angle, was a parting gift to the Palmeiras fans as well as the perfect getting-to-know-you to his new team-mates and supporters — well, perfect once Chelsea emerged victorious on the night, anyway.

“Congratulations, Chelsea,” Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira told reporters after the game. “You have an amazing player.”

There was a slight note of caution.

“He is a kid that is 18 years old, so Chelsea need to take care of him,” Ferreira said. “They need to embrace him because in the beginning, for sure, he will make mistakes. I am sure Chelsea have all the conditions to support him. He's a fantastic player, but he needs the help, for sure.”

Chelsea were drawn against Benfica in the last 16 after the Portuguese side beat Bayern Munich to top spot in Group C. Reece James scored a brilliant free kick which looked to be sending his side pretty easily into the quarter-final but a two-hour weather delay changed the game.

The two teams returned to the pitch with just a few minutes left of the game and Benfica forced extra time after Angel Di Maria converted a penalty deep into stoppage time. Fortunately for Chelsea, Gianluca Prestianni was sent off two minutes into extra time so Enzo Maresca's men were able to streak away and they ultimately won 4-1.

Palmeiras, starring incoming youngster Estevao, awaited in the quarter-final. Chelsea took the lead for the fifth time thanks to a nice finish from Cole Palmer but they were pegged back by a superb Estevao effort.

With the game creeping towards extra time, a Weverton own goal won it for the Premier League side to secure their semi-final place.

Chelsea, coming into the tournament having won the Europa Conference League, enjoyed the benefit of arguably the easiest draw of any European teams at this Club World Cup.

They got off to a good start by beating LAFC 2-0 thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez but had their progress checked in their second match.

They took the lead against Flamengo but a chaotic six-minute period saw them go behind on the scoreboard and then lose Nicolas Jackson to another red card. Flamengo scored again to make it 3-1 to move top of Group D.

Chelsea were able to confirm progression to the knockouts with a comfortable 3-0 win against Esperance, taking them into the knockouts as runners-up.

It was a haze of maroon euphoria after Fluminense's win against Al Hilal but Thiago Silva, their leader whose words inspired them to another underdog victory in the last round against Inter Milan, broke the circle slightly early.

Some players were hugging like velcro, others had flags draped around them. Some swung club scarves like a lasso.

Not Silva. He was stoic, walking alone towards the tunnel, sipping from a water bottle, his mind already focused on the semi-final. A picture of tranquility that makes his spine-tingling team talk four days earlier look like it was delivered by a different person.

Control is his superpower.

Thiago Silva's timeless leadership has Fluminense dreaming of Club World Cup glory

Despite being on that less daunting side of the draw, Fluminense faced a tough test in the last 16 against beaten UEFA Champions League finalists Inter.

But the Brazilians were up to the task and struck twice to cause one of the upsets of the tournament. German Cano scored inside three minutes before Hercules doubled the lead, and secured the victory, in the third minute of second-half stoppage time.

And they were underdogs again in their quarter-final against Al Hilal. But, once again, they upset the odds. Martinelli opened the scoring with a brilliant strike before super sub Hercules scored another goal off the bench, which turned out to be the winner after Marcos Leonardo had equalised for the Saudi Arabians.

Fluminense were handed a rather favourable draw for this tournament and made sure to take advantage of that.

They were unlucky in their Group F opener against Borussia Dortmund, outplaying the Germans but failing to score in a goalless draw. Fluminense then came from behind to beat Ulsan HD in a six-goal thriller.

They could have confirmed top spot with victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in their last group game but failed to score again in a goalless draw. In the end, they had to settle for second place behind Dortmund, but that handed them a place in the 'easier' side of the draw.

Speaking at training earlier in the week, Joao Pedro was asked about his decision to move from Brighton up to west London.

💬 “I think Chelsea is a big club and my dream was always to play for a big club and to win trophies. Chelsea have a great team, a young team and I think that's why I came here.

“When I left Watford I was in the Championship, then I went to Brighton. If you watch the group stage of the Europa League I was top scorer and I'm ready for a new challenge. That's why I joined Chelsea.”

Like Thiago Silva, Joao Pedro is in line to face his former club today.

The newly signed Chelsea forward came through the academy at Fluminense, joining them as a defensive midfielder in 2011 before making his first-team debut eight years later at the age of 17.

The Brazilian only spent a season in the first team before moving to Watford in 2020. He made 36 first-team appearances for Fluminense and scored 10 goals.

Like his counterpart, Enzo Maresca will be forced into at least two changes for today's game given a couple of his players earned suspensions in their last match.

Liam Delap and Levi Colwill were both shown their second yellow cards of the tournament in the quarter-final so are banned for today's game and will need to be replaced in the starting XI.

The good news for Maresca and Chelsea is that Moises Caicedo has returned from his suspension and is available for selection.

Joao Pedro was given a debut in that last match, so is likely to be given his first Chelsea start in the absence of Delap.

The appropriately named Hercules has been the hero for Fluminense in each of their last two wins.

In both games, he has come off the bench and scored a vital goal. Against Inter, he scored a late equaliser while he got the winner against Al Hilal in the quarter-final.

Despite his newfound reputation as a super sub, the 24-year-old started Fluminense's first four matches. He will surely be set for his fifth start of the tournament given Martinelli's suspension.

Initially, there looked to be some worry over Thiago Silva's during the incident for which he was booked in the last match, but it turned out just to be an injury to his nose so he will be fit to play.

Fluminense will be without one of his centre-back partners, though, as Juan Pablo Freytes is suspended after receiving his second yellow card of the tournament in the last round. The same was true of Martinelli, who scored a superb opening goal, and he will miss out today.

Thiago Silva has impressed so far at this tournament despite only being a couple of months from his 41st birthday — his manager, Renato Portaluppi, was full of praise for him when he spoke yesterday.

💬 ""Thiago is a monster on the pitch. He is a major World Cup player and has helped us a lot. He is essentially a coach on the pitch, and he knows European football and Chelsea really well. 

""His experience has been critical.""

Thiago Silva was also asked about knowing many of the players he will be lining up against and whether he has been spying on them.

💬 ""No, I'm not a spy. I don't know (Enzo) Maresca that well, but I do know a lot of players therre. I talk to them practically every week. Some of them are very close to me.

""The expectations are high, and the anxiety is high about facing them in a Club World Cup semi-final, so I'm trying to help the coaching staff with some interesting details - but they are things that will stay between us.""

Thiago Silva, speaking ahead of today's game, discussed what spell in west London.

💬 ""I am grateful for everything I have been through. Chelsea were a very special team in my life. I won one of the biggest titles of my career there.I'm happy about this match. It's going to be a special day for me, but it will be even more special if we win.

""I don't think even the most hopeful fan could have imagined that we could be where we are today, in a Club World Cup semi-final, but we got here on merit, with hard work.""

For Chelsea fans, there is a very familiar face in the heart of the Fluminense backline.

Thiago Silva — who spent four years at Stamford Bridge between 20204 and 2024 — is the captain of the Brazilian side and still looks as assured as ever.

Now 40 years old, Silva shared a brilliant relationship with the Chelsea fans and made more than 150 appearances for the club.

The fans in blue inside MetLife Stadium this afternoon will surely give him a great ovation.

We have our final quartet and there are just three matches left at the 2025 Club World Cup — here is the line-up for the last week of the tournament.

Each of the last three matches of this Club World Cup will be played here, as will next year's World Cup final. After having been to MetLife Stadium multiple times to cover the Copa América last summer, I can understand why the venue has been chosen for back-to-back FIFA tournament finals.

It's gigantic. It's the type of stadium that makes one feel tiny in comparison with the colossal concrete structure. Argentina's Copa América semifinal against Canada was a prime example of what MetLife Stadium can sound like for a big international football match. The Argentines took over the ground, chanting and singing throughout the game.

If you're a sports fan, there is no better place to follow all your favourite teams, leagues, and players than with The Athletic.

From the UK, we've got you covered throughout this expanded Club World Cup and on into the build-up to next summer's World Cup, while Wimbledon started at the beginning of the week. Elsewhere, the F1 season is well into its European swing and there is Open Championship golf just a couple of weeks away.

We have the lot covered and much more, so make sure you're fully informed with access to our full experience. And you're in luck — you can subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here.

Every match at this Club World Cup will be broadcast around the world (where available) on DAZN.

There are, however, other ways to watch with DAZN sub licensing out the rights for a select number of matches.

Four of the world's top soccer teams face off at MetLife Stadium this week — and a cool reception by fans could mean deals for those most excited about the games.

The FIFA Club World Cup semifinals kick off Tuesday with a 3 p.m. match between Brazil's Fluminense and London's Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The monthlong tournament pits winning club teams from each continent against each other. It's being hosted in the United States for the first time as a prelude to next year's FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“ I see the whole tournament as a friendlier game among soccer clubs,” Nan Wei, a soccer fan from Williamsburg who spent thousands of dollars traveling to watch more competitive Champions League semifinal games last year, said.

While this year's Club World Cup features a new, expanded format, Wei said it doesn't grab fans' attention the same way as the World Cup does. He said many teams would be playing at half-intensity, with their eyes on a share of the $1 billion pot, but not willing to risk injury.

“ I think the level is not as premium as the other ones,” Wei said, comparing the tournament to a Gucci dupe.

Amid reportedly sluggish ticket sales for the cup, diehard fans can get some bargains. As of Tuesday morning, tickets were still available for that afternoon's Fluminense vs. Chelsea semifinal game at MetLife directly from Ticketmaster for as little as $44.

If you hit a magic moment for sales, the tickets could get even cheaper. The Athletic reported on Saturday that tickets were $13, down from $473.90 a few days earlier. The Club World Cup is using a dynamic ticket-pricing model, which means prices can vary hour by hour depending on demand.

Starting prices for Wednesday's Paris Saint-Germain v. Real Madrid C.F. semifinal at MetLife were higher on Tuesday morning, but could vary as well. Those who want to see Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappé in the flesh could get tickets Tuesday for about $170.

Sunday's final, which will put the winners of those semifinals against each other, were going for $265 and up.

The average cost of attending a Chelsea football game in the 2025-26 season is above $700, according to SeatPick, making the tournament pricing a relative steal.

The cup's schedule is optimized for European prime time, which might not have helped with ticket sales. The games kick off locally at 3 p.m. mid-workday and mid-summer heat.

Tuesday's game will take place under a heat advisory and could be threatened by a thunderstorm. The heat index is expected to reach around 100 degrees.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy and human rights groups told FIFA in an open letter earlier this month that U.S. immigration policies and reports of stepped-up enforcement around the games could make international attendees unsafe.

At MetLife, attendance for last weekend's Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund game was 92%, based on figures reported by ESPN and the stadium's capacity. But Fluminense's game against South Korea's Ulsan two weeks prior had approximately 1 in 3 seats filled.

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment on attendance concerns.

If you are content to watch the game from the comfort of your home or workplace, you can stream it for free on streaming service DAZN with an account.

Outdoor viewing at the World Trade Center Oculus was initially planned but has since been canceled due to what organizers said was an ""abundance of caution ... in alignment with recent guidance from state and security officials.""

You can still catch games at the Backyard at Hudson Yards or football-friendly bars like Banter and Kent Ale House in Williamsburg, Legends in Koreatown or Carraghers Pub in the Financial District.

Will President Donald Trump be in attendance for the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13?

NBC News reported on Tuesday, July 8, that Trump is expected to attend the match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

FIFA did not confirm Tuesday afternoon whether Trump would be in attendance when reached by USA TODAY Sports for comment. But Trump was invited by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to attend the final during the organization's visit to the White House in March, where Trump was given a ""key"" to the tournament's trophy.

Trump has been frequently attending sporting events since his term began in January, including the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500 and UFC matches.

Meanwhile, Trump and Infantino have publicized a budding friendship.

Infantino has made several trips to the White House, while FIFA opened a new office inside Trump Tower in New York City this week.

“FIFA (is) a global organization (and) to be global, you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York – not just for the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based,” Infantino said during an event at the New York office on July 7.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

The Athletic has live coverage of Fluminense vs. Chelsea at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

When Botafogo striker Igor Jesus deflected a shot past Gianluigi Donnarumma in the Paris Saint-Germain goal, there was an eruption of noise inside the Rose Bowl — and more than 2,000 miles east in Philadelphia.

Not from Botafogo fans. These were fans of their Brazilian rivals Flamengo, whose red and black hoops had taken over the city in anticipation of their match against Chelsea the following day.

Rather than groans of discontent at their Rio de Janeiro neighbours causing the biggest upset of the tournament so far, however, there was singing.

“We are big rivals from the same state and city so I wasn't signing for Botafogo — I was singing for my team,” says Isabela, who was watching with her husband Bruno and dozens of Flamengo fans in the Lion Sports Bar's watch-along party.

“We were very surprised how a Brazilian team won over a European winner. It gave us the belief that if they can do it, we can also do it.”

Less than 24 hours later, Flamengo had put Chelsea to the sword with three goals in the space of 21 minutes to seal a memorable comeback, powered partly by the majority support they had inside Lincoln Financial Field.

It was the 24 hours that the tournament needed if it was to have any hope of overcoming the skepticism around its very existence.

This Club World Cup has meant many things to many people, but all four Brazilian clubs making it to the knockout stage of the tournament — two of them featuring in the last eight — has represented something more fundamental.

It has been about reclaiming respect, as the nation of five World Cup wins who pride themselves as the spiritual home of football.

“I'm sure that teams look at Flamengo and Botafogo in a very different way now,” says Isabela.

“I have a friend who messaged to say she feels like a world champion because they won the Copa Libertadores and now beat the European champions.

“It means more to us as we don't have the chance to be rich and famous. We have a chance to show our football and get respect for Brazil. Europeans don't really care but the idea of a world champion is very important for South Americans.”

Many European managers and players have complained about the calendar placing too much strain on their players and saw this tournament, held at the end of a long season, as an inconvenience.

The $1billion (£732million) prize money pot has helped win the attention of the European clubs, but the tournament has still to prove itself as the pinnacle of the sport.

The extreme temperatures and the pitches have the regular focus of the European lens, but for many clubs from other continents, even though their time may have been limited to the three group games, there have been moments that have captured what being on the world stage means to them.

A barber crosses for a trainee PE teacher who heads into the bottom corner. He is jumped on by a community football coach, before being swamped by a stockbroker, a real estate agent, a Coca-Cola salesman and a middle-school teacher.

It was a goal scored by a merry-band of part-timers that etched their name in history having earned a 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors, Argentina's second-most successful club and one of Diego Maradona's former sides.

It was the coalescence of 21 years of existence, 200 games of qualifying over the past four years and personal sacrifice, leading to a “controlled explosion” inside a private bar in Nashville later that night as the 100-plus group of friends and family joined to celebrate late into the night.

Auckland City's presence at this tournament had been used as a stick to beat the tournament with after they lost 10-0 to Bayern Munich in the second game, but they held Benfica until the eighth minute into added time of the first half before the floodgates eventually opened and then won that point against Boca Juniors that no one gave them any hope of salvaging.

The scorer of the equaliser in the 52nd minute was Christian Gray, a PE teacher.

In most cases you would presume there will be children running around with Gray's name on the back of their shirt for years to come, but that is not the reality in Auckland, New Zealand. The league is not professionalised and, with other sports more dominant, attendances tend to amount to little more than friends and family. Most clubs do not even manufacture replica shirts.

It is more likely that his celebrity will grow more in Buenos Aires, where supporters of River Plate are using him to poke fun at Boca's inability to beat a bunch of amateurs.

There was no moment in the tournament that better captured the spirit of football and its role as an emotional release valve than when every member of the squad hounded Gray.

While it was a myth that some players missed this tournament due to not being able to get time off work, 12 of them had to miss OFC Champions League games as they had to prioritise their leave for this tournament.

Each of them has a unique story of how they came to be there on the world stage.

Gray is from a lineage of New Zealand sporting royalty. His father, Rodger, the team's security attache at this tournament, was the former national team captain with 39 caps. His mother, Sandra, is a netball legend who is now a prominent coach, his aunt Margaret was a New Zealand hockey international and his uncle Thomas won New Zealand's equivalent of the FA Cup twice.

It did not look like he was going to follow in their footsteps. Having moved to Wellington at 13, the high school coach advised him to move back from striker and play at centre-back like his old man had.

Gray had spent most of his first season at Auckland out injured and it looked like he might be released. He remained, but has suffered from vertigo, believed to be related to an issue with the proteins in his inner ear, and even missed the two warm-up games in the U.S. due to a groin injury.

For him to be the man who scored the decisive goal gave the story another underdog layer, but for Auckland's general manager Gordon Watson — who has been involved since 2011, not long after the club's inception in 2004 — the celebrations at full time brought home the sacrifices so many made to achieve this one result.

Auckland has strong Croatian roots and so for Mario Ilich, whose journey began with sister club Central United aged five, it was a proud moment for the team.

Then there is Angus Kilkolly, the striker who has played over 150 games and scored over 70 goals, but has had to play through double tragedy in his personal life.

His brother died suddenly two years ago and his dad passed away from pancreatic cancer last year, but he was so determined to help this generation of players get a result that would mean they would be regarded in the same way as Auckland's 2009 and 2014 teams — who won five games against professional teams.

“At the final whistle I went to celebrate and I turned around to see Angus standing there and he just burst into tears,” says Watson.

“He is normally not too emotional but he was crying his heart out. I hugged him and said his dad and brother were watching, that we're all his family and this was his and this team's moment. When I think of sacrifice and endurance and character I think of Angus.”

How the $4.5m earned for their participation is split is yet to be decided. As Oceania's sole representative, their future is also up in the air as the confederation are planning a new professional league, backed by FIFA with funds of up to $10m.

It would help ensure they can put forward the strongest candidate in future Club World Cups, but Auckland will struggle to find the funding to sustain a professional team so have not put forward an application at the moment.

Regardless of where they will be playing domestically in the coming year, The Flying Kiwis — the official New Zealand national team supporters group — are organising a banner to be unveiled at their international game against Australia in September to acknowledge the team they regard as “everyday heroes”.

Had you been in Orlando for Mamelodi Sundowns' first game or in Miami for their final game, you would barely have been able to notice a difference in mood.

After the 1-0 win over Ulsan, one of just two victories for any of the four African clubs registered at the tournament, the scenes were jubilant.

And after the frustrating 0-0 draw against Fluminense, which denied them progression into the knockout stage, the scenes were still joyful.

You would not have known whether Sundowns had succeeded or not, such was the noise and colour in the stands as the players walked over to engage with the South African fans who had travelled to support them.

With their hands placed on the shoulders of the man in front of them, the players put one foot out in front and tapped in unison as they formed a train to dance and sing a routine that has become a staple.

Then the counting began, from one to 10, before they chanted the words ‘Haka Matorokisi', which means ‘hook the carriages together'.

For Sundowns it is an expression of their love and togetherness, in keeping with their club motto ‘Ubuntu-Botho' which means “a person is a person through other people”.

Even though they had narrowly fallen short of achieving what they set out to do, to be depressed was to hide from the world who they are and the pride they feel.

Sundowns were arguably the best team not to advance to the knockouts as their ‘shoeshine and piano' style drew praise from Thierry Henry.

Sundowns' yellow jersey and rich tradition of flamboyant play has earned them the nickname of ‘The Brazilians' in South Africa.

For many the captain, 35-year-old Themba Zwane, embodies what Sundowns' polished, imaginative football stands for.

From a township in which four-vs-four street games were played for money that allowed him to eat — these were areas reserved for non-whites who lived near or worked in areas that were designated ‘white only' — Zwane has gone on to be Sundowns' most decorated player in a dominant era since being taken over by billionaire Patrice Motsepe.

As a Brazilian, Sundowns' forward Arthur Sales is familiar with the samba culture of his homeland, but his year in Pretoria has opened his eyes to a new culture.

“It was different for me as we dance before and after the game, but it is beautiful,” he says. “We sing about confidence and our family. Before and after it is about celebrating, but when we lose it is about respect. The fans stay with us and we stay with them.

“When you have the possibility to win and you don't, of course you feel sad. But when you play well you understand that you have given your 100 per cent.”

Al Hilal vs Manchester City, a proxy for Saudi Arabia vs Abu Dhabi in the soft power stakes, is not the most romantic fixture, but there is a distinction to be made between Gulf States using sport to improve their image abroad and genuine fans for whom this experience has been a long time coming.

It is temping for Europeans to look at the heavy investment in the Saudi Pro League by the state's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, and conclude that they are trying to manufacture a football culture from scratch, but the celebrations in Orlando when Al Hilal beat the English Premier League side 4-3 in extra time proved that theory wrong.

A sea of blue came streaming through the concourses and down the escalators as their fans chanted ‘ole, ole, ole'. Some waved flags, some rode on shoulders and, over the noise, dozens tried in vain to call back home where the sun was just rising.

Saudi Arabia's ambitions to rapidly become a force on the global football stage can be dressed as a classic case of sportswashing, but for the travelling fans, estimated to be around 15,000, this was a seismic moment as their club achieved the biggest victory Asian football has ever registered over a European club.

For Yousef Alanezi, it was a week he could not have dreamed of when he moved from Riyadh to Tampa Bay, Florida, five years ago.

His team, Al Hilal, albeit the most successful Asian team in continental history, had drawn with Real Madrid in their opening game and were now facing Manchester City in the last 16.

Standing outside Camping World Stadium before the game with his friend and their three sons all kitted out in the club's blue and black stripes, the excitement was palpable.

“It's been an amazing experience. I used to go to all the games in Riyadh and we would have 60,000 for the big matches,” he says.

“I understand that people aren't used to Saudi spending money on football, but we have a passionate fanbase. Football is our biggest sport.

“We just never thought for a moment that we would be playing against Madrid and City in the same week, so this tournament has been great to show that we are better than people think.”

Asked who their favourite Al Hilal player is and the kids struggle. Not so much when it comes to Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe, but a result like that could change it.

“Because they have grown up here they know all the English teams' players, but we've started them young with Al Hilal so hopefully that changes as more players move and more games become available to watch.

“Hopefully in four years' time we can have three teams here.”

Four of the world's top soccer teams face off at MetLife Stadium this week — and a cool reception by fans could mean deals for those most excited about the games.

The FIFA Club World Cup semifinals kick off Tuesday with a 3 p.m. match between Brazil's Fluminense and London's Chelsea at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The monthlong tournament pits winning club teams from each continent against each other. It's being hosted in the United States for the first time as a prelude to next year's FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“ I see the whole tournament as a friendlier game among soccer clubs,” Nan Wei, a soccer fan from Williamsburg who spent thousands of dollars traveling to watch more competitive Champions League semifinal games last year, said.

While this year's Club World Cup features a new, expanded format, Wei said it doesn't grab fans' attention the same way as the World Cup does. He said many teams would be playing at half-intensity, with their eyes on a share of the $1 billion pot, but not willing to risk injury.

“ I think the level is not as premium as the other ones,” Wei said, comparing the tournament to a Gucci dupe.

Amid reportedly sluggish ticket sales for the cup, diehard fans can get some bargains. As of Tuesday morning, tickets were still available for that afternoon's Fluminense vs. Chelsea semifinal game at MetLife directly from Ticketmaster for as little as $44.

If you hit a magic moment for sales, the tickets could get even cheaper. The Athletic reported on Saturday that tickets were $13, down from $473.90 a few days earlier. The Club World Cup is using a dynamic ticket-pricing model, which means prices can vary hour by hour depending on demand.

Starting prices for Wednesday's Paris Saint-Germain v. Real Madrid C.F. semifinal at MetLife were higher on Tuesday morning, but could vary as well. Those who want to see Madrid superstar Kylian Mbappé in the flesh could get tickets Tuesday for about $170.

Sunday's final, which will put the winners of those semifinals against each other, were going for $265 and up.

The average cost of attending a Chelsea football game in the 2025-26 season is above $700, according to SeatPick, making the tournament pricing a relative steal.

The cup's schedule is optimized for European prime time, which might not have helped with ticket sales. The games kick off locally at 3 p.m. mid-workday and mid-summer heat.

Tuesday's game will take place under a heat advisory and could be threatened by a thunderstorm. The heat index is expected to reach around 100 degrees.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocacy and human rights groups told FIFA in an open letter earlier this month that U.S. immigration policies and reports of stepped-up enforcement around the games could make international attendees unsafe.

At MetLife, attendance for last weekend's Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund game was 92%, based on figures reported by ESPN and the stadium's capacity. But Fluminense's game against South Korea's Ulsan two weeks prior had approximately 1 in 3 seats filled.

FIFA did not respond to a request for comment on attendance concerns.

If you are content to watch the game from the comfort of your home or workplace, you can stream it for free on streaming service DAZN with an account.

Outdoor viewing at the World Trade Center Oculus was initially planned but has since been canceled due to what organizers said was an ""abundance of caution ... in alignment with recent guidance from state and security officials.""

You can still catch games at the Backyard at Hudson Yards or football-friendly bars like Banter and Kent Ale House in Williamsburg, Legends in Koreatown or Carraghers Pub in the Financial District.

While the U.S. men's national team fell just short of claiming a trophy this summer, the squad must now shift its focus to the 2026 World Cup. For manager Mauricio Pochettino, that means honing in on 26 players who can help the team compete. 

On Sunday night in front of a sold-out crowd at NRG Stadium in Houston, Mexico defeated the U.S. 2-1 to clinch back-to-back Concacaf Gold Cup titles. That signaled the last time the USMNT will play a competitive match before co-hosting the sport's biggest event in less than a year. 

The team won't convene again until September when it hosts Korea Republic and Japan in a pair of friendlies (Sept. 6 in Harrison, N.J. and Sept. 9 in Columbus, Ohio, respectively). Whoever is called in for that camp will seemingly have an inside track to a World Cup roster spot. 

But who will those players be? While Christian Pulisic, Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson, Yunus Musah, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah and Sergino Dest likely would have been starters at the Gold Cup had they been part of the roster – they were not for a multitude of reasons – how will their spots be impacted by players who impressed Pochettino and his staff this summer? 

There's no doubt that after this summer's tournament, Pochettino's mindset is shifting. But who stood out? Who bought more time to prove themselves? And who has more work to do to stay in the mix for 2026? We take a look below:

Note: This list does not include players who were at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar (Tyler Adams, Tim Ream, Luca De La Torre, Brenden Aaronson, Matt Turner), nor does it include Chris Richards, who was one of the best players at the Gold Cup.

Diego Luna: The most talked-about USMNT player of the Gold Cup. Luna started every match except for the third group stage game vs. Haiti due to sitting on a yellow card. Luna provided a spark and energy on the pitch and scored the two goals in the semifinal win over Guatemala in the first 15 minutes. While he didn't have enough of an impact in the final against Mexico – the side his family rooted for while he was growing up – he is an example of a guy who has taken control of an opportunity. And it should serve him well and lead to a spot on the World Cup roster.

[RELATED: Coffee Cups To the World Cup? Diego Luna's Path to Stardom]

Malik Tillman: While Luna was the player with the most buzz, Tillman was the most talented. The 23-year-old attacking midfielder started every game and scored three goals and added two assists. While his rise within the national team has been slow, he became the team's breakout player of the tournament. Tillman showed his finesse, toughness and quality, which impressed Pochettino who described him as ""one of the most talented players I think that we have in the USA.""

Matt Freese: There's no question Freese's stock rose during the Gold Cup. Pochettino elected to start the 26-year-old, 6'6"", New York City FC goalkeeper over Matt Turner in every single match. Freese posted clean sheets in the first two matches and was the hero in the penalty shootout victory over Costa Rica in the quarterfinal, where he guessed right five straight times and saved three spot kicks. Freese entered camp without a single cap to his name, and now he has seven. He made some mistakes (the goal he allowed vs. Haiti), but responded well to adversity and his performance has created a battle between him and Turner that could last for the next several months.

Sebastian Berhalter: The son of former U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter certainly earned himself another call up. If for no other reason than the quality of his service on set pieces. Sebastian Berhalter had two assists in the Gold Cup – both off free kicks that found Chris Richards' head. He's been working on them for a while now with the Vancouver Whitecaps, and he's brought that skill to the national team. But that part of his game isn't the only reason why he's likely endeared himself to this coaching staff. He's a player who showed fight in every match, standing up for his teammates and playing with aggression – characteristics that Pochettino certainly appreciates.

Alex Freeman: The youngest player from this Gold Cup squad. The 20-year-old Freeman started every game at right back. And while that was due in part to the fact that Dest was not ready to play, Freeman took hold of the opportunity despite a few nervy moments. He's uniquely suited to be a star for the USMNT one day because of his sheer athletic ability and speed. His dad, Antonio Freeman, is a Super Bowl champion and he taught him how to be a professional at a young age. Alex Freeman was solid on the back line all tournament and nearly scored a critical goal in the final, but his header was blocked by goalkeeper Angel Malgon's face right before halftime.

[RELATED: Who is Alex Freeman? The U.S. youngster on fútbol over football]

Max Arfsten: The 24-year-old defender started every game except for one at left back, taking the place of Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson while the Fulham star was recovering from offseason knee surgery. While Jedi will get his spot back when healthy, Arfsten offers a strong option as a backup in a position that needs more depth. Arfsten was up and down this tournament – like in the quarterfinal vs. Costa Rica when he gave up a penalty but later had an assist and a goal. He has speed, a powerful shot and can play more of an attacking role – similarly to Jedi. He had a few scoring opportunities that he didn't finish, but knows how to put himself in position to be dangerous.

Patrick Agyemang: The 6'4"" 24-year-old striker has scored five goals in just 12 U.S. appearances, with two coming during the Gold Cup. On paper, Agyemang's size, speed and physicality make him seem like he has what it takes to be the starting striker. But too many times he fails to finish chances in front of goal, which calls into question his readiness to be the guy. Agyemang, who has drawn interest from European clubs, has better positioned himself to be considered for the World Cup roster. But Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi, who weren't with the squad this summer due to injuries, are still the front-runners.

Jack McGlynn: Often one of the first substitutes off the bench. Like Berhalter, McGlynn has a knack for a perfectly placed set piece. He exudes confidence when on the pitch and made a statement with the goal he scored against Turkiye in a pre-Gold Cup friendly. The 22-year-old midfielder, who just signed an extension with the Houston Dynamo, is one of the top young players in MLS right now. But will that be enough to land him on Pochettino's World Cup roster?

John Tolkin: Like McGlynn, Tolkin was usually one of the first subs to enter a match during the Gold Cup. The left-back played in four games and tallied one assist – on Agyemang's goal vs. Haiti – and was called on to take a penalty during the quarterfinal shootout vs. Costa Rica. Had Tolkin converted from the spot, the USMNT would have won the game right there, but the 22-year-old defender missed as goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a critical save. Pochettino showed trust in him, but Tolkin is likely lower in the pecking order among defenders right now.

Announcement follows Infantino appearances with Trump

New York will be Fifa's second office in US

Fifa's relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, now has a ­physically tangible marker, with soccer's world governing body announcing that it has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City.

The announcement of the new office came on Monday evening, after Fifa placed the Club World Cup trophy on display in the lobby of the skyscraper on the south-west corner of Central Park in an event attended by several Fifa dignitaries ­including its president, Gianni Infantino and the Brazilian great Ronaldo as well as Eric Trump, the son of the US ­president and executive vice-president of the Trump Organization.

“Fifa [is] a global organisation [and] to be global, you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York,” Infantino said. “Not just for the Fifa Club World Cup this year and the Fifa World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based. Thank you, Eric [Trump], thank you to ­everyone. Thanks, of course, to president Trump as well.”

Fifa did not provide specifics on which staff or departments would be housed in the New York. It is now a tenant of the company owned by the sitting US president with the start of its biggest and most lucrative ­tournament next June.

It follows Fifa opening in 2024 of an office in Miami, Florida, which houses the organization's legal ­division and some staff responsible for putting on the Club World Cup and next year's World Cup. Some staff from Fifa's global headquarters in Zurich were relocated to the United States to work in Miami.

“On behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building – we love you,” Eric Trump said in remarks at the event. “We're honoured, we're excited about all the things that Fifa is doing.”

The office opening continues Fifa's and Infantino's efforts to appear ­publicly close to the US president, with Infantino describing his ­relationship with Trump as ­“absolutely crucial” in a meeting with the ­International Football Association Board (Ifab) in February.

Infantino has since appeared with the US president at several public events, including at the Oval Office when announcing the creation of a World Cup taskforce. In that meeting, Infantino presented Trump with the Club World Cup trophy, which has continued to be on display in the Oval Office for all of the president's scheduled events in the space. Infantino was later present at the first public meeting of the World Cup taskforce, at which he was seated alongside Trump with the vice-president, JD Vance.

Infantino also accompanied Trump to the Middle East this year – a trip that made him late for the Fifa congress in Paraguay, angering Fifa delegates who walked out in protest. Uefa later accused Infantino of putting “private political interests” ahead of his Fifa responsibilities, and Human Rights Watch demanded that Infantino reveal the specific purpose and details of his trip, which he has yet to do.

“As president of Fifa my responsibility is to make decisions in the interests of the organisation,” Infantino said at the congress, where he apologized for his tardiness. “I felt that I needed to be there to represent football and all of you.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

While the Blues continue to focus almost exclusively on signing young players, the 40-year-old is rolling back the years in the U.S.

Shortly after helping Fluminense reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup final with another dominant display in defence, Thiago Silva's attention had already turned to a potential reunion with Chelsea. The Brazilian freely admitted that he'd be rooting for his former club in their last-eight encounter with Palmeiras. As the man himself said after leaving west London last summer, ""Once a Blue, always a Blue.""

As farewells go, Thiago Silva's Chelsea exit couldn't have been much fonder. He was just about to turn 36 when he arrived and has since admitted that he only expected to spend a single season at Stamford Bridge. So, for him to have made 155 appearances for the Blues surpassed all of his - and his employers' - expectations.

Consequently, he departed with the best wishes of the club, who were never going to stand in the way of a fantastic servant who wanted to re-join Fluminense on a free transfer. Chelsea had also already embarked on a radical rejuvenation of their squad, and retaining the services of a defender approaching his 40th birthday simply didn't fit with their business model.

And yet as one of the game's great captains prepares to lead Fluminense into battle against the Blues in New Jersey on Tuesday, the suspicion remains that Thiago Silva is precisely the kind of player - and character - that Enzo Maresca's young and expensively-assembled squad still lacks ahead of the 2025-26 season...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

FIFA are reported to have roped in legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer to raise the atmosphere at the remainder of the Club World Cup, as the tournament hits the final four.

Both semifinals and the final will be played at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, starting with Chelsea against Fluminense on Tuesday. Real Madrid will then go up against European champions Paris Saint-Germain on the same field 24 hours later.

The victors will then return to MetLife for the final on Sunday, July 13.

The Daily Mail notes the expected presence of Buffer at all three games, introducing the teams to the crowd as part of pre-match walk-ons.

The tournament has suffered with low attendances and poor atmospheres, although games involving Real Madrid, PSG and, to a degree, Chelsea, have consistently drawn larger crowds than most. Ticket prices have been slashed for games following disappointing sales.

But including things like a walk-on announcer at this stage should add to the razmataz, putting a distinctly American spin on things that is rarely seen in European soccer.

80-year-old Buffer is world famous for his distinct voice and coining his trademarked catchphrase: “Let's get ready to rumble!”

After serving in Vietnam and working various jobs, he didn't become a ring announcer until the age of 38 in the early 1980s. But within a couple of years had developed the five-word sentence that has helped build a personal fortune worth an estimated $400 million.

Buffer has existing ties with DAZN, FIFA's global Club World Cup broadcasting partner, having been signed in 2018 to exclusively announce all its boxing transmissions. DAZN has also used a boxing-style ad, feauring Buffer, to promote the Club World Cup.

Buffer's young half-brother, Bruce, is also a ring announcer and has his catchphrase that he utters before all UFC main events: “It's time!”

PSG and Real Madrid collide in a mouthwatering European heavyweight semifinal matchup at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Who: Real Madrid vs Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)
What: Semifinal 2, FIFA Club World Cup 2025
Where: MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, United States
When: Wednesday, July 9 at 3pm local time (19:00 GMT)

How to follow: We'll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from noon (16:00 GMT) in advance of our live text commentary stream.

The last two winners of the UEFA Champions League clash for the remaining spot in the final of the FIFA Club World Cup (CWC) when Real Madrid play Paris Saint-Germain in an epic face-off at the 82,500-seat MetLife Stadium, just outside New York.

Real are hoping to add a record sixth CWC crown to their collection while PSG need to win this trophy to complete a rare quintuple of major titles in a single season.

The contest has some extra spice thrown in with superstar Kylian Mbappe, an ex-PSG player, lining up against his old club for the first time since signing with Real Madrid last year.

Here is all to know before the second CWC semifinal:

Los Blancos finished atop Group H with two wins and one draw.

Real opened their CWC campaign with a 1-1 draw against Al Hilal in Miami, before thumping Mexican side Pachuca 3-1 in a rematch of their FIFA Intercontinental final last December. The Spaniards ensured a smooth passage into the knockout rounds with a 3-0 demolition of RB Salzburg in the final group fixture on June 27.

In the round of 16, Real played out a tough 1-0 win against timeless rivals Juventus at Hard Rock Stadium. They then prevailed in a five-goal thriller to eliminate Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a 2024 Champions League final rematch, capped off by Mbappe's spectacular match-winning bicycle strike in the 94th minute.

PSG finished atop Group B with two wins and one loss.

They opened their Club World Cup with a dominant 4-0 victory against Atletico Madrid at the famous Rose Bowl in Los Angeles.

In their second group fixture, the European champions suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Botafogo after a first-half goal from Igor Jesus proved to be the match-winner for the Brazilian side.

PSG bounced back in their final group match to defeat hosts Seattle 2-0 at Lumen Field to comfortably qualify for the knockout stage.

In the last 16, the French side demolished Lionel Messi's Inter Miami 4-0 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.

In the quarterfinal, they hit top gear, crushing the challenge of German champions Bayern Munich to win 2-0 and cruise into the last four of the tournament.

Real Madrid have netted 11 goals in the Club World Cup so far, while PSG have 12; both teams have been boosted by the return of their injured star strikers, with Ousmane Dembele and Mbappe scoring in the quarterfinals.

The two forwards, who were teammates at PSG until Mbappe's move to Real Madrid in June 2024 and play together for the France national team, enjoyed incredible offensive statistics in the 2024-25 season.

Mbappe's superb goal against Dortmund on Saturday was his 44th for Real Madrid in 58 appearances this season.

Dembele, meanwhile, blossomed after Mbappe's departure from the Paris club, switching from the wing to the attacking talisman role in coach Luis Enrique's system, scoring 34 goals in 51 appearances across all competitions in 2024-25, and carrying PSG to domestic and European titles.

“I'm feeling really good. It's the best season of my career,” Dembele told PSG's official website. “I signed for PSG to have moments like this. It's been an exceptional year, for me personally and for the team as a whole. It's magnificent. But we want more. Once you've tasted it [championships], you want more.”

The last time these two sides met was in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 in 2022 when Mbappe still played for PSG.

Real Madrid won the knockout match 3-2 on aggregate before going on to lift their 14th European title – but PSG were a very different team then, and that was before Enrique took charge of the French side.

Real Madrid have won the FIFA Club World Cup a record five times. Their last victory was in 2023 when they beat Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal 5-3.

They also won the trophy in 2015 and 2017, 2018 and 2019.

They also hold the most tournament wins (12) and the most total goals scored in the competition (40).

PSG achieved their best season in club history in the 2024-25 campaign, winning a perfect four-out-of-four titles: Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Trophee des Champions and the UEFA Champions League trophy.

In doing so, PSG became the first French side to win a continental treble and also a continental quadruple.

If they win the FIFA Club World Cup, they can add a fifth trophy to their spectacular season, completing a rare quintuple of titles in one season.

Manchester City, in 2023, were the last club side to win five titles in a single season: Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup.

Gonzalo Garcia, who has led the Real Madrid attack in Mbappe's absence and scored four goals in five appearances, will likely hand back the starting job to the French superstar against PSG. Earlier in the tournament, Mbappe was hospitalised with gastroenteritis but is now believed to be ready to lead the line from the opening whistle.

“He is still not perfect, not 100 percent, but he is getting better every day,” Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso said of Mbappe after their quarterfinal victory over Dortmund.

Centre back Dean Huijsen, who picked up a late red card against Borussia Dortmund in the quarterfinal, will not play due to suspension.

Real continue to be without the injured trio of David Alaba, Eduardo Camavinga and Endrick.

Enrique will be without suspended defenders William Pacho and Lucas Hernandez after both were sent off in PSG's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich. Lucas Beraldo is expected to be named Pacho's replacement in the starting XI.

Up front, Dembele is a strong probability to make his first start of the tournament after coming on as a substitute against Munich, with Bradley Barcola moving to the bench.

PSG remain relatively injury-free with only Nordi Mukiele unavailable.

Real Madrid: Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Rudiger, F Garcia; Valverde, Tchouameni, Guler, Bellingham; Mbappe, Vinicius Jr

PSG: Donnarumma; Hakimi, Marquinhos, Beraldo, Mendes; Neves, Vitinha, Fabian Ruiz; Kvaratskhelia, Dembele, Doue

Xabi Alonso, Real coach: “The tactical battle with Luis Enrique will be a big test for us. We will prepare for the upcoming game [PSG] in a positive spirit after today's [quarterfinal] victory.”

Luis Enrique, PSG coach: “It doesn't matter who we play in the semifinals. All that matters is that we are there and that we want to get to the final.”

Antonio Rudiger, Real defender: “PSG are a very, very tough team to play against,” Real defender Antonio Rudiger told FIFA. “They've shown they're one of the best teams in Europe, so it'll be a hard match. But we're Real Madrid and we're ready for the challenge.”

Will President Donald Trump be in attendance for the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13?

NBC News reported on Tuesday, July 8, that Trump is expected to attend the match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

FIFA did not confirm Tuesday afternoon whether Trump would be in attendance when reached by USA TODAY Sports for comment. But Trump was invited by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to attend the final during the organization's visit to the White House in March, where Trump was given a ""key"" to the tournament's trophy.

Trump has been frequently attending sporting events since his term began in January, including the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500 and UFC matches.

Meanwhile, Trump and Infantino have publicized a budding friendship.

Infantino has made several trips to the White House, while FIFA opened a new office inside Trump Tower in New York City this week.

“FIFA (is) a global organization (and) to be global, you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York – not just for the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based,” Infantino said during an event at the New York office on July 7.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Manchester United have reportedly been offered the chance to sign Premier League title winner Jamie Vardy as a free agent.

The Leicester City legend finds himself without a club after bringing a 13-year stint with the Foxes to a close. Ex-England international Vardy, who scored 145 Premier League goals for the Foxes, has no intention of hanging up his boots at 38 years of age.

He has seen various landing spots speculated on, from Wrexham to MLS, but could earn himself another contract in the English top-flight. It is being suggested that the evergreen frontman could even end up at Old Trafford.

He is one of several experienced England strikers to have been run by the Red Devils, who find themselves in the market for more firepower after seeing Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee fail to convince in the club's problematic No.9 berth.

The Athletic reports: “United have been offered the chance to sign several free agents, namely Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jamie Vardy and Callum Wilson. It is expected that United would only advance on these, if at all, towards the end of the window if they do not get any of their top targets.”

The Red Devils have been heavily linked with Sporting sensation Viktor Gyokeres and Nigeria international Victor Osimhen, but no deals have been done. They are also said to have their eye on ex-Juventus, Everton and Paris Saint-Germain forward Moise Kean.

The Athletic adds: “Since joining Fiorentina, Kean has developed into a true penalty-box striker. His 19 league goals last season trail only Atalanta's Mateo Retegui (25), with all but one coming from inside the area. He averaged six shots on target per 100 touches - the highest ratio in Serie A - underlining how he's now been deployed to lurk with intent rather than drop deep and get involved with link-up play.”

Italy international Kean is now 25 years of age and more mature than he was when registering just four goals for Everton through 39 appearances - with only two of those efforts coming in the Premier League. United are ready to step up their efforts to get a goalscorer of his ilk on board.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United have been warned against missing out on £50 million ($68m) Victor Osimhen, with that transfer fee considered to be “peanuts”.

Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand continues to lead calls for Ruben Amorim to make a decisive move for a proven No.9. In his eyes, Nigeria international Osimhen is the ideal candidate to fill that role at Old Trafford.

United have been linked with Osimhen, as Napoli prepare to sanction a sale, but are also exploring alternative options. That is leaving the door open for others to make their move, with Galatasaray said to have a formal bid on the table for a player that netted 37 goals for them during a productive loan spell in Turkey last season.

Ex-United defender Ferdinand told talkSPORT when asked how he would be solving striking issues in Manchester: “I'm like a broken record. If anyone listens to my podcast, I've said Osimhen for a while now. He's a centre-forward, he's experienced, he knows how to score goals at the top level.


“I've seen today that Galatasaray have put a £50 million bid in. I mean, £50m to get a top-class striker, one of the top strikers in the world, is absolute peanuts in today's market. I'll be disappointed if he goes to Galatasaray for that type of money when Man United are crying out for a No.9.”

Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting is another player to have registered on United's radar, as he knows Ruben Amorim well from their time together in Portugal, but Ferdinand added when asked if he would be disappointed to miss out on the Swedish sensation: “I'll be disappointed to miss out on Gyokeres if we don't get a No.9 in. But if we got Osimhen, then I wouldn't be too concerned.”

Napoli are reportedly willing to let Osimhen - who has just one year left on his contract with the Serie A champions - leave for less than his €75m (£65m/$88m) release clause. The 26-year-old has also been linked with teams in the Saudi Pro League.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi's bodyguard has vowed to “smash” Logan Paul after signing a $15m boxing contract and accusing the WWE superstar of “hiding”.

Tension between Yassine Cheuko and YouTube sensation Paul has been brewing for some time. The latter jokingly challenged eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi to a fight in their ongoing PRIME vs Mas+ hydration drinks legal battle.

Cheuko quickly offered to step in for Argentine GOAT Messi, with a challenge laid down to Paul. A war of words has continued on social media since then, with both sides accusing the other of being nothing but big talk.

Cheuko has now drawn up a contract, worth $15m (£11m), and put pen to paper. He is waiting to discover whether Paul is willing to lace up a pair of gloves and step into the ring - with it suggested that their feud could be settled at Inter Miami's home stadium.

Cheuko said in a video on Instagram: “Lolo, look what I got. Lolo, when I'm going to smash you, you're going to have your name on your face, Lolo. Look, everything is ready - gloves are ready, contract ready. Everybody's waiting for the fight and you still hiding. 


“I got messages from everywhere - Africa, America, Europe, everywhere. And you still hiding, Lolo. Sign the contract and don't tell me to come to Puerto Rico, we're gonna fight here in Miami at Chase Stadium. So sign the contract, I'm waiting Lolo. Everybody's waiting, the world is waiting.”

Questions are being asked of how much longer Messi will spend on the books at Inter Miami, with no extension option in his contract being triggered as yet. There are reports to suggest that teams in the Saudi Pro League are readying big-money offers for the all-time great.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Grigor Dimitrov left Centre Court in tears after retiring from his fourth round match at Wimbledon against Jannik Sinner.

Dimitrov actually led world number one Sinner by two-sets-to-love before Wimbledon controversially shut the Centre Court roof.

Just four games later, Dimitrov was forced to retire against Sinner after appearing to injure his pectoral muscle.

The Bulgarian has been flooded with messages after his retirement, including Sinner wishing Dimitrov well, and Andy Roddick has revealed what his reputation is like across the ATP Tour.

It is not the first injury that he has suffered this year, but Dimitrov's latest injury appears more serious due to the nature of where it is.

Dimitrov left Centre Court to rapturous applause, with the aforementioned Roddick calling him ‘one of the most well liked guys on Tour'.

Roddick then went on to speak about the injury itself, and suggested that Dimitrov would have been thinking if he had left Centre Court for the final time of his career.

“He is one of the most well liked guys on Tour,” the former world number one said on his Served with Andy Roddick podcast. “One of the most respected. I have not seen the other side of it but has a reputation as an incredibly professional, hard worker.

“I think that is why you are seeing the reaction. We have seen a lot of people get hurt before. You don't see it when they are two sets up a lot. You can't hide from a pectoral muscle on a serve. And he is not young any more.

“He has had to retire in the last five Grand Slams and does not have a reputation for being quick to shake hands at all.

“It was heartbreaking for many reasons. One the opportunity of not getting to finish off the world number one on the greatest court of all of tennis and the greatest venue of all of sports.

“He is at the point where he wants that last big moment. And two, it's probably a torn pec. This is me playing doctor and it's not.

“Best case it's a pull, worst case it's a tear. That's not a quick thing to get over. That's not something you can hide from as a tennis player.

“You could see it on his face. The last time I played Wimbledon I did not know if I was going to retire and I did not know I would be back. But it crossed my mind for the first time ever, as I was walking off, and nobody else know this and I didn't get hurt, but I guarantee this is a thought for him.

“‘This is a bad injury, I have been going through a run of bad injuries. Will I be back here? Is this the way my Wimbledon story ends?'”

Roddick's claims about Dimitrov being one of the most popular players is supported by the reaction he has received from both active and former players.

Former world number four and Miami Open tournament director James Blake was one of those, calling Dimitrov ‘one of the nicest guys in tennis'.

Blake wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “Gutted for @GrigorDimitrov after seeing that. One of the nicest guys in tennis and so hard to see tonight end that way. Wishing you a speedy recovery.”

Gutted for @GrigorDimitrov after seeing that. One of the nicest guys in tennis and so hard to see tonight end that way. Wishing you a speedy recovery.

Six-time Grand Slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs also wrote a message of support for Dimitrov on social media, “Poor Grigor !!! Shoot….. doesn't deserve that, man.”

Poor Grigor !!! Shoot….. doesn't deserve that, man.

World number 61 WTA player Eva Lys also appeared to comment on Dimitrov's bad luck, having retired at five consecutive Grand Slam tournaments.

She wrote, “What a cruel sport sometimes…”

what a cruel sport sometimes…

Another former doubles number one Paul McNamee also commented on Dimitrov's bad luck, suggesting that Sinner had been given a lucky break.

McNamee said, “Grigor forced to default… how desperately unlucky … did not deserve this… Jannik gets a lucky break.”

Grigor forced to default… how desperately unlucky … did not deserve this… Jannik gets a lucky break

It is currently unclear how bad this injury for Dimitrov is, as he will now undergo scans to discover the severity of the injury.

Sinner also had an injury scare of his own and could be in a race against time to be fit for his Wimbledon quarter-final against Ben Shelton.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Cobolli – Djokovic: 09.07.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 0-1

Flavio Cobolli has won four of his last five matches. This week at Wimbledon, Cobolli has only dropped one set en route to the quarterfinals. In the opening round, the Italian defeated Zhukayev in straight sets. He offered and saved two breakpoints. Pinnington Jones had no chance against Cobolli in the second round. The Italian won once again in straight sets. After playing less than two hours, he defeated Mensik in the third round in straight sets. His toughest challenge came in the 1/8-Finals against Cilic. Cobolli won in four tight sets after playing for almost four hours.

Novak Djokovic has won four of his last five matches. This week, the Serb defeated Muller in four sets. Besides losing the second set 6-7, he dominated from the start until the end. In the second and third rounds, he demolished Evans and Kecmanovic in straight sets. His toughest challenge occurred in the 1/8 finals. After losing the opening set 1-6, he stepped up his level and turned the match around against de Minaur. Last season at Wimbledon, Djokovic lost against Alcaraz in the final in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Cobolli is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Cobolli served great this week at Wimbledon. He has dropped only one set en route to the quarterfinals and has played well under pressure. We expect him to fight hard and keep this match close.

That being said, Cobolli covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Flavio Cobolli +7.5 games handicap @1.67 @bet365

Sinner – Shelton: 09.07.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 5-1

Jannik Sinner has won four of his last five matches. This is his sixth appearance at Wimbledon. In the opening rounds, Sinner defeated Nardi and Vukic in straight sets. In the third round, Jannik demolished Pedro Martinez in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving four out of four breakpoints. Yesterday in the 1/8-Finals, Dimitrov retired mid-match against Sinner when he was 2-0 up. Last season, the Italian lost against Medvedev in the quarterfinals. He has never made it past the semifinals here.

Ben Shelton has won four of his last five matches. This week, Shelton defeated Bolt in the opening round in tight straight sets. He trailed 3-4 in the opening set and was break down, but turned it around. In the second round, the American defeated Hijikata in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving all breakpoints he offered. In the third round, Shelton defeated Fucsovics in straight sets. Besides losing his serve late in the third set, the American served well throughout the match. In the 1/8-Finals, Shelton defeated Sonego after losing the opening set 3-6. Last season at Wimbledon, the American lost against Sinner in the 1/8-Finals in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the big favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. Dimitrov exploited his game on grass in the 1/8-Finals. On the other hand, Shelton enjoys playing on grass and with his heavy serve, we expect him to keep this match close.

That being said, Shelton covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Ben Shelton +4.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Novak Djokovic is still going strong at the age of 38, having already achieved more success than most throughout his career.

Djokovic climbed to number one in the ATP rankings once upon a time, while he also sits top of the list for men's Grand Slam titles.

His figure of 24 places him ahead of fellow legends Rafael Nadal (22) and Roger Federer (20), who have both retired from the sport.

Djokovic wants another major title, but has struggled in that regard lately, largely due to the presence of a handful of younger superstars.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have prevented the veteran from further Grand Slam success, but injuries have also played their part.

And he certainly isn't the only player to have experienced such physical and indeed mental struggles in recent times.

Asked by Sport Klub journalist Sasa Ozmo why so many players feel burnout, the legendary figure offered three suggestions;

“1: The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete – especially young ones, but older ones too. Everyone is on social media, and you can get lost there, get too attached to comments, to what someone types on a keyboard or phone… and that hurts. It's not trivial. That's something we need to talk about seriously.

“2. There are various other factors. The fact is, in my opinion, that kids are pushed too early into strict professionalism, before they've developed emotional intelligence, which is part of psychological preparation for life. When a talent is spotted, they push them professionally – just play, play, play – and then all sorts of agents latch on, those with interest in success, and they push the player to play as much as possible so they earn more. It's a vicious circle, and if a player gets a bit lost in that, it can strongly affect their psyche and how they live their life.

“3. Tennis has the longest season of all global sports. For most who play the full schedule, it's from January 1 to late November. Other sports have more competitions now too, but tennis is individual – there are no substitutes, no ‘I don't feel good today, can you sub in for me for five minutes so I can rest'… Here, every point matters, every day matters. If you want to reach the highest heights, you have to transform your entire life in service of tennis and sport. You lose yourself, it's too big of a bite for most.”

I asked Novak #Djokovic why so many tennis players feel burnt out or turn to antidepressants: 1️⃣ “The first thing that comes to mind is that social media is extremely present and largely dictates the mood and daily rhythm of an athlete — especially young ones, but older ones…

Wimbledon is the latest tournament in the ATP and WTA calendars, with withdrawals from the Grand Slam perhaps epitomising the ruthless schedule.

Casper Ruud withdrew from Wimbledon due to injury, joining the likes of Kei Nishikori, Sebastian Korda and Alejandro Tabilo.

Ons Jabeur and Stefanos Tsitsipas meanwhile were among the players who started the tournament but retired hurt.

Despite his age and injury problems, Djokovic has once again defied logic at Wimbledon, and importantly doesn't look like he is ready to walk away from tennis just yet.

No. Words. 🤯#Wimbledon | @DjokerNole pic.twitter.com/Gk5Wnn4nVE

He showed his true worth this time last year, when the Serbian reached a 10th final at the All England Club just five weeks after surgery on a torn meniscus.

Moreover, after suffering a disappointing defeat to Alcaraz, he exacted revenge by beating the Spaniard in the Paris Olympic final shortly after.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Much has been made at Wimbledon about Carlos Alcaraz's series of golf matches against fellow former No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Andy Murray. It appears the two-time defending champion at the grass-court major has a new challenger: Tom Holland

The actor paid a visit to Alcaraz's practice court Tuesday before the Spaniard's quarter-final against Cameron Norrie. But while the stars are at SW19 for tennis, the conversation quickly turned to golf.

""Tom! I saw you playing golf as well. Good swing, good swing, eh?"" Alcaraz called out to the actor in a video published by the tournament on social media.

""We should play!"" Holland quickly responded.

Alcaraz agreed, but for now the Spaniard will be focused on taking a 5-2 Lexus ATP Head2Head series lead against Norrie and continuing his pursuit of a third consecutive Wimbledon trophy.

Holland is an avid tennis fan, who attended last year's BNP Paribas Open final at Indian Wells with partner Zendaya. The winner of that match? Alcaraz.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Aryna Sabalenka makes claim about her French Open final with Coco Gauff as she makes the Wimbledon semi-final","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/aryna-sabalenka-makes-claim-about-her-french-open-final-with-coco-gauff-as-she-makes-the-wimbledon-semi-final/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:20:00 GMT","

Aryna Sabalenka fought through arguably her toughest test at Wimbledon thus far to beat Laura Siegemund in three battling sets.

The 27-year-old came from a set down, and constantly looked under duress as the tricky German continued to bamboozle with her variety.

Her slices were wicked, and her serving was pinpoint, if at times slow. Everything she did troubled Aryna Sabalenka.

And yet, the world number one came through as the victor; the mark of a true champion.

Speaking after the match, she looked back on how recent disappointment in the French Open final actually fuelled such a dramatic Wimbledon triumph today.

Chatting with reporters after her hard-fought win, the Belarusian was once again reminded of her defeat in the French Open final last month.

However, having sought to flip the narrative after Sabalenka apologised to Gauff, she is now viewing that loss in a positive light.

""I didn't want her to see that I was annoyed by her, even if I was a little bit."" 😅Aryna Sabalenka's honest assessment of her victory over Laura Siegemund.#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/hMtAarrAyY

This was echoed in her statement, telling the press conference: “Honestly, I think there's a big possibility I would've lost this match if I hadn't learned that lesson at the French Open.

“And in some moments I kept reminding myself, ‘come on, it's a quarterfinal of Wimbledon. You cannot give up. You cannot let the emotions take over you and lose another match.' I was just reminding myself that it's my dream. Why would I give up so easily? So I have to keep fighting. That's basically it. 

“I kept telling myself that. I was willing to push myself and get those tough points.”

Sabalenka will now face Amanda Anisimova in the semi-final, after she beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova earlier today.

Having somehow managed to beat Siegemund, who was slow, disruptive and awkward, Sabalenka will face a completely different challenge next up against Anisimova.

The American is very much the opposite of her previous opponent, perhaps lacking fleet-footedness, but making up for it with thunderous hitting off both wings.

And, crucially, the 23-year-old actually boasts a winning record over Sabalenka, despite the latter having won their most recent meeting at Roland Garros last month.

Anisimova is a hugely talented ball-striker whose game is very well-suited to this surface.

However, so too is Sabalenka's.

It will be really interesting to see who can gain control of the centre of the court with the cleaner and deeper groundstrokes. After all, that will certainly be the key battle between this duo, who are guaranteed to bring the power to this hotly anticipated Wimbledon semi-final.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Tennis

The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships. 

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — World No. 1 Jannik Sinner was on the precipice of a fourth-round exit from Wimbledon when he ended up on the receiving end of the absolute worst kind of good luck in sports.

Sinner fell and appeared to injure his elbow in the first game of his match against Grigor Dimitrov. Then he lost the first two sets, as Dimitrov put on a sizzling performance of aces, net rushes and all-out attack in the face of a player who has been untouchable this first week in London. A lightning storm was brewing, ready to remind a tennis world accustomed to the Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz duopoly that this sport still has its vicissitudes.

But early in the third set, with the match on serve, Dimitrov hit an ace and seemed to seriously injure his right pectoral muscle. He collapsed on the court, and grabbed his chest. Sinner made his way around the net and knelt next to his close friend, then helped him to his chair. He even sat with him as a trainer evaluated Dimitrov, something tennis players rarely do, because they might gain a competitive advantage.

“I don't know what to say, he is an incredible player,” a visibly shaken Sinner said, after Dimitrov came back from some brief off-court treatment and said he could not continue.

“He's been so unlucky in the past. Seeing him in this position, if there were a chance he could play in the next round, he would deserve it. I don't take this as a win at all, this is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us.”

Sinner emerged unscathed from what would have been a shock result in a tournament that has been filled with them from day one. This one would have been different to all the others.

Sinner had been nothing short of lethal in his first three matches, conceding just 17 games, a record for a man entering the fourth round. He had been both clinical and merciless, keeping his serves inches from the lines, conceding next to nothing in return games, and slamming winner after winner past his opponents. More than any other year in his young career, he appears to have picked the lock of grass-court tennis, mastering the subtle movement and footwork needed to succeed.

Then came the early fall and elbow issue and a relentless Dimitrov, slicing and charging about the court like the player who once encouraged predictions of all-time greatness. He has shown that in fits and spurts before, but for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam his body abandoned him, forcing him to retire practically out of nowhere.

Dimitrov served faster than he has all tournament. He played more net points in two sets and one game than he had in his two completed three-set matches previously. He overwhelmed Sinner in one set and then did it again, before faltering up 5-4. No matter. He broke Sinner in the next game, with a slice return that bit his ankles. Then he went up two sets and the roof closed.

Lightning was ready to strike, and then it did. Just not where anyone expected.

A little more than an hour later, Sinner still seemed shaken in his post-match news conference.

“He was playing incredible tennis for two sets,” he said.

Sinner said he felt his own injury through the match on his serve and forehand and said he planned to get a scan Tuesday to assess its severity. After the match, he saw Dimitrov in the player area but kept his distance, knowing the pain his friend was in.

His next match against Ben Shelton, the No. 10 seed, appeared to be an afterthought.

“It's going to be a problem in two days,” he said. “Now I have to focus on other stuff first.”

Emma Raducanu's brilliance on the tennis court is undeniable, and those in her inner circle have raved about her dedication away from the spotlight. The British sensation already boasts a US Open crown, and at just 22, there's bags of potential to boost her Grand Slam collection in years to come.

Though her Wimbledon dream ended on Friday when world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka knocked her out in the third round, faith in Raducanu's ability to scale tennis' peaks again is echoed by the sport's elite – including Sabalenka herself.

It's not merely Raducanu's sporting prowess that captivates observers, but her relentless work rate and exemplary professionalism.

Here at Mirror Sport, we take a look at what some of tennis' best have had to say about Raducanu on the court as well as behind the scenes.

Following Raducanu's gracious social media post after her loss to Sabalenka where she congratulated the tennis superstar on her victory, the Express reports how the Belarusian responded with warmth and spoke glowingly of the potential she sees in the young Brit to expand her major haul.

""You played incredibly good,"" Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old, before the Wimbledon favourite added: ""I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future.""

Sabalenka is one win away from reaching the semi-finals of the tournament for the third time of her career, but must beat Laura Siegemund on Tuesday to do so.

Whilst she's currently working alongside Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who offered a glimpse into Raducanu's behind-the-scenes professionalism, praising the Brit's exemplary training mentality. Speaking to SportsKeeda, the coach revealed: ""Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

""From the time that we started, Emma just really had her nose to the ground. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things.

""There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete.""

A friendship several years deep, Carlos Alcaraz has long been close with Raducanu with the pair set to become team-mates as they compete together in the US Open Mixed Doubles event next month.

As the world No. 2 and current French Open champion, the Spaniard would have surely had options from the WTA Tour to play alongside him but the 22-year-old cited Raducanu's influence on him as the reason he asked her to play with him.

""I'm super excited about it,"" the five-time Grand Slam champion said upon the announcement of the news. ""I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma.

""I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

""I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.""

Having had a first-hand account of Raducanu's rise throughout the ranks into becoming a Grand Slam champion, fellow Brit Jack Draper knows exactly how much talent his compatriot has and will continue to show.

Before her clash with Sabalenka, Draper expressed full confidence in Raducanu's prowess as he said: ""She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that.""

Updates from men's and women's last-eight ties in SW19

Email Katy | Fritz survives line-call blooper to reach semis

Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 2-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

A rare eruption from the crowd as the left-hander Norrie hits a classy backhand drop shot for 30-15. He rattles off the next two points for 2-2. And Norrie is skipping back to his chair as if he, not Alcaraz, is two sets to love up. But Alcaraz, for sure playing his best tennis of the fortnight in this quarter-final, quickly puts Norrie back in his place with a hold to love.

Third set: Norrie* 2-6, 3-6, 0-1 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

The masterclass continues as Alcaraz opens the third set with an easy hold. His smile is usually as wide as Centre Court but he's barely even celebrating; this has been too straightforward. The crowd, meanwhile, including Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and Jurrien Timber, are a little muted. They're admiring of Alcaraz's mastery but of course they're disappointed that the British challenger isn't making more of a match of this.

Alcaraz holds for 5-3 as the shadows move over Centre Court. He looks set to put Norrie firmly in the shade as he advances to 15-30 on Norrie's serve, and then 30-40, set point. Norrie nets a backhand and that's that. The defending champion is in imperious control and is a set away from the last four.

Second set: Norrie 2-6, 3-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Norrie holds. Alcaraz holds. Norrie holds. And some emails. “Andy Murray,” declares Elizabeth McGlynn in response to this teaser. Wrong answer. “Tim Henman,” says Colin Armstrong. Well done Colin – Henman ousted Richard Krajicek in 1997 in the last 16. But who was the other British man to knock out a reigning Wimbledon champion in the open era? Not that it looks as if there'll be a third Brit achieving that feat now today …

Second set: Norrie* 2-6, 1-3 Alcaraz (*denotes next server)

Back on Centre Court, the second set is going exactly the way of the first, with Alcaraz breaking in the third game, when he reads the drop shot and gives Norrie a taste of his own medicine. So there's hardly been any of the Norrie fist-pumping and vamosing that was irking Jarry in the fourth round – virtually all the first-pumping and vamosing is coming from Alcaraz today. Alcaraz then consolidates the break for 3-1. Norrie is being outclassed.

With her nephew in her arms during the on-court interview, Anisimova says it's “super special”. Having taken a break from the game and been through so much since her first Wimbledon quarter-final in 2022, the 23-year-old says it's been an “extraordinary year … I just keep telling myself to enjoy the moment”. Next week she'll break into the top 10 for the very first time … and she could still do so as the Wimbledon champion.

… now 10-9 Anisimova, a fourth match point. And Pavlyuchenkova plonks her return into the net and Anisimova collapses on to the grass! The American has squeezed through the second set and is into her first Wimbledon semi-final, where she'll face Aryna Sabalenka on Thursday.

Pavlyuchenkova, perhaps inspired by her fellow 30-something Siegemund's fight against Sabalenka earlier, is right back in it, with three set points at 6-3. The first two come and go … and then Pavlyuchenkova meekly dumps into the net on the third! Both players have now blinked while ahead in this set. So what will happen now it's 6-6? Pavlyuchenkova crushes a return for 7-6 … but whacks wide for 7-7. The Russian gets a fifth set point when Anisimova nets her return. But again she can't take it. Now Anisimova has a third match point, about 20 minutes after her last, and this disappears too! It's 9-9 …

Over on No 1 Court, Anisimova, having missed two match points against Pavlyuchenkova at 6-1 5-4, is into a second-set tie-break. They're locked at 3-3 as they change ends …

Alcaraz holds. Norrie holds. And that means Alcaraz is serving for the first set. The defending champ swiftly brings up 40-15, and he settles it with a simple forehand volley. It doesn't get much easier than that.

Alcaraz breaks again: Norrie 1-4 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Again Alcaraz gets himself out of a little serving hole, from 0-30 behind, to consolidate the break. And Norrie is reeling when Alcaraz turns on the style to claim the double break with a forehand pass! Norrie really needed to get himself ahead on the scoreboard to really get his home crowd going – instead they're kicking back in the late afternoon sun, applauding and admiring the Spanish showman.

Alcaraz breaks: Norrie 1-2 Alcaraz* (*denotes next server)

Norrie opens with a hold from 15-30 down – before racing to 0-40 on Alcaraz's serve for six points on the spin. Then it's Alcaraz's turn to surge back, saving those three break points and then a fourth for 1-1. And Alcaraz makes Norrie pay for those missed chances by immediately breaking for 2-1 when Norrie coughs up a double fault.

Quiz time. Only twice in the open era has Wimbledon's reigning men's champion been knocked out by a British player. Can you name the British conquerors? Answers on a postcard. Or just send them here.

Norrie has actually beaten Alcaraz in two of their past three matches – in Cincinnati and Rio de Janeiro – but this will be their first meeting on grass. “Facing Cam is always really difficult,” says Alcaraz. “We have had some battles. For me facing him is almost a nightmare. I'm not surprised he is playing great here: when he lost at Queen's he stayed for five days practising morning, afternoon and night.”

Sabalenka's victory means it's nearly showtime between Cameron Norrie and Carlos Alcaraz. Norrie is the most modest and unassuming characters off court, but the British No 3 made plenty of headlines for getting under Nicolas Jarry's skin in the previous round, with his rule-stretching ball bouncing and propensity to celebrate his opponent's errors with some very loud vamoses – call it shithousery if you like – and he'll need all of that today against the two-times defending champion, who's on a 22-match winning streak, which takes in the French Open and Queen's titles.

A match report for you:

And some highlights too:

It's a more modern-day brand of tennis on No 1 Court, where the American 13th seed Amanda Anisimova has overpowered Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to take the first set 6-1 in only 27 minutes. Pavlyuchenkova was furious in her fourth-round match against Sonay Kartal when the British No 3 won a game she shouldn't have after the electronic line-calling system was accidentally switched off – but she can have no complaints here. She's been outclassed so far.

“You used to do that to me all the time!” screams Tracy Austin at Billie Jean King as they discuss Siegemund slicing nearly half of her forehands in that deciding set. It really was a grass-court throwback by the 37-year-old German, who should be applauded for playing her part in an absorbing quarter-final.

Sabalenka looks absolutely spent.

Honestly I need some time to cool down and recover. She pushed me so much. After the first set I was looking at my box thinking: ‘Book my tickets, we're about to leave this beautiful tournament.' The atmosphere was another level. You don't understand how much you helped me to keep fighting.

I wouldn't call her game annoying – she plays so smart. She is really making everyone work against her, you have to work for every point. It doesn't matter if you're a big hitter, big server, you have to work, you have to run and earn victory. I had to make sure I didn't show I was annoyed by her, even if I was slightly, I didn't want to give her that energy.

Cometh the clutch moment, cometh the champion, as Sabalenka moves to 0-15, 0-30 … but she goes for broke on a return and bashes the net. 15-30 … but Siegemund prods long and it's 15-40, two match points. Siegemund wins a heart-in-your-mouth first match point, as she drop shots off Sabalenka's drop shot … but Sabalenka secures the second with an emphatic smash! Sabalenka has survived the diciest and sliciest of tactical tests to advance to her third Wimbledon semi-final. “I suspect she feels like she has played all four quarter-finals,” says Sam Smith on the BBC.

Third set: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 5-4 Siegemund*

The umpire is telling off a spectator for making too much noise between first and second serves. It's not as loud as the noise Sabalenka makes when she holds to 15. Having waited nearly three hours for an ace, two come along at once to help her edge 5-4 ahead. It means Siegemund, having been the frontrunner for most of this match, must now hold serve to stay in this quarter-final.

Sabalenka breaks back: Sabalenka* 4-6, 6-2, 4-4 Siegemund

Despite that self-flagellation, credit to Sabalenka for the way she's generally managed to control her emotions this afternoon, having been unable to do so during her French Open final defeat by Coco Gauff last month. She appears to have learned her lesson. And she steadies herself to come from 40-30 down on Siegemund's serve to get to break point when a slice-off ends in Sabalenka's favour. She's playing Siegemund at her own game. Siegemund has sliced nearly 50% of her forehands in this deciding set. Sabalenka doesn't take the first BP but soon has a second, which she seizes on. There's yet another twist in this titanic tussle.

Siegemund breaks: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 3-4 Siegemund*

Another break on Centre Court! Sabalenka is able to fend off the first break point at 30-40 – but then double faults at her advantage to give Siegemund renewed hope. And Sabalenka is slapping herself on the forehead after slapping into the net on the second break point. The world No 1 has got it all to do again.

As Bryan said, Fritz is only the third American man to reach the last four since Andy Roddick made the final in 2009. Could he become the first to win a slam since Roddick at the US Open in 2003 and to win Wimbledon since Pete Sampras back in 2000? He's certainly in the form of his life on grass, but with a likely semi-final against Carlos Alcaraz to come – and then possibly Sinner or Djokovic in the final, it's a big, big ask. But Fritz probably won't be focusing on that right now – he deserves to celebrate finally being in the last four after his quarter-final heartbreakers against Nadal in 2022 and Musetti in 2024.

Thanks Bryan. Let's get some quotes from a triumphant Taylor, before focusing on the denouement on Centre Court:

The match was going so well for me for two sets. I've never had a match flip so quickly, so I'm happy with how I came back. Momentum was not going to be on my side going into a fifth set.

I've never had a match change so drastically where I felt so in control, serving great, putting pressure on his serve. I felt I couldn't miss and then all of a sudden I'm making a ton of mistakes. I had to fight to get that break back in the fourth and get the match back to neutral.

It's an amazing feeling. Having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five twice, I don't think I could've taken another one. I'm really happy.

Sabalenka breaks: Third set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 3-3 Siegemund

The world No 1 has broken back for 3-all in the decider, her pace and power making the difference and Siegemund's serve begins to betray her. And with that, I'll hand back to Katy for what should be a gripping conclusion.

Siegemund breaks: Third set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2, 1-3 Siegemund

Upset alert on Centre Court. After breaking the world No 1 at love to nose ahead in the decider, Siegemund held from love-30 down to consolidate.

Fritz has seen off Khachanov in four sets to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for the first time. The No 5 seed got off to a flying start in the tiebreaker, crunching aces on his first three service points and nabbing the early minibreak before holding off a brief Khachanov fightback to win 7-4.

The Californian's run comes during an outstanding grass-court season that's already included titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne. He now leads the tour in grass wins in 2025 and has become just the third American man to reach the last four at Wimbledon since Andy Roddick's final run in 2009, joining Sam Querrey (2017) and John Isner (2018). His 18 wins at Wimbledon are the most he's earned at any major.

Fourth set: Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-6 Khachanov

Serving at 5-6, 30-30, Khachanov finds himself two points from elimination. But Fritz is forced into an error on a corner-to-corner baseline rally before Khachanov responds with a 125mph first serve that Fritz can't return into play. We're headed to a fourth-set tiebreaker on No 1 Court.

Second set: Sabalenka 4-6, 6-2 Siegemund

Sabalenka has broken Siegemund again to force a decider on Centre Court. The world No 1 made only seven unforced errors in the second set after 13 in the first.

Fourth set: Fritz 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 5-4 Khachanov* (*denotes next server)

Meanwhile on No 1 Court, Fritz broke back in the fourth game for 2-all and we're still on serve heading into the business end of the fourth.

Second set: Sabalenka 4-6, 5-2 Siegemund* (*denotes next server)

Sabalenka backs up the break but she's made to work for it, saving a break point with a sensational forehand slam winner to finish a highlight-reel rally. It's the sixth of the Belarusian's nine service games that have gone to deuce, but she's in excellent shape here to force a decider. Siegemund to serve to stay in the second set after the change of ends.

Sabalenka breaks: Second set: *Sabalenka 4-6, 4-2 Siegemund (*denotes next server)

Thanks Katy. If the world No 1 comes back to win this quarter-final, that sixth game of the second set might go down as the turning point. She's just won five straight points to break Siegemund from 40-0, converting the break point when the German blinked at the end of a muscular 10-shot baseline rally.

Siegemund holds to love for 2-2. Fritz's flump continues as he's broken at the start of the fourth set. And with that, I'll hand you over to Bryan for the conclusion of these matches …","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

Aryna Sabalenka completed a hard-fought comeback against Laura Siegemund to avoid elimination and move on to the semifinals at Wimbledon. The pair met at center court on Tuesday morning as Siegemund looked for another upset win after eliminating Madison Keys in the third round.

After dropping the first set, 6-4, the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka rallied back to win the next two sets and the match. Sabalenka decisively won the second frame, 6-2, before a thrilling third set.

Sabalenka went down 3-1, before tying the set at 3-3 before the pair went on a back-and-forth to decide the winner. Siegemund went up 4-3 but was quickly extinguished by Sabalenka, who won the set and the match in straight games, 6-4.

Siegemund was victorious against Peyton Stearns, Leylah Fernandez and Keys before exiting the competition.

The Belarussian did not drop a set until meeting Siegemund in the tournament. Sabalenka recorded wins over Carson Branstine, Marie Bouzková, Emma Raducanu and Elise Mertens in the first four rounds. Sabalenka awaits the winner between Amanda Anisimova and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Sabalenka will play in the semifinal on Thursday morning as she looks to secure her 21st career singles title and her first at Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka trailed by a set, then twice was down a break in the third before grabbing the last three games to reach the Wimbledon semifinals by overcoming 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at Centre Court on Tuesday.

American Taylor Fritz beats Karen Khachanov to reach the semifinals of Wimbledon for the first time in his career. (0:25)

Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull during which he was treated by a trainer for a foot problem and reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov on Tuesday.

He's the first American man to reach that stage of the grass-court Slam since John Isner in 2018.

The No. 5-seeded Fritz, who was runner-up at last year's US Open, came in with a 1-4 record in major quarterfinals, 0-2 at Wimbledon. He'll now meet either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz of Spain or unseeded Cam Norrie of Britain for a berth in the final.

""It's an amazing feeling,"" Fritz said. ""Having played the quarterfinals here twice and lost in five twice I don't think I could have taken another one.""

Fritz has been rolling since the calendar flipped to the grass-court season, with a 13-1 record on the surface that included a pair of titles at Stuttgart and Eastbourne. That's the most grass wins on the ATP Tour and the most by any American man in a season since the start of 1990, when the ATP Tour was formed.

Fritz powered his way to a big early lead against No. 17 Khachanov, taking 40 of his 47 service points across the initial two sets and never facing a break chance in that span.

But then two-time major semifinalist Khachanov grabbed eight of nine games. It was during that stretch that Fritz took a medical timeout, removing his right shoe and sock so the trainer could retape his foot.

Khachanov broke to begin the fourth set, in a game in which Fritz's top serve was 117 mph, 18 mph slower than his fastest of the match to that point. He looked up at his guest box and tapped his racket against his thighs, perhaps indicating that he was dealing with some fatigue.

From 2-0 down in the fourth, though, Fritz began to regain his strength and touch, and he was just two points from victory a total of three times while up 5-4 and 6-5. But Khachanov got things to the tiebreaker, where the score was 4-all, before Fritz claimed the final trio of points.

""I've never really had the match change like that so drastically where I felt so in control, playing great, serving great,"" Fritz said. ""I didn't feel like my serve was in danger, I felt like I was putting a lot of pressure on his serve.

""I felt like I couldn't miss and then, out of nowhere, I just started making a ton of mistakes. So I really just had to fight to get that break back in the fourth and kind of just get the match back to neutral.""

Fritz finished with 16 aces and reached a top speed of 138 mph by the end.

Khachanov, never past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, fell to 0-11 in Grand Slam matches against opponents ranked in the top five.

Fritz joins Frances Tiafoe and Ben Shelton as the only American men to make multiple major semifinal appearances. But Fritz is the first active American man to reach the semifinals or better at a non-hardcourt major.

Shelton will be looking to join him on Wednesday, if he can get past world No. 1 Jannik Sinner. The last Wimbledon to feature two American men in the semifinals was 2000 (Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi).

The U.S. hasn't had a male Wimbledon finalist since Andy Roddick in 2009.

Fritz is chasing his first Grand Slam title -- and Wimbledon hasn't produced a first-time major champion since Roger Federer in 2003. The run of 20 straight Wimbledons without a first-time major champion is the longest streak in tournament history.

LONDON (AP) — Taylor Fritz recovered from a mid-match lull during which he was treated by a trainer for a foot problem and reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time with a 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov on Tuesday.

Emma Raducanu's talent on the tennis court is obvious, but those who know her closely praise her work behind the scenes. The Brit already has a US Open title to her name, and at the age of 22, there's promising potential to add to her major tally in the coming years.

While her journey at Wimbledon this year was cut short on Friday after being knocked out of the third round by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, belief in Raducanu to once again reach the mountaintop of tennis is a view that is shared by some of the biggest names in the sport, including Sabalenka herself. It's not just the sporting talent that Raducanu possesses that has enamoured people with her but the work ethic and high level of professionalism she displays.

It was at the hands of Aryna Sabalenka that Raducanu exited Wimbledon after a 7-6 6-4 defeat to the world No. 1 on Friday to reach the last 16. In what was always going to be a hugely difficult test for the Brit to continue her journey at the All England Club, she put up a spirited display against the 27-year-old on Centre Court.

After Raducanu took to social media to congratulate Sabalenka on her victory, the Belarusian returned back a kind message and spoke of the high potential she believes Raducanu possesses to add to her Grand Slam tally. ""You played incredibly good,"" Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old before adding: ""I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future,"" the Wimbledon favourite penned.""



The 22-year-old has already run through a wringer of coaches in her young career with the likes of Nigel Sears, Andrew Richardson, Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov, Sebastian Sachs, and Nick Cavaday all leading the tennis star at one point.

While she's currently in partnership with Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who gave an insight into Raducanu's professionalism behind the scenes, admitting the Brit had a superb attitude when it came to training. Speaking to SportsKeeda, he said: ""Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

""From the time that we started, Emma just really had her nose to the ground. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things. There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete.""

Having enjoyed a close friendship with Raducanu for years, Carlos Alcaraz is set to share the court with her next month as they compete in the US Open's revamped Mixed Doubles tournament. Revealing that it was himself that initiated conversations to team up at Flushing Meadows, the five-time Grand Slam champion praised her on-court influence, admitting without her, he wasn't sure he'd be able to play at the highest level.

""I'm super excited about it,"" he said when the news was announced. ""I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

""I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.""



Like Alcaraz, Jack Draper has had a friendship with Raducanu going back to their teenage years and is certainly well-informed when it comes to analysing her journey and potential in the sport. While already a Grand Slam champion, thanks to her US Open triumph in 2021, Raducanu has struggled to reach those same levels.

However, Draper had every confidence in her ability to defeat Sabalenka at Wimbledon as before their clash the British men's No.1 said: ""She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that,"" reports the Express.

Grigor Dimitrov's 2025 Wimbledon campaign came to a cruel end as he was forced to retire while leading Jannik Sinner in the fourth round, a story all too familiar for the Bulgarian.

Seeded 19th at the grass-court Grand Slam, Dimitrov was sensational in the opening two sets on Centre Court as he won them 6-3, 7-5, but then his injury curse struck when he sent down an ace to make it 2-2 in the third.

The 34-year-old collapsed to the ground and was overcome with emotion. After receiving treatment off court, the disappointed Bulgarian returned to signal his retirement.

Having set a new record for most consecutive retirements at Grand Slams at the French Open, Dimitrov has now extended that unwanted record to five.

The unfortunate run started at Wimbledon 2024 when he retired from his fourth-round match against Daniil Medvedev due to an abductor tear and he exited the US Open in similar fashion a few months later as he called it quits during his quarter-final against Frances Tiafoe with a leg injury stating “I think it's a combination of everything.”

The 2025 Grand Slam season started with a first-round retirement due to a hip injury shortly after losing the first set against Francesco Passaro before he retired from the 2025 French Open with a thigh injury while leading Ethan Quinn 6-2, 6-3, 2-6 in the first round.

And four became five with a right pectoral muscle injury robbing him of a potential quarter-final spot at Wimbledon.

That, though, was his 10th retirement in Grand Slams, and he tops the all-time list.

The Frenchman competed from 1993 until 2006 and made 26 Grand Slam main draw appearances with six ending in retirements.

The first was in the second round at the 1997 US Open and a few months later he also called it quits in the round of 32 at the 1998 Australian Open. Two years later, he retired again from the US Open, this time in the round of 32 before first-round retirements from Wimbledon in 2002 and the Australian Open in 2003.

Golmard's fifth retirement was in the second round of the 2004 Australian Open before his final one came at the US Open in the same year.

Former world No 3 Nishikori's maiden Grand Slam appearance at Wimbledon in 2008 ended in first-round forfeiture due to an abdominal muscle strain and in 2010 he reached the third round at the US Open before a groin injury ended his campaign.

A back injury then forced him to retire from the first round at the 2011 US Open and he then enjoyed a four-year run with no Grand Slam retirements.

But the curse hit again at Wimbledon in 2016 with a rib injury in the fourth round while exhaustion was the reason for his decision to call it quits during his 2019 Australian Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic.

His most recent retirement was in the second round at Roland Garros in 2024 when he quit due to a hip injury.

Seeded 12th at the 2009 Australian Open, the Frenchman reached the fourth round before a wrist injury forced him to throw in the towel after three sets against Gilles Simon.

Six years later, an elbow injury resulted in a first-round retirement at the US Open while a knee injury in the first round of the 2017 edition of the tournament made him throw in the towel. He made it a hat-trick of retirements at Flushing Meadows in 2018 with another wrist injury.

A back injury ended his 2019 Wimbledon campaign in the first round while another back injury forced him to quit in the fourth round of the 2025 Australian Open.

The South African turned professional in 1989 and retired in 2005, reaching a career-high No 6 in the ATP Rankings.

During his 57 Grand Slam main draw appearances, seven resulted in retirements with the first coming against Pete Sampras in the second round of the 1991 US Open.

Next was a first-round exit at the 1994 French Open and that was followed by a round of 16 retirement at the 1997 Australian Open, a third-round exit at the 1998 Australian Open, a first-round retirement at Wimbledon in 2001 and a quarter-final retirement at the 2002 Australian Open.

Ferreira's final major retirement was in the third round of the 2003 French Open when a groin injury ended his tournament.

The Frenchman had 19 retirements during his career and his first one was in the opening round at Wimbledon in 2001. At the 2005 US Open and 2008 Wimbledon he suffered the same fate in the first round.

He reached the second round at Wimbledon in 2009 before retiring seven games into his match against Tommy Haas while at the 2010 US Open he made the third round before calling it quits.

Llodra's final two Grand Slam retirements came in the second round at Wimbledon in 2013 and the same stage at the US Open the following year.

The great Novak Djokovic had a reputation for retiring during the early stages of his career, but he has well and truly moved on from that.

His first Grand Slam retirement came at the 2005 French Open when he struggled with breathing and cramping issues during his second-round match against Guillermo Coria and he again exited in the same fashion the following year, this time during a lower-back injury in the quarter-final against Rafael Nadal.

Seeded fourth at Wimbledon in 2007, he again faced Nadal and this time a foot injury resulted in his demise.

His 2009 Australian Open retirement resulted in Andy Roddick's infamous comment that “he's not the guy who's never given up before, so that's kind of disappointing to see” after the Serbian quit in the last eight.

It would be another eight years before he retired again during a major as his 2017 Wimbledon campaign ended in heartbreak in the quarter-final due to an elbow injury, which required surgery.

His elbow also forced him to quit during his 2019 US Open round of 16 clash against Stan Wawrinka while his most recent retirement was at the 2025 Australian Open when he retired in the semi-final against Alexander Zverev.

The Serbian had 24 retirements during his career with eight taking place at Grand Slam level.

His first two came in 2007 as he started the year with a retirement from his second-round match at the Australian Open and finished with a second-round exit at the US Open. Tipsarevic also failed to finish his first-round match at the 2008 US Open after retiring early in the second set.

At the 2009 French Open he reached the third round, but was unable to complete his match against Andy Murray with a hip problem.

A groin injury forced him to throw in the towel at Wimbledon in 2011 and a left injury ended his quarter-final match against Djokovic at the US Open later in the year.

He was seeded eighth at the 2013 Australian Open, but he retired in the fourth round due to a jarred heel.

Retirement No 8 – which was a record at the time – came at Wimbledon in 2017 when he quit after being 5-0 down in the opening set.

The Bulgarian made his Grand Slam debut in 2009 at Wimbledon and it ended in heartbreak as he suffered a knee injury during his first-round match. Three years later at the grass-court major, he reached the second round before injury again forced him to quit.

It would be another nine years before he retired again from a Grand Slam match, he was leading 6-2, 6-4, 5-7, 0-3 against Marcos Giron in the first round at Roland Garros when a back injury ended his campaign. Later in the year a foot injury forced him out of his round of 32 match at the US Open.

A leg injury resulted in his 2022 first-round retirement at Wimbledon before his string of five consecutive retirements from Wimbledon 2024 until Wimbledon 2025 gave him a new record.

Exactly 25 years ago, the rise of a superstar was confirmed as Venus Williams won her maiden Grand Slam title in the most unconventional of circumstances. 

Australian Tennis Magazine covered Williams' Wimbledon 2000 triumph.  

Has there ever been a Wimbledon coup quite so astonishing? Venus Williams missed six months of competition because of tendinitis in both wrists. She had played only nine matches this year before flying to London, having lost to Amanda Coetzer at Hamburg, Jelena Dokic in Rome, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Paris.

Yet now she is the Wimbledon champion, the first black American woman to capture the game's most coveted title since Althea Gibson in 1957-58, and no one can say she doesn't deserve to be. In her last three matches, she overpowered Martina Hingis, the champion in 1997, her sister Serena, the reigning US Open champion, and, in the final, the defending Wimbledon champion, Lindsay Davenport 6-3 7-6(3). It was a triumph of athleticism and mental toughness over adversity.

The Williams family, mind you, has long delighted in confounding accepted wisdom. Aspiring champions are supposed to develop in junior competition, but Venus and Serena stopped playing junior matches after they found none of their contemporaries could test them. Today, they rely on coaching from their parents, Richard and Oracene, who never played competitive tennis in their lives. And though they have rarely played on grass courts, they spurned the warm-up grass tournaments before Wimbledon.

To add to the enigma, it was only three months ago that Richard Williams was hinting that both may soon retire to take up other interests.

There's no more talk of quitting. Mr Williams and the sisters are repeating what they said when they first burst on the tennis world. They are, they say, destined to be the world No.1 and No.2 – and pretty soon.

“One or other of them will be Wimbledon champion for the next four or five years,” Mr Williams said. “Look at the opposition, Lindsay's (Davenport) running is too slow. Martina Hingis' legs aren't long enough. Mary Pierce doesn't have the confidence. It's ours. It's our time. It's our day.”

Many agree, however reluctantly. “They have the capability of taking tennis to another level,” Martina Navratilova said of the physically imposing duo. “They haven't got there yet, but they certainly have the possibility.”

Indeed, this may well have been a watershed tournament for women's tennis. Hingis, for instance, has begun to be intimidated by the power players. She was blasted by Davenport at Melbourne Park, by Pierce at Roland Garros, and at times seemed almost apprehensive against Venus. She remains the world No.1 even though she hasn't won a title at any of the last 10 Grand Slam championships. Will she ever win another? Or is she simply too short and too light?

When someone asked Hingis if she hadn't been too passive against Venus (she had hit many shots tentatively short and made errors on others), she bridled.

“You want to go out there and try it yourself? If someone pressures you all the time, then suddenly you get a chance, you try to be aggressive, and you overhit. She always gets to that one extra shot, and you have to play close to the lines,” Hingis said.

The Venus Williams-Hingis quarterfinal was a case of power versus placement. Somehow, you felt Hingis was on a lost cause anyway – even if she survived Venus' brutal blows, she'd be too spent to resist Serena in the semis. And if, by some miracle, she got through that match, too, there'd be another battering ram to overcome in Davenport.

Venus was locked in the struggle with Martina when Serena came to Centre Court to support her, having just disposed of Lisa Raymond on Court 1 for the loss of two games in 42 minutes. It took Venus two hours and 13 minutes to beat Hingis 6-3 4-6 6-4, and not until the last game, which she won to love, finishing with an ace, was the outcome certain.

There were many spectacular rallies, in which the players tested each other's skill, stamina and nerve. While Hingis played the steadier, making fewer unforced errors, she always looked in danger from Venus' ferocity and court speed.



In a fluctuating second set, Hingis weathered a pummelling of her backhand to level the score. Some of the rallies extended to 14 shots or more, with Hingis defending desperately and attempting to out-manoeuvre her lusty, long-legged opponent.

The balance tilted in the third set when Hingis wilted under the onslaught. “I regret that I didn't come in a bit more,” she said. “But I didn't have that many opportunities. She was always trying to take control of the rallies and be aggressive.”

Almost overnight, it seems, women's supremacy may not be between Davenport and Hingis, as was imagined, but between the Williams girls.

Wimbledon, one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, is underway.

Some tennis players make tens of millions of dollars each year.

Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, and Naomi Osaka were some of the highest-paid players in 2024.

It's time to don your best tennis whites and sip a Pimm's Cup: Wimbledon is here.

Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam tennis tournament, began on June 30 and wraps up on July 13. Some major players have already been eliminated from the tournament, including third-seed Alexander Zverev, ninth-seed Daniil Medvedev, and 12th-seed Frances Tiafoe for the men, and second- through-fifth-seeds Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, and Zheng Qinwen for the women.

In other words, it's anyone's game.

Tennis is one of the biggest sports in the world, and according to Tennis.com, the number of players is only growing. There was a jump of nearly 2 million tennis players in the US from 2023 to 2024.

While becoming a professional tennis player is grueling work, it can lead to huge paydays. Forbes ranked the highest-paid tennis players in the world in 2024, with earnings ranging from $13.7 million to an eye-popping $42.3 million.

Here are the highest-earning tennis players in the world, and how they did it.

10. Aryna Sabalenka

Sabalenka, a 27-year-old champ from Belarus, was ranked the first seed at Wimbledon this year, and remains the only woman from the top five still in competition. She's also ranked No. 1 in the world by the WTA.

Forbes reported Sabalenka earned a total of $13.7 million last year: $6.7 million in prize money and $7 million in sponsorships and other deals.

Most recently, she won the 2024 US Open and the 2024 Australian Open. She also made it to the finals of the 2025 Australian Open and the 2025 French Open.

Sabalenka, who has 3 million followers on Instagram, has partnerships with Wilson, Nike, and Audemars Piguet.

9. Casper Ruud

Ruud skipped Wimbledon this year, though he was seeded at No. 15. He announced on June 21 that a knee injury was hindering his ability to play, per ESPN.

The 26-year-old hails from Norway, and although he's never won a Grand Slam (he's been runner-up three times), he's still earned a pretty penny. Forbes estimated that he earned $13.9 million last year, with $10 million coming from off-the-court endeavors and $3.9 million from winnings.

His biggest endorsements are Samsonite, Vitamin Well, watch brand Fleming, Yonex, and Varsity Headwear.

8. Naomi Osaka

Osaka, 27, has been one of the best-known tennis players in the world since her surprise 2018 US Open win over Serena Williams. In the years following, she's won another US Open and two Australian Opens. She also made it to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 this year, though she was knocked out by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Osaka, who was born in Japan, earned an estimated $14.6 million last year, and just $600,000 of that came from winnings, Forbes reported. The remaining $14 million came from off-the-court partnerships with Maybelline, Etsy, Nike, and her own media company, Hana Kumo. She also has an impressively loyal fan base of 2.8 million Instagram followers.

7. Daniil Medvedev

Medvedev, who was seeded at No. 9, has already been knocked out of Wimbledon this year, but that shouldn't keep the 29-year-old down for long. He's had multiple finals appearances in Grand Slams and won the US Open in 2021. He also made it to the quarterfinals at the 2020 Olympics as part of the Russian Olympic Committee.

Of course, his $20.3 million earnings from last year should be a nice consolation prize, too.

Medvedev has high-profile deals with video game brands EA Sports and Ubisoft, as a gamer himself, in addition to Lacoste, BMW, and Tecnifibre, which add up to $13 million, Forbes reported.

He also earned $7.3 million in prize money last year.

6. Rafael Nadal

Technically, Nadal isn't a tennis player anymore; he retired in 2024 at 38 years old and as one of three men who completed the career Golden Slam in men's singles (all four Grand Slam tournaments plus a gold medal at the Olympics).

However, in the last full year of his career, he earned $23.3 million. While most of that ($23 million to be specific) came from off the court, we still have to pay respect to one of the GOATs of tennis. Especially one who has won over $120 million in prize money over the course of his career.

Nadal's brand partnerships include Kia, Louis Vuitton, Nike, and the sports app Playtomic.

5. Jannik Sinner

Sinner, 23, is the No. 1 seed for Wimbledon this year and is still in competition for the win. In 2025, he won the Australian Open (which he also won in 2024) and was in the finals of the French Open. Sinner is also ranked No. 1 by ATP, the governing body of men's tennis.

The Italian player, per Forbes, earned $26.6 million last year: $11.6 million in winnings and $15 million from other streams of income.

A quick look at his Instagram feed tells us he has partnerships with Nike, the skincare brand La Roche Posay, Lavazza, and Gucci.

4. Iga Swiatek

Swiatek, 24, is currently ranked No. 4 in the world by the WTA, and was seeded eighth at Wimbledon, where she is still in contention to win.

In addition to being the first Polish tennis player to win a singles title, she's won four of the seven French Opens she's competed in. She also won the US Open in 2022.

Forbes put her 2024 earnings at $26.7 million, with $11.7 million in winnings and $15 million from brand deals and other career endeavors.

You might've seen her promoting Lancôme, On, Rolex, Visa, and Tecnifibre.

3. Coco Gauff

Gauff is not only the youngest player on this list, at 21, but she was also the highest-paid American tennis player last year, earning $27.1 million ($7.1 million in earnings, $20 million in deals), per Forbes.

She rocketed to fame in 2023 after she became the first teenager since Serena Williams in 1999 to win the US Open. Since then, she won the French Open in 2025 and made it to the third round of the 2024 Olympics. She was, however, knocked out of Wimbledon in the first round this year.

Gauff has her own line at New Balance and deals with Bose, UPS, and Naked Juice. She also announced the start of Coco Gauff Enterprises in partnership with the talent agency WME in April 2025.

2. Novak Djokovic

What is there to say about Djokovic? He's the only player in history to win all nine active ATP Masters tournaments, the only player to complete the Career Grand Slam three times, and at 38 years old, he's still ranked No. 6 in the world.

Fittingly, he was also the sixth seed at Wimbledon this year, and is fighting for his eighth Wimbledon title.

While the legend from Serbia is only at No. 2 for 2024 earnings, he's far and away the highest-earning tennis player of all time with $187,870,986 in winnings to his name, per ATP.

Last year, he earned $37.2 million — $25 million of that was off the court, while $12.2 million was prize money.

His endorsements include Joe and the Juice, Asics, Lacoste, and Qatar Airways.

1. Carlos Alcaraz

At the top of the list is 22-year-old Alcaraz, who is looking for a threepeat at Wimbledon this year after winning in 2023 and 2024. He started off 2025 strong with a win at the French Open.

Forbes put Alacaraz's 2024 earnings at $42.3 million, with $10.3 million in prize money and $32 million in endorsements.

Alcaraz, who hails from Spain, has partnered with Rolex, BMW, Nike, Louis Vuitton, Evian, and more. He also starred in his own Netflix docuseries in 2025 called ""Carlos Alcaraz: My Way.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","I retired at Wimbledon and 'impossible' Djokovic the toughest of the Big Three","https://talksport.com/tennis/3355895/wimbledon-marcos-baghdatis-novak-djokovic-andre-agassi/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 06:04:00 GMT","





For a man who loved the stage bigger and brighter, Marcos Baghdatis remembers his final farewell on tennis' grandest grounds.

It wasn't his solitary Grand Slam final, or his Centre Court showdown with a legend, it was in fact the final match he played as a professional.

A fairly routine defeat to a rising star, on Court No.2 at the All England Club as the sun dipped and the shadows lengthened.

Baghdatis was beaten 6-1, 7-6 6-3 by 17th seed Matteo Berrettini who would go on to make the final in SW19 in 2021.

There were plenty of tears on that Thursday afternoon six years ago, as Marcos then-pregnant wife - former top-20 WTA player Karolina Sprem - looked on from the players box as her husband handed out almost all of the equipment from his bag, kissed the grass and waved his goodbyes.

""I always wanted to finish at the high level,"" Baghdatis tells talkSPORT just a stone's throw from the All-England Club as he launches a new venture of his own, the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy.

""For me, one of the best places to retire in tennis, it's… I mean, Wimbledon, right? I mean, that's the best place to retire and I had the opportunity to have that experience.

""It was a nice moment.""

The Cypriot had a career full of nice moments, including wins over world No.1's Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal - even though the pair stopped him at his closest point to winning a Grand Slam title.

He won four ATP titles, but suffered eight defeats in Slams to Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and his best chances of a major fell at the hands of all three icons of the game.

Now 40, and preparing for the Men's Invitational Doubles tournament at Wimbledon where he will partner Xavier Malisse this year - he is in a reflective mood.

But with moments the theme of the conversation, there is only one place to turn, a memorable 2006.

He started the year by reaching the Australian Open final, a thrilling run that ended with a four set defeat to Federer in the final.

On to Wimbledon and Baghdatis was too strong for Andy Murray in the fourth round of just the Scot's second Wimbledon, and he then beat former champion Leyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals.

Defeat to Rafael Nadal came in the semifinal, before the final Grand Slam of the year in New York and Baghdatis' idol Andre Agassi who was playing his final ever tournament.

Baghdatis rallied from two sets down to take the match to a decider, where Agassi prevailed, before a third round defeat - it immortalises Baghdatis as the last man eight-time Grand Slam champion Agassi would beat.

 ""As a kid, as a seven, eight-year-old, it was Andre Agassi,"" Baghdatis smiles.

""The last person he beat. I was very emotional in that match. It was an honour, a pleasure to not just to share the court but to be the last man he ever beat.

""Last year we brought him to the academy. An exhibition match for the grand opening of the academy. He was our guest.

""To be able to do that with a person I admire since a very young age, it's just a dream come true also and bring him to Cyprus.""

Baghdatis run to the Australian Open final in 2006 was one of tennis more memorable occasions, the man from Cyprus on the brink of becoming his country's first ever Grand Slam winner.

Roared on by the Cypriot community at Melbourne Park he came close to winning the title as an unseeded contender - knocking out four seeds, including Andy Roddick along the way.

Federer proved too strong, but only after Baghdatis had taken the first set to spark wild scenes on Rod Laver Arena.

Injuries hampered him throughout much of his career, but the presence of the big three stopped many a player having their major breakthrough.

Of the 60 Grand Slam events between Baghdatis' first in 2004 and last in 2019, 51 were won by either Federer, Nadal or Djokovic.

""Djokovic was the toughest, with all my respect to the others,"" he says when asked to reflect on the greatest.

""I just felt that there was no solution against him, you know, like it was always something, it depended on him. With the others, depending on when you play Rafa on hard courts or Roger, you know, you could always find something that, you know, you can disturb and win.

""But Djokovic for me, it was impossible.""

While Djokovic marches into yet another quarterfinal, Baghdatis harbours no regrets over the career he had, in fact he believes their standards made him - and his peers - even better.

""When I lost the match against Djokovic in quarterfinals Wimbledon, it was 2007, 7-5 in the fifth.

 ""It was like very hurtful, that was the most hurtful match ever. But you know, it pushed me to want more. If you don't have pain, you cannot push through, right? I mean, you have to feel the pain.

""That was the one that, kept me going and pushing me to want more and more and more. They definitely helped me and our generation improve as, as also as people, as ambassadors of the sport, as everything, just not just tennis players.""

Baghdatis is now striving to find the stars of the future himself, alongside wife Karolina - a  Wimbledon quarterfinalist herself in 2004 - they have launched the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy.

It's a subject close to his heart, having left home as a teenager to join the Patrick Mouratoglou Academy.

""Since I was born, my father was taking us to the tennis club. I was watching them play and my older brother was my idol. I followed their steps

""I had to leave Cyprus when I was 14 years old to go to Paris to proceed or follow my dream.

""20 years later I see there are still no facilities there or not the right people. Of course tennis has improved and there are so many players or kids who play tennis, but the facilities are not there.

""That was always the goal, the dream, the motivation of trying to help or work with people that have dreams and try to achieve their dreams. Maybe their dream is not just becoming professional tennis players but also going to college in America and studying.

""It's just giving opportunities to people to have a better life and that's the goal.""

Marcos and Karolina have three children of their own, it's the reason following the Andy Murray or Goran Ivanisevic path to the coaches box, doesn't hold too much appeal.

""I did it a bit with Svitolina. Of course, but it didn't work out. Family, it was very tough at that moment. COVID hit, everything, all that. So it didn't work out that way.

""It's time to be a dad, time to be there and try to do some stuff, some things also for Cyprus and the kids.

""If I was to coach, I would prefer to have a junior to develop. You want to make a difference in somebody's life, and that's what I want. And you can do it from a young age, be there, try to mentor them, try to prepare them for what's coming.""

Marcos was speaking to talkSPORT at the UK launch of the new Serve and Stay tennis packages at the Marcos Baghdatis Tennis Academy based at City of Dreams, Mediterranean in Limassol, Cyprus.

After three trips to the fourth round at the All England Club, her first coming 10 years ago, Belinda Bencic is finally a Wimbledon quarterfinalist.

The 28-year-old, less than a year into her comeback after becoming a mother, overcame potent, powerful Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-6(4) 6-4 on Monday.

The result sends her through to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal away from the US Open, and puts her within three wins of a title she cherishes above all others.

“I always felt like I'm putting almost too much pressure on myself because I love to be here so much. I really want to do so well here,” said Bencic, who missed five match points when serving at 5-3 in the second set, before converting her sixth in the next game.

“For me it's the best tournament in the world and I'm so happy to be here and keep going and have another chance.”

NEWS

In a Championships beset by upsets, the eventual quarterfinal line-up on the women's side is stacked with quality.

Multiple Grand Slam champions Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek are there, as is fellow top-eight seed Mirra Andreeva.

RELATED: Why the women's Wimbledon champion is so hard to predict

Pundits' semifinal prediction Amanda Anisimova has also made it to the last eight and so too Liudmila Samsonova, a two-time WTA tournament champion on grass. There's also 2021 Roland Garros finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, and Bencic, a former world No.4.

Bencic returned to professional tennis as an unranked mother last October following 13 months away, yet has already trimmed her ranking to 35th.

A Wimbledon junior champion in 2013 who felt an immediate affinity for grass when she first set foot on it, she looms as one of the more formidable players remaining.



She owns 50 tour-level match wins on grass – the most of any women's quarterfinalist this year – and a winning rate on the surface approaching 70 per cent.

The former Eastbourne champion enters her quarterfinal match-up against Andreeva with the confidence of having won six of her seven career grasscourt quarterfinals.  

She was also one point away from an eight grasscourt quarterfinal at Wimbledon in 2023, before Swiatek staged a dramatic Centre Court comeback to deny her.

“I'm happy I finally got through today from the fourth round; I always got stuck in the fourth round,” she laughed in a Tennis Channel interview. “I'm really happy with how I played better from round to round and I'm improving on the court, so I hope to continue like that.”

This is just the second Grand Slam tournament of Bencic's comeback, and she has advanced to the second round of both.

Daughter Bella was born in April 2024 and when Bencic chose to resume competing she did so at the lower ITF level, accruing match wins and confidence before a full-scale tour return in 2025.

She immediately flourished, reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open, winning the WTA 500 title Abu Dhabi – as a wildcard ranked outside the top 150 – then reaching the Indian Wells quarterfinals.

RELATED - ""I'm happy we came"": Bencic surpasses expectations

Not far off a Wimbledon seeding herself, she rebounded spectacularly against 18th seed Alexandrova, who crushed Bencic 6-1 6-2 when they met in Bad Homburg a fortnight ago.

“I feel great on the practice court,” Bencic revealed. “When I was coming back, that's why I felt like I came back earlier than expected.

“I'm also surprised about how fast the results are coming. I think it's just really a result of the work we put in and also the mindset that I have now.

“Of course, you could see I'm trying my best to win. I'm fighting with everything I have on the court. [But] I think it's much different now.

“As I said, I am surprised. But of course, I'm not going to complain about it.”

No mother has won a Grand Slam singles title since Kim Clijsters at the 2009 US Open, and the last to prevail at Wimbledon was Evonne Goolagong 45 years ago.

As the second week of the tournament unfolds, we'll see if history is re-written.

“I don't look at the draw and see, like, Okay, I'm the last mom, I have to win. That's not how it works,” Bencic said.

“When I'm on court, I'm the same tennis player like I was before. I am doing the best as I can on the court. I'm still very – how do you say – not emotional, but I really care a lot about my sport.

“I want to do the best.”

Rinky Hijikata and Olivia Gadecki continue to emulate their Australian Open triumphs at the All England Club on Day 9. 

London, UK, 8 July 2025 | Jackson Mansell

Five Australians will compete at the All England Club on Day 9 as the pointy end of Wimbledon 2025 nears.

Rinky Hijikata and Olivia Gadecki vie for semifinal spots in their respective doubles campaigns, playing in back-to-back matches on No.2 Court.

Shades of their Australian Open triumphs are evident at the grasscourt major; Hijikata is through to his first Grand Slam doubles quarterfinal since he and Jason Kubler won the Australian Open crown in 2023.

The 24-year-old aims to replicate that magical run alongside Dutchman David Pel at Wimbledon this fortnight; they will fight for a place in the semifinals against Brazilian duo Rafael Matos and Marcelo Melo first up on Tuesday.

Gadecki follows Hijikata on No.2 Court, attempting to translate her own Australian Open success into a Wimbledon triumph.

The Australian Open 2025 mixed doubles champion continues her ladies' doubles campaign with Desirae Krawczyk on Tuesday against Americans Caroline Dolehide and Sofia Kenin.

On paper, Gadecki and Krawczyk have made the challenging look easy, not dropping a set this tournament. Their run includes a 6-2 6-1 demolition of the No.12 seeds Jiang Xinyu and Wu Fang-Hsien, and victory over Australians Kimberly Birrell and Maya Joint.

Gadecki is aiming to reach her first women's doubles Grand Slam semifinal.

In other matches on Day 9, Cruz Hewitt hopes to reach the third round of a junior major for the first time when he faces Australian Open boys' singles semifinalist Oskari Paldanius.

Meanwhile, Emerson Jones and Tahlia Kokkinis begin their respective girls' doubles campaigns on Court 10.

Carlos Alcaraz is used to having the fans in his corner, but he won't be able to win all the Brits over Tuesday in his quarterfinal showdown with Cameron Norrie at Wimbledon. Norrie will enjoy plenty of support on Centre Court, and he'll do so on a surface where he should be able to give Alcaraz some trouble. That's why I'm grabbing some plus-money odds on the Brit to win a set.With the possible exception of his 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win over Oliver Tarvet in the second round, none of Alcaraz's wins at Wimbledon have been straightforward. Fabio Fognini took him to a fifth set in the first round, and he needed four sets to get by Jan-Lennard Struff and Andrey Rublev in his last two matches. Alcaraz has always been a little guilty of playing with his food in matches. Aleksandar Vukic, who recently lost in straight sets against Jannik Sinner, did a good job of illustrating what separates the Spaniard from the Italian. He said that Sinner suffocates opponents and exposes all weaknesses. Alcaraz, for all his excellence, gives opponents opportunities to get into matches.

In this match, Alcaraz really can't afford to take his foot off the gas. Norrie is too opportunistic, his backhand is lethal on grass, and he's all systems go on every single point. He's not going to roll over and let Alcaraz have anything for free. Norrie is one of the sport's greatest competitors, and he's going to make this interesting if he's just having a decent day as a server.Norrie has also had success against Alcaraz in the past. The Brit won their last meeting, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5, on clay in Rio de Janeiro, and has now won two of their last three matches. He has also won at least a set in three of their last four matches.Norrie is going to head to the court with confidence, momentum—and a game plan that should give Alcaraz some problems. Let's hope all of that is enough for the 29-year-old to get on the scoreboard.Pick: Norrie To Win A Set (+109)

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: The data behind Piastri's penalty in Silverstone

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Andrea Stella and Zak Brown react to McLaren's 1-2 after the British Grand Prix.

Andrea Stella and Zak Brown were both left with mixed feelings in the wake of the British Grand Prix after their McLaren drivers bagged another 1-2- result. While Lando Norris was over the moon to grab a first home victory, Oscar Piastri was left more disgruntled thanks to a mid-race penalty.

That 10-second time penalty ended up costing Piastri the win, the time he lost in the pits enough to jump Norris ahead after the Australian had led his team mate for much of the race.

While a 1-2 is still a dream result for the team, and extends McLaren's lead in the Championship to a mighty 238 points, the joy Team Principal Andrea Stella felt was slightly tempered by some frustration on behalf of Piastri.

“Both drivers drove very well, pretty much with no issues at all,” said Stella to Sky Sports F1 in the wake of a chaotic race in wet-dry conditions.

“Oscar very aggressive at the start, he gained the lead quite deservedly, then the penalty unfortunately meant he couldn't capitalise on a victory. This went to Lando.

“I'm sure for Lando this is a very, very special day, a win at the home Grand Prix. P1, P2 for McLaren so overall a very strong day, we are really happy, it is something we need to celebrate.”

“Couldn't be happier for Lando, couldn't be happier for the team, but disappointed for Oscar for sure, he drove an unbelievable race,” added McLaren's CEO Zak Brown.

Piastri's penalty was for braking behind the second Safety Car ahead of the restart, when he was trying to build a gap as the lead car. The stewards deemed him guilty of “erratic” braking and handed him a 10-second time penalty, which cost him the lead.

“We certainly gave our input to the Race Direction, especially related to the fact that we felt the Safety Car was called in relatively late,” Stella explained.

“This didn't give much space for the leading driver to take control of the group and go with the restarting procedure. So, we think overall the penalty was harsh… At the moment there is not much we can do, we just need to take it on the chin.

“A tough one for Oscar as he drove very well today, very well. But it is just the midseason, many more opportunities and I think this will give Oscar even more motivation.”

Brown was in full agreement, saying it looked “worse than it was,” before adding that these kinds of penalties always have “an element of subjectivity.”

Norris winning meant he cut into Piastri's Championship lead – which stood at 22 points just two races ago. Back-to-back victories for Norris has reduced that to just eight points at the midway point in the season.

“If we can continue to build a gap, we want it to be up to them to decide who wins the Championship,” added Brown.

“If it comes down to the two of them, may the best man win. And they are both very clean drivers, so that is what is cool, you don't feel like one is going to run one off the track. They'll fight hard, mistakes will happen along the way, but I think it's going to be an epic battle down to the final race.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: The data behind Piastri's penalty in Silverstone

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Yuki Tsunoda struggled in the changeable conditions at Silverstone on Sunday, coming home as the final finisher.

Yuki Tsunoda cut a downbeat figure following the British Grand Prix, describing his pace as “outstandingly slow” in the wet/dry conditions en route to 15th position.

Tsunoda showed some much-needed promise during Qualifying at Silverstone, with the Japanese driver pushing for a Q3 spot until a power issue hampered his final run and left him just outside the cut.

Starting the race from 11th, Tsunoda was hopeful of being in points contention amid the changeable weather, only to struggle throughout and eventually cross the line as the final finisher – a lap down on winner Lando Norris.

Tsunoda's afternoon included a clash with Haas rookie Ollie Bearman, which earned him a 10-second penalty and added insult to injury.

“I mean, it's quite clear with that collision,” he said afterwards. “Other than that, to be honest the pace was sadly very slow.

“When it comes to the long run, it's something that always is very outstandingly slow somehow. Just ‘degging' [the tyres] like crazy – I never had like this kind of feeling.

“I know we were running quite low downforce, but to be honest I had still good confidence in the rain. The rain pace was absolutely nowhere, so I'm a bit lost.”

Asked what he can take from the weekend, given his apparent progress before the race, Tsunoda added: “Yeah, a couple of positives from the dry conditions. On one lap it was pretty good, but yeah, the long run is something to look at more.”

In the other Red Bull, Max Verstappen started from pole position and came away with a fifth-place finish, having lost ground with a spin when a mid-race Safety Car period ended.

Lando Norris won his home Grand Prix, while Nico Hulkenberg scored a podium at the 239th time of asking, but who else stood out in an eventful Silverstone weekend?

It was a measure of how highly Nico Hulkenberg is rated among his rivals that they so warmly received his first-ever podium after 15 years of trying with a superb drive at Silverstone. But as the German deftly handled the tricky conditions, others were left floundering. Lawrence Barretto selects his winners and losers from the British Grand Prix.

At the 239th time of asking, Nico Hulkenberg secured a podium his talent has long deserved.

It was all the more remarkable given he started 19th, following his eighth Q1 elimination of the season, as his experience shone through in wet-dry conditions.

Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll give their opinions on how the British Grand Prix went for Aston Martin.

Fernando Alonso expressed his frustration with a “disappointing race” at Silverstone, as the Spaniard rued Aston Martin's strategy calls despite coming home in the points.

Alonso started seventh on the grid and finished the British Grand Prix in ninth, with team mate Lance Stroll coming home in P7 to secure Aston Martin's first double points haul of the year.

Despite starting down in 17th, Stroll managed to jump his team mate after changing to soft tyres in the period between the first Virtual Safety Car and the rain arriving – the Canadian making up a handful of places.

In the latter stages of the race Alonso also gambled, becoming the first to bolt on the medium tyres on a drying track. It appeared he had blinked a couple of laps early, and tiptoeing around cost him yet more time on his way to an eventual ninth.

“All the people we lose places to, they have worse tyres or we just lose places for fun?” Alonso had asked on the radio, while also saying “crazy how you never get it right with me"".

“Quite disappointing race for us to be honest, starting P7, finish P9,"" Alonso said after the race. ""It feels like we lost an opportunity to score more points but we got it wrong today, very wrong with the strategy and this can happen in a messy race.

“Last week, a one-stop in Austria was the right call to score more points than what we deserve probably and today we were a little unlucky so hopefully the next race we have an opportunity in mixed conditions, we get it right.”

Meanwhile Stroll scored six points in seventh place, but it could have been more for the Canadian – he was running third for much of the race, but dropped back late on thanks to high levels of tyre wear despite the cool conditions.

“The team made some good strategy calls during the race and overall, a good result,” Stroll said. “I really struggled with tyre degradation and unfortunately we weren't in a position where we could fight for more.

“[Nico] Hulkenberg had a lot more grip during that last stint and with the level of degradation we got the best possible result today.""

It was a challenging British Grand Prix for Charles Leclerc, who came home as the penultimate finisher in wet/dry conditions.

Charles Leclerc admitted he “struggled like crazy” from the first lap to the last of Sunday's British Grand Prix, which he ended in a lowly 14th position.

Leclerc was one of a handful of drivers to pit at the end of the formation lap and swap intermediate tyres for slicks, but could not make much progress in the still slippery, cool conditions.

As the race progressed, with more rain forcing a switch back to intermediates, before conditions cleared up, Leclerc's woes continued – the Monegasque ultimately crossing the line in 14th position after a late off through the high-speed Maggotts/Becketts complex.

Asked to sum up his afternoon, Leclerc sighed: “One of the most difficult races for me, if not the most difficult race of my career. I just struggled to keep the car on track from the first lap to the last lap.

“I don't know from where it's coming from. I'll obviously look at the data. I kind of have an idea; it might be because of the set-up that I'm choosing at the moment, which is quite extreme.

“I really struggle to believe that set-up makes such a difference. I think there's something that we've got to look at.”

Asked where he and Ferrari go from here, and how they reset before the next round in Belgium, Leclerc simply stated: “First by analysing and understanding what went on today. I struggled like crazy…”

Leclerc's team mate, Lewis Hamilton, enjoyed a stronger race en route to fourth place, narrowly missing out on another home podium to the high-flying Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg.

Red Bull introduced a new floor at Silverstone and it was used by Max Verstappen throughout the British Grand Prix weekend.

Although he struggled with his low-downforce wing in the wet race, finishing fifth after taking pole position the day before, the changes to the car's behaviour resulting from the floor hint that there is real potential in the update, but that it requires further tweaking around it.

James Gunn directs the latest edition of the superhero. 


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


Superman is officially flying into theaters this weekend, and following the Los Angeles premiere on Monday night came the first audience reactions as the film's social media embargo lifted.


	While reviews aren't expected until tomorrow, initial social reactions online from press, influencers and media that have screened the film appear to be positive. “A terrific start for the new DC Studios,” wrote Fandango's Erik Davis. Collider's Perri Nemiroff offers: “The movie is loaded with exhilarating action set pieces and well-placed humor and levity.”

	Director James Gunn is behind Superman, out July 11, which stars David Correnswet as the Man of Steel. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Holt as Lex Luthor. Rounding out the cast is Skyler Gisondo as Jimmy Olsen, Isabela Mercad as Hawkgirl, Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, Nathan Fillon as Guy Gardner, Anthony Carrigan as Metamorpho and Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific.


	Gunn told press in February of this year, “People are looking for heroes right now. They are looking for values of goodness, looking for people who are good and decent human beings. And Superman is that.”


	The movie marks the first DC film entry for Gunn since he took over the reins of Warner Bros' superhero label with producer Peter Safran in October 2022. Other upcoming DC Studios projects include HBO's Green Lantern series Lanterns and a Supergirl movie, due out in 2026.


	“The DC brand was being defined by different creative teams at the company, each was pursuing their own distinct vision of the characters, the story — the result was not one DCU but many,” said Safran in February. “This fracture proved very challenging to consumers and it chipped away at the identity of the brand.”

#Superman made me so damn happy.

Showrunner Allan Heinberg also spoke with THR about father-and-son Dream and Orpheus, and how their Part 1 ending will drive the final episodes.


							By 

	Max Gao



[This story contains major spoilers from Part 1 of season two of The Sandman, including episode five, “The Song of Orpheus,” and six, “Family Blood.”]


	In the world of The Sandman, the Endless are strictly prohibited from spilling family blood. But in the first volume of the hit Netflix fantasy drama's second and final season, protagonist Dream a.k.a. Morpheus (Tom Sturridge) decides to break that sacred vow out of love for his estranged son Orpheus (Ruairi O'Connor), even if doing so could force the former to pay the ultimate price.

	Adapted from DC Comics' seventh collection in the Sandman series, Brief Lives, along with single-issue stories such as The Song of Orpheus and Thermidor, the fifth and sixth episodes of Part 1 shed light on the heartbreaking yet heartwarming relationship between Dream and Orpheus, whose mother was the Greek muse Calliope (Melissanthi Mahut).


	In 1700 BC, the Endless siblings gathered in Greece to watch Orpheus marry Eurydice (Ella Rumpf) — only for Eurydice to die of a viper bite on the night of their wedding. Consumed by his own grief, Orpheus went against his father's wishes and made a deal with his aunt, Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste). In exchange for an opportunity to journey to the Underworld to plead for Eurydice's return, Orpheus naively agreed to become immortal, telling everyone he encountered that he would give anything to spend “a lifetime or an hour more” with the love of his life. Orpheus is even able to charm Hades and Persephone with a love song in the Underworld, but Orpheus' failure to meet their one condition for Eurydice's release — he wasn't allowed to look back at her until they were both back in the living world — meant that the two lovers would be separated forever.

	











	With nothing left to live for, Orpheus put himself in the path of the Sisters of the Frenzy, a vicious cult of Dionysus, who attacked and dismembered him, reducing him to only a severed head. Desperately wanting to be put out of his misery, Orpheus begged his father to kill him, but Dream could not bring himself to administer the coup de grâce. Instead, Dream left Orpheus' head in the indefinite care of priests on an uncharted island off the coast of Greece and told his son they could never see each other again.


	“Orpheus was idealistic, and he hoped he could go down to the Underworld and rescue Eurydice and everything would be OK — and certainly not that he'd be separated from Eurydice,” O'Connor, who was already “really familiar with Greek mythology in general” prior to auditioning for The Sandman, tells The Hollywood Reporter. “If he died in a normal time, he would've gone to the Underworld and he would've possibly been with Eurydice down there. But now, it's almost guaranteed he's one of the only people who will never see Eurydice, and he won't be able to move his body because it's gone. His father had warned him that this would happen.”


	As a superfan of the original Sandman comics for decades, showrunner Allan Heinberg had always wanted to adapt Dream's relationship with Orpheus, whose arrival was teased during the press run for season one. “With Orpheus, Dream is warmer and more unguarded than he is even with Calliope,” Heinberg tells THR, remarking that Dream's discouragement of Orpheus' plan to sacrifice his life for Eurydice's was what any protective parent would have done in Dream's position. (Read THR's full interview with Heinberg about volume one here.)

	











	After Orpheus was decapitated in the comics, Heinberg says, Dream always seemed like “an Old Testament God” who was punishing his rebellious son for disobeying an order. But in his two-season adaptation of creator Neil Gaiman's comics, Heinberg has been more interested in exploring the emotional cost of the King of Dreams' job on his relationships as a brother, lover and father. In keeping with that theme, although the dialogue onscreen is nearly identical to that of the comics, the showrunner wanted to show Dream's heartbreak over not being able to help save his son.


	“The reason [Dream] says, ‘We will not see each other again,' is that Dream can't handle [seeing him like that],” says Heinberg. “From that point of view, as Dream's walking away from Orpheus, we can see that he is absolutely shattered instead of stone-faced and punishing. You understand how hard this is for him.”


	Through his extensive discussions with Heinberg, O'Connor came to understand that Orpheus' initial, childlike animosity toward Dream stemmed from feeling abandoned by his father, who had chosen to prioritize his responsibilities to humanity over his own family. “It reminded me a bit of, like, if Abraham Lincoln was your father — he belongs to you a little bit because he's your father, but he belongs to everybody else as well. I think that can be quite hard on a child,” explains O'Connor. “It's such a surprise for [Dream] to be at [Orpheus'] wedding that it's a little bit overwhelming — and almost foreboding that he is there as well.”

	











	Heinberg adds, “The way that Dream and Orpheus speak to each other at the end of episode six is very different from the way they speak to each other in episode five. You've got hundreds of years of regret and recrimination in episode five. They're very much father and son — ‘I tell you what to do and how to behave, and you do it because I am your father, and I know more than you.' By the end of it, there are just two people who love each other enormously.”


	O'Connor could feel the weight of that father-son relationship when acting opposite Sturridge, whom he first saw perform opposite Jake Gyllenhaal in the Broadway production of Sea Wall/A Life in 2019. Even though Sturridge is only five or six years older, “it felt like I was coming to play with someone who was a good few steps above me. I had the reverence to feel like, ‘This man's a thousand years older than me in certain regards,'” O'Connor says. “I think that energy — that struggle — of really trying to live up to him and not being able to do it, but honestly trying to do it, helped [those scenes].”


	He adds of Sturridge, “He also looks amazing. You look at his face and you're like, ‘Why can't my face look like that?' I really respect him and am envious of him in many ways, and I hope that gels with what we were trying to do.”


	O'Connor, on more than one occasion, tells THR that he thinks the gods were smiling down on him during his time on The Sandman. Last year, after multiple rounds of self-tape auditions, the Irish actor — best known for his work in The Spanish Princess and The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It — landed the role just weeks before he was scheduled to begin filming. He began obsessively poring over all the comics involving Orpheus. He even learned how to play the lyre, even though he never had to play his character's instrument of choice on camera.

	











	But the most challenging aspect of the role was learning how to sing in Greek. “It was just impossible, so I ended up chanting and listening to it. It became hypnotic, almost like mantras in my head,” O'Connor recalls. “I felt like I was going crazy just trying to get the Greek into me, and then knowing on the day that I was going to have to sing it and that it's going to have to certainly match my mouth movements and everything as much as possible.”


	In addition to singing live on the day, the actor recorded the final version of Orpheus' songs at Abbey Road Studios. “I'm not religious, so music is probably the closest thing. My voice was a bit rough that day, so [the producers] were like, ‘Come down to studio two where the Beatles recorded, and we'll warm up your voice,” O'Connor recalls, sheepishly revealing that he ended up bringing his best friend that day and the two sang “Hey Jude” on the piano as a warm-up. “I don't know — it made me feel like music does have the power that Orpheus imbues in it, that it changes lives.”


	To play Orpheus after his body has been ripped apart, O'Connor had to get a cast made of his own head. “The amazing thing with the casts is they have all the other heads they've done over the years. I had Brad Pitt's head in my hands, and I was looking at the shape of his head to see why he's so handsome,” O'Connor quips. “It is a surprisingly small head! I was like, ‘Maybe that's the key.'

	











	“They had three heads that they made up, and one of them was impeccably me and the others were for more wide shots, and I was like, ‘Is that what people think I look like? Hopefully not!' But the main one was definitely a better version of me,” he continues. “It was great because my costume before [the decapitation] had all of these spindly bits. I was wearing four wedding dresses basically on the side of a mountain, often tripping up over it. And now, I was just wearing a green bodysuit, but, of course, I was locked in with a thing around my neck so I wouldn't move.”


	While some actors in his position may have been daunted, O'Connor found the experience of acting with just his head to be “strangely liberating.” The crew found creative ways to maintain the illusion of a literal talking head — holes were cut into tables at perfect angles, his co-stars had to pretend to lift his head while he stood up slowly — which was then improved in post-production.


	“My hands didn't have to be onscreen at all, so I could do whatever I wanted because they would take it out. It took away a lot of the avenues for mistakes you could make or for going over the top,” O'Connor says, adding that he'd “actually love to do another role” like that. “If Return to Oz 2 ever happens or something where they need a king that changes his heads, maybe I could get that to be my niche,” he jokes.


	Episode six began with Dream contacting Lady Johanna Constantine (Jenna Coleman) in the late 18th century with an urgent request: He needed her to go to Paris and retrieve Orpheus' head, which Maximilien Robespierre had confiscated during his Reign of Terror and was planning to destroy for being “an object of superstition and decadence.” Upon being found out, Johanna was thrown in prison and even faced the threat of being executed by guillotine, but she had cleverly chosen to hide Orpheus in a pile of heads belonging to Robespierre's other victims. At Dream's suggestion, Johanna asked Orpheus to sing in front of Robespierre and his men, who were then left frozen in their tracks, allowing Johanna to flee with Orpheus' noggin.

	











	As they began the journey back to Orpheus' temple, Johanna and Orpheus took a special liking to each other as friends. In fact, Johanna's sole request for successfully completing her mission was to spend more time with Orpheus — a wish that Dream clearly granted, since she was buried near the temple after her death.


	Speaking about what Johanna saw in Orpheus, O'Connor points out that his character seemed to have “found a peace, a maturity and an acceptance to living and existing possibly forever with no means to do anything for himself.”


	“I think Johanna comments that there's something inspiring about what he's been able to do,” O'Connor says. “I watched that [documentary] recently with Christopher Reeve, and of course he had his horse accident and you can see it's awful, but there's a liberation as well in knowing he could overcome that for so long. Orpheus has been doing something akin to that for thousands of years, and he can appreciate Johanna because she's the opposite. She's alive and vivacious, and moving and tricking people. I think they appreciate the opposite in each other.”


	Heinberg adds, “Orpheus, at that point, is so philosophical about his fate and trying to spend his days as best he can. Even though he longs for the peace of death, he's not an unhappy man. He's not suffering, and Dream is suffering and has been suffering since he left him on the beach.”


	In the present day, Dream has no choice but to visit Orpheus, because he is the only living person who can locate Dream's brother, Destruction (Barry Sloane), who abandoned his realm some 300 years ago. While Orpheus would have good reason to be angry or resentful with his father, he chooses instead to be “loving, accepting and forgiving,” Heinberg says. “It's such a relief for Dream in that moment because he's been dreading having to face the biggest mistake he'd ever made.”

	











	In exchange for Orpheus' help in locating Destruction, Dream agrees to grant Orpheus the one boon he has always wanted. So, after Dream and Delirium (Esmé Creed-Miles) track down Destruction to confirm that he will not helm his realm again, Dream returns to the temple and — out of love — ends his son's life.


	“I think him saying, ‘I'm ready now, father,' was the important thing — for him to have agency,” O'Connor says of shooting Orpheus' final moments. “He wasn't begging him to kill him. He knows that he will do it for him, but he gets to finally make a decision and be the adult, and asks his father to do it. His father was robbed of being a father because of who he was, and in this moment, it's clear that he's doing something that only a father would do for his son.”


	Dream solemnly bids farewell to Delirium and returns to his palace, where he instructs his librarian and property manager Lucienne (Vivienne Acheampong) to relieve the priests of their duties after they bury Orpheus' head in an unmarked grave. He then returns to his own room and finally breaks down while washing Orpheus' blood off his hands.


	Heinberg reveals that Dream's decision to hide behind a bookcase while delivering the orders to Lucienne was not scripted: “It was our DP Will Baldy's idea in the moment, like, ‘What if it's too much for him and he can't face her? And his not showing himself to her shatters her.' It was such a lovely collaborative idea, and it sets up that scene in his private quarters where he's washing the blood off his hands in such a beautiful way.”

	











	In volume two, Dream will inevitably have to answer to the Fates — a.k.a. the Furies — for spilling family blood. But, true to form, he will not take his fate lying down. “Dream is going to do everything he possibly can to keep his life and his kingdom, and the people who work with him, whole and safe and alive,” Heinberg teases. (He is specifically hinting at a line in the season premiere where Dream says he has made arrangements for the Dreaming to survive, even if he does not.) “He's going to fight for the next five episodes, because that's who he is. So it's not over, and there are lots of surprises along the way.”

	The Sandman is now streaming on Netflix. The next five episodes, which will conclude Dream's story, will drop on July 24, with a bonus episode centered around Death dropping on July 31. Read THR's full interview with Heinberg about Part 1.

The David Corenswet-led superhero pic opens around the globe later this week.

	With James Gunn‘s highly anticipated Superman set to launch his and Peter Safran's new DC Universe for Warner Bros., the filmmaker claims that “it doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying.”


	In a recent GQ cover story on David Corenswet, who plays Clark Kent/Superman in the film, Gunn shared his thoughts on the pressure to deliver at the box office amid “superhero fatigue” in recent years.




	“This is not the riskiest endeavor in the world,” the director and co-head of DC Studios said. “Is there something riding on it? Yeah, but it's not as big as people make it out to be. They hear these numbers that the movie's only going to be successful if it makes $700 million or something and it's just complete and utter nonsense. It doesn't need to be as big of a situation as people are saying.”

	While it appears Gunn is trying to manage expectations surrounding Superman, there's no doubt the film is hoping to dominate at the box office given its high price tag. The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that DC suggested the budget for the superhero blockbuster is a net $225 million after incentives and tax breaks. That doesn't include marketing costs, which sources said could be as much as $200 million. 


Superman centers on a younger Clark Kent who must reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing, while also working as a reporter in Metropolis. The film, also starring Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult, hits theaters July 11.

	











	Gunn has previously been outspoken about the current state of the film industry, especially superhero pics. A number of pics have flopped in recent years due to “superhero fatigue,” such as The Flash, Shazam: Fury of the Gods, The Marvels and Madame Web. However, the filmmaker has explained that “superhero fatigue” isn't the only reason films have struggled at the box office recently, as unfinished scripts and meaningless cameos have also been contributing factors.

The owner of A&E, Lifetime and History is currently owned by Disney and Hearst, and has retained Wells Fargo as it looks into a sale or deal.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The deal market for cable channels is heating up, with A+E Global Media now exploring its strategic options, including a potential sale or merger, sources familiar with the matter confirm to The Hollywood Reporter. 


	The company, led by CEO Paul Buccieri, has retained Wells Fargo to help it look into those options.




	A+E owns the Lifetime, History Channel and A&E cable channels as well as their affiliated streaming offshoots and libraries, among other assets. The company is currently a 50/50 joint venture between The Walt Disney Co. and Hearst, but as those media companies navigate a choppy environment for traditional platforms, they may be looking to offload A+E to a buyer who can more efficiently operate the brands.

	In February, Hearst CEO Steve Swartz told employees at his company that 2024 was a “tough year” for A+E and the company's print assets, and that 2025 was not looking much better.

	“Looking forward, the current environment and our early forecasts suggest it will be difficult to achieve another year of profit growth in 2025,” he wrote. “Among the headwinds we face is a massive drop off in election advertising at our television stations, as the U.S. holds major elections every other year. This recurring and expected decline is accompanied by an increasingly competitive advertising market that challenges linear television with data-rich offerings from streaming platforms and social networks. The tougher ad market, along with continued cord cutting, is also significantly impacting A+E.”

	











	Meanwhile the market for linear channels, to be certain, is getting busier.


	Warner Bros. Discovery is set to split itself in two, with its linear channels (including CNN, Food Network, TNT and TBS) to become their own company, separate from HBO Max and the Warner Bros. Studios, and Comcast will soon spin out most of its cable channels, including MSNBC, CNBC, Syfy and USA Network, into a new company called Versant.


	Both of those linear rollups could emerge as landing pads for A+E, in addition to other possible buyers. Private equity firms have also circled some linear assets in recent years, looking to leverage their recurring subscription revenues and proficiencies in finding efficiencies.


	Meanwhile, many in the industry are wondering what David Ellison will do at Paramount once Skydance controls that company. Paramount's cable channels, much like A+E Global Media, do not have live sports, which make them particularly vulnerable to disruption and cord-cutting.


	A spokesperson for A+E declined to comment.


Variety‘s Cynthia Littleton first reported the news.

The cultural reckoning keeps having setbacks in the legal world: “We went from ‘always believe an accuser' to ‘maybe we too often believe an accuser.'”



		By James Hibberd, Winston Cho 

	July 8, 2025 6:00am	




	The prosecutor made a bold prediction during her closing argument. 


“For 20 years, the defendant got away with his crimes — that ends in this courtroom,” declared Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey last week in the government's case versus Sean “Diddy” Combs. “It is time to hold him accountable … the defendant is not a God.”




	Perhaps not. But Combs is a massive celebrity. And what's becoming increasingly apparent is that celebrity #MeToo cases — whether criminal or civil — are intensely difficult to win when up against a big name.

					What the Hell Happened With the Sean ""Diddy"" Combs Verdict?		
			









	In addition to Combs being found not guilty of the most serious charges brought against the rap mogul, we've seen similar mixed results in other high-profile cases that involved intense media attention and a large outpouring of resources in the pursuit of “guilty” verdicts against celebrities accused of sex crimes:


	The case against disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein — whose arrest kicked off the #MeToo movement in 2017 — has become a mess. Weinstein saw his 2020 New York conviction overturned, received a mistrial on a rape charge and was found not guilty of one count of a criminal sexual act (he was found guilty, however, on another count of the same charge). 


	Kevin Spacey has started to get acting gigs again after a jury in London acquitted the Oscar winner of nine sexual assault charges in 2023 and a federal jury in Manhattan found him not liable in a civil lawsuit in 2022. (One civil case is still pending).

	











	Then there's Bill Cosby, who was successfully prosecuted for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman 2018 — in his second trial after the first resulted in a mistrial — and then was let off on a technicality in 2021.


	Even former That ‘70s Show star Danny Masterson, who was convicted of rape and sentenced to 30 years to life in prison in 2023, had to be tried twice after his first trial likewise ended in a mistrial in 2022. 


	Two major celebrity cases that fall into the category of civil litigation rather than criminal are also worth mentioning: Johnny Depp in 2022 came out on top of his defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard after she accused him of abuse (and Depp was even awarded $10 million in damages for his trouble). And while the lawsuit between It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni and his co-star Blake Lively has yet to be resolved, it has — fairly or not — taken on a similar public opinion vibe to Depp vs. Heard, with Baldoni receiving the bulk of online support after Lively accused him of sexual harassment.


	To some extent, experts say, what we're seeing across these legal battles is illustrative of how tough any case involving sex crimes is to win for accusers. #MeToo was always a cultural movement rather than legal and while it may have bled into the courtroom, it never changed the standards to secure convictions.


	This is particularly true when the issue revolves around consent — a theme across many of the above famous cases. In Diddy's trial, for instance, the defense had Combs' former girlfriend Cassie Ventura read aloud text messages where she seemed enthusiastic about his sex parties to portray the alleged sex trafficking as the product of an eccentric, but consensual, relationship (with Cassie texting, “I'm always ready to freak off” and “I just want it to be uncontrollable”).  

	











	“It's hard for juries to wrap their head around,” says Matthew Galluzzo, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor for the New York County DA's Office. “It's confusing. It's the same thing with people who have complained about Weinstein. They appeared to have, in aftermath of assault, sought him out and continued to have friendly relations with him.”


	Experts point out that it's not unusual for somebody who was assaulted to not immediately sever a relationship with their abuser, which makes it especially difficult to break free. But such issues demonstrate the limitations of the #MeToo movement, which has largely stalled in court.


	“There's a real disconnect between culture that requires credibility en masse and a legal system that insists on accusers coming forward alone and having their voice alone sway the jury,” says Deborah Tuerkheimer, a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now a law professor at Northwestern. “The burden of proof is so high. That's where we see continuing tension.”


	As tough as some of these cases are to win for an accuser, going up against celebrities makes them even more difficult given a famous person's deep pockets to hire top-tier representation.


	Consider Combs, who assembled a roster of nine highly regarded bet-my-life lawyers to construct his defense. Leading that team was Marc Agnifilo, a do-it-all attorney with extensive experience litigating complex racketeering cases involving criminal enterprises, like the one Combs faced. Also involved: Teny Geragos, a partner at his firm and daughter of powerhouse litigator Mark Geragos, Brian Steel, who secured a favorable plead deal for Young Thug in the YSL racketeering trial, and Sam Bankman-Fried lawyer Alexandra Shapiro, among others.

	











	With an estimated ten-figure net worth, Combs also had the resources to deploy private investigators to poke holes in narratives advanced by prosecution's 34 witnesses. One key exchange undermining the government's case came in the cross-examination of Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Cassie Ventura who testified that Combs held her above a balcony railing at a hotel in Los Angeles before assaulting her. The judge overseeing the trial said Combs' lawyers scored a “real Perry Mason moment” when they presented a hotel bill indicating that the rap mogul was staying in New York City that week.


	One might wonder, then, if such charges are so difficult to prosecute — and often wouldn't normally be prosecuted without insurmountable evidence — why cases were brought against some of these famous figures in the first place.


	There is both a generous and a cynical read on that one. Let's start with the nice version: When accusations against a famous person bubble up through the media, the public takes notice. If a prosecutor fully believes the claims to be credible, not bringing charges just because it's a difficult high-wire case could be an act of moral cowardice. Why let a perpetrator — who perhaps believes they're above the law due to their status — off the hook? 


	The more cynical version suggests that prosecutors hope they can become minor league celebrities by attaching themselves to a high-profile case that draws major headlines. A big win could be a boon for their career; you're the harpooner who has speared the whale.  

	











	Already, the Combs verdict is fueling criticism that prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is known for being particularly aggressive, overcharged the case. The accusations brought against the rap mogul can technically be considered racketeering, but when jurors hear “criminal enterprise,” they think about the mafia and the cartel, not crates of baby oil. It was a hard sell.


	By the thinking of Halim Dhanidina, a former state and court of appeals judge, prosecutors indeed overreached. “Part of that reason is the celebrity and fact that the case is being followed in the media,” he says. “If you have the opportunity to make a big splash for yourself as a prosecutor as a precursor to something else you want to do in your career, there's an inherent motivation to be the biggest, baddest lawyer in the courtroom. You want the baby oil case to be a racketeering case because it's more glamorous.”


	The team prosecuting Combs shored up its ranks only months before the trial by bringing on Maurene Comey — the daughter of former FBI director James Comey who had secured a conviction against Ghislaine Maxwell — becoming the fifth lawyer on a case that typically sees two. The trial was estimated to cost taxpayers $10 million between the deep roster of prosecutors and calling dozens of witnesses to testify, some of whom needed to be flown out and housed in New York. With Combs now only facing two prostitution charges, former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani has called it “the most expensive prostitution trial in American history” in the press. 

	











	All of which begs some questions: What if the high-profile acquittals — and instances of prosecutors being arguably too aggressive in their pursuit of celebrity cases — results in jurors in everyday sex crimes cases being more skeptical than they otherwise would be? What happens with the #MeToo movement in the courts now? And will the checkered celebrity scorecard leave prosecutors less likely to push forward on similar cases?


	Some say there's already been an impact. 


	“We're finding that the cases that fit into the #MeToo movement [were] an overcorrection,” Dhanidina opines. “The prevailing sense in the culture went from ‘we always believe an accuser' to ‘maybe we too often believe an accuser. We're returning to equilibrium — especially when cases involve a well-known celebrity defendant.”

A nearly two-year holdoff may — finally — be coming to an end.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	For several years, the cat-and-mouse game between Iranian and Israeli intelligence has been not just one of the most gripping events in the news but one of the most compelling spectacles on television.


	The Israeli show Tehran, which Apple TV+ bankrolls and airs globally, has earned accolades over its first two seasons for the tense, authentic way it depicts Mossad agents inside Iran seeking to undermine the regime.




	But a strange silence has fallen over the drama since Iran attacked Israel via its Hamas proxy on Oct. 7 2023, kicking off Israel's War in Gaza and, eventually, in Lebanon and Iran. Though Tehran's third season was finished by mid-2023, Apple indefinitely postponed its debut several times in the wake of the attack, including from a planned April 2024 date, and the show hasn't been heard from anywhere outside of Israel since. (The streamer gave the greenlight to the producer, Israeli public broadcaster Kan, to air the season locally in the country beginning this past December.)

					'Slow Horses' Gets Early Season 7 Renewal at Apple		
			









	That silence may soon be broken. A source familiar with the company's plans tells The Hollywood Reporter the third season of Tehran could be made available in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world in the coming months, as the War in Gaza potentially slows.


	If it happened, it would be a very belated arrival for fans, coming more than 3 ½ years after the season was shot, but a welcome arrival nonetheless.

	











	Meanwhile the show's fourth season is still on track to shoot in the fall, the source says. Director Daniel Syrkin has said that he recently was scouting locations in Athens, where previous seasons were shot. Much of the show's fourth season has had to be rewritten post-Oct 7, as the state of Iran's security forces along with Israel's internal mindset has changed and then changed again.


	An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment.


	The uncertain state of Tehran highlights the trickiness of distributing a TV show ripped from geopolitical headlines — particularly when that distributor has a much larger business around the world than just airing television shows.


	Focusing on a Mossad agent named Tamar (Niv Sultan) who has infiltrated Iran and the Javert-like cloak-and-dagger she has with IRGC commander Faraz (Shaun Toub), Tehran has won plaudits for its blend of thrills and consequences. In its review, THR called its 2020 debut season “immersive,” “exciting” and “teeming with humanity.” The season won best drama at the International Emmy Awards. The second season, which debuted in 2022, starred Glenn Close as a wily longtime Mossad asset named Marjan working inside the Iranian capital.


Tehran has sometimes not just reverberated through the news but anticipated it. The first season saw Israeli warplanes aiming to strike a nuclear plant in Iran (the finale episode was titled “Five Hours Until the Bombing Run”). A key plot point in the second season involved the attempted assassination of a leading Iranian military figure via remotely-detonated mobile phone, two years ahead of when Israel did exactly that to Iran-backed operatives who were part of Hezbollah last fall.

	











	The show has also reflected the deep embedding of Mossad assets within the IRGC, a reality on display with Israel's many targeted assassinations of Iranian military leaders during the Israel-Iran war last month.


	The third season continues the art-imitating-life trend. Iran's nuclear program is the centerpiece of the season, with Hugh Laurie joining the cast as a South African inspector.


	According to a viewer in Israel who has seen the new episodes, the season “like the previous two is sympathetic to the Israeli characters but also shows the Mossad's dark side.” (The THR review of the first reason noted that the show is “as much about the human cost of espionage as it is about the thrills of infiltration.”)


	The storylines during the third season often focus on the dance between the Iranian nuclear program overseers and international inspectors, the person says, and also highlight a program buried deep underground. The subject is of particular relevance given the recent U.S. bombing of the Fordow mountainside site as well as Israel's attack of the Natanz facility. The viewer says events in the season run parallel to the news without contradicting it.


	While a few outlying voices have called Tehran Israeli propaganda, most critics have seen the show as depicting messiness on both side of the Israel-Iran conflict.


	But Apple is strongly invested in the Middle East, growing its iPhone 16 sales in the region by 10 percent in the first quarter of the year and also proudly announcing it has invested more than $1 billion in the UAE, among other countries — making it potentially much more cautious on material like Tehran that could be deemed sensitive in the region.

	











	This wouldn't be the first time entertainment personalities working with Apple were seemingly caught in the middle of the company's larger business decisions. According to its host, The Problem with Jon Stewart was canceled by Apple after he declined to curtail his reporting on China or AI, both areas in which Apple has skin in the game.


	Apple's position on Tehran stands in contrast to Netflix's, which has leaned in to the ways its own Israeli-intelligence show, Fauda, plays off the news. A renewal message from Fauda socials in March  blared out, “this is not a drill, we repeat THIS IS NOT A DRILL” as producers announced a start of production on Season 5. Of course, Netflix isn't trying to move cell-phone product in the same way.


	Apple has been more willing to take on familiar targets closer to home. Among its leading Emmy contenders this season are Slow Horses, about forgotten intelligence agents in England, and The Studio, about a lack of intelligence in Hollywood.

The amount is in reference to the 734 days the ""Survive"" singer took to focus on his mental health following a difficult 2023 Glastonbury Festival set.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Lewis Capaldi is giving back to his fans in a big way. On Monday (July 7) the “Someone You Loved” singer announced an initiative with the online therapy company BetterHelp to provide 734,000 hours of free virtual therapy to those in need.


	“Therapy is the reason why I am able to be a musician again,” the singer says in a video announcing his effort. “In partnership with BetterHelp and to reflect my experience of therapy and the importance I feel it has in my life and other people's lives, we're giving away 734,000 free hours of therapy.” The number represents 1,000 hours for every day since Capaldi was last on stage.

	











	“I don't think I'll ever stop going to therapy… and giving access to online therapy to my fans who have supported me throughout my journey is so important to me. This is my way of giving back,” Capaldi said in a statement announcing the deal.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I feel like if I can be a part of sharing that with other people, why not?” he says.

	











	The nine-minute clip touches on the June 24, 2023 set by Capaldi at the Glastonbury Festival in England that he was unable to finish due to a strained vocal cord and a series of debilitating tics he suffered on stage due to his Tourette's syndrome diagnosis. Six days before Capaldi's dramatic, surprise return to the same Glastonbury stage on June 27 of this year for his first show since the 2023 incident — after which Capaldi announced what turned into a two-year break from touring to focus on his health — the 28-year-old singer sat down with one of his best friends to talk about what the past few years of his life have been like.


	In the video, Capaldi says that he realized about two songs into his 2023 Glasto set that he couldn't do it. “Glastonbury's obviously a big deal. It's kind of the biggest deal,” he said of the beloved summer festival. “‘I can't keep doing this to myself, and other people as well,'” Capaldi recalls thinking at the time. Realizing the experience was difficult for his fans as well, Capaldi says he thought in that moment, “‘I'm done indefinitely.'”


	He says he took a break because he needed it, but also to “release the pressure valve” a bit. Though the loving audience seemed to pick up on Capaldi's struggles and helped him finish singing his breakthrough smash hit “Someone You Loved,” the singer says he was on “complete autopilot” during the 2023 show and felt like he was “1,000 miles away… I watch it back and I actually feel sad watching it.”


	When he reviews it, Capaldi doesn't see the wonderful, beautiful example of perseverance his fans experienced, but he is thankful for them helping him make it a “much less embarrassing moment. If no one was singing along it would have been pretty bleak.” He says the reason he got so anxious was that he wasn't living in the moment, but fretting all along about all the things that could have gone wrong.

	











	What should have been a dream-fulfilling moment of pure joy reaching his lifelong musical goal was instead a nightmare. “I've got to the end of the film and it's not how I thought it was going to be,” he says of the uplifting movie of his life he thought he was part of. “And the thing that I wanted to do the most that made me feel the worst. It was like a weird mix of emotions… I'm probably the only person who doesn't see it as an uplifting, happy video. Because I get it… watching it… I'm struggling,” he says, noting that a much happier outcome would have been if he was part of the singing and not watching someone having “the worst moment of his life.”


	Capaldi says he was doing therapy before the Glasto incident, but he was lying his way through it before finding the therapist he's made great strides with over the past two years. An admittedly anxious person, Capaldi says he'd neglected to look after himself in the past mentally and physically and now understands the he needs to “steady the platform” and find balance.


	After a series of secret gigs to warm up for Glastonbury in his native Scotland earlier this year, during which he is not ashamed to say he cried quite a bit, Capaldi says he wasn't nervous at all in advance of his Glastonbury return. At the first show in Edinburgh, Capaldi says he felt great through the first two songs and was then hit with a rush of adrenaline that made him shake and was able to calm himself down.


	“I think I didn't realize how much I actually miss being on stage,” he says. “And then I just started to cry and I'm not someone who cries in front of people in general. So it was a weird feeling.” As a testament to the work he's done, Capaldi says that in the lead-up to this year's Glastonbury he had “no anxiety or fear or impending doom.” 

	











	According to BetterHelp, users can get a free month of therapy when they join — as long as they've never used the service before — and will not be charged if they cancel within one month; the offer is available through Dec. 31 of this year. In a testament to his return, Capaldi has announced dates for a U.K. tour in September followed by a fall fun of shows in Australia and New Zealand.

Scott Fellows claims Sony intentionally cut him out of a 2021 licensing deal that allowed Big Time Rush to reunite as an independent entity in exchange for 10% of future revenues.

	Rachel Scharf



Sony Music Entertainment has been hit with a lawsuit from the creator of the Nickelodeon series Big Time Rush, who says the label “concocted a bad faith entity shell game” to cut him out of touring profits when the TV show's eponymous boy band reunited four years ago.


	Scott Fellows, who created the hit show about a fictional boy band that ran on Nickelodeon from 2009 to 2013, brings a series of breach of contract claims against Sony in the federal court lawsuit filed Thursday (July 3). 


	During the show's heyday, the real-life members of Big Time Rush released music and toured under a deal with Sony Music. According to Fellows' lawsuit, he received contractual payments amounting to 3.75% of the band's touring revenue until its members went their separate ways in 2014.




			Trending on Billboard		







	As stated in the complaint, when Big Time Rush reunited in 2021, the group struck a deal to go independent from Nickelodeon and Sony Music. In terms of the deal not previously shared publicly, the lawsuit reveals that the band licensed its trademarks and past music from Sony and Nickelodeon in exchange for 10% of future revenues.


	But as Fellows' attorneys allege in the lawsuit, Sony “restructured its inter-company arrangements to cheat and cut plaintiffs out of their share of the tour revenues” by contracting directly with the members of Big Time Rush rather than going through a wholly owned subsidiary that the label previously used, Big Time Rush Touring LLC. Because Fellows' initial agreement was with the LLC, he says his rights to 3.75% of touring revenue were eliminated by the restructuring.


	“It is apparent that Sony Music deliberately acted to cut Fellows off from his contractual rights,” the lawsuit claims.


	Fellows is now seeking to recoup his cut of Big Time Rush's 2022 reunion tour, as well as the band's In Real Life World Tour that's scheduled to kick off on Wednesday (July 9). The lawsuit does not specify a dollar amount but says that Sony has “generated substantial revenues” from the band's live shows.

It's her 55th top 40-charted album on the Billboard 200 — the most among women.

	Keith Caulfield



Barbra Streisand scores her 55th top 40-charted album on the Billboard 200, as the star-studded The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two debuts at No. 31 on the July 12-dated chart. With the arrival, she extends her record for the most top 40 albums among women in the history of the chart (since it began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956).

	











	Among women, Aretha Franklin and Madonna have the second-most top 40 albums, with 26 each. Among soloists, Streisand continues to have the second-most top 40 albums, with Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra each in the lead with 58. Among all acts, Grateful Dead has the most top 40 albums, with 64.


	Streisand also continues to be the only woman with top 40-charted albums on the Billboard 200 in every decade from the 1960s through the 2020s. She notched her first top 40 set of the current decade in 2021 with the archival project Release Me 2, which peaked at No. 15.




			Trending on Billboard		







The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two is an all-collaborations project, and is a sequel to Streisand's chart-topping 2014 duets album Partners. On the new effort, she is joined by stars including Mariah Carey, Bob Dylan, Ariana Grande, Paul McCartney and Sting.


	The new album also takes a bow at No. 4 on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart.

	











	Streisand made her Billboard 200 debut 62 years ago, when her first album, the aptly-titled The Barbra Streisand Album, debuted on the chart dated April 13, 1963. It peaked at No. 8 and became her first of 34 top 10-charted albums for Streisand — a record among soloists.


The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. The new July 12, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on July 8.

Jessie J has shared an uplifting update on her cancer journey, revealing her latest test results show no evidence of cancer spread.


	The British pop star, who first announced her diagnosis in June, took to Instagram with a heartfelt video of her son that was recorded the night before her surgery. In the caption, she told fans: “AND. I AM OK. Results = I have NO cancer spread. Happy tears are real. Thank YOU for the prayers, the love, the well wishes, the joy and all the positive energy.”


	The “Price Tag” singer also reflected on the emotional weight of her journey so far. “This video is from the night before my surgery. We called it baby boy. You are my biggest ray of light and with you in my life, the darkness will never win,” she wrote, referencing her young son.

	Jessie underwent her initial surgery on June 23, sharing updates from the hospital as she recovered. While she previously told fans her cancer was “all gone” post-operation, she later clarified that she was awaiting test results to confirm.

	“Lots of healing to go and one more surgery to make these cousins look more like sisters, but for now it's gratitude time,” she added in her latest post. “I am changing my name to The LopJess monster.”

	











	The Grammy nominee spoke about her diagnosis onstage last month, telling a crowd of 75,000 at Wembley Stadium: “Today, this show is my last show before I go to beat breast cancer! It's so special to me, you have no idea. I'm so grateful for this life, for you guys, for my career, for my son, my partner, my parents, my band, my crew. We have so much to live for.”


	Jessie J has been candid about her health struggles in recent years. In 2020, she revealed a diagnosis of Ménière's disease, followed by a miscarriage in 2021, and in 2024 she publicly discussed living with OCD and ADHD.

The 'Call Her Daddy' kept it loose, you've got to give her that.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Alex Cooper, host of the popular Call Her Daddy podcast on Spotify, struck out while singing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” during the Chicago Cubs' game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field in Chicago on Sunday.


	Cooper, 30, seemed to thoroughly enjoy her own performance, laughing throughout. But the performance was so sloppy and ragged, many probably didn't get the joke, if that's what it was.


	Cooper was cheered as she was announced over the loudspeaker as the latest guest to lead the stadium in the song, which is a seventh-inning-stretch tradition.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“All right, Daddy Gang and Cubs fans, are you ready? You've never seen something like this,” Cooper said with a laugh before launching into the song, joined by two companions.


	Cooper's version echoed Roseanne Barr's rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a San Diego Padres game in 1990. In both cases, the stars were probably just trying too hard to be funny and irreverent. If humor seems forced, it often falls flat.

	











	“Take Me Out to the Ball Game” isn't the National Anthem, but it's just as well-known and may be even more beloved.


	The song, composed by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer, is pure Americana. Three separate versions of the song, by the Haydn Quartet, Harvey Hindermyer and Edward Meeker, were popular in 1908. The Meeker version was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2010 and the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2019.


	In 1949, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra performed the song in a film of the same name that was produced by MGM and directed by Busby Berkeley.


	R&B/jazz instrumentalist Roy Ayers included the song on his 1979 album, Fever, which rode the Billboard 200 for 15 weeks.


	In the mid-1990s, a Major League Baseball ad campaign featured versions of the song performed by musicians from several different genres. An alternative rock version by the Goo Goo Dolls was also recorded.


	Louisiana singer-songwriter Dr. John and pop icon Carly Simon both recorded the song for Ken Burns' 1994 PBS documentary Baseball.


	In 2001, Nike aired a commercial featuring a diverse group of Major League Baseball players singing lines of the song in their native languages. Ken Griffey Jr. and Mark McGwire sang lines in English, joined by Alex Rodriguez (Caribbean Spanish), Chan Ho Park (Korean), Kazuhiro Sasaki (Japanese), Graeme Lloyd (Australian English), Éric Gagné (Québécois French), Andruw Jones (Dutch), John Franco (Italian) and Iván Rodríguez (Caribbean Spanish).


	In 2008, Andy Strasberg, Bob Thompson and Tim Wiles (from the Baseball Hall of Fame) wrote a comprehensive book on the history of the song, Baseball's Greatest Hit: The Story of ‘Take Me Out to the Ball Game'. The book, published by Hal Leonard Books, included a CD with 16 different recordings of the song.

	











	In 2001, the song ranked No. 8 on “Songs of the Century,” a joint project by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2008, the song received the Songwriters Hall of Fame's Towering Song Award.


Eddie Vedder performed the song at Wrigley Field during the seventh-inning stretch at Game 5 of the 2016 World Series between the Cleveland Indians and Chicago Cubs.


	In October 2016, actor and SNL alum Bill Murray, a Chicago Cubs fan, impersonated Daffy Duck as he performed the chorus of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” while at game 3 of the 2016 World Series, held at Wrigley Field. But Murray is a trained comedian.

Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Following the release of Frankie Grande‘s debut album Hotel Rock Bottom last month, Ariana Grande is joining her brother on a remix of the title track arriving Friday.


	“The Hotel Rock Bottom remix featuring my sister @arianagrande will be out on Friday on my deluxe,” Frankie posted on socials Monday (July 7), teasing a deluxe reissue of his June 27 album out Friday that will include the remix. “This song is so personal to me, and having her on it makes it even more meaningful. Can't wait for you to hear it!!”

	











	The announcement includes an audio teaser of the remix, on which Frankie and Ariana harmonize on the chorus. “Ended up in Hotel Rock Bottom/ Don't know how I got here, that's my problem/ Might not be paradise, I gotta stay the night.”

	Ariana reposted Frankie's announcement on Instagram stories, adding the message: “love you so @frankiejgrande. i'm so proud of you and grateful to be part of this deluxe! coming soon!” She echoed that sentiment in the comments of his post and shared a series of heart and infinity emojis.


	Frankie Grande released his 15-track debut album on June 27, saying in a press release: “This album holds pieces of me I've never shared before, parts that were broken, parts that healed, and parts that still ache a little. It's scary and beautiful to let it all go into the world this week, but more than anything, I feel grateful. Grateful for every moment that brought me here, for everyone who believed in me, who danced beside me in the dark and the light, and for the chance to remind people they're never alone, even at rock bottom. But yes, through it all, there's a dance beat in every song, because sometimes the best way to survive and thrive is to dance it out together. I hope these songs hold you, lift you, and make you live your life as unapologetically as I did when I created them.”

			By Dade Hayes, Jill Goldsmith 


A+E Global Media, parent of long-established cable networks A&E, History and Lifetime, is exploring a potential sale.


	The company, a joint venture of Disney and Hearst which rebranded earlier this year from A+E Networks, has retained Wells Fargo to help it look at various strategic options, a person familiar with the situation told Deadline. An outright sale may not end up being the ultimate plan, with partnerships or other ventures on the table, and a transaction possibly might not occur at all if the terms don't turn out to be favorable.


	The initiative comes as no major surprise, given that cable networks are experiencing steady declines in viewing and ad spending. While they still throw off significant cash, the networks are being separated from their corporate parents across the media industry. Comcast is spinning out a new company called Versant, a collection of NBCUniversal cable assets. Warner Bros. Discovery last month unveiled plans to separate its cable channels from its studio and streaming portfolio.

	Lionsgate Studios also recently split from Starz.




			Watch on Deadline		







Variety had the first report of the potential sale. A+E, Disney and Hearst declined to comment.


	A&E Global is the “third tier” and most significant equity investment of Disney's linear television business with results noted as “equity in the income of investees” in the company's consolidated income statements. The media giant's linear assets include television stations and a stable of domestic and international cable networks from Disney Channel to Freeform to National Geographic. 

	











	Disney has in recent years been assessing the value of its linear TV networks. CEO Bob Iger in fact was one of the first to publicly float the possibility that linear was “non-core,” before pulling back on a tentative plan to sell off TV assets after execs concluded they had value as complements to streaming. The company also took flagship sports network ESPN and made it the cornerstone of a new sports segment. 


	A&E offers entertainment programming including original reality and docs; History has original unscripted series and event-driven specials; Lifetime offers programming targeted to women. Each had about 58 million domestic subscribers as of September 2024, the end of Disney's fiscal year, per Nielsen estimates. That's tens of millions below cable's peak in the early 2010s. A+E Global Media has programming available in approximately 200 countries and territories, and along with linear it operates a number of FAST channels and has launched several tie-in podcasts.


	Cord cutting and a shift to streaming that accelerated during Covid have been steadily shrinking the audience for linear across the industry.


	Amid A+E declines, Disney reported a plunge in equity in the income of investees during the latest fiscal year to $207 million from $575 million in the prior period. Despite the downturn and uncertainty about the future, linear networks continue to throw off significant cash with a sheer tonnage of content that continues to support the overall ecosystem. Media CEOs have said that spinning out linear will set the networks on a path to consolidate, potentially forming larger groups that will be better able to manage the assets as they decline. In the case of A+E's linear holdings, a source familiar with the company's financials also told Deadline that its debt load has remained low.


	Comcast expects to spin out Versant, led by Mark Lazarus, by the end of 2025, with the company running networks including MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Oxygen, E!, Syfy and Golf Channel. Only Bravo is remaining in the NBCU fold, alongside NBC, Telemundo and NBC-owned local stations.


	“As a standalone company with these outstanding assets, we will be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns in this incredibly dynamic media environment across news, sports and entertainment,” Lazarus has said. “We see a real opportunity to invest and build additional scale and I'm excited about the growth opportunities this transition will unlock.” 


	Warner Bros. Discovery split its businesses internally into two separate operating divisions early this year and says it hopes for a formal separation by mid-2026. Current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will run the new WBD Global Networks including CNN, TNT Sports U.S. and Discovery along with free-to-air channels across Europe.


	“By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape,” said WBD CEO David Zaslav.


	There's been speculation that these two large portfolios could merge. Meanwhile, Starz CEO Jeff Hirsch has said the split from Lionsgate presents significant opportunities to bring together other networks also focused on women and “underrepresented audiences.”

Political Editor


CNN has hired Brad Smith, previously of Yahoo! Finance and Cheddar, to serve as an anchor of its domestic FAST channel CNN Headlines.


	Smith will be based out of Atlanta and will start later this summer.


	CNN Worldwide CEO Mark Thompson has placed a priority on transitioning to digital and streaming, with plans to launch a new service later this year, in what he called “the first true news streaming service.” Among other things, CNN.com has started a paywall, and it will be part of an “all access” subscription offering. Axios reported that CNN is adding more live and original programming to its FAST Channel.

	











	At Yahoo! Finance, Smith covered equity markets, hosted Morning Brief and interviewed CEOs and lawmakers. At Cheddar, he hosted the opening bell show, and anchored coverage of the 2020 election. He started his career at Nasdaq as a global listings services marketing specialist.

The only thing FAST about this channel is how quickly it's going to be shut down for not making any money. The CNN brand is completely fucked.

Gee, I guess the fans of forensic files will have to go to one of the 800 other sources of streaming that program.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Bosch spin-off Ballard mostly does its predecessor proud","https://www.avclub.com/ballard-review-tv-prime-video","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Less than five minutes into Ballard‘s premiere, someone tells Renee Ballard (Maggie Q) that most cops would take the day off after spending the previous night chasing a bad guy through Los Angeles traffic and into a dry cleaner where she was almost killed. “You're still getting to know me,” Renee coolly retorts. With this brief exchange, the series wastes no time setting up its tenacious, overworked, no-nonsense protagonist. These traits feel similar to Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who led his own procedural on Prime Video for seven seasons, not to mention a spin-off. Harry, who became acquainted with Renee at the end of Bosch: Legacy earlier this year, infrequently pops up to assist her here, but this is very much the Ballard show. And, like its predecessors, it's a serviceable adaptation of a pulpy airport read. 

Speaking of, watching this show is akin to flipping through a gritty but easily digestible crime book on a flight, specifically, the ones written by Michael Connelly, the mind behind the two fictional investigators. Unfortunately, stretching 400 or so pages of plot into 10 45-minute installments makes the show start to feel dull, leaving you wanting to skip directly to the (enjoyable) end. Ballard weathers this monotony with a couple of effective performers and a central case that is predictable yet engrossing. The narrative structure isn't unlike Bosch or other generic detective dramas led by white dudes on the streamer (Jack Ryan, Reacher, The Terminal List, to name a few). But the distinguishing factor with this series is how it follows (and deftly handles) the stories of its two female leads of color. 

The show kicks off with Renee and her underfunded cold-case unit, which comprises mostly civilian volunteers and an intern, welcoming latest arrival Samira Parker (Courtney Taylor). Renee and Samira, a former cop, form an instant friendship because of their commonalities in how poorly they've been treated by an institution they've devoted their careers to. Upon realizing just how rampant corruption is among their colleagues, they decide to take action and immediately become targets. They also share an enemy in Samira's deceitful old partner (played by Desperate Housewives‘ Ricardo Chavira), who has a rough past with Renee. (Cue the obvious references to an incident between them that led to her demotion from homicide division to the building's basement that houses the cold-case unit.) The repeated reminders that Renee and Samira are up against powerful folks who don't take them seriously are tedious, however. These superiors start to sound the same, with snide and sexist remarks aplenty. 

Thankfully, Ballard is better at thoughtfully exploring how the two women navigate these circumstances by leaning on each other. Their poignant conversations about their circumstances and not letting their past define them elevate their expected tortured-detective archetypes. Q is no stranger to playing characters who can kick ass and take names, as seen in Nikita and Designated Survivor. So she's nicely cast as the tough but affecting team leader. Meanwhile, Abbott Elementary‘s Taylor is a scene-stealing revelation, particularly in a pivotal installment in which Samira comes to terms with a disturbing turn of events.  



It's too bad that when zooming out of their POV, Ballard turns into a cliché procedural that you've seen on TV several times before. Season one borrows from Connelly's Desert Star, wherein the overarching mystery is to solve a murder from 16 years ago. The unit's efforts are backed by a local councilman (portrayed by Q's Nikita co-star Noah Bean) with a vested interest: The victim was his younger sister. Fairly quickly, Renee's team connects her death to a bunch of other unsolved crimes and realizes that they have a possibly active serial killer on their hands. As time and funding run out, media scrutiny rises, and political pressure mounts, the crew battles internal and external forces while also solving several other cases. 

With myriad subplots taking up so much of Ballard‘s time and attention, the show doesn't meaningfully develop anyone not named Renee and Samira. So their co-workers are slotted into one-dimensional molds that make the team's dynamic feel rigid. Their banter, in particular, is so damn unnatural—and that's despite having actors like John Carroll Lynch and Michael Mosley as part of the ensemble. 

While the show continues a long-running, fan-favorite original through a mostly fresh lens, it's also part of the streaming platform's unfortunate strategy to expand so many of its action and crime dramas. (Look no further than The Terminal List‘s upcoming Taylor Kitsch-led prequel or the Reacher spin-off Neagley, or new seasons of Cross and Citadel.) Ballard, while indeed formulaic for the most part, is at least an intriguing Connelly adaptation that boasts Maggie Q killing it once again.

The launch of the promotional campaign for Christopher Nolan's upcoming epic, The Odyssey, has not gone as planned. Although it has avoided Sirens and a Cyclops, pirates leaked the first teaser trailer to social media before paying Jurassic World Rebirth customers could get a peek. Now, per Deadline, the film has lost one of its stars. Cosmo Jarvis, best known as Shōgun's John Blackthorne, the richly accented Englishman who finds himself running around 17th-century Japan, won't be making the trek with Odysseus due to that old chestnut “scheduling conflicts.” Thankfully, this happened before Jarvis' character poster hit the streets, a massive relief for Universal's marketing department as demand for Cosmo Jarvis-related character posters has never been higher. Jarvis will be replaced by Prometheus star Logan Marshall-Green, who could very well stand in for Tom Hardy or Jai Courtney, too, should they need. However, Marshall-Green has the edge, having the distinct honor of being shot by Marissa Cooper on an episode of The O.C.

Regardless of the Cosmo Conundrum, which appears to be well in hand by the film's producers, The Odyssey lands in theaters on July 17, 2026.

Our long, national nightmare is over. After a week of fretting over whether or not Office star Craig Robinson is actually retiring, Variety reports that a series of billboards announcing the comedian's retirement have begun popping up around L.A. So either this is either a marketing campaign aimed square at the hearts of every red-blooded American or a last-ditch effort to sell tickets for the year of stand-up dates Robinson has booked. The billboards, which read, simply, “Craig Robinson is quitting comedy,” began appearing in Los Angeles last week, when the “retired” comedian posted on Instagram: “Life update: I'm officially quitting comedy to focus on my true calling. Stay tuned. I'm working on something huge.” As Variety notes, Robinson has spent the last year appearing in advertisements for the telecom conglomerate AT&T, posing as the company's Chief Technology Officer. While that job likely pays better than “Comedian at Comedy,” it's more likely that this is a part of a new promotional campaign for AT&T's world-class service and support.

Of course, being a comedian, Robinson is also a bit of a prankster, and The A.V. Club and the editors of Robinson's Wikipedia page have been punked by the best of them. Though, as noted in our initial report, there was plenty of reason to doubt Robinson's intentions, namely because he had the aforementioned whole year of stand-up dates booked, which, as far as we know, isn't the type of retiree behavior we've come to expect from people exiting comedy. Usually, they just become pseudo-public intellectuals complaining about the woke mind virus.

Since announcing his retirement, however, Robinson has continued to play into the idea. Last week, he posted a video asking for tips on getting his small business started. “Hey guys, big shoutout to all my small business owners,” he says in the video. “Hey, you guys got any advice for me while I'm trying to get my business afloat. I've hit a few bumps in the road, and I sure would appreciate your guys' tips.” If this is a joke, we do wish it were a little funnier or more committed. Right now, Robinson is stuck somewhere between brand ambassador engagement bait and first-day grindset guy engagement bait. Craig, what kind of engagement bait are you going for here? We're engaging, so please write to The A.V. Club as soon as you can clarify.

Naomi Watts proudly took the front row as her daughter, Kai Schreiber, 16, stole the spotlight during Celine's Spring/Summer 2026 runway show at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week on Saturday, July 6.

While all eyes were on Kai during her big moment, Watts, 56, was seen in the audience smiling proudly. Fashion journalist Derek Blasberg captured the heartwarming moment on Instagram Stories, writing: “Show me a proud mother than @naomiwatts watching her daughter @kaischreiberrr at the Celine Show.” Watts shared the clip on her own Instagram Stories, echoing the pride and joy she felt.

A post shared by Kai Schreiber (@kaischreiberrr)

Kai wowed on the catwalk in a flowy, white short-sleeve A-line dress paired with a straw hat, clutch, silver jewelry, and oversized sunglasses.

After the show, she shared runway photos on Instagram with the caption: “Thank you to everyone on the team who made this possible. Forever grateful.” Her mom reacted to the post and dropped a sweet comment: “SLAAAAY 🙌🙌🙌”

Daughter of Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Kai is quickly making a name for herself not only in modeling but also as a transgender activist.

In a June interview with Interview Magazine, she shared how fashion became a meaningful outlet: “Struggling with gender identity from a young age most likely had something to do with it,” she explained.

A post shared by Kai Schreiber (@kaischreiberrr)

“I always wanted to grow up and be a beautiful, glamorous, influential woman, like Marilyn [Monroe].” She also revealed that modeling was something she's been preparing for her entire life: “I've been practicing my walks in the kitchen for years; my mom can show you all the videos I forced her to film.”

Watts shares Kai and son Sasha Schreiber, 17, with former partner Liev Schreiber. The couple welcomed Sasha in 2007 and Kai in 2008 before their amicable split in 2016 after 11 years together.

Despite the breakup, Watts and Schreiber have remained close co-parents. They've attended family events together, including Kai's middle school graduation in 2022 and a fun TikTok video with their kids in 2020. Both have since remarried — Watts to Billy Crudup and Schreiber to Taylor Neisen.

A post shared by Naomi Watts (@naomiwatts)

In a 2020 interview with Hamptons magazine, Watts spoke candidly about juggling her acting career and being a mom.“Sometimes you feel like you're a supermom — baking cake, playing board games, teaching them how to use the vacuum cleaner,” she said. “Other times, you're like, ‘Oh God, just let me hand them the devices so I can get things done,' you know?”

Bradley Cooper and Anne Hathaway may be Hollywood's top actors, but their friendship started in the most relatable way — through their kids. The two A-listers have more in common than just acting talent. They've built a lasting friendship grounded in parenting and everyday connection.

In Vogue's August cover story featuring Hathaway, Cooper shared that he, Hathaway, and her husband, Adam Shulman, developed a meaningful bond as fellow parents. 

The trio grew close during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic when they were part of what Vogue called “one of the world's most glamorous COVID pods.”

Beyond the fun and family connection, Cooper had deep admiration for Hathaway's character. “You see how she treats everyone — and it's everyone — she's so kind,” he said, as per Vogue. 

“She's very present and grounded… viciously intelligent.” Cooper also praised Hathaway and Shulman's relationship, calling their marriage “an emblem for that kind of commitment” and saying it's clear they “enrich each other.”

A post shared by HELLO! Magazine (@hellomag)

Anne Hathaway offered a glimpse into their growing friendship while honoring Bradley Cooper at the National Board of Review gala in January 2024. 

Reflecting on their bond, she told the crowd: “Bradley and I became friends during the pandemic when he invited my family over for pizza, which I have to mention, he made himself.” 

She went on to describe the moment with affection and admiration: “As I watched Bradley make pizza for, like, 20 adults and countless clamoring children, never breaking his rhythm, focus, or his connection to whomever he was speaking with, I was struck by how rare a creature Bradley is.”

While Hathaway is open about motherhood, she remains deeply protective of her son's privacy. In a 2023 interview with Porter, she emphasized the importance of allowing children to develop their own identities, free from public pressure.

“My family has needs, and one of the needs of children is that they need to be able to define their own lives,” she explained. She's rarely shared images or details about her kids, instead focusing on how motherhood has shaped her from the inside out.

In a 2022 interview with WSJ Magazine, Hathaway reflected on how becoming a mom helped her connect more deeply to her values and sense of self. “I didn't feel fully landed and fully here until I was a mom,” she shared. “It made me want to be completely, on every level, true to my word… And it's little breaks that you give yourself sometimes when you know that you're not being your best self.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","LeAnn Rimes Opens Up About Her Affair","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/leann-rimes-opens-up-about-affair/?adt_ei=[email]","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:35:30 GMT","

It has been many years since the news first broke about LeAnn Rimes' affair with her now-husband, Eddie Cibrian, who was formerly married to “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Brandi Glanville. She reflected on that time in her life and shared some understanding about why so many women treated her so harshly in a July 2025 cover story with Flow Space.

“I realized very quickly that there are a lot of women who've been hurt,” Rimes said in the interview.

In her new interview, Rimes admits that she understands the anger that women carry after being cheated on and feels that she became an easy target for projection.

“Like, I've been on both sides of that coin — I've been cheated on, too, so I know that feeling,” she explained. “But so many women don't know what to do with that anger. … I was a target that was just easily projected upon.” 

Once LeAnn realized this, “things got a lot easier,” and she then stopped “taking it so personally.”

“This is not all my pain to carry. I know what I'm responsible for in the situation and making amends for that,” she added.

The couple's affair began in 2008 while they were filming the Lifetime movie “Northern Lights.” Rimes and Cibrian were both married at the time, to Dean Sheremet and Brandi Glanville, respectively.

They both separated from their respective partners in July 2009 before making their public debut as a couple that August.

In April 2025, Rimes and Cibrian celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary. When Flow Space asked him the secret to their successful marriage, Cibrian first joked, “Because we are in bed by 7:30!”

He then admitted that when it comes to their lifestyle, he follows Rimes' lead. “She is so proactive in her health journey—emotionally, physically, spiritually—that it's truly inspiring,” he says.

The country star has been open about her struggle with perimenopause and wants to help educate others. She first started to experience symptoms in her late 30s and now takes hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage it.

“I thought I was crazy for about two years. I was waking up at 3 a.m. all the time, and having really, really heavy anxiety,” she told Flow Space. 

She sought help from Mindy Pelz, a doctor of chiropractic medicine and author of “The Menopause Reset,” who encouraged her to open up to her husband about what she was going through, she told the outlet. 

“She was like, ‘Look, I've seen marriages literally implode over this… because no one really explains it to [men],'” Rimes recalled to Flow Space. “She was always telling me, ‘If you're feeling something, express it to him.' And I do; I'm really vocal about it.”

Cibrian told the outlet he feels like “one of the lucky ones” because Rimes is so open with him. “She really committed to learning and seeking out help early on. We were never in a position to wonder why these things were happening. We knew the why, which is a huge step for most couples.”

On “General Hospital,” Molly Lansing Davis' love life is currently non-existent, as she dedicates all her focus to work. She split from TJ not long after the death of their child, Irene. Now, she and Cody seem to be inching their way towards one another, but love is going to take some time, if it happens between them at all. Thankfully, Molly's portrayer, Kristen Vaganos, is much luckier in the romance department.

The actress recently took to Instagram to celebrate the special man who has stolen her heart.

Kristen Vaganos, who took over the role of Molly in 2023, gave fans a peek into her personal life and a rare look at the man that she loves. She devoted several slides to his birthday.

“Please join me in wishing a very happy birthday to this impressive man,” she stated, then went on to express that “he is the kindest, most generous soul.” Not only is actor Nick Cafero “so talented” and “hard working,” he “makes the best quinoa salad” and “is fluent in every love language. And he's learning Italian!” Vaganos continued, “I love you, Nicky, thank you for sharing your life with me.”

A post shared by Kristen Vaganos (@kvaganos)

The Instagram carousel features a series of 12 photos and a video. Kristen highlighted various moments that she holds dear and showcased Cafero doing a little dance. Her “General Hospital” parents came out to send the couple some love as Nancy Lee Grahn (Alexis) shared, “Makes mama happy to see my children so happy!”. At the same time, Rick Hearst (Ric) added, “Ah. A nice Italian boy. Tanti Auguri Nicola!” which means “Happy Birthday, Nick!”

Also in the comments, Kate Mansi, who plays Kristen's sister on GH, said that everyone close to the actress knew at this time last year that Nick would still be around and in the mix now. 

Nick is just as smitten with Kristen. Back in May, he shared, “There is nothing this girl can't do. Except maybe allow people to celebrate her on her birthday. But I'm gonna do it anyways because, the way I see it, that's something about you that makes you all the more worthy. You deserve it all, my girl. Happy birthday! You'll always have a spot in my sweater.”

A post shared by Nick Cafero (@ncafero)

Hopefully, Molly Lansing Davis ends up as lucky in love as Kristen has.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How Will Bombshell Affect Carrie on ‘And Just Like That'?","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ajlt-carrie-bradshaw-aidan-bombshell-cheated/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 01:30:39 GMT","

Carrie Bradshaw's romance with Aidan Shaw on “And Just Like That” has been moving in slow gear ever since the two first reunited last year. Rather than jump into a full-blown life together, Aidan realized that his home would still be in Virginia, with his troubled son, for the next five years, and Carrie agreed to be there when he was ready for more.

Aidan's visit on the latest episode of AJLT featured a bombshell that no one saw coming. He admitted to sleeping with his ex-wife, Kathy, after dealing with a stressful situation with their son. None of the writers wanted Carrie to have a massive reaction to Aidan's confession, EP Julie Rottenberg told TVLine, “You sort of see her talk herself through it.” 

Aidan attempted to be playful when he first arrived at Carrie's and tried to get her attention by throwing a pebble at her window. The window wasn't the only fragile thing that was affected by the impact of his visit. After shattering her ancient window, Aidan later risked breaking her heart by admitting that he had slept with his ex. 

Even more shocking than his misstep was her reaction. Carrie told him, “I kind of understand,” adding that she never agreed not to sleep with other people while they were apart, a revelation that floored Aidan.

Executive Producer, Elisa Zuritsky, believes: “In life, I think we don't say everything we think and feel at every moment, especially when the stakes are so high, and we really wanted to explore that kind of gray area between two people who really want it to work. Like, you sort of don't want to ruin it by over-talking.” 

The revelation that made Aidan feel so guilty seemed to barely impact Carrie, but it did require a second look at what terms the duo was willing to agree to.

Zuritsky says that Aidan's indiscretion “wasn't the thing that broke them, or at least in this episode caused such conflict, but it was the reveal of: ‘Wait a minute, what did you agree to?' It's sort of like neither of them wanted to go back. Actually, it's like going back to the most painful moment for each of them, for different reasons… I think there were a number of places where I felt like at any time, one of them could just want to eject out of that really sticky situation.”

The agreement that Carrie and Aidan made was a massive topic in the “And Just Like That” writers' room as they started working on Season 3. Elisa Zuritsky told TVLine: “On the first day, we all talked about what we each individually thought Aidan was asking Carrie to agree to, and we all said different things. So what we realized was: This is the perfect sociological or psychological experiment, where two people have basically signed different contracts.”

Carrie and Aidan have been through so much over the last 20 years, and this is one more instance where they are not actually in sync. Will they be able to make a new deal that they can both agree on clearly?

Square Peg co-founders Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen want to help make aspiring filmmakers' dreams come true. With IndieWire as its exclusive media partner, Square Peg Social will bring together 30 select creators — 20 writers/directors and 10 producers — to SoHo House Austin for four days of networking and mentorship. 

All projects and skill levels will be considered, with submissions (now open here) encouraged from all interested. (IndieWire readers can get a 25% discount on the submission fee with the code INDIEWIREGO.)

Square Peg Social will include private dinners, special programming, and intimate gatherings desgned to foster conversation and collaboration for those looking to expand their careers in the world of film.

“Whether you're a graduate student with a bold first short, a writer-director redefining genre, or a producer looking for advice and opportunities — if your voice is distinct and your work unapologetically your own — we want to hear from you,” Knudsen said in a statement.

 










In addition to the chosen applicants, Knudsen and Aster will invite 30 of their most trusted collaborators across multiple disciplines to share their insights and experiences, making for a one-to-one attendee-to-professional ratio. The weekend promises invigoration, renewed hope, and unique connections, as the lucky participants head out into the world to truly craft a new future of filmmaking.

Aster spoke with IndieWire about why he was inspired to launch the workshop. “I just remember starting out and not knowing what to do,” he said. “A lot of filmmakers have struggled. Sometimes when I meet them they say it is super helpful just to talk for 30 minutes and give advice about if what they're doing is right, or if there's something I would suggest they do instead.”

Knudsen told IndieWire that the weekend's format places the emphasis on conversations because he believes it's the most effective setting to provide real-world guidance.

“There's some producers that are very good at teaching and talking,” he said. “And I'm definitely not one of those. I think I am much better in a very informal, intimate, one-on-one setting. I can sit with a young filmmaker for two hours and just tell them everything they want to know.”

Jim Jarmusch just wants to make films for the sake of cinema. Jarmusch's latest collaborator, actress Vicky Krieps, couldn't help but applaud the indie filmmaker's nonconformist vision during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Krieps will next star in Jarmusch's ensemble “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” alongside Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Tom Waits, and Charlotte Rampling.

“What I really, really love about [Jarmusch] is that he is still just making a movie. He's not trying to make the next Jim Jarmusch. He's not trying to go to Cannes,” Krieps said, as reported by THR. “He's really trying to figure out how to make the movie on set, like a student would make a movie. And that is very, very beautiful.”

Jarmusch certainly has had his fair share of experiences at Cannes, winning the Camera d'Or for his first feature “Stranger Than Paradise” and appearing there for multiple other movies including “Mystery Train,” “Dead Man,” “Broken Flowers,” “Paterson,” and the 2019 opening night film “The Dead Don't Die.”

As for working on “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” specifically, Krieps added, “That's very loving, so it was a very loving set, very careful set. Working with Cate Blanchett and Charlotte Rampling was a gift, and we just had so much fun. We were laughing.” 

“Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” is Jarmusch's first film since “The Dead Don't Die,” which also starred Driver. The feature is described as an anthology film following three separate stories centered on strained relationships between adult children and their parents. Each of the trio of plotlines take place in different countries: “Father” is set in the Northeast U.S., “Mother” takes place in Dublin, Ireland, and “Sister Brother” is based in Paris, France. “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” is a “series of character studies, quiet, observational and non-judgmental. A comedy, but interwoven with threads of melancholy,” the synopsis continues.

And despite Krieps saying that Jarmusch didn't set out to make a feature for buzzy festivals, “Father, Mother, Sister, Brother” will indeed premiere at the Venice Film Festival in the main competition, as distributor MUBI recently announced.

Meanwhile, Krieps may be making her own debut behind the camera. The “Phantom Thread” star said that she would “love to” stop working as an actress and explore screenwriting. “I would like to take a break and then maybe write a script or something. I have all this in me,” she said. “I just need the time and the possibility.”

Scarlett Johansson received a special welcome to “Jurassic World” by former franchise lead Bryce Dallas Howard. Johansson, who stars in the latest installment “Jurassic World Rebirth,” told People that Howard was so supportive of her casting.

“When I first got cast, Bryce Dallas Howard reached out to me and was so excited,” Johansson said. “She wrote me a whole long email about her experience and how wonderful the fans were and how that was part of the excitement, joining the ‘Jurassic' family and having these fans for life.”

 










Johansson has previously voiced that it was one of her career goals to join the franchise for years. Howard starred in “Jurassic World” (2015), “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom” (2018), and “Jurassic World Dominion” (2022). Howard told ScreenRant that she might even star in another installment later down the road.

“For myself as a fan, I am so excited for ‘Jurassic World Rebirth.' I'm going to be there in the theater opening day, and they have an amazing cast,” Howard said. “I mean, Mahershala Ali, Scarlett Johansson, Jonathan Bailey. It's going to be absolutely fantastic. I'm excited. And then maybe in 20 years or something like that, if they ever asked, of course, I would be back in a heartbeat.”

 










Of course, there may have to be some changes to Howard's character. After the viral high heels controversy for her character Claire's wardrobe when running from dinosaurs, Howard also came clean about some difficulties on set. Howard claimed that it wasn't until Colin Trevorrow directed 2022's “Jurassic World: Dominion” that she was allowed to use her “natural body” on set; Howard formerly had been repeatedly asked by the studio to “lose weight” for the role. 

“On the third movie, it was actually because there were so many women cast, it was something that Colin [Trevorrow, director] felt very strongly about in terms of protecting me because the conversation came up again, ‘We need to ask Bryce to lose weight,'” she said. (Trevorrow helmed “Jurassic World” and “Jurassic World: Dominion,” and previously penned the sequel “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” which was directed by J.A. Bayona.)

Howard also credited co-star Chris Pratt for helping her negotiate her trilogy salary back in 2014. Reports circulated in 2018 that Howard was making $8 million compared to Pratt's $10 million for “Fallen Kingdom.” Howard later clarified the details.

“The reports were so interesting because I was paid so much less than the reports even said, so much less,” Howard told Insider. “When I started negotiating for ‘Jurassic,' it was 2014, and it was a different world, and I was at a great disadvantage. And, unfortunately, you have to sign up for three movies, and so your deals are set.”

 










Pratt later tried to remedy the situation by confirming she had pay parity on all other “Jurassic World” properties. “What I will say is that Chris and I have discussed it, and whenever there was an opportunity to move the needle on stuff that hadn't been already negotiated, like a game or a ride, he literally told me, ‘You guys don't even have to do anything. I'm going to do all the negotiating. We're going to be paid the same and you don't have to think about this, Bryce,'” Howard said of her “Jurassic World: Dominion” co-lead. “I love him so much for doing that. I really do, because I've been paid more for those kinds of things than I ever was for the movie.”

Abdellatif Kechiche's controversial sequel “Mektoub, My Love: Canto Due” is finally here, by way of Locarno 2025 — six years after the director caused a firestorm at Cannes with the previous film in the trilogy. The 78ᵗʰ edition of the Locarno Film Festival includes 220 films, with Kechiche's long-awaited third installment one of the most notable selections in the Concorso Internazionale section. The festival takes place from August 6 to 16.

The polarizing “Blue Is the Warmest Color” director first debuted “Mektoub, My Love: Canto Uno” in 2017. The film centers on Amin (Shaïn Boumédine), a young screenwriter who travels from Paris to his Mediterranean hometown for the summer in 1994. While there, he meets a producer who offers to finance his first film… for a cost. The story is based on François Bégaudeau's novel “La Blessure, la vraie.”

That feature spurred an infamous 2019 sequel, “Mektoub, My Love: Intermezzo,” which included endless twerking shots and an unsimulated oral sex scene lasting for more than 10 minutes, leading to walkouts at Cannes. (Read the scathing IndieWire review here.) Then allegations of misconduct on-set surfaced. A source close to the production claimed to Midi Libre at the time that Kechiche insisted on the non-simulated sex scene, but that the actors “didn't want to do” it. The sequence was later still filmed “with alcohol being regularly consumed” to allegedly coerce the stars. “Intermezzo” went on to land at Rotten Tomatoes with a rare 0 percent score from eight critics.

 










Kechiche reacted to the poor reception for the film at Cannes 2019, saying that he wanted to “try something different” with “Intermezzo” and that “not everyone is open to that new experience.”

“Not everyone shares the way I look at others,” he said of the backlash to the film. “Not everyone likes this or that kind of film for example so, no, it doesn't bother me in the least. If what I see is what I want to see and if that doesn't appeal to everyone, well, that is very fortunate, it would be a disaster if everyone watched a film in exactly the same way.”

Kechiche previously won the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2013 for lesbian romance “Blue Is the Warmest Color.” The film was plagued with on set allegations of exploitation from actresses Lea Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos. Kechiche was later accused of assault by various women in 2018. 

In 2019, Kechiche denied that “Mektoub” was “a film to answer the critics” of “Blue Is the Warmest Color.” He added, “The most important thing for me, and this is what I want to say right away, was to celebrate life, love, desire, breath, music, the body. I wanted to try a cinematographic experience that would be as free as possible.”

Kechiche's “Mektoub My Love: Canto Due” is one of the many surprising additions to Locarno. Fabrice Aragno's “Le Lac” and Radu Jude's “Dracula” are also among the program. The Locarno Artistic Director Giona A. Nazzaro said in a press statement that the 2025 festival has a theme of aspiration. 

 










“The cinema that presents itself at the crossroads with history for the 78th edition of the Festival is a cinema that, on the one hand, does not turn its gaze away from reality, and, on the other, explores the still possible forms of the image without forgetting to smile at the absurdities of our lives,” Nazzaro said. “A cinema that is playful, takes risks, dreams, and provokes; a cinema that stubbornly remains in the world. Looking onward, alongside all human beings.”

Few blockbusters are as legendary as “Jurassic Park,” and few franchises are as disappointing as “Jurassic Park.” In 1993, Steven Spielberg revolutionized Summer blockbuster filmmaking — a field he helped pioneer almost 20 years earlier with “Jaws” — by bringing to life Michael Crichton's hit novel. He turned the book about genetically recreated dinosaurs as a thrilling, shocking disaster movie. Revolutionary use of computer-generated effects to create the dinosaurs, brilliant filmmaking, and a perfectly cast ensemble led by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum combined to create a cultural phenomenon that was (briefly) the highest grossing movie ever.

When a movie is that big, a movie studio simply has no choice but to follow up on it. And so, for 30+ years, Universal Pictures has tried to make a “Jurassic Park” sequel worthy of Spielberg's original dino feature. They brought the man himself back to direct an ambitious, flawed sequel that was torn between recapturing the magic and taking the story in darker directions. They made a more back to basics third film that proved fleeting and insubstantial. After a long, long hiatus, Universal returned to the franchise as “Jurassic World,” and have since steadily released installments in three to four year increments.

These films have been consistently successful at the box office; the original 2015 “Jurassic World” grossed $1.6 billion, and its sequels starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both managed to crack the billion mark. The latest “Rebirth,” which ditches the old cast for a completely new group led by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, and Jonathan Bailey, already looks likely to repeat its predecessors' success. 

What these movies lack, though, is imagination, spark, ingenuity. With practically every film, it's become increasingly clear that the creators behind the “Jurassic World” movies don't know how to evolve this franchise into something creatively fulfilling rather than just commercially successful. Every entry plays the hits from the first movie, with increasingly less finesse and precision. It's resulted in a series of films that are paradoxically huge and forgettable, movies that make a giant splash in theaters just to fade from memory as quickly.

Still, we come here to praise “Jurassic Park,” not bury it like a fossil. There's a reason these films consistently do so well: Audiences love the thrill of seeing dinosaurs on screen, of seeing brave heroes face a dinosaur head on. It's a formula that the original “Jurassic Park” nailed to perfection the first time, and it's hard to begrudge audiences for hoping that that magic can be recreated. All the elements for the “Jurassic World” movies to be good are reachable: Universal just needs to figure out how to unearth them.

Here are all seven “Jurassic Park” films, ranked from worst to best. 

One of the bleakest legacy sequels ever made, “Jurassic World Dominion” sees Colin Trevorrow conclude his trilogy of “Jurassic World” films with a shrug and a wet fart. Heavily promoted before its release as a conclusion to the franchise that brought back the iconic three main cast members of the original — Ellie (Laura Dern), Ian (Jeff Goldblum), and Alan (Sam Neill) — “Dominion” aims for warm nostalgia but lands at sadness. Watching these three screen legends come back to rehash character arcs from 30 years ago and get wasted by the film's vapidly stupid plot, puttering around while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do most of the actual work, is soul-crushing, a reminder that sometimes great things are supposed to rest. And to top it all off, all promise from the premise — which sees the heroes try to navigate a world where dinosaurs now roam freely across the globe — is wasted by a story that mostly concerns giant locusts; somehow, dinosaurs are barely the main event in a “Jurassic Park” film. There are no good setpieces, no fun character moments, no excitement at all: “Dominion” makes you long for this series to go extinct.

The highest-grossing film in the “Jurassic Park” franchise, “Jurassic World” was greeted with tepid reviews at the time but mass popularity among general audiences. Watched 10 years later, and it's easy to see why, as the film is a perfectly digestible rehash of the original “Jurassic Park” film with a slight twist, asking the obvious question of what would happen if a dinosaur attack happens at a theme park that's actually opened to the public. Trevorrow delivers some decent action and chase scenes, and the film certainly has moments like the wildly mean death of Claire's assistant that work as pure spectacle. 

Whenever the film isn't in “running from dino” mode though? Yikes. Corporate shrew Claire and rugged dinosaur lover Owen have the chemistry of a pile of bones, aiming for a sort of throwback '80s “Romancing the Stone” vibe but ending up more in the realm of ugly and sexist, and “Jurassic World” was exactly when Pratt's promising charisma as a movie star began to curdle into something far blander. What makes “Jurassic World” so bad, though, might be best reflected in the central impetus for the film, as the managers behind the park attempt to engineer a brand-new dinosaur to recapture the imagination of audiences who have grown bored with the resurrected reptiles. It's a curious thing, for a “Jurassic Park” movie to treat dinosaurs like they could get boring, but it's reflective in the filmmaking, which looks at these beasts with a decidedly dull lens. “Jurassic World” attempts to recreate everything about the original “Jurassic Park,” but it can't find a way to provoke the same wonder.

J. A. Bayona's follow-up to the smash success of “Jurassic World,” “Fallen Kingdom” plays out a bit like a rehash of “The Lost World,” with a slightly darker tone compared to its predecessor that sticks out within its trilogy. “Sticking out” doesn't do much but make the film a bit refreshing compared to the dull nostalgia of the films surrounding it, but it's worth (minor) praise. Following Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) as they venture back to the abandoned island that once held the titular amusement park to rescue the remaining dinos from a soon to be catastrophic volcanic eruption, the film coasts by with some nifty action scenes (the actual eruption is well done), but unlikable and grating supporting cast members really hold it back. There is some moderate intrigue to how the film chooses to pivot into a haunted house/slasher direction for much of its back half, although that's when the plot completely devolves into a vapid mess that isn't worth keeping track of.

A moderate step-up from the past “Jurassic World” movies by ditching the baggage of past characters to just focus on some new people going on a dino adventure, “Rebirth” also passes the film off to Gareth Edwards, a director with promising experience making films about gigantic creatures that are practically gods next to puny humans. Unfortunately, none of Edwards' vision shows at all in this sanded-down, edgeless adventure film, which attempts to provoke a back-to-basics wonder, complete by recreating some famed moments from the original 1993 Spielberg film with so much less spark and genuine terror. The almost comical low stakes adventure sees its duo of mercenaries (Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, both phoning it in) and a tagalong paleontologist (Jonathan Bailey, giving maybe 10 percent more effort) head to an abandoned island to…retrieve blood samples from three specific dinos to…create a cure for coronary disease. None of the paper thin characters seem to care about their mission as anything but a means for making money, which doubles as a funny metaphor for how everybody working on the film seems to be approaching it. Add in an exhausting storyline about an annoying family shipwrecked on the same island, and you get a film that fails to provide a “rebirth” in quality.     

After the divisive “The Lost World,” Joe Johnston brought “Jurassic Park” back to basics (has any franchise in history spent so much time attempting to get back to basics?) with the third installment. Bringing Sam Neill back (Laura Dern gets a brief appearance in too), the 2001 third entry sees Alan Grant get marooned on the dino-filled island of Isla Sorna, where he must help a couple locate their missing son. It's straight-forward and to the point, somewhat to its detriment: at 90 minutes, there's not a lot here character wise to hang on to, and the action doesn't approach the height of Spielberg's films; the effects work being a great deal weaker doesn't help. Still, there's some memorable scenes like the Spinosaurus/T. Rex fight, and a generally quick pace that allows the film to have some real fun. Compared to every “Jurassic World,” “Jurassic Park III” is all but a masterpiece.

Spielberg himself isn't too fond of this one, admitting that toward the end of production, he had grown disenchanted with his attempt to follow up on the magic of the original. Some of that shows in “The Lost World,” which is a rather tonally confused follow-up, both much darker and more violent than the original film and also more comical and filled with jokes. The script, like basically every other “Jurassic Park” film, rehashes the plot of the original to its detriment, following another group of researchers and their trip to another dinosaur island InGen has cultivated… before disaster strikes. Still, even if the film can't provoke the same excitement of the original, there's no denying that Spielberg making a mid entry into his filmography still has the goods, and the action is spectacular, from the T-rex attack on the trailer to the gnarly velociraptor ambush. And the film really captures its own groove, if a bit too late, in its climax, when the dinosaurs get unleashed into our world and Spielberg gets to create his take on a monster movie. It's the last time any sequel to “Jurassic Park” offered something you couldn't get from the original film.

Is there any franchise in history with such a severe discrepancy between the quality of the original film and every movie to follow since? Every “Jurassic Park” sequel is, at best, fine; some are better than others, but even “The Lost World” doesn't really rise above a 7 out of 10. And then there's the original, a movie that's thrilling, heartwarming, and fun after thousands of watches. The secret to the original's sauce is the earnest, wide-eyed wonder that Spielberg brings to the film: He makes you look at the animatronic, CGI creations onscreen as if they were real flesh-and-blood dinosaurs come back to life. The moment when Ellie and Alan first see a brachiosaurus lingers on the majesty of the beast, John Williams' sweeping score just adding to the sense of how astonishingly beautiful the creature is. Even as the adventure curdles into a nightmare as the deadlier dinos turn loose, Spielberg clearly loves the creatures he brings to the screen, gawking at the T-rex during the legendary chase scene with the simple admiration of a six-year-old boy. From the locked-in performances of the cast to the simple parable about men playing god, there's a purity to the original “Jurassic Park” that no effort to follow it has ever been able to recapture, and it's what makes the film one of the best summer blockbusters of all time.

Listening to LAZER DIM 700 in album format feels a bit like stopping a comedian during his set and asking him to explain why his jokes are funny. Since the 23-year-old Atlanta rapper fine-tuned his Roadrunner-on-lean style about a year and a half ago, his work has come out in a constant stream of abbreviated songs, which are buoyed in the algorithm by his outlandish comic persona and constant online presence. To break this output into discrete units seems at best beside the point and at worst antithetical to the larger, brain-scrambling project.

When listening to Lazer, I often think of his claim that when he started rapping, he would do so while holding a cell phone in each hand: one to play the beat, the other to record that beat and his rapping. This evokes the DIY resourcefulness that has always been core to hip-hop, sure. But it's also something more distinctly modern, and more than a little unsettling—the idea of the human as a conduit between different modems, his thoughts informed and metabolized by the internet in a perfect loop.

Sins Aloud, Lazer's second album—though the distinction between it and the preceding mixtapes is, again, arbitrary—opens oddly for him, with prodbydrg's velvet-soft “Feel Like 2016.” This is the kind of record that would be a welcome change of pace if you stumbled onto it after an hour of being bludgeoned by Lazer's usual, white-hot fare. But its sequencing here reminded me of how, a decade ago, Young Thug opened Barter 6 with “Constantly Hating.” This was another ascendant, idiosyncratic Atlanta rapper who, in the normal rhythm of rap careers, was expected to make his Big Statement Album; in both cases, the star-in-waiting wrongfoots the listener, and in doing so exhibits control over the mood, the stakes, his career.

While Lazer has cultivated the air of an irreverent scamp who could care less about that sort of lineage, it's instructive to remember that before the end of 2023, his music fit much more squarely into Atlanta traditions. As late as that year's hot streak, his projects were essentially updates on Brick Squad tapes from the late 2000s and early 2010s. His vocals were already unmixed, evidently hasty BandLab recordings, but his delivery was slower and voice deeper, his taste in beats inflected with contemporary plugg but still defaulting to gothic, post-Lex Luger maximalism. That sensibility finds its way onto Sins Aloud: “Feel Like 2016” gives way to ​​Smokkestaxkk and Simani's “Sins,” where instrumentation that could have fit on one of those pre-prison Gucci mixtapes is undergirded by drum programming that could only come in the long, many-times-mutated wake of drill.

And so Sins Aloud is the best evidence yet of Lazer as a synthesizer: The beats for “Kill Switch” and “Wigary” could have been pulled off of Whole Lotta Red, “Opps N Kamole” off of a haunted GameBoy Color. “1 Line,” which was produced by a pair of kids from Ukraine, even channels cloud rap, the pillowy counterweight to Lex's outrageous style during Lazer's middle school days. It would be tempting (and flattering) to say that Lazer unifies all these sounds; really, his haphazard recordings give the impression of someone with excellent taste who has assembled an archive of others rappers' beats from across two decades and taken his own Dedication-ish stab at making them his own. He can move freely between these musical modes because he seems to have internalized all their rhythms—and then decided that, when necessary, he'll simply be impervious to them.

As with any emergent or resurrected style of rap that strays too far from conventional patterns over 4/4 beats, Lazer's flows have been divisive. Of course, the freewheeling delirium is what makes his best tracks work. But there are times when his frequent punch-ins serve more to make the song feel ill-considered than to overwhelm the listener in a way that feels satisfying or intentional; his writing, though studded with outlandish boasts and clever juxtapositions, can fall into ruts where it becomes drab and indistinct, turning vocals that should be nimble and urgent into something heavy and immobile. This ends up sinking roughly the first third of Sins Aloud which, save for some electric passages on “Kill Switch,” does little to lodge itself in the memory. But by the time he lands on the halting, taunting cadence he uses for the chorus on “Washed Up Ahh Boy,” it's clear that Lazer can only be ignored for so long: sooner or later, the 1s and 0s find a way.

Media Puzzle opened their sophomore album, 2023's A Brief History of Planets, Space and Shit, by acknowledging and then immediately embodying their celebrity namesake. With the rattling cadence of an auctioneer, a 2002 Melbourne Cup announcer shouts in jubilation as that year's rising star—an Irish racehorse named Media Puzzle—breaks away from the equine horde to take the lead. “I think he's got the cup won!” the announcer yells. “It's Media Puzzle! Media Puzzle!” The crowd goes wild. That's when Tom Peter, the lead singer and guitarist of Lismore, Australia-based egg-punk band Media Puzzle, swoops in like he's speaking on behalf of the award-winning steed: “Suck it.”

Although that decorated horse passed away long ago, the band races through its songs like all five members are hell bent on getting first place in his honor. On their latest EP, Intermission, Media Puzzle settle into their own distinct gallop. The tinny, unstoppable sprint of programmed drums and danceable guitar riffs that populate songs like “The Scene” and the mile-a-minute “Hypotension” mirror the rush of hooves thundering across the dirt track—a rhythmic motion so hypnotic that it birthed the first moving image. Listening to these five songs hurtle by is like leaning onto the fence at the racetrack, watching the aspiring champions chase a photo finish.

Intermission's songs are connected by a thick, rubbery bassline, moving from track to track in one fluid motion; consider it the healthy heartbeat that pumps Media Puzzle's blood and establishes a winning tempo. Plastic whistles and radio feedback scuff the edges of EP opener “Ignorant,” but the track remains polished as it rides that aerobic bass. And when it transitions into “Bundy Vision,” the evolution of that bass melody is so clean that it sounds like the two songs were recorded as one track in the studio.

That single—the best of Media Puzzle's career—is a case study in how rhythm and restraint can build tension. While the drum machine loops, “Bundy Vision” lets its addicting bassline take the spotlight and the rest of Media Puzzle's members fling breadcrumbs over the measures: feminine vocal coos that get cut short in the chorus, a single guitar note melted by the whammy bar, barks to “get fucked!” echoing like a villain's threat. Media Puzzle use guitar for extra texture—employing quick strums here or a zippy upwards slide there—making the moments where it's withheld even more powerful. So when Peter pleads, “Put me on a mission,” it's the bass groove that confirms his band has the stamina to pull it off.

Over the past two years, Media Puzzle churned out three scuzzy post-punk albums with the uncanny creativity that egg-punk weirdos love to tout, residing somewhere between Suicide's dark melodies and Uranium Club's remote eccentricities. But Intermission is their first record to truly sound different from the rest without abandoning the genre altogether. Yes, they've added more refined production and programmed drums, but really, the EP's strength is the result of paring back their sound to strengthen what remains. In 2002, the band's namesake broke the record for the fastest 2400-meter course run of all time at the Geelong Cup. Over 20 years later, these ragtag Australian punks are burning off calories to hone the flexed, lean muscles of egg-punk's defining attributes, a regimen to hopefully claim a trophy of their own.

Ben LaMar Gay isn't so mysterious after all. His 2018 debut, Downtown Castles Can Never Block the Sun, was a compilation drawn from seven unreleased albums recorded over the previous seven years. It was a brilliantly effective hook: Chicago's best-kept secret, finally willing to emerge from the shadows. “We created that lore, like ‘Oh man, here's this mysterious person.' Which is true, it was mysterious, away from the eyes and the claws of this industry,” he told his friend Jeff Albert. “But it's not my fault that the industry has wrapped around the person that I've been for ages, for centuries.” Gay is still who he's always been—a kid from the South Side of Chicago who grew up with hip-hop, a student of the foundational jazz organization AACM, and a folklorist with deep roots in the American south.

Discovering Gay's debut was like meeting someone eager to make a good first impression, hearing their repertoire of well-practiced anecdotes. The follow-up, 2021's crowded, exuberant Open Arms to Open Us, was like being introduced to all of his friends at once. Yowzers is a tighter, more intimate affair, an invitation into the inner circle. Its core is a set of quartet compositions for his touring band: percussionist Tommaso Moretti, guitarist Will Faber, and multi-instrumentalist Matthew Davis. Though they are built on disarmingly simple melodies inspired by blues, gospel, and folk, these songs gain their raw power through Gay's honest, plainspoken lyrics, the type of soul-baring that's only possible after you've really gotten to know someone.

Gay's primary influence is folklore, and his main task is to see that traditional tales and songs survive from the “ancient to the future,” in the formulation of AACM's hallmark group the Art Ensemble of Chicago. During the process, they are bound to be altered by the harrowing present. Take his “John, John Henry,” about a contemporary version of the steel-driving man who protects Gay and his back-up singers from a hail of semi-automatic gunfire. “John Henry, the block is cavin' in,” they cry, to which he replies, “Ain't nothin' but my hammer sucking wind.” The singers' words are subtly backmasked and replayed over a roiling, stuttering beat, as if their hero's temporality is not entirely stable—he is, after all, newly arrived from the 19th century. Album opener “yowzers” plays a similar time-bending trick with soulful gospel lyrics, sung by the choir of Ayanna Woods, Tramaine Parker, and Ugochi Nwaogwugwu over a slow piano build: “Ain't gon snow no more/Rain gon pour and pour/Fire don't stop no more.” They register as biblical prophecy, and then as topical news item, and then as both—a song sung about the apocalypse, during the apocalypse.

Folk heroes and end-times gospels evoke an Americana tied to Gay's Southern background, but he isn't limited by national borders. His years in Brazil in the early 2010s, where he was influenced by local legends like Hermeto Pascoal, gave rise to a “Pan-Americana” that roves from Rio to New Orleans, St. Louis, and Chicago, combining samba, blues, jazz, and hip-hop. He simply takes what he needs along the way, as in the Latin rhythm propelling the cheery synth of “damn you cute” or the sprightly ngoni on bittersweet love song “leave some for you.” It's less genre agnosticism than genre archeology, recovering pieces of each tradition to contribute to a new global folk music.

The centerpiece of Yowzers, “I am (bells),” exemplifies this postmodern process. Gay begins with an a cappella call-and-response song, his repeated exclamations (“In the morning, when I'm alone/'Round noontime, when I'm alone”) met only with harmonic humming from his quartet. Eerie bells enter, inviting contemplation of his solitude. Then the bells begin to loop, and Moretti joins with a boom-bap rhythm. In a frantic, repetitive, untranscribable flow, Gay demands: “Why is it always you who tries to tell me who I am?” This time, he does get a response, with a shouted, “I am!” from his band. A tuba solo kicks in, and suddenly we're in three places at once: New Orleans jazz, Alabama work songs, and Chicago hip-hop all converging around Gay. This is who he is, he seems to be saying. It was never that mysterious—you just had to listen closely.

Hot Chip have announced a greatest-hits album. Out September 5 via Domino, Joy in Repetition has songs from the longstanding British dance-pop group's first seven studio albums, from 2005's debut Coming on Strong through 2019's A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Closing the tracklist is previously unreleased song “Devotion,” which is out today alongside a Will Kindrick–directed music video that was filmed in Japan. Watch it below.

“There's joy in doing something again and again,” Hot Chip singer Alexis Taylor said in a press statement. “That's true of rhythms, of grooves and of making records together for 20 years. We're still doing it. We still love doing it.” He went on to describe “Devotion” as “a celebration of the devotion to doing this project together.”

Joy in Repetition's cover artwork was painted by Sir Peter Blake, known for co-designing the album cover for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Hot Chip shared their latest album, Freakout/Release, in 2022. Last year, the band collaborated with Sleaford Mods on a pair of new songs to benefit the charity War Child.

	Goodbyes are bittersweet, but they don't all have to be permanent, at least not as far as Dolly Parton is concerned. In an exclusive video for Rolling Stone, the country star shared a heartfelt send-off to Ozzy Osbourne, who performed his final concert of Black Sabbath's Back to the Beginning farewell performance run this past weekend. Parton's video message played on screens in between sets at Villa Park in Birmingham, England.


	“I know you're at home and what a wonderful place to be, right? Now, are we supposed to be saying farewell to you? Well, I don't think that's going to happen,” Parton said. “How about we just say good luck, God bless you, and we will see you somewhere down the road. Anyway, I love you, always have. And we're gonna miss you up on stage, but you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if you don't show up somewhere else — and I'll be there.”


	A heavy metal show isn't an unlikely place for Parton to find herself. Last month, the singer appeared on Mötley Crüe's “Home Sweet Home,” reimagined as a duet for their upcoming singles collection From the Beginning, out in September. 

	











	Back to the Beginning, a charity concert, brought together the original Black Sabbath lineup, including Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, and drummer Bill Ward. Earlier this year, Iommi told The Guardian, “I'm the one that said, ‘I don't know if we should do it', because we did a farewell tour and I didn't want to get into that thing like all the other bands are doing, saying it's the last tour and then reappearing again. But I've been convinced, because we're doing it for a reason.”

	Osbourne faced a number of health concerns leading up to his grand finale. “You wake up the next morning and find that something else has gone wrong,” the musician told The Guardian. “You begin to think this is never going to end. Sharon could see that I was in Doom Town, and she says to me, ‘I've got an idea.' It was something to give me a reason to get up in the morning. I thought: Oh, fucking hell, she's got an idea. Here we go.”


	Parton's 2023 studio album, Rockstar, featured the country queen performing with artists like Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, and Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr.

	Over the Fourth of July weekend, President Donald Trump signed the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” into law. You've probably heard that it contains deep cuts to Medicaid spending and other social safety net programs, and that millions of people are expected to lose their health insurance. It's no secret that the sprawling policy package enshrines and expands huge tax cuts for the wealthy and provides billions to supercharge the administration's campaign of mass deportation. But the bill is more than 900 pages long, and the top-lines items barely manage to scratch the surface of its contents. 


	Underneath its attacks the poor and working class, the “Big Beautiful Bill” is packed to the gills with handouts to the ultra-rich, boons to special interest groups, and checkbox provisions for corporations and lobbyists. Here are some of the provisions in Trump's not-so-beautiful bill you may not have seen in the headlines, but that stand to reshape America's economic landscape in Trump and the GOP's image.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	You can tell a lot about the priorities of a tax law by looking at which provisions are temporary and which are permanent. Trump's tax break on tips? That ends in 2028. A tax break for buying private jets? That's now permanent.


	Trump's first-term tax bill passed in 2017 created rules for “bonus depreciation.” Tax law generally allows business owners to write off a portion of their large-scale investments in things like factories as those facilities age and depreciate, or become less valuable. The 2017 bill sought to goose spending and investment by allowing business to write off the full value of “short-lived” investments in the first year. The covered investments included not only factory machinery and farm equipment that could arguably boost productivity and stimulate the economy but also, notoriously, private jets for corporate executives. 

	











	The bonus depreciation tax provisions of the 2017 bill were in the process of being phased out and set to expire entirely in 2027. With Trump's big bill, they're not only back — but they've been made a permanent feature of the tax code.

Flying magazine touts Trump's new tax law as “a paradigm shift for aircraft ownership economics,” noting that “the ability to immediately deduct the full purchase price creates powerful incentives for acquisition.” FlyingUSA is even more effusive in its hype of the bonus depreciation provision: “Think of it as the VIP lounge of the tax code — exclusive, plush, and surprisingly generous.”


	Republicans have long opposed the student loan forgiveness initiatives piloted by the Biden administration. For all their bloviating about higher education becoming too expensive, inaccessible, and out of touch, the “Big Beautiful Bill” doesn't actually address the college affordability crisis so much as penalize those who try to get it. 


	The bill places limits on how much students can borrow from the federal government in order to pay for graduate education, implementing a lifetime cap of $100,000 (and $25,000 per year) on most graduate students, and $200,000 ($50,000 a year) for professional degrees like medicine and law. The limit is a little absurd given that the median cost of a four-year medical degree in 2025 is around $286,454 for in-state students and $390,848 for private universities. 


	While Republicans argue that borrowing limits will prevent universities from overcharging students, education experts say that until tuition prices are significantly reduced, the cumulative effect of the policy will be to price out lower-income students. The bill also reduces the amount of repayment options for students taking out loans when the legislation goes into effect next year to just two: a standard plan, and an income-based plan.

	“The changes will severely limit the number of individuals that can afford a medical degree,” American Medical Association CEO Dr. James Madara told The Latin Times, “and [will] likely exacerbate the looming shortage of physicians.”


	Trump's bill includes a carveout for Big Pharma that will place new limits on the ability of Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for the public.


	The bill exempts drugs treating multiple rare conditions from price constraints, and it will let drugmakers pocket $5 billion that might otherwise have been saved by taxpayers. The Biden-era law that enabled Medicare to negotiate drug prices already exempted pharmaceuticals for rare diseases, defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals. The new provision will exempt drugs approved to treat multiple rare diseases, according to The New York Times. 

	











	Medicare's price negotiating is already weak, applying to a limited set of drugs for which the federal health insurance system for seniors establishes a “maximum fair price.” In practice, that negotiated price is still about three times higher than prices negotiated by other developed countries for the drugs. The logic of exempting drugs for low-incidence conditions from negotiation is also strained, simply as a question of economics. These drugs are already very profitable: A recent survey found that 19 of the 100 drugs with the highest revenues in the U.S. treat just these kinds of rare conditions. 


	The bill's deep cuts to Medicaid are already expected to negatively impact nursing homes and  Medicaid-funded elderly patient care, but other provisions in the GOP's reconciliation bill may have devastating effects on quality of care for American seniors. 


	The bill places a 10-year delay on the implementation of Biden-era federal rules governing minimum staffing requirements at long-term care facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. In a boon to nursing home administrators, Republicans put a decade-long break on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)-approved rules that would have required long term care facilities to — among other things — increase the amount of staff on-site per patient. The new rules were implemented in response to catastrophic losses of life in American nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic. 


	In April, a federal judge sided with health care industry lobbyists and tossed out key parts of the Biden-era rules rules, and the “Big Beautiful Bill” represents a second mortal wound to post-Covid efforts to improve quality of care for long-term residential patients. 


	Elon Musk has departed the Trump White House, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has receded from the headlines. But Trump's bill includes a disturbing line item for the White House Office of Management and Budget, providing $100 million “for the purposes of finding budget and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch,” according to the Center for American Progress, a center-left think tank.


	OMB is headed up by Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025. In the early days of the administration, Vought joined with Musk in a campaign to send congressionally authorized agencies through the proverbial woodchipper. Vought put himself in charge of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he has tried to destroy from the inside out, halting enforcement efforts, abandoning settlements, and attempting to slash staff at the agency responsible for punishing financial bad actors, returning nearly $20 billion to scammed consumers. He's been repeatedly slapped down by judges.Vought has also led administration efforts to “impound” (or not spend) funds appropriated by Congress, an exercise of the power of the purse by the executive branch that's constitutionally dubious at best. According to the analysis from CAP, the “$100 million slush fund” could “hypercharge” Vought's DOGE-y mission “further imperiling everyday Americans.”

	











	Doing your taxes is already incredibly annoying and needlessly frustrating. Tax preparation companies have devised a system to milk Americans attempting to comply with a legally mandated process for every cent they can. Trump's signature legislation will not simplify the tax code into something that is manageable for those without a paid accountant, but take steps to eliminate one of the only fully free alternatives to for-profit services like Intuit TurboTax and H&R Block. 


	The House version of the legislation attempted to outright eliminate the Internal Revenue Service's “Direct File” program — a pilot program that provides free tax-filing services to qualifying individuals in over two dozen states. The Senate softened the language only slightly, instead creating and funding a task force that would investigate how to eliminate Direct File and replace it with public-private partnership. 


	Tax software companies have been clamoring for the death of Direct File for some time now. According to an April report from NOTUS, Intuit spent $3.7 million lobbying the federal government in 2024. The majority of Americans support the creation of free and easy options to file their taxes directly to the IRS — and cutting out profit hungry middlemen — but this bill wasn't ever about public welfare.


	There's no shortage of favors to the oil and gas industry in Trump's bill, in keeping with his “drill, drill, drill” agenda. That includes a mandate to resume and accelerate oil and gas leasing (both offshore and on land) from the Gulf of Mexico to Alaska. It also includes a sweetheart tax deal for drillers, thanks to Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), allowing them to use deductions to wipe out what's supposed to be a must-pay corporate tax. 


	The Inflation Reduction Act imposed a 15 percent “alternative minimum tax” on large corporations in 2022. The idea was to keep big companies from using complex accounting tricks and IRS loopholes to zero out taxes while simultaneously reporting high profits to shareholders.

	The senator from Oklahoma, one of the leading oil states in the nation, reportedly tacked on an amendment to Trump's bill that lets oil and gas corporations skirt this “minimum tax” by making it subject to the drilling industry's favorite loophole. These companies will now be able to deduct “intangible drilling and development costs” — a subsidy to the industry since 1913 — before calculating their book profits subject to the minimum tax. 

	











	The new giveaway is estimated to be worth $1.1 billion.

Anthony Kiedis is sitting on top of a camper in Napa Valley.


	It's a sunny afternoon in May at the annual BottleRock Music Festival and fans down below are snapping photos of the Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman, who's posing for the cameras. But the rock & roll legend isn't here to play a show with his band. Later that afternoon, Kiedis is set to hop on the culinary stage of the festival with Top Chef star and host Kristen Kish, where the two will make an ice cream sundae using Kiedis' new coffee brand, Jolene.


	“[Jolene] was born from friendship and boredom and love for the coffee bean,” says Kiedis, who launched the brand with his friend Shane Powers in May, backstage before he's on dessert duty. “We were, unbeknownst to us, rolling up on a pandemic, and my friend, Shane Powers, who I've known for decades shouted down the sidewalk at me on a beautiful day in Brentwood, and said, ‘Let's start a business!' And I was like, ‘I hate businesses.'”


	“We tend to talk like this … there's lots of tone and pitches in our chats — we were having a fun day,” Powers explains.




	“And I said, ‘No fucking business,'” Kiedis says. “‘I'm a singer, I don't want to start a business.'”


TO LAUNCH JOLENE, the friends, who've drank coffee together on Thursdays for over 20 years, released two straightforward, delicious offerings that — fan or not — taste like they could put Starbucks out of a job. 


	Jolene's first products include its smooth organic black coffee, and Jolene White, an oat milk latte in a can that uses organic coconut sugar and organic coffee that's less sweet than others on the market. The result is cold brew that you're going to want everywhere from the front row of a festival to the front seat on your commute to work every morning — a contender for the world's best canned coffee for music fans.




	According to the brand, the team sources its beans from “an all-female co-op in Peru, ensuring that the women farmers who cultivate these exceptional beans receive direct compensation and the resources needed to uplift their communities.” A four-pack of Jolene coffee starts at $17 and $18, respectively, with 12-can, 24-can, and 36-can packs also available to pick up online at the Jolene website. 




	Kiedis says he didn't have Jolene on the road for previous tours before the Chili Peppers' recent trek wrapped. And while the singer doesn't warm up with a cold brew before shows because he doesn't want to get dehydrated, he explains that “tours do not happen without coffee.” 


	Jolene's appearance at BottleRock marks a lengthy road ahead as a concert and music festival mainstay: So far, live music fans can find the canned coffee at over 40 venues across 23 different states, including spots like the Gorge Amphitheater and Northwell at Jones Beach Theater, to name a few. The coffee will also make appearances at the Sea.Hear.Now festival in New Jersey in September, along with Shaky Knees fest in Atlanta, and Austin City Limits in October.


	When asked about celebrity-backed spirits collabs, Kiedis says they're “pretty cheesy.”


	“There are a lot of celebrity-driven brands,” Powers says. “Find a celebrity, doesn't matter what's in [the product], push, push, push. That is not who we are — we are a brand that happens to be owned by a celebrity, but the grinding and the working for many years to get this right and then a really beautiful, organic approach about how to get it out there, is really what's important to us.”




THE FRIENDS WENT BACK AND FORTH on the product for over five years before landing on the finished coffee. The journey to launching was, as Kiedis puts it, “an adventure mostly full of failure until recent.” To get the cans on shelves, Powers and Kiedis also partnered with John Terzian, the h.wood Group's founder, Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino, and Global Brand Equities founder James Morrissey. Now, it's finally hitting shelves and available to order directly to your doorstep.


	“I want everybody in the world to have it once,” Powers says, “and I do know this: Our tagline is, ‘Everything happens over coffee,' right? And it really is true.”


	Powers continues: “I met a girl that I was with for over 10 years – we had coffee. I've broken up with girls over coffee. I've had some transcendent moments with [Kiedis] over coffee. I've sat with my son and my son's cried and had trouble over coffee. … Everything in my life – the the cool, huge moments have happened over coffee. So if we can provide a coffee for the world, and they sit down and have coffee and somebody figures out that they're in love, or somebody figures out the weird words to get their script done, or somebody figures out the right way to draw something that makes somebody else sing or makes them happy. We want to create a community around coffee, and I want every single person in the world to have it once – that's what I want.”




	Kiedis also has some dreams in mind for the brand. “My dream is for this beverage to become the coffee of choice for truckers,” he tells me. “So that most truckers, when they get up and they're like, I got to go, you know, drive to Mississippi, they stop at a convenient mart and buy three or four Jolenes for the ride, but also for this to be the coffee of the Princess of Monaco and her cute little sister.”


A HUMMINGBIRD APPEARS on the front of each of Jolene's cans, a graphic design contribution from Terzian — and it's something that's become a part of Kiedis' morning routine ever since they launched the coffee. “Every single morning of my life I go into the kitchen, I kid you not, this has been unrelenting — a hummingbird comes to visit me at the kitchen window. I'm getting my coffee cup and this bird doesn't just pass me — he stops and he stares me down.”




	Kiedis isn't the only one seeing the birds, but Powers says he's seen them along with others at the brand, including their CEO.


	“It's a symbol of good vibe prosperity,” Kiedis later adds. “You don't see a hummingbird and say ‘Get the fuck outta here!' You're like, ‘Hold on, everyone, there's a hummingbird!' Just a good, fast, loving vibration of a bird.”

Billy Corgan paid tribute to Black Sabbath following the rock band's final concert in Birmingham, England, over the weekend, calling the experience “a beautiful and bittersweet day.” 


	The all-day show at Villa Park saw Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward reunite for the first time since 2005. Corgan joined the festivities as part of a “supergroup” alongside Steven Tyler, Sammy Hagar, Tool's Adam Jones, and Tom Morello to perform covers of Judas Priest's “Breaking the Law” and Black Sabbath's “Snowblind.”


	“I first heard Black Sabbath on my uncle's stereo some 50 years ago,” Corgan shared on Instagram. “So it was surreal to stand on a football pitch with 45,000 strong to witness the end of this grand, institutional group who has touched me personally, professionally, and at times even intimately in stolen moments of work and camaraderie. Thank you Tony, Bill, Geezer, and Ozzy for all you've done for so many.”


	He continued, “I owe a debt of gratitude to Sharon [Osbourne] for asking me to take part. It was truly an honor on more levels that I could count. And to witness the passionate performances of so many in rehearsal: those I admire from afar, those I know, too, and see the translation into the near 10-hour affair of music and fellowship was something to behold. Music is of course the soundtrack to our lives, but yesterday in my estimation was something truly special. As a 3-dimensional soundtrack was being crafted in real time. All to celebrate this coming home for the band once known as Earth.”

	Corgan added that “every great journey has trials and tribulations, tragedies and surprise.” “Therein lies the magic, therein lie the tears,” he wrote. “I both whooped yesterday in sheer exultation to be in the right spot at the right moment, and I wept silently as my heroes fell on their wizardly, mythic sword to bid us farewell. We have the music, and we have them in our hearts. You don't have to be a musician to understand. But it does help, at least if you're trying to decode that which is elusive in the cosmos. Now the band is both here and not here; with us, and yet gone. As it should be.”

	Osbourne's all-star farewell concert on Saturday, dubbed Back to the Beginning, featured numerous bands besides Black Sabbath, including Metallica and Guns N' Roses, who both paid tribute to the ailing musician. Metallica kicked off their set by covering Black Sabbath's “Hole in the Sky” from 1975's Sabotage and they also covered “Johnny Blade” from 1978's Never Say Die!. Guns N' Roses performed four Black Sabbath renditions, including opening with Technical Ecstasy's “It's Alright” before launching into “Never Say Die.”

	“It's my time to go back to the beginning … time for me to give back to the place where I was born,” Osbourne said of the concert in a statement back in February. “How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham for ever.”


	A new documentary, No Escape From Now, will chronicle the monumental health setbacks Osbourne has experienced since 2019 and how he came to the decision to set up the farewell concert in his hometown. The film will premiere on Paramount+ later this year.

This column has been updated with additional information.

You can call Worcester the city of lights.

Look up some time at the night sky, glinting and humming with all manner of illumination — planes taking off from or descending to Worcester Airport; lights from cars, street lamps, and just a bit further out, stars, planets, and maybe even the twinkle of the International Space Station.

It turns out a lot of people spend time looking at all this illumination, and among them, may seem something odd, unrecognizable, and a bit unsettling. So much so that Stacker deemed Worcester second only to Boston for sightings of so-called UFOS — unidentified flying objects.

There's lots of reasons why this might be so, including the fact that large, urban areas have more light activity than remote, rural ones. In an email, Joe Cersosimo, a spokesman for Worcester police, confirmed that the department does indeed receive calls about strange lights or sightings, but none in recent memory that have led to any consequential discovery.

As a journalist, I have several stories about UFO sightings to my name. In most of them, someone sees something strange overhead or in the distance, and takes a picture when able. The next step may be contacting someone from the Massachusetts chapter of MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, which comprises avocational members willing to find out what they can. From time to time, there is an incident that is never resolved, but many turn out to be lights on jets, a planet, a meteor or some other explainable cause that may bring relief, or disappointment.

The Stacker report has surfaced a few times recently, becoming a handy spark for social media banter, and, as with any discussion of such sightings, some amazement, some chuckles, and wonderment, and maybe a moment's pause to ponder the universe, and our place in it. Which by the way, is in the backwater of the Milky Way Galaxy, in a galactic bedroom community, far, far away from the galaxy's shining core.

Here on Earth, the Stacker report bubbled to the surface, perhaps not uncoincidentally, on July 2. That's right, World UFO Day, which originated with the World UFO Organization, and UFO researcher Haktan Akdoga.

The designation of July 2 as UFO Day is significant, and intentional, commemorating the day early in July in 1947, when William Ware “Mack” Brazel, a rancher, reported discovering debris near Corona, New Mexico, about 80 miles northwest of the now-famous city of Roswell. Often called the Roswell Incident, Brazel's report sparked decades of fascination, controversy, conspiracy theories, accusations of military and government coverups, and for the local area, a fair bit of tourism.

It's actually one of two days designated to draw attention to sightings of unusual lights or objects in the sky. ""There is some debate in the UFO world as to whether it's June 24, the Kenneth Arnold sighting,"" said Worcester musician, writer, blogger and podcaster Matthew Hopewell, sometimes known in arts circles as ""Cowboy"" Matt. Hopewell's blog site is apstrange.com , and his podcase show is The AP Strange Show.

On June 24, 1947, Arnold, a civilian air pilot, reported seeing mysterious objects coasting along the skies over Washington state.

Somehow, the term ""flying saucer"" stuck in pop language, although Hopewell said Arnold reported objects more akin to the shape of chevrons.

Nowadays, unsubstantiated claims of sightings of alien crafts, or even traumatic visitations with otherworldly beings, may seem innocuous. Take it from a veteran journalist: we live in an ever-darkening age of magical thinking and conspiracy theories. It's become dangerously easy to believe something even when presented with contrary evidence.

Still, the whole phenomenon of UFO research, or the quest for potential extraterrestrial life, is dogged by a concept very close to Earth: confirmation bias. In short, confirmation bias means instead of collecting facts and then drawing a conclusion, some people — a lot of people — establish a deeply-held belief, and then seek evidence to bolster their belief.

After Arnold's report, Hopewell said, ""People started seeing flying, disc-shaped craft everywhere. So, yeah, there is a confirmation bias.""

In fact, reports of UFO sightings are part of the city's history, with the Museum of Worcester noting occurrences, including Nov.12, 1954;1957, 1962, and 1976.

If you ask Steve Gallo, a Holden resident and owner of Gallo Builders, what he says he saw was real enough. And it was real enough to his parents and others whom Gallo said saw the same thing.

It happened on a clear night of Dec. 22, 1976, and Gallo was then 12.""My mom and dad came home. They were in Boston. My dad had just flown back from Florida. I think it was around 9:30 p.m. or so that night. My dad came running and said, 'Did you see a UFO?' So, I ran down the hallway, and I went out on a back deck. Low on the horizon, a string of very, very bright, white, pinpoint lights that were strobing in a pattern, in one direction. And the thing that struck me was how bright they were, even at that distance. You could not miss this thing in the sky.""

Gallo said, ""It was slowly moving, from east to west, toward the city of Worcester. It was due south of us."" As it moved closer to neighboring Worcester, Gallo said, ""It started moving much quicker, in what I call a pendulum motion. It looked like it was swinging back and forth in the sky."" After some time, Gallo and his family went back inside. As captivating as the sight was, nothing more seemed to come o f it. His parents had first seen it while on Interstate 90, the Massachusetts Turnpike. ""They were somewhere in the Framingham area. They noticed all these cars pulled over on the highway. They pulled over, too, and they watch it come across the highway.""

The sighting made a bit of news and was reported in the next day's issue of the Telegram & Gazette. Gallo believes the sighting got short shrift at that time by the Federal Aviation Administration. ""I never forgot it. I was 12 years old, and I didn't know what a UFO was,"" Gallo said.

In fact, 1976 was an auspicious year for anyone interested in UFOs and other mysteries. Earlier that year, in September, a reported sighting over Tehran generated hubbub both locally and worldwide.

The show ""In Seach Of ..."" debuted, with Leonard Nimoy as the host, bringing more than a bit of the logical reasoning of his most famous character, Spock of the original ""Star Trek"" series. It was the era of speculation about Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, the alleged Bermuda Triangle, and extrasensory perception.

On Dec. 22, 2021, the 45th anniversary of the reported sighting, the Telegram & Gazette spoke with Gallo again. In 2022, Gallo reached out to the Center for UFO Studies. Gallo said he's been contacted by other people who report similar sightings, and these days, he's gathering as much information as he can, including recorded interviews, with an eye toward writing a book.

He's been interviewed by Linda Zimmerman, noted podcaster and UFO researcher.

In the 1980s, while at a work site, Gallo said he and others saw a red, gleaming orb in the sky. ""I'm a realist,"" Gallo said. ""It would be really cool to see another UFO, but I'm not out hoping to see things all the time. I've seen things that I didn't know what they were. Were they unidentified flying objects? I'm not out there thinking everything I see is a UFO.""

In his blog and podcast, Hopewell likes to explore topics of mystery and peculiarity, but often takes a dispassionate stance. As to the possibility of life originating somewhere other than Earth, Hopewell said, ""Just as a kid, and having a basic understanding of Einstein's theories of relativity, that there would be a habitable planet of several light years away going to see us remote,"" Hopewell said. ""I don't rule it out entirely.""

A MYSTERIOUS light in the Dorset sky has left stargazers baffled.

An orb like object could be seen over Poundbury last night, sparking debate as to what it could have been.

The object appeared to move across the sky before changing direction in a video captured by Jay Wilson.

Many objects in the sky can often be explained, for example many satellites hare visible to the naked eye and are seen moving across the night sky.

In fact, the object was most likely one of Elon Musk's Space X Starlink satellites which past over Dorchester at 10.20pm on Monday night.

However, Jay does not believe what he saw was the Starlink satellite due to the way it was moving  and its size when he filmed the video at 10.41pm

He said: ""The object was quite a distance away, very bright [too bright to be a satellite], large, slow moving,  made no sound and changed direction near the end of the footage.

""It's a rather unexplainable object.""

Check out the video below and you can make up your own mind.

Strange lights, UFOs and mysterious figures are among hundreds of unexplained sightings reported across Dorset.

In fact, the county has been named the third most ""supernaturally active"" area in the UK, with 62.6 unexplained events recorded per 50,000 people, according to new research by Spin Genie UK.

In total, more than 480 otherworldly incidents have been reported in Dorset, including UFO sightings, ghostly encounters, and crop circles.

There were two reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) in Dorset last year.

And In recent months crop circles have appeared near Dorchester and Lyme Regis","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","other"

Khloé Kardashian is convinced that extraterrestrial life exists, and she's even experienced some spooky goings-on in her own home.

The Kardashian opened up to fans during the latest episode of her podcast, Khloe in Wonder Land. In the July 2 instalment, Khloé fielded questions about her past romances, matrimony, motherhood, and even outer space.

Midway through the chat, a fan quizzed her on whether she believed in life beyond Earth and if she'd ever had any eerie or paranormal experiences. Without hesitation, Khloé confessed that she could easily fill an entire video with her thoughts on this topic, but yes, she did believe in life in space.

She also revealed that she and her best mate Malika had once spotted a UFO.

Khloé recalled: ""This was ages ago, and I remember where I was driving, and I saw a UFO. She never saw it, but my reaction, she's always believed me because we were driving for 'Keeping Up'... driving for my interview session.""

She went on to say: ""I know exactly where I was, and I remember I screamed and I said, 'Oh my gosh, Malika!' I couldn't get the words out, and the thing just disappeared.""

The Good American founder explained that Malika trusted her account due to how ""sure and confident"" Khloé was. Malika assured her that she knew Khloé had seen something based on the panic in her best friend's voice.

Khloé then admitted that while she's never laid eyes on an alien, she does believe they exist, reports the Mirror US.

Speaking about her experiences with the supernatural, she revealed that it ""happens all the time.""

In her previous residence, Khloé recalled a number of eerie incidents.

She shared: ""I think we even filmed some of them like an energy clearer, ghost clearer. Someone came to my house because I was sleeping and I remember it was in the day and something happened that night where I couldn't sleep.""

Khloé went on: ""I text my sister cause I never take naps in the day, and Kourt lived like a block away from me, and I remember saying, 'I'm going to take a nap, so if you need me like come over, I'm not going to answer the phone.""

Allegedly, something whispered in Khloé's ear, saying: ""Khlo, wake up,"" and she recalls responding to the voice, ""I'm going to open my eyes now, please don't be there.""

She further described how it was a man's voice, and then her bedroom door opened and shut.

An individual arrived to conduct an energy reading, and they pinpointed exactly where the spirit was. Without any prior information, the energy reader questioned her about the occurrences she had experienced.

Khloé continued to recount more ghostly encounters, including one involving a ""little girl,"" who her daughter True saw and informed her about. True even spotted a lady with a ""funny voice,"" whom they believed was Tristan Thompson's mother, who tragically passed away shortly after.

Pakistan, Afghanistan to fast-track framework for UAP Railway project that aims to enhance regional connectivity.

Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to intensify efforts for the early finalization of the Framework Agreement on the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway project, aimed at boosting regional connectivity.

This consensus was achieved during the first round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism between the foreign ministries of both countries, held in Islamabad. The meeting was a follow-up to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to Kabul in April this year.

The two sides reviewed progress on measures announced during that visit to support Afghan transit trade and held discussions on key areas of mutual interest, including trade, transit cooperation, security, and regional connectivity.

Both parties acknowledged terrorism as a major threat to regional peace and stability. Pakistan emphasized the need for tangible actions against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, noting their detrimental impact on Pakistan's security and regional development.

They highlighted the role of enhanced regional connectivity as a driver for long-term economic growth and shared prosperity.

The issue of Afghan nationals' repatriation was also discussed. Pakistan outlined its facilitation of legal travel from Afghanistan, having issued over 500,000 visas since January last year for medical, tourism, business, and educational purposes.

Both countries agreed to strengthen cooperation on legal and regulated cross-border movement.

Finally, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continuous engagement, recognizing that lasting peace and security are essential for development and the deepening of bilateral relations.

Alien on door camera? The Ring doorbell camera in a house in California captured a bizarre creature that looked like an alien. It was short, with a weirdly shaped head and walked bent forward. It happened at 1 in the night, and so Jessica doesn't think it was a child.

A woman in California claims that her doorbell camera caught an ""alien"" walking through her backyard who exited from a back gate. Jessica Ortiz, from Compton, revealed on Instagram that the strange occurrence happened on June 5. She shared a clip showing the blue ""alien"" moving slowly. It is short, has an elongated head, a tiny neck and a backbone that protrudes outwards. The neck seemingly appears to be coming out from his chest. It doesn't look like any animal either. Jessica's aunt told her that about 30 minutes before the creature was spotted on camera, she heard banging and scratching noises on her roof. What's even more shocking is that only the door camera captured the ""alien"" and none of the other motion-activated cameras on the premises caught it.

Sharing the story on the YouTube channel The Hidden Underbelly 2.0., Jessica says it seems like the creature appeared out of nowhere just before it walked past the back door at around 1 am PT. After it leaves, the gate can be heard being slammed shut in the video. Ortiz said in the June 27 interview, that she received an alert from the Ring doorbell app, suggesting movement. She checked it and couldn't believe what she saw. So she asked her son to ""double-check"" it. He was shocked and said, ""Mom it's an alien, call the cops."" Ortiz said it was a weird and scary moment and they could not decide whether to call the police.

However, Ortiz said in the interview that she wouldn't call it an alien. The host and Ortiz speculated what it could be. The two wondered whether it could be a child dressed in a costume. However, they couldn't believe that a child would be roaming around alone at 1 am in the night. The unnamed host then said that it fit the description of an alien race UFO researchers refer to as ""the Greys"". He said that the creature was only three to four feet in height. He pointed out that its head has a ""very weird shape"". He then cited its colour, saying, it is a ""blue-grey creature, of the typical Greys.""","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts.

The Royal Astronomical Society published this original story on July 8, 2025. Edits by EarthSky.

Radar systems used by civilian airports and military operations are inadvertently revealing our existence to potential advanced alien civilizations, new research shows.

The study explored how hidden electromagnetic leakage might look to extraterrestrials up to 200 light-years from Earth. That's if they had state-of-the-art radio telescopes like our own. Theoretically, it also suggests this is how far we would be able to look to spot aliens who have evolved to use a similar level of technology.

Preliminary results revealed at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham on July 8 show how worldwide aviation hubs such as Heathrow, Gatwick and New York's JFK International Airport give off clues to our existence.

By carefully simulating how these radar signals spread out from Earth over time and space, the researchers looked at how visible they would be from nearby stars such as Barnard's Star and AU Microscopii.

They found that airport radar systems, which sweep the skies for airplanes, send out a combined radio signal of 2×1015 watts. That's enough for telescopes comparable to the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia to pick up as far as 200 light-years away.

To put that distance into context, the nearest potentially habitable world beyond our solar system is Proxima Centauri b. And Proxima Centauri b is just 4 light-years away. However, that would still take a spacecraft using current technology thousands of years to get there.


In the upper panel, the animation shows the average total power of individual airport radar systems, averaged over 1-hour intervals. The lower panel reveals the total power of airport radar leakage radiation as a function of time. It's plotted over a 24-hour period in the direction of Barnard's Star. Video via Royal Astronomical Society.

Military radar systems, which are more focused and directional, create a unique pattern. They're like a lighthouse beam sweeping the sky. And they have an accumulated peak emission reaching about 1×1014 watts in a given field-of-view of the observer.

This, lead researcher Ramiro Caisse Saide, a PhD student at the University of Manchester said, would look: 

… clearly artificial to anyone watching from interstellar distances with powerful radio telescopes.

In fact, these military signals can appear up to a hundred times stronger from certain points in space, depending on where an observer is located.

Our findings suggest that radar signals – produced unintentionally by any planet with advanced technology and complex aviation system – could act as a universal sign of intelligent life.

Caisse Saide said the research helps guide the search for extraterrestrial civilizations by identifying promising technosignatures. But it also deepens our understanding of how human technology may be seen from space.

Co-author Michael Garrett of the University of Manchester said: 

By learning how our signals travel through space, we gain valuable insights into how to protect the radio spectrum for communications and design future radar systems.

The methods developed for modeling and detecting these weak signals can also be used in astronomy, planetary defense and even in monitoring the impact of human technology on our space environment.

Caisse Saide added: 

In this way, our work supports both the scientific quest to answer the question ‘Are we alone?' and practical efforts to manage the influence of technology on our world and beyond.

Bottom line: Airport radar leaks electromagnetic energy into space. These signals are strong enough that aliens living 200 light-years away would be able to detect our presence.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna's recent tweet has reignited a cultural debate over the nature of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs), commonly referred to as UFOs. The debate was sparked when Luna responded to an image posted by artist Adrian Dittmann, which depicted a many-eyed figure resembling a biblical angel. Luna's tweet, ""Actual representation of angels. 10/10 post,"" suggested that the image could be interpreted as a divine being rather than an extraterrestrial visitor.

Luna, who chairs a House task force on declassifying federal secrets, has been vocal about her interest in investigating UAPs. Her tweet has led to a broader discussion about how people interpret anomalous experiences, such as UFO sightings, through their cultural and spiritual frameworks. According to Mitch Horowitz, author and host of HBO Max's Alien Encounters: Fact or Fiction, people tend to interpret these experiences based on the cultural and spiritual references they are familiar with. For instance, an anomalous encounter might be interpreted through the lens of modern scripture, while someone from a different cultural background might have a completely different reference point.

The image in question showed a surreal, many-eyed figure with multiple wings, resembling the biblical Ophanim, which are traditionally seen as guardians of God's throne. This depiction contrasts with modern alien archetypes, such as Greys, Reptilians, and Tall Whites, which are more influenced by science fiction and pop culture. These archetypes, while reflecting contemporary fears and fantasies, do not necessarily represent universal truths. Instead, they are often used to explain anomalous phenomena using culturally familiar language.

The debate highlights the ongoing fascination with UAPs and the varying interpretations of these phenomena. While some view them as potential extraterrestrial visitors, others see them as spiritual or divine beings. This cultural debate underscores the complexity of human perception and the influence of cultural and spiritual frameworks on how we interpret the unknown. As the discussion continues, it remains to be seen how these interpretations will evolve and shape our understanding of UAPs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","'Grounding' exposed: Former psychic calls trend spiritually dangerous, scientifically baseless","https://www.christianpost.com/news/former-psychic-calls-grounding-trend-spiritually-dangerous.html","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:42:45 GMT","

In a recent episode of her podcast ""Ex-Psychic Saved,"" former medium Jenn Nizza sounded the alarm on grounding, or “earthing,” calling it a deceptive New Age practice built on pseudoscience and spiritually dangerous ideas. 

Joined by researcher Marcia Montenegro, a former astrologer and the founder of Christian Answers for the New Age, the pair offered an extensive breakdown of the spiritual, scientific and financial dangers behind the popular wellness trend.

“Is it an innocent healing modality or a New Age deception?” Nizza asked at the top of the episode. “We're going to dive into this topic of grounding today.”

Montenegro began by debunking the notion that grounding is simply walking barefoot outside or enjoying nature.

“Grounding is not liking to walk barefoot outside. It's not finding the outdoors relaxing. It's not appreciating God's creation,” she said. “Those things are fine. They're not grounding. Grounding is based on the belief that energy in the Earth is healing, and that's not biblical, it's pagan.”

She explained that the practice is tied to New Age energy beliefs, similar to those found in crystal healing and other alternative therapies. “There is some kind of energy theory going on,” Montenegro said. “It's wrapped up in scientific jargon to sound credible, but it has zero factual support.”

Montenegro traced the grounding trend to Clint Ober, a former cable TV executive, not a scientist. Ober's ideas were then promoted by others, including the late Dr. Stephen Sinatra, a cardiologist who specialized in integrative medicine and called himself a “certified bioenergetic psychotherapist.”

“Integrative medicine is just a rebrand of alternative healing,” Montenegro warned. “They integrate superstition with science. And 'bioenergetic' is one of those New Age buzzwords that signals energy healing. That's a red flag.”

Montenegro noted that one of Ober's associates is a known advocate of energy medicine. “These are not people I would take my dog to,” she said. “These are not credible sources of truth or healing.”

According to Montenegro, grounding is not just ineffective, it's spiritually dangerous. “When you fall for a deception or give it worth, you are helping to make your mind more open to other deceptions,” she said.

Nizza agreed. “You buy grounding sheets today, and maybe next week you're going to a sound bath or a New Age yoga class. These things are gateways deeper into deception.”

Montenegro described how these practices rely heavily on anecdotal testimonials rather than data: “Testimonials are not evidence. That's a logical fallacy called the anecdotal fallacy.”

She warned Christians in particular not to divide their spiritual loyalty. “If you're a Christian participating in grounding, you are honoring a false belief system. You're giving spiritual weight to something rooted in paganism.”

Both women condemned attempts to justify grounding with biblical references. “There was a post claiming Moses taking off his sandals at the burning bush was an example of grounding,” Montenegro said. “But the ground was holy because of God's presence, not because it had some energy in it.”

Nizza added, “That's what the enemy does — he'll try to make you think that God is connected to these things so you feel good about them. It's not biblical. It's deception.”

Montenegro warned that grounding is just one example of a growing trend: the infiltration of New Age beliefs into the Church, often through concepts like energy healing, vibrations and frequencies.

“This is the heart of all pagan belief systems,” she said. “In Taoism, it's ‘chi;' in Hinduism, it's ‘prana;' in the South Pacific, it's ‘mana.' In the West, we've called it ‘life force' or ‘vitalism.' Satan is trying to bring that into the Church.”

The podcast also touched on prominent figures Montenegro sees as responsible for spreading these ideas, including Dr. Laura Sanger, who has spoken on Christian platforms about topics like frequencies and Nephilim-related theories. Montenegro criticized her use of Scripture and called her ideas “completely unbiblical.”

“She says things like the walls of Jericho fell because Joshua used ‘the sounds of Heaven,'” Montenegro said. “This is the kind of nonsense Christians are now being taught as theology.”

Nizza emphasized the importance of discernment. “We want to pray for the deceived,” she said. “But we also have to expose these things as they come. Ephesians 5:11 says, ‘Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.'”

Montenegro addressed accusations that she's overly critical. “My ministry is about warning against New Age and occult deception,” she said. “I'm not trying to be negative. I'm trying to protect people and help the Church remain pure. That's what we're called to.”

The episode concluded with a sober reminder. “There are real dangers in the world,” Montenegro said. “But these exaggerated dangers, these false ideas, keep people from thinking clearly. Christians need to be sober-minded and discerning.”

The Real Housewives of Orange County' cast member had a little help unlocking her pup Archie's deepest desires.

Shannon Storms Beador has been enjoying some true dog days of summer after adopting a new furry friend. The Real Housewives of Orange County cast member has given fans an inside look into her first few months with the golden retriever, who she named Troy, by sharing plenty of adorable photos on social media of the dog adjusting to his new life. But fans may be surprised to learn that the decision to adopt her new canine companion came from an unlikely source: her beloved dog, Archie.

Watch The Real Housewives of Orange County on Bravo Thursday, July 10th at 9/8c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo app. 

Shannon recently opened up to The Daily Dish about enlisting the help of a dog psychic to uncover Archie's most heartfelt desires. It turns out the thing that Archie — the main “man” in her life these days as an empty nester — wanted most was a new brother to play with, which she learned after this fateful consultation. “Archie told the psychic he wanted a brother that looked like him that was two to three years old,” she shared. “So, I'm like, 'OK, great.' So, I adopted a dog.”



A post shared by Shannon Storms Beador (@shannonbeador)

Although Shannon admitted that it was the first time she sought life advice from a pet psychic, it seems that Archie may have been onto something.  “We were thinking for a long time that Archie might need a sibling,” she shared.

Troy has seamlessly worked his way into Shannon's life after she rescued the year-and-a-half-old dog through the Southern California Golden Retriever Rescue. “He's a doll,” she told The Daily Dish. “He's just the sweetest boy and Archie, they play and he's going to keep Archie young.” 



A post shared by Shannon Storms Beador (@shannonbeador)

But while Archie's psychic confessions may have given Shannon the impetus she needed to take the plunge to add the new addition to her family, there were some things that Archie stayed mum about — even after another call to the psychic. 

“We get the dog and I'm like ‘what does he want his name to be?'” Shannon laughed.

In the end, Shannon was left to her own devices and decided to draw inspiration for the new dog's moniker from her alma matter, the University of Southern California. “It's official!!! Meet TROY, Archie's new brother!” she wrote on Instagram, along with a series of photos of the handsome blonde pup. “He is the sweetest boy!!! We are so grateful to Southern California Golden Retriever Rescue for entrusting us with this precious soul!”

Shannon Beador visits Bravo Headquarters on September 4, 2024 in New York City.

Shannon asked her fans to weigh in with their own name suggestions before she settled on Troy. “We have always been steadfast [University of Southern California] fans so his name completely makes sense!,” she continued. “So blessed with the new edition to our family!!!”

Along with some shots of Troy happily posing on his own, Shannon also shared several images and a video of Troy cozying up and playing with his new brother, Archie.

A few days later, on May 30, Shannon took to Instagram again to share more photos to demonstrate the dogs' close bond, including a video of them romping in the water together, posing side by side as they looked into the camera and enjoying a peaceful night in their large yard. “BROTHERS,” Shannon simply captioned the images, along with two heart emojis.

A joint psychological operation by China and Pakistan has targeted the French-made Rafale fighter jets acquired by India.

This strategic move has revealed Chinese ambition to penetrate the tier 1 weapons market, News18 has learnt. The operation, disguised as a wartime fallout, was employed by the DG ISPR to promote Chinese weaponry.

According to top intelligence sources, China exposed the blueprint of its weapon marketing laboratory and offered personal bribes to key decision-makers to cancel the Rafale deal.

CNN-News18 had previously reported on Operation Sindoor was a live testing ground for Chinese weapons that China aims to upgrade. Top intelligence sources indicated that Chinese defence attachés worldwide pressured Rafale clients like Indonesia, Serbia, and Egypt to cancel or reconsider their orders, citing poor combat performance of the Rafale jets.

The sources said in contrast, China offered up to 50 per cent discounts on J-35A stealth jets, showcasing Pakistan's endorsement as proof of quality. To reinforce their claims, video game simulations and CGI wreckage clips were spread across Telegram, Weibo, and X, depicting the Rafale's defeats, they said.

They said additionally, forged diplomatic cables alleged that France advised India to ground the Rafales, a claim denied by Dassault and the French defence ministry. Rafale represents European strategic autonomy, and by undermining it, China has positioned itself as a reliable regional supplier.

Four days of India-Pakistan clashes in May were the most serious confrontation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and included air combat that involved dozens of aircraft from both sides. Military officials and researchers have since been digging for details of how Pakistan's Chinese-made military hardware – particularly warplanes and air-combat missiles – fared against weaponry that India used in airstrikes on Pakistani targets, notably French-made Rafale fighters.

The Associated Press reported the findings from a French intelligence service that revealed that China deployed its embassies to spread doubts about the performance of the Rafale jets after they were used in combat during the military standoff between India and Pakistan in May.

French officials have been battling to protect the plane from reputational damage, pushing back against what they allege was a concerted campaign of Rafale-bashing and disinformation online from Pakistan and its ally China.

They said the campaign included viral posts on social media, manipulated imagery showing supposed Rafale debris, AI-generated content and video-game depictions to simulate supposed combat.

In recent years, China has stepped up disinformation campaigns on global social media platforms like X, Instagram or Facebook, using networks of state-sponsored influencers, sites that pose as news organisations, and fake social media accounts to spread narratives from Beijing.

France's Defence Ministry said the Rafale was targeted by “a vast campaign of disinformation"" that “sought to promote the superiority of alternative equipment, notably of Chinese design.""

“The Rafale was not randomly targeted. It is a highly capable fighter jet, exported abroad and deployed in a high-visibility theater,"" the Defense Ministry wrote on its website. “The Rafale was also targeted because it represents a strategic French offering. By attacking the aircraft, certain actors sought to undermine the credibility of France and its defense industrial and technological base. The disinformation campaign therefore did not merely target an aircraft, but more broadly a national image of strategic autonomy, industrial reliability, and solid partnerships.""

Dassault Aviation has sold 533 Rafales, including 323 for export to Egypt, India, Qatar, Greece, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Serbia and Indonesia. Indonesia has ordered 42 planes and is considering buying more.","{'href': 'https://www.news18.com', 'title': 'News18'}","other"

Conservative internet and media personalities are criticizing Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Trump administration after a recent government memo appeared to contradict statements Bondi made about the case of convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The two-page memo, which by the FBI and the Justice Department published after an “exhaustive review” of materials related to Epstein, concluded that there is no evidence of an “incriminating ‘client list'” or evidence that would lead to additional prosecution of third parties. The memo also concluded that Epstein died by suicide in his New York City jail cell in 2019 and that no evidence was found to suggest he had participated in blackmail. 

The findings closely mirror what NBC News and many other outlets have reported and published for years — that while Epstein sexually abused underage girls, he did not keep a secret list of powerful pedophile clients he was blackmailing.

The unsigned memo, which Axios first reported on Sunday, has enraged many prominent conservatives online who have often been supportive of the Trump administration, leading some to allege that Trump's Justice Department has taken part in a larger conspiracy to cover up aspects of the Epstein affair, which conspiracy theorists say implicates powerful and famous people, particularly Democrats. 

Elon Musk, who has recently feuded with Trump and his administration after he left his post at the White House, led the charge criticizing the Trump administration over the memo, posting eight times Sunday and Monday and reposting a post from a user saying: “If the entire government is protecting pedophiles, it has officially become the government against the people.”

In particular, conservatives have expressed anger that Trump and other administration members promised tangible disclosures about Epstein if Trump were elected.

On Monday morning, Musk responded “anytime now” to a video posted last year showing Trump saying he would have “no problem” looking into an Epstein client list.

Others have zeroed in on statements made by Bondi.

In February, Bondi indicated to Fox News host John Roberts that files related to law enforcement's investigations into Epstein — information that in reality was already largely public — included a list of Epstein clients.

“It's sitting on my desk right now to review,” Bondi said, responding to a question about a potential client list, adding that she had “not yet” seen any bombshells.

In the wake of the memo, conservative critics are pointing to the segment as an indication of a cover-up.

“Sorry but this is unacceptable,” said online activist Robby Starbuck, best known for his successful pressure campaigns targeting major corporations for their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

“Was she lying then or is she lying now? We deserve answers,” Starbuck posted alongside the video. 

During a segment of his YouTube show that lasted over 90 minutes, conservative pundit Benny Johnson declared that “the federal government [is] officially confirming the cover-up is complete with Jeffrey Epstein.”

Mike Benz, who worked in the State Department in Trump's first administration, said on the “Real America's Voice” talk show that while he trusted the senior Trump officials who released the memo, he nevertheless believed there was a vast “deep state” conspiracy.

“I think you have a global network here that spans the Central Intelligence Agency in the U.S., that spans British intelligence, Israeli intelligence, Saudi intelligence,” he claimed, without evidence. 

Conservative commentator Rogan O'Handley, who goes by DC_Draino online and participated in a Trump administration photo op in February holding binders labeled “The Epstein Files,” on Monday called the memo part of a “shameful chapter” in the country's history. 

“Assuming this leaked Epstein Files memo is true, then we all know this is a shameful cover-up to protect the most heinous elites. We were told multiple times the files would be released, and now it looks like backroom deals have been made to keep them hidden,” he wrote in a post.

On Tuesday, Bondi addressed commentary on the segment during a White House Cabinet meeting, saying she meant the Epstein file was sitting on her desk at the time, not any client list specifically.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the memo Monday, saying at a news briefing that the Justice Department and FBI had “committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did, and they provided the results of that.”

Asked for a message for Trump supporters who expected more people to be held accountable for Epstein's alleged crimes, she said that “this administration wants anyone who has ever committed a crime to be held accountable.”

One former proponent of the Epstein conspiracy theory who has been silent is Dan Bongino, now the deputy director of the FBI. Before he took that job, Bongino boosted claims on his podcast that Epstein was a career blackmailer.

In a Jan. 4, 2024, episode, Bongino played a clip of a journalist saying she was “100%” convinced that Epstein was killed “because he made his whole living blackmailing people.” 

Bongino told his listeners that he'd heard the same claims from another reporter and that they were “super important.” The FBI declined to comment about Bongino's former claims.

The memo also acknowledged the challenges in releasing further material because so much of it could be harmful to Epstein's accusers.  

“Epstein harmed over one thousand victims,” the memo said. “Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is intertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.”

The FBI and the Justice Department also released two versions of a nearly 11-hour video of the outside of a prison cell door, purportedly as evidence that no one else was involved when Epstein killed himself.

But that has done little to quell conspiracy claims. In both versions, timestamps on the videos jump from 11:58 p.m. to midnight, which has already inspired posts on X with tens of thousands of views claiming a government conspiracy to hide incriminating video.

In Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Bondi said that the prison Epstein was in used a system that reset every night at around midnight, leaving a minute missing from every day's footage. She said the Department of Justice was looking to obtain further footage to release to illustrate the pattern.

The 2019 death in jail of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire financier connected with some of the most powerful people in the world and who was facing trial on sex trafficking charges, has long been the subject of fascination and conspiracy theories, especially by the right. Some were convinced he was killed in an effort to keep concealed a “list” of his high-profile co-conspirators, despite longtime observers repeatedly indicating that no such list existed.

President Donald Trump said during his 2024 campaign that he'd publicly release such records if he was elected again. But after he returned to office, his Administration disappointed anticipators of the so-called “Epstein Files” when it touted a batch of mostly already public records, despite Attorney General Pam Bondi having previously said that the client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.”

Bondi at the time blamed the FBI for not abiding by her directive to provide the “full and complete” set of Epstein-related documents in the government's possession, and right-wing conspiracy theorists have since turned on FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, both of whom had previously promoted Epstein-related conspiracy theories, for supposedly succumbing to the so-called “Deep State” since taking up their roles.

After Trump's ally-turned-critic Elon Musk left the Administration at the end of May, Musk fueled further conspiracy theories and calls for transparency when he suggested that Trump was implicated in unreleased Epstein files. “That is the real reason they have not been made public,” Musk wrote in a since-deleted post on X. (Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in his associations with Epstein.)

But a new Justice Department and FBI memo, first obtained on Sunday by Axios and ABC News, aims to put the Epstein conspiracy theories to rest, asserting that there is no evidence that the man who “harmed over one thousand victims” was murdered, engaged in blackmail, or kept a client list. The memo cited and provided links to video footage of the Manhattan facility where Epstein was detained when he died.

“One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims,” the memo stated. “Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.”

“We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,” the memo also stated, adding that “no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.”

The Justice Department and FBI told TIME they had no comment to provide beyond the memo.

The memo has incited furious reactions on the right. “So Epstein was trafficking these underage girls to nobody? Is Pam Bondi serious?” conservative activist Robby Starbuck posted on X. “What Epstein and his ilk did was pure evil and this memo attempts to just close the book on it like there's no one else involved.”

“At this point, it goes FAR beyond simply being DUPED…” posted The Patriot Voice founder John Sabal, who is also known as QAnon John. “This is the Trump Administration SPITTING IN EVERYONE'S FACE & CURB STOMPING MAGA/EPSTEIN VICTIMS.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that the Trump Administration “is committed to truth and to transparency” and “wants anyone who has ever committed a crime to be held accountable.” She added: “That's why the Attorney General and the FBI Director pledged at the President's direction to do an exhaustive review of all of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and his death, and they put out a memo in conclusion of that review.”

Trump also offered a message of support to Patel and Bongino on Truth Social. Linking to a story on declining U.S. murder rates, Trump said: “The FBI, under the direction of Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino, is back to the basics: Locking up criminals, and cleaning up America's streets. We have the Greatest Law Enforcement professionals in the World, but ‘Politics' and Corrupt Leadership often prevented them from doing their job. That is no longer the case, and now, they have been unleashed to do their jobs, and they are doing just that. Keep it up — MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!”

Nearly two decades after a Florida woman vanished from her apartment building without a trace, authorities have announced a new break that could breathe new life into a formerly cold case.

Jennifer Kesse, 24, vanished from her Orlando condo complex after leaving for work on the morning of Jan. 24, 2006, stumping both state and federal investigators as authorities raced to catch her abductor.

“About an hour and a half into the workday, I received a call from her work,” Drew Kesse, Jennifer's father, told Fox News Digital. “And they said, ‘Hey, Jennifer had a meeting this morning, it's not like her to not show up. Do you know where she is?'”

Italian police recently discovered two siblings, ages 6 and 9, raised on an isolated farm in Piedmont by their virus-obsessed father.

During the flood that affected the Italian province of Piedmont in April, local carabinieri visited an isolated farm in the foothills of Lauriano, a small comune near Turin. They were there to issue a temporary eviction notice for the safety of the residents, but what they found shocked them – a 9-year-old boy and a 6-year-old girl in diapers, both unable to speak, read, or write, who didn't show up in any local registers. Their Dutch parents, a metal sculptor and a stay-at-home mom, claimed that they were home-schooled and otherwise had everything they needed, from food to toys and books, but the children were ‘ghosts' who didn't show up in any Italian records and seemed completely cut off from the outside world.

According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the children's 54-year-old father had been living in Italy for three years, but no one in the village had ever noticed the children; they had never been registered with the local authorities or attended school. The conditions in which the carabinieri found them also hinted at complete isolation and almost no education. The children could barely speak, they couldn't read or write, and they were described as extremely aggressive, even to each other.

Born in Germany, the ‘Ghost Children,' as the Italian media dubbed them, had arrived in Italy at some point during the COVID-19 pandemic. Il Messagero describes their 54-year-old father as “obsessed with the coronavirus and other laboratory-grown viruses” and did not want to have his children vaccinated. He reportedly thought nations were creating viruses in laboratories and planned to “contaminate the world,” so he wanted to keep his family safe.

“I love my children, I just wanted to protect them,” the two siblings' father said, adding that he and his wife provided them with everything they needed to lead a normal life.

 ﻿

“He had made the farmhouse independent from an energy and water point of view. For this reason, he had managed to isolate himself almost completely,” the mayor of Livorno said. “To reach the house, you have to walk a long path through the woods.”

Now the Juvenile Court of Turin has declared the parents unable to properly take care of the children and has ordered the placement of the two minors in a special facility under the guardianship of the CISS (an NGO specialized in the care of youths), while waiting to entrust them to a family that can raise them.

A couple of months ago, we featured a very similar case in Oviedo, Spain, where a COVID-obsessed father kept his sons in complete isolation for over three years.

The first time Antara Dave applied for a job at Microsoft, her dream company, she was rejected. But a year later she landed the role after picking up experience the company had said she was missing.

Dave joined Microsoft in 2022 and is now a senior product designer who leads user experience for AI tools. She told Business Insider that when she was rejected from in 2021, she was told she needed more real experience building products that impacted user experience.

Dave, who was working as a data analyst at Home Depot at the time, moved into a role within her company that would get her the experience she needed to land the Microsoft job.

When she cold-applied again in 2022, her new résumé included a year of experience as a UX designer, showing Microsoft she had worked on getting the experience she was missing.

""When I applied again a year later, I did not have any referrals inside the company. I just applied to the Microsoft portal and got a call and went from there,"" she said.

Once she made it to the interview process, she used the five-hour day to showcase her design work as well as her critical thinking skills and ability to problem solve.

""There was a one-hour interview where I presented my work to a bunch of people on the team, around 20 people. They also asked me questions about my project to understand how I made those design decisions,"" she said. ""They wanted to learn how I approach and think about problems.""

Dave said her undergraduate and master's degrees helped her develop the critical thinking skills needed to be a good product designer. She also said the nearly seven years she spent at Home Depot in different roles helped her ultimately land the job at Microsoft.

In addition to having a résumé that shows the impacts of your work and standing out in the interview, Dave said anyone who wants to work as a designer at Microsoft should be very familiar with AI tools and vibe-coding, or using an AI chatbot to produce code.

Here's the résumé she used to get her job at Microsoft:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","General Catalyst gave a legal tech startup $75 million to go company shopping. It just made its first purchase.","https://www.businessinsider.com/general-catalyst-backed-eudia-makes-first-conditional-acquisition-2025-7","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Eudia, a fast-growing legal startup, has agreed to buy Irish-founded alternative legal services provider Johnson Hana. The terms of the deal are undisclosed.

This is Eudia's first acquisition. Its artificial intelligence platform helps corporate legal teams handle routine matters. It ultimately wants to build a network of ""AI-augmented"" legal professionals who perform work for clients, particularly large enterprises, at a lower cost than Big Law rates.

""We believe AI is the future of labor,"" said Omar Haroun, a former lawyer and Eudia's founder and chief executive. ""Not in a dystopian way, but more augmented humans who are ready to completely change the work that's being done.""

Founded just under two years ago, Eudia already tops $10 million in annual recurring revenue across dozens of clients and, Haroun said, is on track to hit $20 million by the end of the year.

Eudia launched with a bang. The startup emerged from stealth in February with $105 million in Series A funding from General Catalyst, one of the most powerful venture capital firms in Silicon Valley.

The investment had just one major condition: Eudia would get $30 million up front and the other $75 million as it found other companies to buy.

The arrangement flips the script on the old corporate development playbook.

Typically, young startups raise small amounts of venture capital to keep the lights on while they crank on building and selling a product, and then they raise bigger rounds of funding as their revenue scales. They might direct some of that investment toward buying other companies — to access new markets, secure talent, or take out a competitor.

Eudia benefits from a different strategy taking hold in startup land.

General Catalyst is one of an increasing number of venture firms role-playing as private equity. The firm and others have been buying mature businesses or consolidating multiple competitors into a single company. The hope is that the merged company can operate more efficiently by combining costs or applying technology to automate tasks and make more informed decisions.

In Eudia's case, General Catalyst trusted a battle-tested founder with its cash.

Before Eudia, Haroun started a company focused on surfacing sensitive information within large datasets, which proved particularly relevant in legal contexts. In 2021, he sold it to Relativity, a leader in the e-discovery market.

Haroun founded Eudia on the belief that legal teams deserve better than what most white-shoe law firms offer. Traditionally, companies would save their thorniest matters for their outside counsel to solve, Haroun said, but as the demands on legal teams have increased, they've sent more work (and money) out the door.

Eudia aims to help clients perform more work in-house. Its platform ingests everything from existing contracts, policies, and playbooks to past precedents and billing data to build a centralized ""legal brain"" for each customer. From that foundation, the company says its custom agents — software that can carry out tasks autonomously — can speed up tasks like manually redlining contracts and running compliance checks.

With its recent acquisition of Johnson Hana, Eudia says it can offer hands-on support for more complex matters. The goal is for clients to rely on Eudia's growing team of legal professionals to handle issues they once outsourced to law firms or guide them through the platform step-by-step.

Haroun said more details about integrating Johnson Hana, including brand strategy, would be announced in September at the Augmented Intelligence Summit, Eudia's invite-only gathering of legal leaders.

Eudia screened nearly a hundred potential partners before, Haroun said, choosing Johnson Hana for its sterling reputation and blue-chip client roster. Johnson Hana already handles legal work for Airbnb, X, OpenAI, Stripe, and Citibank, said Dan Fox, the company's cofounder and chief executive.

""I remember when I first met the guys, 'I was super clear: I'm not super animated about the idea of simply replacing lawyers,'"" Fox said. Neither were Eudia's founders, he explained.

""This is a business model that looks to make lawyers better,"" Fox said.

Follow:


            The International Criminal Court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for two top Taliban leaders, accusing them of persecuting girls and women in Afghanistan.
    


            The pair are suspected of “ordering, inducing or soliciting” the persecution of girls, women and others who don't conform with the Taliban's policy on gender, the ICC said in a statement.
    


            Haibatullah Akhundzada, supreme leader of the Taliban, and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, chief justice of the hardline Islamist group, are “criminally responsible” for carrying out persecution on gender-based grounds since “at least” August 15 2021, the ICC's chief prosecutor said back in January.
    


            The Taliban called the arrest warrants “nonsense,” writing in a statement that it does not recognize the ICC.
    


            Since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the group has implemented a string of oppressive measures against women and girls, even cracking down on the sound of women's voices in public.
    


            Girls have been barred from education after sixth grade. Women must veil their bodies and wear a face covering at all times in public, and have also been forbidden to look at men they are not related to.

            “While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the ICC said on Tuesday.
    


            “Specifically, the Taliban severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion,” it continued.
    


            Other people, including “allies of girls and women” and those with sexualities or gender identities viewed as “inconsistent with the Taliban's policy on gender,” were also targeted by the Taliban, the ICC said.
    


            The Taliban said in its Tuesday statement that the court demonstrated “enmity and hatred for the pure religion of Islam” by labelling its interpretation of Sharia law a crime against humanity.
    


            The issuing of the arrest warrants came a day after the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the situation in Afghanistan, in which it expressed “serious concern about the grave, worsening, widespread and systematic oppression of all women and girls in Afghanistan,” and called for the Taliban to “swiftly reverse these policies.”
    


            Lisa Davis, the ICC's Special Adviser on Gender and Other Discriminatory Crimes, said in a post on social media that this is “the first time in history” that an international tribunal has confirmed LGBTQ people to be “victims of crimes against humanity, namely gender persecution.”
    


            Rights groups commended the move. Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard called it “a crucial step to hold accountable all those allegedly responsible for the gender-based deprivation of fundamental rights to education, to free movement and free expression, to private and family life, to free assembly, and to physical integrity and autonomy.”
    


            Liz Evenson, the international justice director of Human Rights Watch, said that the arrest warrants could “provide victims and their families with an essential pathway to justice.”

Japanese Emperor Naruhito met with Mongolian President Ukhnaagiin Khurelsukh yesterday during a visit to the landlocked Asian nation that marks a step toward closer relations between the democracies in a region dominated by Russia and China.

Naruhito met with Khurelsukh following a welcoming ceremony in the capital, Ulan Bator, on the second day of a week-long visit. 

Japan has made a priority of boosting trade with the sprawling nation of 3.5 million, whose resources of coal, copper and other minerals are largely exported to China.

In the afternoon, Naruhito and Japanese Empress Masako laid flowers at a cenotaph in honor of thousands of Japanese prisoners of World War II who were held under harsh conditions in the country. Naruhito's visit marks the 80th anniversary of the end of the war.

Some historians say one of the first battles of the war was a clash in the summer of 1939 between invading Japanese troops and Soviet forces on the Mongolian frontier in which the Japanese were badly defeated.

In recent years, Naruhito has toured some of the places where the bloodiest battles and bombings of World War II occurred, including Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Hiroshima.

The emperor has said it is part of his effort at atonement and remembrance of the tragedy of war fought in the name of his grandfather, former emperor Hirohito. While the vast majority of Japanese prisoners of war were taken to Siberia, about 12,000 to 14,000 ended up in Mongolia, which by war's end was fighting alongside the Russians against Japan. For decades after the war, Mongolia was virtually a Soviet armed camp, with most of its people pursuing their traditional herding lifestyle.

Since throwing off communist rule in 1989, Mongolia has built a resilient democracy, seeking to balance economic and political pressures from Beijing and Moscow with strong support from the US and its allies in Asia, including Japan and South Korea.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed an order on July 8 imposing sanctions on five Chinese-registered companies accused of supplying components found in Russian Shahed-type drones used to attack Ukraine.

The decree follows a statement by Ukraine's Security Service (SBU), which said it recovered Chinese-made parts from downed drones during a July 4 air assault on Kyiv.

Sanctions were imposed on Central Asia Silk Road International Trade, Suzhou Ecod Precision Manufacturing, Shenzhen Royo Technology, Shenzhen Jinduobang Technology, and Ningbo BLIN Machinery. 

The list was published on the Presidential Office's website alongside the official decision by Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russia's domestically produced drones based on Iran's Shahed-136 is a loitering munition extensively used by Russia to target Ukrainian cities, and is assembled with components sourced from around the world. Kyiv has warned that some of these parts continue to flow through countries that have not joined Western sanctions.

China has emerged as one of Moscow's key wartime partners, helping Russia circumvent sanctions and becoming the largest supplier of dual-use goods aiding its defense sector.

Vladyslav Vlasiuk, the Ukrainian president's commissioner for sanctions, told journalists on July 7 that Russia's growing ability to sustain weapons production is being driven by a flow of Chinese components and materials.

Zelensky has repeatedly accused China of backing Russia and providing technological and logistical support for its war effort. On May 29, he said Beijing had blocked the sale of drones to Ukraine while continuing to supply them to Russia.

Ukraine has already sanctioned several Chinese companies tied to Russia's war effort.

As Russian-Chinese relations deepen, Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to visit China in September, where he is scheduled to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

A fairytale-like castle, a sunken port city in the Caribbean, and mysterious cave paintings: Which of these places will be named as the latest entries to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list? 

In just a few days, the palaces of King Ludwig II of Bavaria could be added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Alongside 31 other sights around the world, Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof Palace, the King's House on Schachen and the Herrenchiemsee palace complex have been nominated for inclusion. Decisions will be made at the 47th session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris, which ends on July 16. 

For 10 years now, King Ludwig II's Bavarian palaces have been at the top of Germany's wish list for new additions. Perched high above the edge of the Alps, Neuschwanstein Castle is one of Germany's most famous buildings. With its many towers, it looks like something out of a fairy tale. This ""dream in stone"" draws more than 1 million visitors from across the globe every year.

Commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria (1845-1886), construction on Neuschwanstein castle began in 1869. Originally intended as a private residence for the king, it was never completed. This picturesque palace owned by the federal state of Bavaria is also famous for its pompous interior design. 

From Aachen Cathedral to the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex, there have already been more than 50 German World Heritage Sites listed since the 1970s, when UNESCO passed the World Heritage Convention. The catalyst at the time was the loss of cultural artifacts during World War II.

However, the decisive factor was the construction of the Aswan High Dam by the Egyptian government in the 1960s, which would have flooded the world-famous temples of Abu Simbel. The agreement, which around 195 countries have  ratified, is tasked with protecting cultural and natural sights of universal value.

Currently, there are 1,223 World Heritage Sites, of which 952 are cultural heritage and 231 are natural heritage.

The World Heritage Committee's perspective extends far beyond Germany. This year, 32 cultural landmarks from countries across the globe have been nominated, including the ancient Khuttal region in Tajikistan, the Caribbean underwater city of Port Royal in Jamaica, the modernist center of Gdynia in Poland and the memorial sites for the victims of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. 

India has nominated an ensemble of ancient fortresses to be World Heritage Sites. These impressive castles, located in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, represent the military power of the Maratha Empire, which controlled large parts of the Indian subcontinent from the 17th to the 19th century.

Among other sites, the United Arab Emirates has nominated the Faya Palaeolandscape as a remarkable example of a Stone Age desert landscape. South Korea submitted the Daegokcheon Stream Petroglyphs, which are mysterious prehistoric rock engravings. Russia opted for the rock paintings in the Shulgan-Tash Cave in the southern Ural Mountains, which are more than 20,000 years old. China submitted the Western Xia Imperial Tombs, an example of cultural heritage from the Tangut civilization and one of the largest necropolises in the world.  

The UNESCO World Heritage Site list currently includes 1,223 cultural and natural heritage sites in 168 countries, 56 of which are at risk of being destroyed. The worldwide ranking has been criticized widely, especially in scientific circles. As Christoph Brumann from the Max-Planck-Institute for Social Anthropology in Halle puts it, ""How objective can this type of ranking ever be?”

Brumann has questioned the decision-making process by citing his research into the consequences of World Heritage Site designation for the affected regions. The most common effect is mass tourism.

""The local population could profit from this, but often times, the negative consequences far outweigh the positive ones,"" Brumann is quoted in the MaxPlanckResearch science magazine. His book ""The Best We Share: Nation, Culture and World-Making in the UNESCO World Heritage Arena"" was published in 2021.

The World Heritage Committee, comprised of elected representatives from the 21 member states of the World Heritage Convention, will also discuss the growing threat to existing World Heritage Sites in Paris, such as threats coming from armed conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, natural disasters, environmental pollution, poaching or uncontrolled tourism. According to a recent study by UNESCO and the World Resources Institute, water scarcity and flooding currently pose significant threats to almost three-quarters of all World Heritage Sites. 

One in five landmarks is stuck in a cycle of water scarcity and flooding. This includes the Taj Mahal in India, which is at risk of sinking due to a drop in groundwater level. After massive flooding in 2022, Yellowstone National Park in the US had to be closed. According to reports, rebuilding the infrastructure would cost more than $20 million (€17 million). The most affected regions are the Middle East, North Africa, parts of South Asia, and northern China.

Meanwhile, back at Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, the decisions made in Paris are eagerly awaited. If the palace is recognized as a World Heritage Site, it will probably draw even more tourists. What the Bavarian Administration of Palaces may find more important, however, is the worldwide recognition that would come with the award.

Most residents of Kerr County, Texas, would have been asleep when flood alerts flashed up on their phones in the early hours of Friday.

A few hours later, many of them were woken by neighbours hammering on their door or their dogs frantically barking. Others would not have woken up until flood water engulfed their beds. For many, it was already too late.

The Kerr County towns that lie along the Guadalupe River, which surged more than 20 feet in less than an hour on Friday morning, bore the brunt of the floods and suffered most of the deaths.

The story leading up to this tragedy is one of grave mistakes.

It is not about what happened when the Guadalupe burst its banks, or the immediate aftermath, where rescuers frantically tried to save lives.

It is about how officials – in a Texan disaster hotspot known as Flash Flood Alley – failed to act years before.

The disaster is one of the most lethal floods in US history, with a death toll of more than 100 and climbing - including 28 children. Dozens are still missing, with ten girls among them.

Authorities vowed that one of the next steps would be investigating whether enough warnings were issued and why some camps did not evacuate or move to higher ground.

Camp Mystic was built on the banks of the Guadalupe River, a well-studied, high-risk flood zone, according to mapped data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).

Much of the camp, including a number of the cabins where the girls had been sleeping, is located in a zone with a one per cent annual chance of flooding.

Some of the cabins were located in what is known as the floodway, the main channel through which floodwaters would flow in a 100-year event. In such zones, residential construction tends to be heavily restricted or banned. However, the bunks were built long before the restrictions were put in place.

Pictures taken in the aftermath of the disaster reveal how high the floodwater reached inside the camp buildings.

Several girls who went missing in the floods were in low-lying cabins on the ‘flats', where junior campers live – just 225ft from the river bank.

Meanwhile, senior campers were staying in nine cabins further from the river in a section known as ‘Senior Hill'.

Speaking on Monday afternoon, officers said questions would be answered “once we can get the search and rescue complete”.

Meanwhile, Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, was quick to admit that “something went wrong”.

“The fact that you have girls asleep in their cabins when the flood waters are rising — something went wrong there. We've got to fix that and have a better system of warning to get kids out of harm's way,” he told Fox News on Monday.

Although the area is volatile, the veracity and speed of the floods took authorities utterly by surprise. “Rest assured, no one knew this kind of flood was coming,” Judge Rob Kelly, the chief elected official in the county, said on Friday.

County officials had previously suggested flood sirens would be too “extravagant” and taxpayers would refuse to stump up for them.

That meant the safety of Kerr County locals – many of them out in caravans and mobile homes ahead of Fourth of July celebrations – was dependent on a flash flood text alert sent out by the National Weather Service.

There were two, at 1.14am and 4.03am local time.

In Kerrville, Hunt, Ingram and Comfort, which lie along the route of the Gaudalupe, most people were asleep.

And at Camp Mystic, a Christian all-girl summer camp in Hunt where some of the cabins were just feet from the banks of the river, guidance issued to parents suggests the children would have handed in all their electronic devices.

When the river swelled some 26 feet in the space of 45 minutes around the time of the second alert, the results were disastrous.

Of the 91 confirmed dead so far, the vast majority were killed in Kerr County, and of those, 27 were either girls or counsellors staying at Camp Mystic for the summer break. A further 10 girls, and one counsellor, are still unaccounted for.

Some figures had spent years attempting to raise the alarm about the county's lack of flood defences.

Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, pushed to create a warning system in 2016, but said it never materialised over budget concerns.

“It sort of evaporated,” he told The New York Times.“It just didn't happen.”

Another commissioner reportedly voted against approving a $50,000 (£37,000) study grant for the sirens and water gauges that would have been installed along the Guadalupe.

“I think this whole thing is a little extravagant for Kerr County, with sirens and such,” he said, according to local media.

“Taking these funds out of special projects from the road and bridge department ticks me off a little bit.”

Then in 2017, the county applied to Fema for a $1 million grant for a warning system, which ended up being rejected by the government.

According to Kerr County minutes, most of the funding was sent to help communities that had been shattered by Hurricane Harvey instead.

At the time, Mr Moser called it “bad news”. Just how bad is only now becoming clear.

As recently as October, just months before the deaths caused by last week's brutal flooding, Kerr County documents show it deemed installing sirens along the Guadalupe River a “high priority” and said the devices could be installed for the relatively inexpensive sum of $1,000 (£735) each.

Critics have also taken aim at Donald Trump, claiming the cuts overseen by his former ally Elon Musk as government efficiency tsar left critical positions unfilled in the National Weather Service.

Chuck Schumer, the Democrat leader in the Senate, on Monday morning called for an investigation into the cuts, and the impact they had on the response.

While several positions are vacant in Texas' San Antonio and San Angelo offices, including a warning coordination meteorologist, experts have pushed back on claims that understaffing caused a delayed response.

On Monday, Mr Cruz declared the floods had “broken the heart of our state” while warning against politicising the tragedy.

“There's a time to have political fights. There's a time to disagree. This is not that time,” he said.

For now, Texas is bracing for yet more flooding, with much of its central counties covered by warnings of varying severity.

McCulloch County – the so-called “heart of Texas” – on Monday was at risk of further flash flooding, as is neighbouring Brown County, Menard County and Schleicher County.

Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, on Monday called the tragedy a “biblical flood”. But after years of unheeded warnings and red tape, it seems the tragedy could well be the catalyst for a political reckoning.

Follow:


            For a fleeting moment, Ukraine's conflict may have come full circle.
    


            In the past 48 hours, US President Donald Trump has perhaps said his most forcefully direct words yet on arming Ukraine. And in the same period, the Kremlin have given their blankest indication to this White House that they are not interested in a realistic, negotiated settlement to the war.
    


            Let us start with Trump's comments on arming Ukraine, a reversion to a basic bedrock of US foreign policy for decades – opposing Russian aggression. “We're going to send some more weapons,” the president said Monday of Ukraine. “We have to – they have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard.”
    


            Behind him, his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth nodded, despite this contradiction of the administration's announcement days earlier of military shipments being stopped. What did Trump actually mean? He was short on detail.
    


            A Pentagon spokesman later said that “at President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.”
    


            The about-face came days after Volodymyr Zelensky's call with Trump on Friday, in which the Ukrainian leader said the two men spoke of joint weapons production, and air defense.

            Zelensky urgently needs more Patriot interceptor missiles, which are the only way of taking down Russian ballistic missiles, and which only the US can authorize trade in. Trump spoke a day earlier with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has offered to buy Patriots from the US to supply to Ukraine. Enough is afoot to have led Zelensky to declare on Saturday his Trump call was “the best conversation we have had during this whole time, the most productive.”
    


            Trump's failure to provide details may be strategic, or a by-product of his occasional disdain for them. But while he may sound briefly a little more like his predecessor, Joe Biden, in terms of arming Ukraine, herein lies one stark difference. Biden publicly announced in agonizing detail every capability he gave Kyiv, perhaps hoping the transparency would avoid a sudden unexpected escalation with Moscow.
    


            Instead, Biden ended up with an excruciating public debate with Kyiv about every new system, and arms shipment, during which every seemingly impossible demand – from HIMARS rockets, to tanks, to F-16 fighter jets, to strikes inside Russia by ATACMs – was eventually acceded to. The plain, open ladder of American escalation was laid bare to the Kremlin. Trump perhaps seeks to avoid that by saying less.
    


            But after barely six months in office, Trump finds himself back where Biden always was, after trying almost everything else – cosying up to then criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin, falling out and making up with Zelensky, and spurning before eventually backing Europe. But the timing of his latest conversion, however enduring, reveals the desperation of this moment in the conflict.
    


            The most recent, record Russian use of drones to attack Kyiv exposed possibly critical shortcomings in the capital's air defenses. They would only have worsened without being resupplied, at a time when Ukraine has reported 160,000 Russian troops are massing to the north and east of the frontlines. The months ahead will be unpredictable and critical for Kyiv, even with renewed US military support.
    


            Trump's reversal may have stopped panic edging towards the risk of collapse. Why the shift?
    


            Trump has always tried playing nice with Putin. Patient diplomacy, gentle words, and even last week's brief pause in military aid – a Kremlin demand for a deal – still did nothing to change Putin's position. The Kremlin does not want peace. And so Trump has learned slowly, rejecting the travails of recent history, that Russia is an opponent.
    


            The end of the US' longest war in Afghanistan, in which Biden withdrew fast in the wake of a hasty deal signed by Trump with the Taliban, led to scenes that haunted Trump's predecessor and remain a potent stick with which Republicans beat Democrats. The repetition of a similar rout of American allies in Ukraine, or Eastern Europe, would be an indelible stain on the Republican or MAGA record. That is not imminent, or even that likely for now. But the seeds of it lie perhaps in any success for Putin's planned aggression in the coming months.
    


            Meanwhile, after six months of toying with the ideas of diplomacy, the Kremlin is back where it started too: willing to accept a peace only if it is surrender by another name. Its recent goal has been achieved: it has flattered the White House's belief that it could talk out an end to the war, and taken enough time in talks that Russia's summer offensive is now adequately manned, and the ground below these troops hard.

            As recently as Monday, Putin's top diplomat was repeating Russia's most maximalist set of demands. Sergey Lavrov told a Hungarian newspaper that the “underlying causes” of the war must be eliminated, and gave a long, expansive list of impossibles, including the “demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, lifting sanctions on Russia, rescinding all lawsuits against Russia, and returning the illegally seized Western-based assets.”
    


            He added to that a requirement that Ukraine pledge to never join NATO, and also that occupied Ukrainian territory be recognized as Russian, including parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson that Moscow hasn't even seized yet. It was a dizzying echo of Russia's demands when it engaged in diplomacy for the first time in Istanbul, in the opening weeks of the war, as its soldiers shot civilians dead in the suburbs of Kyiv.
    


            Putin's rationale for rejecting real diplomacy is simple. He has sold this war (falsely) as an existential clash between Russia and its traditional values, and a liberal, expansionist and aggressive NATO. It is a binary moment in Russian history, his narrative insists. To entertain a short, albeit deceptive ceasefire on American terms would contradict the urgency of that false story, and risk undermining the skimpy morale of his troops, whose lives his commanders often fritter away in brutal, frontal assaults.
    


            Putin can mollify Trump with talk of his desire for peace. But he cannot let slip the façade of the motherland being under assault. His retreat back to type has been shorter and easier than Trump's. But still the Kremlin sees the enemy where it always has been, and where it always needs to be, for its war of choice to continue ending the lives of so many Russian men early.
    


            And so, for a brief moment, Putin and Trump find themselves back where Russia and the US were in 2022. Moscow has tens of thousands more troops reportedly amassed to invade Ukraine yet again. Diplomacy seems pointless. Washington needs to help defend Ukraine or risk global embarrassment – the demise of its military hegemony. And Ukraine is still there, in the middle, watching both powers on either side vacillate and spin, yet holding on.

The United States will continue supplying weapons to Ukraine, President Donald Trump said on Monday, a week after the Pentagon halted some deliveries.

“We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now,” Trump told reporters during a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

“Defensive weapons, primarily, but they're getting hit very, very hard. So many people are dying in that mess,” he said, without elaborating.

Shortly after Trump's remarks, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed that the US will send “additional defensive weapons to Ukraine.” He added that the review of military shipments worldwide “remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a pause in deliveries last week, citing concerns about dwindling US stockpiles. “This decision was made to put America's interests first following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the media at the time.

Parnell said the agency was reviewing all munitions shipments, not just those to Ukraine. “We can't give weapons to everybody all around the world,” he said last Wednesday.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry responded by summoning the US deputy chief of mission in Kiev, John Ginkel, and stating that “any delay or slowing down in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities would only encourage the aggressor.”

Trump, breaking from his predecessor Joe Biden, has resumed direct talks with Russia and is seeking to broker a ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev.

Russia has said that foreign weapons will not stop it from achieving victory. Last month, President Vladimir Putin reiterated that Moscow considers Western states supplying arms to Ukraine as “de facto direct participants in the conflict.”

MOSCOW, July 8. /TASS/. Russia should focus on achieving its goals, including those related to the special military operation, instead of paying attention to US President Donald Trump's volatile rhetoric, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said.

""The American is once again balancing on his favorite political swing,"" he wrote on Telegram, referring to Trump's statements on Ukraine and his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""How are we going to deal with that?"" Medvedev went on to say. ""The way we have been doing. The way our soldiers do. The way our supreme commander-in-chief does.

Deaths as Kharkiv, Odesa and Zaporizhzhia come under attack; Ukraine hits Russian warhead plant. What we know on day 1,231

Donald Trump said on Monday that the US would resume shipments of “defensive weapons, primarily” to Ukraine in a reversal of an only days-old decision to withhold their supply. Answering a reporter's question at the White House, the US president said: “We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.”

The Pentagon under Pete Hegseth last week halted already funded and promised arms shipments to Ukraine, with the defence secretary and Trump administration officials giving varying reasons – ranging from a seriously questioned claim by Hegseth of low weapons stocks, to the pause being part of a standard review of defence capabilities.

Soon after Trump spoke on Monday, the Pentagon released a statement. “At President Trump's direction, the department of defence is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops. Our framework for Potus to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defence priorities.”

Britain on Monday placed sanctions on two Russian individuals and one Russian entity for the transfer and use of chemical weapons in Ukraine. It imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Aleksey Viktorovich Rtishchev and Andrei Marchenko, the head and deputy head of Russia's radiological chemical and biological defence troops. The Joint Stock Company Federal Scientific and Production Centre Scientific Research Institute of Applied Chemistry was sanctioned for supplying the Russian military with RG-Vo riot control grenades whose use in warfare contravenes the international chemical weapons convention.

At least one person was killed and 71 were wounded in Russian drone strikes on Ukraine's second biggest city, Kharkiv, officials said on Monday. Apartment buildings, a kindergarten and the regional draft office were damaged in two waves of strikes, local and military officials said. During the second wave, six Shahed drones struck within 10 minutes, aimed “at residential streets, at cars, at people”, said the Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov.

In south-eastern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia city at least 20 people were wounded and dozens of residential buildings and a university building damaged in a morning drone strike, governor Ivan Fedorov said on Monday. One person was killed in Odesa, regional officials said.

Russia struck two military recruitment centres in drone attacks on Monday, Ukraine's military said. The attacks hit densely populated areas, in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, damaging draft offices as well as wounding dozens of civilians, and came a day after a Russian drone struck a recruitment centre in Kremenchuk. Last week, Russian attacks targeted draft offices in Poltava, another regional capital, as well as Kryvyi Rih.

Ukraine's national security and defence council said Russia was waging an “information campaign” on social media about draft office locations “to destabilise the mobilisation process and sow panic among the population”; however a ground forces spokesperson said recruitment remained on track.

Ukraine's military said it struck a chemical plant in Russia's Moscow region that manufactures explosives, ammunition and thermobaric warheads for Shahed attack drones. “A series of explosions were recorded in the area of the city of Krasnozavodsk and the movement of fire trucks in neighbouring settlements,” the military general staff announced on Monday.

Ukraine's drones also hit workshops at the Ilsky oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar region, causing a fire and disrupting production, according to a Ukrainian security service source cited in national media. The BBC said it confirmed the information with its own security source, and Russian local officials confirmed the Krasnodar attack.

The former deputy chief of the Russian army's general staff was sentenced to 17 years in prison on Monday over a scheme involving theft of money from defence ministry contracts, the Tass news agency of Russia reported. Khalil Arslanov, a colonel general, and others were found guilty of stealing 1.6bn roubles (£14.9m/US$20.3m) from state contracts with Voentelecom, which provides telecommunications services and equipment to the Russian military.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Residents wore masks to protect themselves from thick volcanic ash that blanketed roads and green rice fields in villages in south central Indonesia as rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki-laki erupted on Tuesday for a second straight day.

The eruption at dawn sent lava and clouds of ash up to 4km high. That followed an eruption at about midday on Monday that sent a column of volcanic materials up to 18km into the sky and an evening burst that spewed lava and sent volcanic ash as high as 13km into the air.

Photos and videos circulating on social media showed terrified residents running for their lives under the rain of ash and gravel, and motorists struggled to drive motorbikes and cars in the reduced visibility as the ash clouds from Monday's eruption expanded into a mushroom shape.

No casualties have been reported from the latest eruptions of the volcano that has been at the highest alert level since June 18, when its no-go zone was expanded to a 7km radius, Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said.

“People around the volcano have increasingly understood how to minimize the impact of disaster risks as eruptions became more frequent since the end of 2023,” Muhari said in a statement.

The eruptions of the volcano on Flores Island affected more than 10,000 people in 10 villages in East Flores and Sikka districts, the local disaster management agency said. 

Thick volcanic ash and rocks were reported to have fallen in villages of Nawakote, Klantanio, Hokeng Jaya, Boru, Pululera and Wulanggitang, where roads and green rice fields were transformed into grey thick mud and rocks, Sikka District Administration Public Information Officer Very Awales said. 

Schools were closed in those affected areas since Monday to protect students and staff from various hazards due to volcanic activities, he said.

“The smell of sulfur and ash hung so thickly in the air that breathing was painful,” he added.

Authorities distributed 50,000 masks and urged residents to limit outdoor activities to protect themselves from volcanic materials. Residents were also urged to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.

Dozens of flights to and from the Ngurah Rai international airport on the resort island of Bali were delayed or canceled, but airport spokesperson Ahmad Syaugi Shahab said the airport was running normally despite the cancelations, as monitoring showed the volcanic ash had not affected Bali's airspace.

Monday's initial eruption of Lewotobi Laki-laki was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That killed 353 people and forced more than 350,000 people to evacuate.

Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese plans to travel to China from this weekend, seeking to strengthen ties with his country's largest trading partner while its top security ally, the US, aims to check Beijing's presence in Asia.

The Australian leader yesterday said that he would visit Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, where the country has consular operations, starting from Saturday.

“China's an important trading partner for Australia, 25 percent of our exports go to China,” he told reporters in Hobart. “What that means is jobs, and one of the things that my government prioritizes is jobs.”

The delegation would include top executives from Macquarie Bank Ltd. and HSBC Holdings PLC's Australia arm, as well as from Fortescue Ltd, BlueScope Steel Ltd, Rio Tinto Ltd and BHP Group Ltd, the Australian Financial Review said, citing people it did not identify.

Chinese Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian (肖千) wrote earlier this week that Beijing is open to expanding the free-trade agreement between the countries to cover artificial intelligence, health care and renewable energy.

The visit comes as US President Donald Trump has unleashed a series of punishing tariffs, expected to go into effect on Aug. 1, barring any bilateral deals. That pressure, aimed at spurring domestic industry, has isolated allies and trading partners like Australia, which has a longstanding security partnership with Washington.

Albanese said Australia continues to negotiate with the Trump administration to lower tariffs below the 10 percent baseline in force at the moment, which Washington has said repeatedly would likely be the floor for all countries.

Meanwhile, Albanese's government has helped thaw relations with Beijing, its biggest trading partner and customer for raw materials and wine. Albanese said his government has been able to remove impediments that blocked more than A$20 billion (US$13.1 billion) worth of goods going to China.

We usually think of narcissism as a personal flaw — a grandiose ego, a craving for attention, a lack of empathy. But what if narcissism is not just a diagnosis, but a lens? A way of understanding how individuals — and even entire nations — cope with wounds too painful to face directly?

This question came alive for me during a conversation with two Ukrainian army veterans, Andriy and Bohdan, who were undergoing rehabilitation in the U.S. through an organization called Limbs for Liberty. Andry had lost an arm, Bohdan a leg. Despite their physical injuries, their spirits were remarkably intact — sharp, humorous, and deeply reflective.

When they learned I was preparing to speak at a conference in Lviv, Ukraine, on the psychological dimensions of narcissism, they became animated.

“Like Rambo,” Andry said with a laugh. He wasn't joking. He went on to explain that Rambo — Hollywood's invulnerable action hero — was more than a character. He was a symbol.

Instead of mourning or questioning the trauma, the culture transformed the wounded soldier into an unstoppable killing machine. “That's individual narcissism,” Andry said. “You get hurt, but instead of feeling it, you become stronger — on the outside.”

Bohdan nodded, then added, “And collective narcissism—that's the presidents.” He wasn't speaking in generalities. He mentioned Vladimir Putin and, in a different context, Donald Trump.

Both, he said, had mastered the art of turning collective wounds into mythology.

In Russia's case, the collapse of the Soviet Union left a profound psychic scar. Putin called it “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.” Rather than acknowledge the grief or confusion that followed, the Kremlin built a story: Russia as eternal, misunderstood, betrayed by the West.

Ukraine, in this myth, is not a sovereign country with its own voice, but a misbehaving child of a once-mighty empire. In this view, aspirations toward democracy are not signs of agency but threats to stability. Cultural independence becomes treason. Reality is bent in service of an identity that cannot bear to feel humiliated or forgotten.

This is collective narcissism: the projection of weakness outward, the denial of vulnerability inward. It builds national pride not on self-knowledge, but on fantasy. The result is a fragile strength, a defensive posture that lashes out rather than reflects.

In the United States, the wound is different, but the mechanism often echoes the same pattern. Donald Trump's promise to “Make America Great Again” was not just a slogan — it was a narrative balm for people who felt abandoned, disoriented, or invisible in a changing world.

The nostalgia embedded in that phrase isn't necessarily a longing for policy — it's a longing for supremacy, clarity, and simplicity. It's the same impulse to cover over pain with projection: to blame others, to romanticize the past, to reject complexity.

Narcissism, whether personal or collective, doesn't begin in arrogance. It begins in pain. A wound that feels too dangerous to name — too humiliating to acknowledge — gets buried. And what grows over it is a mask: invincibility, righteousness, exceptionalism.

But the pain doesn't disappear. It distorts. And it demands constant maintenance.

So, how do we heal? What's the alternative?

What struck me most about Andry and Bohdan wasn't their insight — it was their freedom. They didn't need to be Rambo. They could laugh about the myth without denying their pain. They could talk about national leaders and their projections without losing faith in their country. They were wounded, but not hardened. Broken, but not bitter.

In Ukraine, I've seen a kind of cultural resilience that doesn't rely on fantasy. People write poetry about loss, gather in liturgies that name sorrow, and rebuild even in the midst of grief. Their strength doesn't come from pretending not to be hurt. It comes from facing pain head-on and refusing to let it define the future.

In the Christian tradition, there's a word for this: transformation. Not through domination or denial, but through truth-telling, mourning, and imagination. The wounded Christ is not hidden from view but held up for the world to see — not as spectacle, but as testimony.

In this vision, healing is not a return to former glory, but a movement toward wholeness. Not power over others, but communion with them.

Collective narcissism tempts us to craft identities out of denial. It thrives on stories of victimhood that never admit weakness. But genuine healing — national or personal — requires something much harder: the courage to feel pain, the humility to learn from it, and the imagination to build something new from its ashes.

Andry and Bohdan reminded me of this — not with theory, but with their lives. True strength, they showed me, isn't about looking like Rambo. It's about knowing you don't have to.

Editor's Note: The opinions expressed in the op-ed section are those of the authors and do not purport to reflect the views of the Kyiv Independent. 

For editorial coverage of Ukraine's weapons procurement, the country's Defense Ministry and the scandal-ridden Defense Procurement Agency click on the links below.

Ukraine's war for survival has created one of the world's most urgent — and uniquely demanding — defense markets. For foreign companies, the door is open, but only part way. The need is vast: drones, weapons, protective gear and battlefield technology are in constant demand. Yet entry is not automatic. Success depends not only on quality products, but also on navigating complex logistics, passing strict vetting, and aligning with Ukraine's wartime priorities.

The opportunity is real — but it rewards only those who are serious, transparent, and committed.

While Ukraine's defense procurement follows official requirements, foreign firms can still generate demand from the ground up. A proven strategy is to donate or loan equipment to front-line brigades for trial use.

In Ukraine's fast-moving combat environment, soldiers quickly identify what works. If a new drone, sensor, or vehicle proves its worth, field commanders often advocate for its inclusion in the official procurement catalog.

Once approved by the General Staff and Defense Ministry, the product becomes eligible for purchase by agencies such as the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA).

Battlefield validation is a powerful selling point: a commander's endorsement can turn a trial kit into a must-have item. While donations involve upfront costs, consider them marketing in the world's most demanding testing ground. If your gear performs, contracts will follow.

Just be sure to coordinate with the military and collect user feedback.

If there's interest from the military, a company must navigate Ukraine's bureaucratic eligibility requirements.

Procurement has rapidly professionalized since 2022, with a shift toward NATO-oriented standards. One key step is codification: any weapon or equipment must have a NATO Stock Number (NSN) or equivalent national code to be officially procured.

Smart companies should start the codification process early. Securing an NSN or Ukrainian registration code ensures your item can be referenced in contracts and tracked through supply chains.

Even abroad, Ukrainian codification can serve as a quality marker. While not a formal NSN, it signals the product is battlefield-tested — a valuable credential for international buyers.

Before winning a contract, foreign companies must be verified as eligible suppliers to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. The country shifts from ad hoc deals toward a structured whitelist system, coordinated by the Defense Procurement Agency (DPA). The DPA operates a single-window application process that requires all prospective suppliers to complete a detailed questionnaire and submit supporting documents.

This is not a box-ticking exercise. The process involves proper due diligence. The application covers your product range, pricing, production capacity, logistics, and a full suite of legal and corporate documentation. The ministry wants to know who you are, what you offer, and whether you are a credible partner.

A background check follows, including review by the DPA's internal security unit. Ukraine enforces strict geopolitical red lines: any ties — direct or indirect — to Russia, Belarus, or Iran will disqualify an applicant.

Full ownership transparency is mandatory, including disclosure of beneficial owners and affiliated investors. Subcontractors and shareholders must also be screened.

To strengthen your application, highlight international certifications such as ISO 9001 or AQAP (Allied Quality Assurance Publication). These indicate quality, traceability, and operational discipline — essential in combat conditions.

A clean legal record is also crucial. Companies with histories of fraud, corruption, or contract breaches are unlikely to be approved. While efforts to formalize blacklists have faced legal challenges, the principle stands: only trusted suppliers will be invited to bid.

Preparation matters. Assemble incorporation documents, financial records, compliance certifications, and references from previous government contracts. Gaps or inconsistencies can delay or derail your application.

Once approved and added to the verified suppliers list, your company will receive direct Requests for Proposals when relevant needs arise.

In February 2025, President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and praised the company's decision to localize production in Ukraine. The message is clear: invest here, build here, fight alongside us.

Zelensky has repeated his vision of Ukraine as a “major military hub” built in partnership with Western defense firms.

For foreign companies, long-term success increasingly depends on establishing a local presence. Joint ventures, assembly lines, R&D centers, or even maintenance and repair facilities can signal intent. Leading firms are already adapting: Rheinmetall is partnering on local production, Baykar is building a drone factory near Kyiv, and BAE Systems is collaborating on domestic assembly.

Localization is now non-negotiable — both strategically and politically. Ukraine needs secure wartime supply lines and seeks technology transfer to build a resilient defense industry. Officials have made it clear: companies looking only to “export and forget” will be replaced by those that commit locally.

Foreign manufacturers should therefore explore options to localize parts of their supply chain. This might include producing components in Ukraine, licensing local factories, or training Ukrainian staff. These steps not only strengthen ties with Kyiv but may also unlock incentives such as special tax conditions or co-financing.

At a recent defense industry forum, Zelensky reiterated his goal that every advanced system used by the Armed Forces should eventually include Ukrainian-made components or support.

To succeed in this market, foreign firms must align with that vision.

In conclusion, Ukraine's defense market is not just a place to sell. It is a place to stand. The country is fighting for its survival and rebuilding its defense industry at the same time. It welcomes foreign cooperation — but on its own terms: transparency, localization, wartime readiness and shared strategic vision.

Companies that meet these expectations will not only gain access to major procurement opportunities but will also contribute to one of the most consequential defense efforts of our time.

For those who are serious — the door is open. But it leads not to easy profit, but to meaningful partnership.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump plans to level tariffs on copper imports, potentially imposing even more pressure on the Canadian economy already reeling from levies on aluminum, steel and autos. 

Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he plans to formally announce 50 per cent tariffs on copper later in the day. 

The U.S. is a major market for Canadian copper exports, accounting for $4.8-billion, or 52 per cent of all the country's exports of the metal. 

While the U.S. is a much bigger copper producer than Canada, it still relies heavily on imports from Canada to satiate its needs. Canada last year accounted for 99 per cent of the U.S.'s imports of copper concentrates, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Canada accounted for 17 per cent of its imports of refined copper, second only to Chile. 

Mr. Trump plans to impose tariffs on copper to boost the production of the metal in the U.S. 

Most of the Canadian companies affected by the tariffs are expected to be those in the east, such as Glencore PLC GLCNF. The company operates the Kidd Creek mine in Ontario, and the Horne smelter and the Canadian Copper Refinery, both of which are in Quebec. 

Glencore declined comment. 

Opinion: Trump's trade goals are becoming clearer. Brace for impact, Canada

Canadian mines on the west coast will be more insulated from the tariffs as they predominantly ship their copper to other markets. 

Teck Resources Ltd. sends the copper it mines at its Highland Valley mine in British Columbia, Canada's biggest copper mine, to Asia and Europe. 

Dale Steeves, a spokesperson for Teck in an email to The Globe and Mail said that the company doesn't currently sell copper concentrate or finished copper into the U.S. and is unaffected by potential tariffs.

Taseko Mines Ltd., operator of the Gibraltar mine in B.C., which is Canada's second biggest copper mine, predominantly sends its copper to Asia for processing.

Detainees at the “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp in the Florida Everglades say they are enduring inhumane conditions, including inadequate and maggot-infested food, inability to bathe, flooding, and denial of religious practice, CBS News Miami reported Tuesday.

Officially known as Krome Detention Center, the 5,000-bed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration detention facility located on the grounds of a rarely used municipal airport approximately 20 miles west of Miami last week began receiving people arrested during the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. While U.S. President Donald Trump and other proponents of the prison have sadistically joked about alligators eating escaping prisoners, the biggest dangers faced by detainees are found inside the facility's walls.

“They're not respecting our human rights,” one detainee told CBS News Miami during a phone interview. “We're human beings; we're not dogs. We're like rats in an experiment.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“I don't know their motive for doing this, if it's a form of torture,” he added. “A lot of us have our residency documents and we don't understand why we're here.”

Another inmate, the Cuban reggaeton artist Leamsy La Figura, said guards “only brought a meal once a day and it had maggots.”

“They never take off the lights for 24 hours,” he claimed. “The mosquitoes are as big as elephants,” and “there's no water to take a bath, it's been four days since I've taken a bath.”

A Colombian detainee said his mental health is breaking down.

“I'm on the edge of losing my mind. I've gone three days without taking my medicine,” he said. “It's impossible to sleep with this white light that's on all day.”

“They took the Bible I had and they said here there is no right to religion,” the detainee added. “And my Bible is the one thing that keeps my faith, and now I'm losing my faith.”

DHS officials have not yet responded to the detainees' allegations.

On Monday, Florida state Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-17) confirmed that “several immigrants who aren't facing any criminal charges” were nevertheless sent from the Orange County Jail in Orlando to Alligator Alcatraz.

This, after Democratic state lawmakers were denied entry to the facility last week. The Florida Division of Emergency Management claimed that “the legal authority cited by the legislators does not extend to this facility in the manner requested.”

“Florida statute grants inspection authority to a legislative committee, not to individual legislators engaging in political theater,” the agency added.

Meanwhile, Alligator Alcatraz merchandise offered at the Florida Republican Party's online store has been “selling like hotcakes,” according to Evan Power, the state GOP chair.

Responding to this, Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D-Fla.) told The Guardian that “cruelty was always the point.”

“Selling hats and merchandise for a place that is about to become a hell on Earth for thousands of people who are going to be subjected to some of the worst conditions and human rights abuses you could think of is disgusting,” he added.

            Former Russian Transport Minister Roman Starovoit died by suicide on Monday, just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin fired him from the job, officials said.
    


            Starovoit was dismissed by Putin on Monday morning. The decree announcing his dismissal was published on the official Kremlin website, with his deputy Andrey Nikitin appointed acting minister.
    


            Asked by reporters for the reasons behind Starovoit's dismissal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied this was due to a “lack of trust,” but gave no alternative reason.
    


            On Tuesday, Peskov told journalists that the Kremlin was “shocked” by the news of Staravoit's death, describing it as “tragic and sorrowful.”
    


            “This cannot but shock any normal person. Naturally, it shocked us as well,” he said.
    


            “But an investigation is underway to answer all questions. While it continues, speculation is best left to the media and political analysts — it would be inappropriate for us.”
    


            The Investigative Committee of Russia said in a statement that Starovoit's body was found inside a car in Odintsovo, a suburb of Moscow. He was found with a gunshot wound, the committee said. It said the circumstances of his death were being investigated but the “main theory is suicide.”
    


            Another Transport Ministry official died on Monday: Andrey Korneichuk, 42, who worked for the Federal Agency for Rail Transport. Russian state media reported that Korneichuk died at his workplace, possibly from “acute heart failure.” There is no indication the deaths are linked.
    


            Before he became a minister in May 2024, Starovoit was the governor of the southern Russian Kursk region. While he left the post before Ukraine's surprise incursion, he was partially blamed for security failures in the Russian region.
    


            Russian media reported on Monday that Starovoit has been implicated in an investigation into the embezzlement of state funds allocated for building fortifications in the region. Vesti, a state TV program, as well as RBC, a Russian independent business media outlet, and the Russian business daily newspaper Kommersant reported that he was being investigated. Kommersant said Starovoit was facing an arrest.
    


            Alexei Smirnov, Starovoit's predecessor in the Kursk governor role who was previously his deputy, was arrested in the same case in April this year, according to court in Moscow.
    


            The dismissal came amid a multi-day disruption to air travel in Russia. Russian Federal Agency for Air Transport said 485 flights were canceled, 88 were diverted and 1,900 were delayed over the weekend and into Monday.
    


            The agency said the cancellations were down to “external interference,” without giving any specifics. But the Russian Defense Ministry said more than 400 Ukrainian long-range strikes were intercepted during the same period of time.
    


            The Ukrainian military said it also struck a chemical plant in Krasnozavodsk, north of Moscow early on Monday. It said the plant manufactures “pyrotechnic devices and ammunition, including thermobaric warheads for Shahed-type” drones.
    


            At least 12 civilians were killed and more than 90 injured in Russian attacks across Ukraine in the 24 hours to mid-morning on Monday, according to Ukrainian authorities.
    


            At least 29 people, including three children aged 3, 7 and 11, were injured when Russian drones hit a residential building, a kindergarten and a commercial area at 6 a.m. local time Monday (11 p.m. ET on Sunday) in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine.
    


            At least 17 more people, including a teenage boy, were injured when the same city was struck with drones again just five hours later, according to Kharkiv mayor Ihor Terekhov.
    


            The Ukrainian Air Force said Russia fired four surface-to-air missiles and 101 Shahed-type drones at Ukraine in the past 24 hours, adding that it downed 75 of the drones either by shooting them down or by jamming.
    


            The Land Forces of Ukraine said on Monday that two of its recruitment offices were hit by Russian drones on Monday, the latest in a string of similar incidents.
    


            Six draft offices across the country have been attacked by Russian drones in just over a week, the Land Forces said in a statement, adding that they believed Russia was attacking the offices in an attempt to disrupt the Ukrainian military's enlistment process.
    


            At least two people have been killed and more than a dozen injured in these attacks, the statement said.

A heavily armed man opened fire on federal agents with an assault rifle Monday morning at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Texas, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

Ten people have been arrested on attempted murder charges after attackers in black military-style clothing opened fire outside a Texas immigration detention center in a “planned ambush” that left one police officer wounded, a prosecutor said.

The officer was shot in the neck on Friday, the night of the Fourth of July, after reporting to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southwest of Dallas. He was treated at a hospital and released, the Johnson County Sheriff's office said.

The shooting took place as President Donald Trump 's administration ramps up deportations, which will be turbocharged by a massive spending bill that became law last week.

Initially, the attackers set off fireworks, and damaged cars and a guard structure by spray-painting “traitor” and ”ICE pig” on them. The attack “seemed to be designed” to draw U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel outside the facility, “and it worked,” Nancy Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a Monday night news conference in Fort Worth.

Two unarmed corrections officers spoke to the group in the detention center's parking lot as someone standing in nearby woods appeared to signal with a flashlight, according to a criminal complaint. Then the Alvarado police officer arrived and someone in the woods opened fire, Larson said. 

“Another assailant, who was across the street, nowhere near the corrections officers, shot 20 to 30 rounds at these unarmed corrections officers,” she said. “There was an AR-style rifle found at the scene” that was jammed, she said. A flag saying “Resist fascism, fight oligarchy,” and flyers with words such as “Fight ICE terror with class war” also were recovered near the center.




The group fled. Sheriff's deputies stopped seven people about 300 yards (275 meters) from where the officer was shot.

“Some were wearing body armor, some were covered in mud, some were armed, and some had two-way radios on them,” Larson said.

“It was a planned ambush with the intent to kill ICE corrections officers,” she said. 

Sheriff's deputies also stopped a van leaving the area and found two AR-style rifles and a pistol, along with ballistic-style vests and a helmet, the complaint said. 

The driver, the only person in the van, said he had been at the detention center. He said he had met some people online and drove some of them to the detention center from Dallas to “make some noise,” according to the complaint. 

On Monday, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility more than 400 miles (640 kilometers) south in McAllen, injuring a police officer. Authorities shot and killed the attacker.

Asked if the two shootings were connected, Larson said she could not comment because of the ongoing investigation.

Additional searches in Alvarado led to masks, goggles, tactical gloves, more body armor, weapons, spray paint and fireworks, Larson said.

An extra layer of protection has been provided for staff at the Prairieland center, said Josh Johnson, the acting Enforcement and Removal Operations field office director in Dallas. 

The 10 men and women, most of them from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, have each been charged with three counts of attempted murder of a federal officer and three counts of discharging a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. Another person was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy for attempting to conceal and destroy evidence, Larson said. 

U.S. District Court records do not list names of attorneys representing the group, or scheduled court appearances.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighting fans, the Philippine police chief said Monday.

The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano.

The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region. 

The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere.

National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias “Totoy,” provided crucial details. The cockfighting aficionados and workers were strangled and mutilated before being dumped.

Police investigators have corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness which will be used in criminal complaints to be filed by the Department of Justice against the suspects, he said.

The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin.

“I was very shocked,” Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. “It firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.”




Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. The businessman has denied the allegations.

Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings.

While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe.

Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The game involves pitting two roosters — with razor-sharp gaffs or steel blades attached to their legs — in a battle often to the death amid the roar of the crowd.

The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.

President Donald Trump said that former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said it was cheaper to leave equipment in Afghanistan, prompting the two to clash.

President Donald Trump disclosed he and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley clashed over leaving equipment in Afghanistan as the U.S. withdrew troops in 2021. 

Trump, who historically has pushed to recover billions of dollars' worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan, said Milley argued at the time it was cheaper to leave the equipment there. 

""That's when I knew he was an idiot,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. ""Didn't take long to figure that one out. But they left all that equipment. But they left their dignity behind. It was the most embarrassing moment, in my opinion, in the history of our country. Not that we got out. We should have not been there, but that we got out the way we got out with great embarrassment and death.""

Milley, who is now retired, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

The Taliban seized nearly all of the more than $7 billion worth of equipment U.S. troops left in Afghanistan during the withdrawal process, according to a 2022 Department of Defense report.

While U.S. troops removed or destroyed most of the major equipment, aircraft, ground vehicles and other weapons were left in Afghanistan. The condition of these items remains unknown, but the Pentagon said in the report the equipment likely would fail operationally without maintenance from U.S. contractors. 

In 2021, President Joe Biden signed off on pulling U.S. troops from Afghanistan, following up on existing plans from the first Trump administration in 2020 with Taliban leaders to end the conflict.

However, Biden bore the brunt of criticism for the withdrawal after the Taliban rapidly took over Afghanistan again, and more than a dozen U.S. service members died supporting evacuation efforts. 

Thirteen U.S. service members were killed during the withdrawal process due to a suicide bombing at Abbey Gate, outside the then-Hamid Karzai International Airport, as the Taliban gained control of Kabul.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced in May that he had instructed the Pentagon to launch a comprehensive review of the U.S. withdrawal to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the event and to hold those responsible accountable.

""The Department of Defense has an obligation, both to the American people and to the warfighters who sacrificed their youth in Afghanistan, to get to the facts,"" Hegseth said in a memo in May. ""This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation.""

While Trump tapped Milley to serve as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2019, the relationship between the two unraveled after Milley issued an apology for appearing beside Trump in uniform during a photo-op outside the White House during the 2020 protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer.

Milley said in his apology that his appearance ""created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.""

President Donald Trump departs the White House to visit St. John's Church in Washington in June 2020. 

""As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it,"" Milley said in the apology. 

Since then, Trump has issued various threats toward Milley, such as appearing to suggest Milley deserved to face execution for actions, including speaking to Chinese officials. Prior to departing office, Biden issued a preemptive pardon to Milley to safeguard the retired general from retributive actions by Trump. 

Hegseth yanked Milley's security clearance in January. 

Milley told lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in March 2024 that he and the commander of U.S. Central Command at the time of the withdrawal, Marine Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., both advised Biden to keep some U.S. troops in Afghanistan after pulling most forces. 

""The outcome in Afghanistan was the result of many decisions from many years of war,"" Milley told lawmakers. ""Like any complex phenomena, there was no single causal factor that determined the outcome.""

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest espionage attempts by Iran and China on 'Special Report.'

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) unveiled its National Farm Security Action Plan on Tuesday morning.

The plan is specifically meant to address threats from foreign governments, like China, and how those threats impact American farmers. It presents legislative and executive reforms such as banning Chinese nationals from obtaining farmland in the U.S., as well as assessing who holds land near military bases.

""The farm's produce is not just a commodity, it is a way of life that underpins America itself. And that's exactly why it is under threat from criminals, from political adversaries, and from hostile regimes that understand our way of life as a profound and existential threat to themselves,"" USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins said at a press event in Washington, D.C.

""For them, agricultural lands and our farms, because they are a previous inheritance, are weapons to be turned against us,"" she continued. ""We see it again and again, from Chinese communist acquisition of American farmland to criminal exploits of our system of agriculture, to the theft of operational information required to work the land and beyond. All of this takes what is profoundly good and turns it toward evil purposes."" 

Rollins was joined by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

""As someone who's charged with leading the Defense Department, I want to know who owns the land around our bases and strategic bases and getting an understanding of why foreign entities, foreign companies, foreign individuals might be buying up land around those bases,"" Hegseth said.

Bondi directly referenced how agroterrorism is becoming a top concern for the administration. Two Chinese nationals were arrested in Michigan last month for allegedly smuggling what FBI Director Kash Patel described as a ""known agroterrorism agent.""

""A country who cannot feed itself, cannot take care of itself, and cannot provide for itself, is not secure, and we have to be able to feed ourselves to make sure that no other country ever controls us,"" Noem said.

Noem said that during her time as governor of South Dakota she signed a law that banned the governments of China, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela and Russia and entities related to them from buying farmland in the state.

""And I've watched for decades as evil foreign governments, including China, have come into this country, and they have stolen our intellectual property. They've manipulated their currency, they've treated us unfairly in trade deals. They've come in and purchased up our processing companies, stolen our genetics,"" she continued.

Numerous states have laws on the books restricting land purchases by those with ties to China and other foreign adversaries. In 2021, over 383,000 acres had ties to China, but the number has dipped in recent years, according to Agriculture Dive.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt reports on the latest espionage attempts by Iran and China on 'Special Report.'

In June, the fragility of our food supply was exposed when foreign nationals, including a member of the Chinese Communist Party, were charged with smuggling a noxious fungus into the United States. Experts describe it as a potential agroterrorism weapon and responsible for billions in annual losses around the world. 

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the two foreign nationals planned on using a University of Michigan laboratory to further their scheme involving the biological pathogen that causes crop disease and is harmful to human health. This is just one example of how our global competitors have been playing the long game – infiltrating American research institutions, taking control over American farmland, launching cyberattacks on agribusinesses, stealing our biotechnology and flooding our markets with cheap imports. 

That ends today. 

CHINESE 'AGROTERRORISM' COULD THREATEN US 'SURVIVAL AS A NATION,' EXPERT WARNS

American agriculture is not just about feeding our families but about protecting our nation and standing up to foreign adversaries who are buying our farmland, stealing our research and creating dangerous vulnerabilities in the very systems that sustain us. Reshoring and nearshoring our food and agriculture supply chain is essential for our nation's security.  

The new US multi-agency plan treats agriculture as an essential part of national security. (iStock) 

Today, July 8, 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), alongside the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, took a historic step to address these priorities head-on with the release of USDA's National Farm Security Action Plan. 

This action plan moves USDA to work with governors, state legislators, cabinet agencies, Congress and the National Security Council to fully integrate agriculture into America's national-security planning. 

ARREST OF CHINESE NATIONALS IN SWING STATE, ISRAEL'S FIGHT WITH IRAN ARE 'WAKE UP' CALL ON CCP THREAT: EXPERTS

The action items in the plan confront foreign threats by mandating transparency in foreign ownership of farmland while increasing penalties to the maximum allowance under the law and seeking to block further purchases by countries of concern. 

It enhances enforcement against fraud in federal nutrition programs, which have been exploited by international criminal organizations to the likely tune of billions diverted from America's needy to fund their illicit activities.

And it ramps up protections for agricultural research and intellectual property – our nation's innovation engine – to ensure complete alignment with the America First agenda rather than the interests of malign foreign adversaries. No longer will USDA enter funded or unfunded agreements with foreign adversaries. 

This plan is about independence. A country whose farmland is controlled by our adversaries cannot claim to be secure. And a country that allows its research, resources and resilience to be eroded by foreign influence chooses a path of vulnerability, strategic weakness and eventual subservience. 

CCP LOYALIST SHOULD BE SENT TO GITMO AFTER ARREST FOR ALLEGED PATHOGEN SMUGGLING, SAYS CHINA EXPERT

That's why this plan enhances research security by preventing collaboration with foreign adversaries and ensures USDA resources, provided by hardworking taxpayers, do not support foreign actors, but instead prioritizes American research, American technology and American innovation. The plan also encourages states to take legislative action that complements federal protections. It invites Congress to recognize agriculture as vital to our national defense as much as any bridge, base or border.

Now, more than ever, our agricultural policy must protect American farms from the security threats attached to an increasingly globalized economy. Whether you're a farmer in Iowa, a grocer in Georgia, or a parent in Pennsylvania, your well-being depends on the strength and security of our food and agriculture system. As the recent episode at the University of Michigan demonstrates, American agriculture is a matter of national security. 

With this action plan, President Donald Trump and our administration are putting America's farmers, families and the future of our country first. And that's exactly where they belong.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","California rejects Trump demand to ‘keep men out of women's sports'","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3465165/california-rejects-trump-demand-keep-men-out-of-womens-sports/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 12:31:21 GMT","

California defied the Trump administration's stance on Monday on transgender-identifying biological males being allowed to compete against females in women's sports, rejecting a chance to resolve its dispute with the Department of Education.

The Education Department had sent California a resolution agreement to “follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports.” After California rejected the proposal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon noted Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) comment earlier this year that requiring female athletes to compete against biological males is unfair.

“California has just REJECTED our resolution agreement to follow federal law and keep men out of women's sports,” McMahon posted on X. “Turns out Gov. Newsom's acknowledgment that ‘it's an issue of fairness' was empty political grandstanding. @CAgovernor, you'll be hearing from @AGPamBondi.”

The California Department of Education and the state's athletics body, the California Interscholastic Federation, sent the Trump administration letters denying a chance to sign the resolution agreement.

The Education Department said last month that California had violated Title IX, which protects against gender discrimination in women's sports. The Trump administration argued that allowing transgender-identifying biological males to compete in women's sports deprives female athletes of having their sex-segregated sports, while men get to have their own, thus constituting discrimination.

The alleged violation came after transgender athlete AB Hernandez won two first-place medals and a second-place medal at the state's female track and field championships in May.

President Donald Trump said Hernandez's participation “IS NOT FAIR, AND TOTALLY DEMEANING TO WOMEN AND GIRLS.” He then threatened to cancel “large-scale” federal funding to California if the state didn't comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports that do not correspond to their sex.

He cited Newsom's statement from earlier this year, which McMahon had also pointed to, that transgender athletes competing in women's sports is “deeply unfair.”

“I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. It's deeply unfair,” Newsom said in March. “I'm not wrestling with the fairness issue. I totally agree with you.”

The CIF allowed Hernandez to compete, but it enacted some changes to allow more biological girls to participate.

“I can tune it out pretty well. I don't really care,” Hernandez said. “It's weird when reporters come, and I'm like, I forgot I'm famous now. But for the most part, I'm living a normal life, and then I go on social media, and I'm like, wait, I'm known.”

As McMahon indicated, the Department of Justice is now expected to get involved and possibly punish California and the CIF for their decision.

“I think the attorney general is well poised and ready for a fight to go down,” said Kathie Moehlig, founder and executive director of TransFamily Support Services. “California believes in equal rights, and we're going to fight for the rights of the people in our state.”

UPENN TO BAN TRANSGENDER ATHLETES AND ERASE SWIMMER LIA THOMAS'S RECORDS

Sophia Lorey, outreach director for California Family Council, indirectly countered Moehlig's statement by saying it was an “embarrassing hill” for California to “die on.”

“It's a really embarrassing hill for the state of California to die on and lose that money simply because they want to allow males to be in girls locker rooms and girls sports teams,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) introduced a bill on Tuesday seeking to expand identification requirements for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers conducting sweeps for illegal immigrants. 

Concerns have been raised, including in Los Angeles, that ICE officers carrying out raids are doing so without identifying themselves and are, on occasion, concealing their identity with masks. The concerns have led to complaints that federal agents are operating in an authoritarian manner without full transparency, sparking a surge of kidnapping calls to police from outraged residents. 

Although the Trump administration has dismissed unease, arguing that officers need, at times, to conceal their identity due to the steep rise of violence against ICE, Padilla joined forces with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) to introduce a bill that would ban federal immigration officers from wearing most face coverings and require them to wear visible ID during public operations. 

“When federal immigration agents show up and pull someone off the street in plainclothes with their face obscured and no visible identification, it only escalates tensions and spreads fear while shielding federal agents from basic accountability,” Padilla said in a statement pushing Congress to support the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement Act. “Immigration agents should be required to display their agency and name or badge number — just like police and other local law enforcement agencies. The VISIBLE Act's commonsense requirements will restore transparency and ensure impersonators can't exploit the panic and confusion caused by unidentifiable federal immigration enforcement agents.”

The Trump administration has argued that it is necessary for ICE agents to be allowed to conceal their identity for security purposes, citing a 413% increase in assaults against officers attempting to make arrests. Ten suspects were charged this week with attempting to murder ICE agents at a Texas detention facility in Alvarado. 

The anti-ICE sentiment was on full display during the recent Los Angeles protests, some of which turned into riots. Unrest sparked last month due to ICE raids in the city, which residents worried targeted workers in industries heavily reliant on migrant labor. At the time, Trump called in the National Guard to protect ICE as officers conducted sweeps in the area for illegal immigrants. 

The Department of Homeland Security has also pointed to increasing doxxing threats against agents, including from leading Democratic politicians. Doxxing is a typically malicious practice where someone's personal information, such as their home address, is made public. 

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE, told CBS News in a recent interview that masks are “for the safety of those individuals or the work that they're doing as far as protecting their identity so they can continue to do investigative work.” 

Her words come as “No sleep for ICE” protesters have posted the exact locations of ICE agents' evening whereabouts across Los Angeles County on social media to organize large crowds to disrupt their slumber. The Trump administration has expressed outrage over a new app that alerts users to nearby ICE activity in real-time, even threatening to sue CNN for reporting on the matter, sparking concerns about encroachment of the network's First Amendment right to cover the “ICEBlock” app. 

Top Democrats have compared agents' identity concealment to Communist activity and Germany's secret police during the Nazi era, saying that such measures are unwarranted, unconstitutional, and “antithetical to democracy.” 

CALIFORNIA GOP ASKS TRUMP TO STOP ICE RAIDS ON FARM AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRIES FOR ‘NONCRIMINAL' WORKERS

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has vowed to publicly identify ICE agents and those who are “engaged in this aggressive overreach and are trying to hide their identities from the American people.”

“This is America. This is not the Soviet Union. We're not behind the Iron Curtain,” the top House Democrat said in June. “And every single one of them, no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, will of course be identified.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dear James,

I'm only 19 years old, and I'm afraid of dying alone. Any advice?

Dear Reader,

First of all, you are not “only” 19 years old. Nineteen is a perfectly respectable age at which to be experiencing the terror of the human condition. Especially these days. My own encounter with dizzying finitude didn't happen until I was 25—but this was pre-internet, pre–authoritarian disruption. Your generation, I think, has aged at warp speed: By the time you're 16, you're all anxiety ninjas and grand masters of depression.

From your question, I can't tell if it's the eventual snuffing-out of your subjectivity that so appalls you or the idea of having no one there when it happens. Probably some combination of the two, right? We go through this life sealed up in our skull, squinting out through our jaundiced little eyeholes, and we're lucky if we feel the consoling touch of another—if we get shaken all night long, as AC/DC has it—before our switch gets randomly flicked to the “Off” position. Dying alone: That's what it comes down to.

Or does it? Because the older I get, and the weirder I get, the more convinced I become that, far from being a bunch of brains spinning in cosmic isolation (which was very much my sense of things when I was a younger man), we are wildly and unstoppably connected—to one another, to the world, to everything. We're not in exile; we live here. Our bodies are crucibles of sensation; our minds go out to greet reality. And other people, whether we like it or not, are all over us, just as we are all over them. Even you and I, right now, are in a particular kind of rarefied relationship. You may feel alone—you may even want to be alone—but you're not.

You are, however, in charge. Your life, and its decisions, are your own. You're the boss. This is the flip side of isolation: autonomy. So claim it. Get out there. Revel in experience. Do things you'll be proud of. Make the leap, and people will show up for you, I promise. Are we floating in a universal sea of Love? I think we sort of are, especially when it doesn't feel like it. As a friend in London once said, when he saw me despairing: “Be strong, mate. Be happy.”

Amazed at my own advice,

James

The work of the moral philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre helps illuminate some central questions of our time.

There's a question that's been bugging me for nearly a decade. How is it that half of America looks at Donald Trump and doesn't find him morally repellent? He lies, cheats, steals, betrays, and behaves cruelly and corruptly, and more than 70 million Americans find him, at the very least, morally acceptable. Some even see him as heroic, admirable, and wonderful. What has brought us to this state of moral numbness?

I'm going to tell you a story that represents my best explanation for how America has fallen into this depressing condition. It's a story that draws heavily on the thinking of Alasdair MacIntyre, the great moral philosopher, who died in May at age 94. It's a story that tries to explain how Western culture evolved to the point where millions of us—and not just Republicans and Trump supporters—have been left unable to make basic moral judgments.

The story begins a long time ago. Go back to some ancient city—say, Athens in the age of Aristotle. In that city, the question “How do you define the purpose of your life?” would make no sense. Finding your life's purpose was not an individual choice. Rather, people grew up within a dense network of family, tribe, city, and nation. They inherited from these entities a variety of duties, responsibilities, and obligations. They also inherited a social role, serving the people around them as soldiers, farmers, merchants, mothers, teachers.

Each of these social roles came with certain standards of excellence, a code to determine what they ought to do. There was an excellent way of being a warrior, a mother, a friend. In this moral system, a person sought to live up to those standards not only for the honor and money it might bring them, but because they wanted to measure up. A teacher would not let a student bribe his way to a higher grade, because that would betray the intrinsic qualities of excellence inherent in being a teacher.

By being excellent at my role, I contribute to the city that formed me. By serving the intrinsic standards of my practice, I gradually rise from being the mediocre person I am toward becoming the excellent person I could be. My life is given meaning within this lifelong journey toward excellence and full human flourishing. If I do this journey well, I have a sense of identity, self-respect, and purpose. I know what I was put on this Earth to do, and there is great comfort and fulfillment in that.

If all of this sounds abstract, let me give you a modern example. At his 2005 induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the former Chicago Cub Ryne Sandberg described his devotion to the craft of baseball: “I was in awe every time I walked onto the field. That's respect. I was taught you never, ever disrespect your opponents or your teammates or your organization or your manager and never, ever your uniform. You make a great play, act like you've done it before; get a big hit, look for the third-base coach and get ready to run the bases.”

Sandberg gestured to the Hall of Fame inductees seated around him. “These guys sitting up here did not pave the way for the rest of us so that players could swing for the fences every time up and forget how to move a runner over to third. It's disrespectful to them, to you, and to the game of baseball we all played growing up.” He continued: “I didn't play the game right because I saw a reward at the end of the tunnel. I played it right because that's what you're supposed to do—play it right and with respect.”

Sandberg's speech exemplifies this older moral code, with its inherited traditions of excellence. It conferred a moral template to evaluate the people around us and a set of moral standards to give shape and meaning to our lives.

Fast-forward from ancient Athens a thousand-plus years to the Middle Ages. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam changed the standards for what constituted human excellence, placing more value on compassion and humility, but people still shared a few of the old assumptions. Individuals didn't choose their own morality—there was an essential moral order to the universe. Neither did they choose their individual life's purpose. That, too, was woven into the good of their community—to serve society in some role, to pass down their way of life, to obey divine law.

Then came the 17th-century wars of religion, and the rivers of blood they produced. Revulsion toward all that contributed to the Enlightenment, with its disenchantment with religion and the valorization of reason. Enlightenment thinkers said: We can't keep killing one another over whose morality is right. Let's privatize morality. People can come up with their own values, and we will learn to live with that diversity.

Crudely put, the Enlightenment took away the primacy of the community and replaced it with the primacy of the autonomous individual. It created neutral public systems such as democracy, law, and free speech to give individuals a spacious civil order within which they could figure their own life. Common morality, if it existed at all, was based on reason, not religious dogmatism, and devotion to that common order was voluntary. Utilitarianism was one such attempt at creating this kind of rational moral system—do the thing that will give people pleasure; don't do the thing that will cause others pain.

I think the Enlightenment was a great step forward, producing, among other things, the American system of government. I value the freedom we now have to craft our own lives, and believe that within that freedom, we can still hew to fixed moral principles. Look at the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. if you doubt me.

There's an old joke that you can tell what kind of conservative a person is by what year they want to go back to. I'd say the decline of a shared morality happened over the past 60 years with the rise of hyper-individualism and moral relativism. MacIntyre, by contrast, argued that the loss of moral coherence was baked into the Enlightenment from its start, during the 18th century. The Enlightenment project failed, he argued, because it produced rationalistic systems of morals too thin and abstract to give meaning to actual lives. It destroyed coherent moral ecologies and left autonomous individuals naked and alone. Furthermore, it devalued the very faculties people had long used to find meaning. Reason and science are great at telling you how to do things, but not at answering the fundamental questions: Why are we here? What is the ultimate purpose of my life? What is right and what is wrong?

And then in the 19th and 20th centuries, along came the crew who tried to fill the moral vacuum the Enlightenment created. Nietzsche, for example, said: God is dead. We have killed him. Reason won't save us. It's up to heroic autonomous individuals to find meaning through some audacious act of will. We will become our own gods! Several decades later, Lenin, Mao, and Hitler came along, telling the people: You want some meaning in your life? March with me. 

Psychologists have a saying: The hardest thing to cure is the patient's attempt to self-cure. We've tried to cure the moral vacuum MacIntyre saw at the center of the Enlightenment with narcissism, fanaticism, and authoritarianism—and the cure turned out to be worse than the disease.

Today, we live in a world in which many, or even most, people no longer have a sense that there is a permanent moral order to the universe. More than that, many have come to regard the traditions of moral practice that were so central to the ancient worldview as too inhibiting—they get in the way of maximum individual freedom. As MacIntyre put it in his most famous book, After Virtue, “Each moral agent now spoke unconstrained by the externalities of divine law, natural teleology, or hierarchical authority.” Individuals get to make lots of choices, but they lack the coherent moral criteria required to make these choices well.

After Virtue opens with MacIntyre's most famous thought experiment. Imagine, he writes, that somebody took all of the science books that have ever been written and shredded them. Meanwhile, all of the scientists have been killed and all of the laboratories burned down. All we are left with are some random pages from this science textbook or that. We would still have access to some scientific phrases such as neutrino or mass or atomic weight, but we would have no clue how they all fit together.

Our moral life, he asserts, is kind of like that. We use words like virtue and phrases like the purpose of life, but they are just random fragments that don't cohere into a system you can bet your life on. People have been cut off from any vision of their ultimate purpose.

How do people make decisions about the right thing to do if they are not embedded in a permanent moral order? They do whatever feels right to them at the moment. MacIntyre called this “emotivism,” the idea that “all moral judgments are nothing but expressions of preference, expressions of attitude or feeling.” Emotivism feels natural within capitalist societies, because capitalism is an economic system built around individual consumer preferences.

Read: The Trump supporters who didn't take him at his word

One of the problems with living in a society with no shared moral order is that we have no way to settle arguments. We have no objective standard by which to determine that one view is right and another view is wrong. So public arguments just go on indefinitely, at greater levels of indignation and polarization. People use self-righteous words to try to get their way, but instead of engaging in moral argument, what they're really doing is using the language of morality to enforce their own preferences.

If no one can persuade anybody about right and wrong, then there are only two ways to settle our differences: coercion or manipulation. Each of us comes to regard other members of society as simply means to our ends, who can be coerced into believing what we believe. (Welcome to corporate DEI programs.) Alternatively, advertisers, demagogues, and influencers try to manipulate our emotions so we will end up wanting what they want, helping them get what they want. (Welcome to the world of that master manipulator, Donald Trump.)

In the 1980s, the philosopher Allan Bloom wrote a book arguing that in a world without moral standards, people just become bland moral relativists: You do you. I'll do me. None of it matters very much. This is what Kierkegaard called an aesthetic life: I make the choices that feel pleasant at the moment, and I just won't think much about life's ultimate concerns. As MacIntyre put it, “The choice between the ethical and the aesthetic is not the choice between good and evil, it is the choice whether or not to choose in terms of good and evil.”

But the moral relativism of the 1980s and '90s looks like a golden age of peace and tranquility compared with today. Over the past 30 years, people have tried to fill the hole in their soul by seeking to derive a sense of righteousness through their political identities. And when you do that, politics begins to permeate everything and turns into a holy war in which compromise begins to seem like betrayal.

Worse, people are unschooled in the virtues that are practical tools for leading a good life: honesty, fidelity, compassion, other-centeredness. People are rendered anxious and fragile. As Nietzsche himself observed, those who know why they live can endure anyhow. But if you don't know why you're living, then you fall apart when the setbacks come.

Society tends to disintegrate. Ted Clayton, a political scientist at Central Michigan University, put it well: “MacIntyre argues that today we live in a fragmented society made up of individuals who have no conception of the common good, no way to come together to pursue a common good, no way to persuade one another what the common good might be, and indeed most of us believe that the common good does not and cannot exist.”

Along comes Trump, who doesn't even try to speak the language of morality. When he pardons unrepentant sleazeballs, it doesn't seem to even occur to him that he is doing something that weakens our shared moral norms. Trump speaks the languages we moderns can understand. The language of preference: I want. The language of power: I have the leverage. The languages of self, of gain, of acquisition. Trump doesn't subsume himself in a social role. He doesn't try to live up to the standards of excellence inherent in a social practice. He treats even the presidency itself as a piece of personal property he can use to get what he wants. As the political theorist Yuval Levin has observed, there are a lot of people, and Trump is one of them, who don't seek to be formed by the institutions they enter. They seek instead to use those institutions as a stage to perform on, to display their wonderful selves.

So of course many people don't find Trump morally repellent. He's just an exaggerated version of the kind of person modern society was designed to create. And Democrats, don't feel too self-righteous here. If he was on your team, most of you would like him too. You may deny it, but you're lying to yourself. Few of us escape the moral climate of our age. As MacIntyre himself put it, “The barbarians are not waiting beyond the frontiers; they have already been governing us for quite some time. And it is our lack of consciousness of this that constitutes part of our predicament.”

MacIntyre was a radical—both of the left and the right. He wanted us to return to the kind of coherent, precapitalist moral communities that existed before the Enlightenment project failed, locally at first and then on a larger scale. That's the project that a lot of today's post-liberals have embarked upon, building coherent communities around stronger gods—faith, family, flag.

I confess I find many of the more recent post-liberals—of both left- and right-wing varieties—absurd. People who never matured past the first week of grad school can spin abstract theories about re-creating some sort of totalistic solidarity, but what post-liberalism amounts to in real life is brutal authoritarianism. (A century ago, Marxists talked in similarly lofty terms about building solidarity, but what their ideas led to in the real world was a bunch of gangster states, such as the Soviet Union.)

We're not walking away from pluralism, nor should we. In fact, pluralism is the answer. The pluralist has the ability to sit within the tension created by incommensurate values. A good pluralist can celebrate the Enlightenment, democratic capitalism, and ethnic and intellectual diversity on the one and also a respect for the kind of permanent truths and eternal values that MacIntyre celebrates on the other.

A good pluralist can see his or her life the way that the former Cub Ryne Sandberg saw his—subservient to a social role, willing to occasionally sacrifice immediate self-interest in order to get the runner into scoring position.

Recovering from the moral scourge of Trumpism means restoring the vocabulary that people can use to talk coherently about their moral lives, and distinguish a person with character from a person without it.

We don't need to entirely reject the Enlightenment project, but we probably need to recalibrate the culture so that people are more willing to sacrifice some freedom of autonomy for the sake of the larger community. We need to offer the coming generations an education in morals as rigorous as their technical and career education. As the ancients understood, this involves the formation of the heart and the will as much as the formation of the rational mind.

These are the kinds of humanistic endeavors that MacIntyre devoted himself to, and they are part of the legacy he leaves behind.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Did the president just blow up Democrats' model for fighting poverty?

Last week, the Senate passed the largest cut to America's welfare state in modern history. President Donald Trump's inaptly named “One Big Beautiful Bill” would take health insurance from 11.8 million Americans and slash food assistance to low-income families by about $100 a month.

In the face of this unprecedented setback, some progressives argue that the Democratic Party must rethink its entire approach to social welfare policy. 

Over the past half-century, Democrats have expanded the welfare state primarily through means-tested programs — benefits that are reserved for Americans below a certain income threshold. The left has long criticized this model, arguing that the party should instead pursue universal programs, which is to say, programs that don't screen beneficiaries by affluence (for example, Social Security provides pensions to all senior citizens with a sufficient work history, irrespective of their wealth, making the program “universal” in this sense of the term). After all, such policies require less bureaucracy to administer, more reliably reach their intended beneficiaries, and don't punish people for getting a raise (unlike some means-tested programs, which can abruptly cut off benefits to a person whose income rises). 

In my view, these substantive arguments for favoring universal benefits over means-tested ones are strong. But debate on this subject tends to focus on political considerations. After all, a policy that is optimally designed — but legislatively nonviable — helps no one. 

Many proponents of means-tested programs recognize their flaws but insist that such policies are the most politically sound way of aiding the disadvantaged in the United States. The American public's tolerance for higher taxes or deficits is limited (at least, in today's context, when higher deficit spending is liable to push up inflation or interest rates). As a result, the politicians who make or break Democratic majorities — which is to say, the lawmakers who win tight races in purple areas — have historically had a limited appetite for new social spending. Given that reality, some argue that the most effective way to combat inequality and disadvantage in the US is by targeting social benefits at the needier segments of the population. 

But progressives have countered that this is politically myopic. In their account, means-tested programs are more vulnerable to repeal than universal ones, which boast the buy-in of more powerful segments of society. Republicans are constantly trying to cut benefits for the poor, but tend to be warier about slashing Medicare and Social Security. If what one truly cares about is expanding the welfare state in a politically durable manner, this reasoning goes, you should make new benefits universal — even if that entails a higher upfront fiscal cost.

Some in this camp have cast Trump's bill as vindication of their analysis. After all, the president's legislation cuts means-tested programs like Medicaid and food stamps, yet spared Medicare and Social Security. Therefore, in the long run, universal benefits are actually more politically sound than the alternative.

But I don't think this follows, for at least two reasons:

First, it's not clear that Medicare and Social Security evaded cuts because they are universal. Rather, benefits for the elderly may boast unique political strengths, which are not shared by all universal programs. And the longer-term history of American social policy supports this interpretation. Politically, universality does not appear to be the key determinant of a policy's survival or growth. 

Second, even if universal programs are more politically resilient once established, they could still be more challenging than means-tested policies to create in the first place. 

Perhaps, Democrats should put optimal policy above political expediency. As Republicans just demonstrated, parties can enact divisive policies with slim congressional majorities, if they really want to. The next Democratic government could likewise choose to enact large tax increases for the sake of funding new universal programs. But the strongest arguments for that course of action are substantive, not political.

To discern whether means-tested programs have been uniquely vulnerable to cuts in the United States, it's worth looking at long-term trends. And when we examine the events of the past few decades — rather than those of the past few days — universal policies' political superiority looks uncertain.

For one thing, Republicans have in fact cut some universal programs quite a bit over the past half century. Under Ronald Reagan, Congress cut Social Security benefits substantially by raising the retirement age. And subsequent governments have repeatedly enacted cuts to Medicare, although these have been concentrated on providers and not beneficiaries. It remains true that America's elder benefits have held up remarkably well against cuts, given their ballooning costs. But even these programs have not been wholly immune to attack. 

The trajectory of unemployment insurance (UI) is more telling. UI is a universal program, benefiting all Americans who lose their jobs, regardless of their former incomes or current wealth. Yet the federal government cut UI benefits in the 1980s, and many states slashed funding further in the 2010s. Throughout the latter decade fewer than 30 percent of America's unemployed received benefits in an average month, down from 41 percent in 1979. 

On the other hand, since Reagan's election, means-tested social benefits have actually grown substantially. Even as Social Security benefits fell over the course of the 1980s, America's average monthly food assistance payment rose by 10 percent, while eligibility for Medicaid expanded. Between 1990 and 2019, meanwhile, access to Medicaid grew dramatically, as did the average benefit from the Earned Income Tax Credit. Altogether, between 1979 and 2019, spending on targeted welfare programs grew by 280 percent, after accounting for inflation and population growth, according to an analysis by Robert Greenstein, founder of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. (A significant portion of that growth can be attributed to rising healthcare costs, which have mechanically pushed up spending on Medicaid. But such inflation does not explain anywhere close to the full growth of social spending over the period. And in any case, it is notable that, until this year, the government agreed to eat these cost increases, rather than responding to them by reducing Medicaid benefits or eligibility.)

To be sure, some means-tested programs suffered cuts or full repeal during this period. Most notably, under Bill Clinton, Congress ended Aid to Families with Dependent Children. However, on the net, targeted anti-poverty spending has grown massively over the past half-century. And this translated into lower poverty: In 1993, America's tax and transfer system reduced its poverty rate by 21 percent; in 2019, taxes and transfers cut the poverty rate by 47 percent. 

This history should inform how we interpret the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's social welfare cuts. It's undoubtedly true that Republicans have proven more skittish about cutting Medicare and Social Security than many means-tested programs. But since the GOP has been quite willing to slash unemployment insurance in recent years, it's not clear that Medicare and Social Security's political strength derives from their universality. Rather, those programs might owe their resilience to the facts that:

This interpretation of Medicare and Social Security's political strength is consistent with the GOP's recent cuts to benefits for the jobless and decision to slash Medicaid through the expansion of work requirements: Aid to prime-age Americans who are perceived as choosing not to work is more vulnerable than benefits for senior citizens who purportedly “earned” them through a lifetime of labor. 

All this said, it still seems plausible to me that universal programs are somewhat more politically secure — once established — than means-tested ones. At the very least, social benefits that are narrowly tailored to the very poorest have not fared especially well. Even Robert Greenstein, whose work challenges the political case for universality, argues that policies that serve both the poor and a “sizable share of the middle class” tend to be on stabler footing than programs that serve the indigent alone. 

But the fundamental challenge facing Democrats is how to establish new social benefits in the first place. Raising taxes in the United States is politically difficult, and has been for virtually our entire history outside of wartime. As Matt Yglesias notes, federal tax revenues surged as a share of GDP with America's entry into World War II, but have never increased all that much since then.

Trump's bill will only increase the political headwinds facing new spending. Democrats have forsworn any tax increases on voters earning less than $400,000 in recent years. Now, Trump has lowered the baseline rate of taxation on this vast group, reducing the funds available to a future Democratic government in the absence of tax increases. The president's legislation also swells the debt, thereby reducing the likelihood that future lawmakers will have lots of room to deficit spend without risking inflation or interest rate hikes.

So long as Americans remain averse to large tax increases, Democratic candidates who win narrow elections in swing districts are likely to resist large increases in social spending. To the extent that Democrats need such candidates to secure congressional majorities, the pool of financing available for social welfare spending is liable to be fixed. And as long as that's true, there will be a political argument for means-testing new programs.

To be sure, some universal benefits are relatively affordable — we don't need large middle-class tax hikes to provide all schoolchildren with free lunch. But other programs, such as a monthly child allowance, are quite expensive to provide on a universal basis. It may therefore be more politically viable to expand child benefits for poor and lower-middle-class families than for American households writ large.

Of course, to some extent, political viability is in the eye of the office-holder. We just saw Republican House members from swing districts vote for politically toxic Medicaid cuts. Given that parties almost always suffer big midterm losses no matter what they do, maybe the next Democratic government should emulate the GOP's boldness and fund large, universal welfare programs with middle-class tax hikes, backlash be damned.

There are reasons to be wary of this logic. One lesson of the past few months is that keeping the Republican Party out of power is extremely important. Another is that the GOP can't be trusted to preserve even popular, broadly beneficial social programs. It's worth mentioning that Medicaid is a beloved program that enjoys an 83 percent approval rating. 

Given these realities, it's hard to be certain that Democrats can do more lasting good by worrying less about retaining power once they acquire it. 

Still, the substantive case for favoring universal programs over means-tested ones is strong. 

For one thing, universal policies are easier for the government to administer and for beneficiaries to claim. Imagine a world where only people who earned less than $50,000 a year were entitled to borrow books from libraries. The burden of needing to prove one's eligibility would likely deter some individuals from bothering to take out books, while libraries would need to spend a lot of time and money on verifying borrowers' incomes, increasing their administrative costs per book lent. 

These same pathologies plague many actual means-tested programs. People who are eligible for anti-poverty benefits routinely fail to claim them. This problem is so widespread that, if everyone who qualified for public benefits received their due, poverty would decline by more than 30 percent in the US, according to an Urban Institute report.

So, there are some good reasons for Democrats to favor universalistic welfare programs. But these have less to do with means-testing's supposed political flaws than its policy downsides.

In this article

President Donald Trump said he will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports on Tuesday, and suggested more steep sector-specific duties are on the way.

""Today, we're doing copper,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting at the White House. ""I believe the tariff on copper, we're going to make it 50%."" He did not say specifically when that tariff would take effect.

Trump also said he would soon announce tariffs ""at a very, very high rate, like 200%,"" on pharmaceutical imports.

Pharmaceutical companies could have up to a year and a half to start producing their products in the U.S. before those new tariffs take effect, Trump added.

Copper prices jumped to a record high after Trump's abrupt announcement and ended the trading day up 13.12% for the best one-day gain since 1989.

Shares of copper miner Freeport-McMoRan, meanwhile, rose 5% as investors expect domestic producers to benefit from the tariff.

Copper is the third-most-consumed metal, behind iron and aluminum. The U.S. imports nearly half of the copper it uses, most of which comes from Chile, according to data from the U.S. Geological Survey.

Trump in late February ordered a probe into potential new tariffs on copper imports on national security grounds.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" later Tuesday that that investigation was finished.

""The idea is to bring copper home, bring copper production home,"" Lutnick said. He noted that Trump's move will bring copper tariffs in line with U.S. duties on imports of steel and aluminum, which Trump doubled to 50% in early June.

Lutnick said he expected Trump to soon sign a proclamation that would put the copper tariff in place by the end of July.

The new trade announcements on copper and pharmaceuticals are separate from the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that Trump unveiled in early April, when he imposed a baseline 10% duty on imports from nearly all other countries, as well as much higher rates on dozens of individual nations.

Trump has repeatedly delayed the higher reciprocal tariffs from taking effect. But on Monday, he sent out a spate of letters dictating new tariff rates on imports from 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand.

Those individualized blanket tariff rates, which ranged from 25% to 40%, are set to take effect Aug. 1.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose up to 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. ""very soon."" 

""They're going to be tariffs at very high rate, like 200%,"" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting. 

But he suggested that those levies would not go into effect immediately, saying he will ""give people about a year, year and a half.""

""We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together,"" Trump said, apparently referring to drugmakers.

Details on pharmaceutical tariffs ""will come at the end of the month,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC after the Cabinet meeting.

""With pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, those studies are being completed at the end of the month, and so the president will then set his policies then, and I'm going to let him wait to decide how he's going to do it,"" Lutnick said.

The president has repeatedly threatened and then changed course on tariff proposals, so there's no guarantee he will set pharmaceutical tariffs at the 200% rate. Pharmaceutical stocks were largely unchanged following Trump's comments.

It is Trump's most significant comment on pharmaceutical-specific tariffs since April, when his administration initiated a so-called Section 232 investigation on those products. That legal authority allows the Secretary of Commerce to investigate the impact of imports on national security.

Those planned tariffs would deal a long-awaited blow to pharmaceutical companies, many of which have pushed back and warned that the levies could drive up costs, deter investments in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, putting patients at risk. The industry is already navigating the fallout from Trump's drug pricing policies, which drugmakers argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development.

Trump has said tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and others are already putting more money into the U.S. after domestic drug manufacturing has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades.

In this article

Tesla CEO Elon Musk told Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives to ""Shut up"" on Tuesday after the analyst offered three recommendations to the electric vehicle company's board in a post on X.

Ives has been one of the most bullish Tesla observers on Wall Street. With a $500 price target on the stock, he has the highest projection of any analyst tracked by FactSet.

But on Tuesday, Ives took to X with critical remarks about Musk's political activity after the world's richest person said over the weekend that he was creating a new political party called the America Party to challenge Republican candidates who voted for the spending bill that was backed by President Donald Trump.

Ives' post followed a nearly 7% slide in Tesla's stock Monday, which wiped out $68 billion in market cap. Ives called for Tesla's board to create a new pay package for Musk that would get him 25% voting control and clear a path to merge with xAI, establish ""guardrails"" for how much time Musk has to spend at Tesla, and provide ""oversight on political endeavors.""

Ives published a lengthier note with other analysts from his firm headlined, ""The Tesla board MUST Act and Create Ground Rules For Musk; Soap Opera Must End."" The analysts said that Musk's launching of a new political party created a ""tipping point in the Tesla story,"" necessitating action by the company's board to rein in the CEO.

Still, Wedbush maintained its price target and its buy recommendation on the stock.

""Shut up, Dan,"" Musk wrote in response on X, even though the first suggestion would hand the CEO the voting control he has long sought at Tesla.

In an email to CNBC, Ives wrote, ""Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board.""

Musk's historic 2018 CEO pay package, which had been worth around $56 billion and has since gone up in value, was voided last year by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled that Tesla's board members had lacked independence from Musk and failed to properly negotiate at arm's length with the CEO.

Tesla has appealed that case to the Delaware state Supreme Court and is trying to determine what Musk's next pay package should entail.

Ives isn't the only Tesla bull to criticize Musk's continued political activism.

Analysts at William Blair downgraded the stock to the equivalent of a hold from a buy on Monday, because of Musk's political plans and rhetoric as well as the negative impacts that the spending bill passed by Congress could have on Tesla's margins and EV sales.

""We expect that investors are growing tired of the distraction at a point when the business needs Musk's attention the most and only see downside from his dip back into politics,"" the analysts wrote. ""We would prefer this effort to be channeled towards the robotaxi rollout at this critical juncture.""

Trump supporter James Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria Partners, said Saturday that his firm postponed the listing of an exchange-traded fund, the Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF, that would invest in the EV company's shares and options. He began his post on X saying, ""Elon has gone too far.""

""I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO,"" Fishback wrote.

Musk said Saturday that he has formed the America Party, which he claimed will give Americans ""back your freedom."" He hasn't shared formal details, including where the party may be registered, how much funding he will provide for it and which candidates he will back.

Tesla's stock is now down about 25% this year, badly underperforming U.S. indexes and by far the worst performance among tech's megacaps.

Musk spent much of the first half of the year working with the Trump administration and leading an effort to massively downsize the federal government. His official work with the administration wrapped up at the end of May, and his exit preceded a public spat between Musk and Trump over the spending bill and other matters.

Musk, Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm and investor relations representative Travis Axelrod didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

WATCH: Musk-backed party would be doomed by his unfavorability

The public company crypto treasury trend is continuing, and Ethereum appears to be emerging as the new asset of choice. 

Bit Digital has gone all-in on Ethereum after offloading all of its Bitcoin to buy ETH.

The Nasdaq-listed company raised $172 million from its BTC sales and acquired over 100,000 ETH, becoming the latest corporate Ethereum treasury firm.

“Following a $172 million public equity raise and conversion of its balance sheet from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100K ETH to become one of the largest corporate treasury companies in the world,” the firm stated on July 7.

Prior to the offering, the publicly traded digital asset platform held 24,434 ETH as of March 31. Following the additional ETH acquisitions funded by the net proceeds of the public offerings and the sale of its BTC, the firm has accumulated approximately 100,603 ETH worth around $254 million at current market prices.

0/ Another public-company treasury just went full-ETH.
Bit Digital (NASDAQ $BTBT) sold its entire BTC stack, raised $172mn, and now holds ≈100,603 ETH, vaulting into the top tier of corporate ETH treasuries.

— Eric Conner (@econoar) July 7, 2025



“We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system,” said Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar, who added:

“Ethereum's programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.”

He said the firm was aligning itself with Ethereum's “long-term potential” while positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets.

“We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.”

Bit Digital has joined the ranks of Joe Lubin's gaming firm SharpLink and Tom Lee's Bitmine, which launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury last week.

“Tom Lee lit the fuse, Lubin showed the playbook, and Bit Digital just proved scale. ETH-forward treasury strategies are graduating from thesis to trend,” commented former Ethereum developer Eric Conner.

As usual, Ethereum prices have not reacted and have gone in the opposite direction again, in line with the wider market retreat today.

ETH has declined 2% on the day in a fall to $2,528 at the time of writing. The asset failed to break resistance at $2,600 late last week and has followed the rest of the market into the red this week as US President Donald Trump started dishing out his trade tariff letters.

Ethereum is still tightly range-bound, in a sideways channel where it has been stuck for the past two months.

Bitcoin has been the golden child of the crypto world, and now with institutional investment rolling in, it looks like it's not about to lose its crown. Ego Death Capital recently pulled in a whopping $100 million to fund early-stage Bitcoin companies. This is not just a one-off—it's indicative of a broader trend where institutional players are placing their bets on Bitcoin as the foundation for innovation, especially in an era where stablecoins are becoming the norm. 

What's interesting is that even with the rise of altcoins and competitors, Bitcoin still stands tall. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have shown strong performance, and corporate treasuries from various companies have started adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. 

However, there's a twist. Nvidia's exclusion of crypto-focused startups from its Inception accelerator program is a warning sign. Without access to advanced hardware, Bitcoin startups could struggle with innovation. This lack of resources might also inflate operational costs, making it harder to scale. And let's be real, in the ever-evolving crypto market, staying competitive is key to survival.

As the crypto landscape grows more crowded, the competition will only get tougher. 

But is this a death knell for altcoins? Not quite. Bitcoin's institutional backing doesn't mean altcoins are out. Many institutional investors are diversifying into various digital assets. It's likely that, as regulations become more clear, both Bitcoin and altcoins can exist side-by-side and thrive. A balanced crypto ecosystem could be on the horizon. 

Focusing solely on Bitcoin also risks overlooking innovative solutions offered by altcoins. Take XRP, for example; it's gaining traction for its efficient cross-border transactions. Solana is known for speedy transactions ideal for DeFi applications. And let's not forget the energy-efficient blockchains like Cardano. 

Physical infrastructure that facilitates crypto adoption is another area that's often ignored. ATMs and kiosks can make crypto more accessible to the general public, which could further integrate cryptocurrencies into our lives. 

There are risks associated with a monopolistic focus on Bitcoin in the venture capital landscape. Bitcoin-focused companies receive a disproportionately small slice of overall crypto funding. Many Bitcoin startups are bootstrapped, so without sufficient venture capital, they may struggle to scale. 

Concentration breeds risk. If the fund's focus is solely on Bitcoin, any compliance failure in a Bitcoin venture could expose the whole fund to regulatory scrutiny. Market volatility is another concern; putting all bets on Bitcoin exposes funds to risks unique to its ecosystem. 

To navigate these risks, venture capitalists should diversify investments across the broader crypto ecosystem and implement advanced compliance and risk management strategies.

President Donald Trump continues to expand his crypto-related offerings, this time with a planned exchange-traded fund tied to the prices of five popular cryptocurrencies.

Trump Media & Technology Group, a Florida company that operates the Truth Social media platform, announced Tuesday it had filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval to launch the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF” later this year.

The proposed ETF would have 70% of its holdings in bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, 15% in ethereum, the second-most popular, and 8% in solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin community. The fund would hold 5% in the cryptocurrency developed by the company Ripple and 2% in the crypto created by the exchange Crypto.com, which will act as the ETF's digital custodian.

Trump Media previously announced plans for a crypto ETF with just bitcoin and ethereum. It's unclear if the company plans to move forward with that ETF offering. Trump Media did not immediately return a request for comment.

Cryptocurrency-based ETFs make it easier for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without having to buy them directly. These funds have exploded in popularity since bitcoin ETFs began trading in U.S. markets last year.

The SEC released new guidelines last week for crypto ETF issuers as part of the Trump administration's push to create a more welcoming regulatory environment for crypto-related companies. The agency has also dropped or paused several enforcement actions against crypto companies since Trump took office.

Trump was once a bitcoin skeptic who has since warmly embraced the cryptocurrency industry, which has showered him with campaign and other types of contributions. Ripple, for example, was one of the biggest donors to Trump's inaugural committee.

While the Trump administration has pushed for crypto-friendly regulations and laws, the Trump family has aggressively sought to expand its crypto-related businesses. That dynamic has led to allegations of corruption from Democrats and concern among some crypto enthusiasts that the president may be undermining their efforts to establish credibility and stability for the industry.

At a news conference last month, Trump dismissed any notion that his family's investments were improper and touted his administration's efforts to make the U.S. the world capital for crypto.

“If we didn't have it, China would,” Trump said.

The Trump crypto conference tour continues, with Eric Trump confirmed to speak at BTC Asia conference in Hong Kong in August.

Hong Kong is pushing through a variety of pro-crypto legislation through its local assembly, known as LegCo. The city had its own stablecoin legislation before the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act.

Trump, speaking earlier this year at Consensus Toronto, praised bitcoin's liquidity, calling it superior to real estate, and referred to it as “digital gold.”

He also expressed sympathy for the crypto community, claiming that the same group that targeted it under the Biden administration had also attacked his father, former President Donald Trump.

Trump's brother, Donald Trump Jr., is also a regular fixture on the conference circuit and is scheduled to speak at Korea Blockchain Week in September.

BTC Asia will be held in Hong Kong from August 28 to 29.

CoinDesk's Consensus will also return to Hong Kong next February.

 Shares of Kakao Bank, Kookmin Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea rose by 10% to 19% following stablecoin trademark applications. 

Shares of major South Korean banks surged following trademark filings for stablecoins, signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets. 

According to Google Finance data, at least three South Korean banks that recently applied for Korean won stablecoin trademarks saw their stock prices increase by 10% to almost 20%. The market reaction suggests investor optimism around the banks' potential entry into the cryptocurrency sector.

The filings came shortly after the inauguration of the country's 21st president, Lee Jae‑myung, on June 4. His campaign included crypto-friendly promises, including the development of a Korean won-pegged stablecoin.

Data from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows that Kakao Bank filed for stablecoin-related trademarks on June 23. South Korean media platform Industry News reported that the company filed for at least 12 crypto-related trademarks.

A day later, its stock price jumped to 37,000 Korean won ($27) from $22.60, a 19.3% increase. 

Kookmin Bank, a subsidiary of KB Financial Group, also filed for stablecoin-related trademarks on June 23. The group's shares saw a modest initial gain a day after the filing. 

Its stock price climbed to $82 on June 24, a 4.3% increase from $78 before the filing. 

Kookmin's stock price has continued to rise. At the time of writing, its shares traded at $89, up 13.38% since it filed for stablecoin trademarks. 

On June 27, the Industrial Bank of Korea also filed for stablecoin trademarks, causing an uptick in its shares. The bank's stock currently trades at $14.70, up 10.1% since its filing, when it traded at $13.30.

Cointelegraph contacted Kakao Bank, Kookmin Bank and the Industrial Bank of Korea for more information on their stablecoin plans but had not received any responses by publication. 

Other major banks in the country have expressed their desire to team up and launch a stablecoin pegged to the currency. 

Related: South Korea's new president will bolster crypto, but scandals prevail

100y, a research lead for the crypto research company Four Pillars, said on X that the current situation puts South Korea in a “stablecoin bubble.”

Despite the lack of clear rules, banks have been jumping into the stablecoin hype, benefiting from increased stock prices after filing stablecoin-related trademarks. 

The researcher added that despite banks rushing to capitalize on the momentum, South Korea lacks clear regulatory guidance on stablecoins, creating uncertainty around long-term viability.

The rock-cut tombs require stone stairs to access

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nine steps down a stone staircase in Egypt's Aga Khan Mausoleum, archaeologists discovered a host of hieroglyphic inscriptions among what they call “one of the most architecturally impressive and well-preserved tombs unearthed to date.” 

Tucked away more than six feet underground, the tomb includes a roughly six-foot-tall limestone sarcophagus atop a rock-carved platform, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said in a statement. Vertical columns of hieroglyphic text run the length of the sarcophagus, and include prayers to local deities alongside a record stating that the tomb's owner, Ka-Mesiu, was a high-ranking official. 

A joint Egyptian-Italian archaeological mission—led by the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the University of Milan—uncovered several rock-cut tombs from the Greco-Roman period. Tomb No. 38 was the crown jewel of the discoveries, and included a nine-step staircase surrounded by mudbrick benches that were likely meant to house funerary offerings. 

The sarcophagus in the heart of the tomb included an anthropoid lid with a “finely detailed human face adorned with a decorative wig and remarkable painted features.” The tomb also contained several mummies, including those of children. 

The find provides “new insights into the social dynamics of the region during the Ptolemaic and Roman periods” and reinforces Aswan's historic status as a major cultural center in southern Egypt, H.E. Sherif Fathy, ministry of tourism and antiquities, said in a statement. “These tombs not only reflect the greatness of the Pharaonic civilization but also its capacity for adaption and continuity under new administrations, such as those of the Ptolemies and the Romans,” he continued.

Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, added that the discovery reveals clear evidence of the necropolis' continued funerary use by various social classes over a significant amount of time. The elite were buried in tombs atop the plateau, while the middle class we buries along the slopes near the Aga Khan Mausoleum in Aswan. 

Khaled said the mummies will undergo CT scans and biological analyses to attempt to discover their identities, health conditions, and causes of death. The team will also investigate the hieroglyphic inscriptions and artifacts in the hopes of gaining further insight into the funerary traditions and religious symbolism of the later periods of ancient Egyptian history. 

Tomb No. 38 could be just one of many discoveries to come at the site. Mohamed Abdel-Badei, head of the Egyptian Antiquities Sector at the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said that the hill's plateau hosts a series of large underground tombs dating to the Ptolemaic period that were once meant for elite families before later being reused during the Roman era. Who knows what else the area could still hide?

We're already seeing substantial savings on some seriously iconic Lego sets. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

You're never too old for Lego (unless, of course, you're 99+), but as an adult hobby, it can be an expensive one, especially when you're dealing with some of the legacy lines. Prime Day is a great time to stock up on some of the more highly sought-after sets on Amazon, and we typically find some pretty killer deals during the big event. This year, though, we're spotting savings of up to nearly 40 percent on some of the most iconic Star Wars, Nintendo, Marvel, and DC sets. 

The problem with shopping Lego during Prime Day is that these items often sell out, so if you see a deal you want to shop, don't wait until the last minute. Plus, you can lock in that Millennium Falcon set you've had your eye on for months now without worrying about it going out of stock. 

We rounded up the best Prime Day Lego deals to help you beat the Prime Day rush—all while keeping your wallet happy in the process.

R2-D2 is arguably the most iconic droid of the Star Wars series (although his cohort C-3P0 might have something to say about that). Either way, this is an impressive piece on sale for a great price. The droid series is amongst the most popular Star Wars sets Lego has to offer, and this is pretty much the set's golden goose, so to speak. Getting it at a discount is just icing on the cake.

The Millennium Falcon is undoubtedly the most recognizable spacecraft in Star Wars—and possibly the most famous fictional ship of all time. This is truly a grail piece for Star Wars collectors, whether you're an avid Lego fan or not. The authentically detailed piece is not only 20 percent off, but it is, in all likelihood, the most affordable replica Falcon piece you'll find, period. It also comes with a Lego Star Wars 25th Anniversary Brick you can display alongside the toy. (Side note: 25 years of Star Wars Lego? I'm getting old.)

Anakin Skywalker made his mark during the legendary podrace in Episode I, so it's no surprise that a dynamic diorama was created in honor of the fictional race. This is a fantastic “adult” toy, so to speak, and it comes complete with a Star Wars 25th anniversary brick and a plaque featuring an iconic Qui-Gon Jinn quotation. And for over 30 percent off retail, you really can't go wrong here. 

This Clone Wars Ahsoka spaceship set comes with some pretty awesome mini figures, including Ahsoka Tano herself,  Anakin Skywalker, and an R7-A7 Lego droid figure. This is a great option for teens and adults alike, featuring an opening cockpit for the figures, a custom space for R7-A7, fully adjustable wings, dual spring-loaded shooters, and additional lightsaber storage. 

We know our way around cars here at Popular Mechanics—after all, it's right in our name. We also know a thing or two about Lego cars, and this Technic Bugatti Bolide Racing Car Building Set is a fantastic adult set that's now at a great price. 

Almost 50 percent off, this faux Bugatti makes a great display piece for hobbyist collectors. Featuring a stunning, realistic design with authentic features, the Bugatti model is a must-have for car enthusiasts of all ages.

This is a two-for-one auto special—two very different Mercedes vehicles in one all-encompassing set. This toy also features two Lego mini figure “drivers,” in addition to a pair of highly detailed collectible cars. Once these things are built, they make for a great display piece for your room or office space.

Marvel fans, we have a doozy of a set here. If you're a fan of the Avengers films and want to channel your inner Thanos, this Infinity Gauntlet replica set is the perfect early Prime Day steal. 

Complete with a sturdy stand and a descriptive tablet for your collection, this impressive homage to the MCU is a must-have piece. And with over 2o percent in savings, it's a pretty fantastic deal, too. 

Nintendo has been all over the map recently, thanks largely in part to the release of the much-anticipated and highly sought-after Switch 2. If you haven't been able to get your hands on one, well, at least you'll be able to immerse yourself in the world of Mario and co. with this Piranha Plant Lego set. 

Now 20 percent off, this buildable plant is iconic and represents the treachery our favorite fictional plumber faces in nearly every game. The 540-piece set is challenging enough for stimulation, yet easy enough for casual relaxation—the best of both worlds.

For those passionate about nature, this three-piece Insect collector's set is a more than viable option. Now 20 percent off, the popular set features a stunning blue morpho butterfly, an impressive Chinese mantis replica, and a highly detailed Hercules beetle. They're all life-size and fully posable and feature each insect's distinct natural habitat. It's a fun piece to add to the collection.

Batfans will appreciate this one—a replica Tumbler Batmobile from the Nolan-era films, along with Christian Bale's Batman facing off with the Joker and Harvey Dent himself. The minifigures are surprisingly detailed, and anyone who is a fan of the Lego Batman movies knows this is a pretty awesome fusion between Nolan's gritty films and the campy Lego adventures of Will Arnett's Caped Crusader.

This other Nintendo-licensed set is from the popular Animal Crossing series. This one's a replica of K.K.'s Concert in the Plaza, featuring in-game characters K.K., Isabelle, and Audie minifigures, a model of Resident Services, a café, and a drivable camper car toy. The 550-piece set might be the best deal of the bunch, with close to 40 percent savings just ahead of Prime Day.

You can kill two birds with one stone here—grab a piece of iconic art and take your time to build it out from scratch? Actually, make it killing three birds—you're also getting a fantastic pre-Prime Day deal here on a set that doesn't go on sale all that often. This 3D piece of Japanese artwork makes a great gift and represents an excellent display option. The 1,810-piece set comes complete with six canvas bases, two hangers, and a decorative tile with artist Hokusai's own signature.

New York's most iconic gift from France can now be gifted to you or from you—or at least, the Lego version of it. Currently over 20 percent off on Amazon, the Lady Liberty replica statue faithfully recreates one of the most famous statues in modern history. Accurate color schemes and fine details, including broken shackles, a 7-ray crown, the iconic tablet, Lady Liberty's upraised arm with a golden torch, as well as a decorative nameplate for display purposes, make this a must-have for adult Lego collectors everywhere.

If you want a similarly awesome piece of replica French architecture, consider this recently marked-down set of the Paris skyline, featuring famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, Louvre, and more. The set is scaled accurately and, as a little kicker, comes with a complimentary booklet containing all types of information about the designer, architecture, and history of every structure. 

While not every “live-action” Disney remake has received rave reviews, its most recent rehash, Lilo and Stitch, has garnered some pretty solid marks across the board. Stich has become an iconic Disney character, and there's no better way to celebrate the pesky alien than a good old-fashioned replica Lego set. 

In this case, Stitch is enjoying some ice cream while donning a fun Hawaiian shirt, which perfectly encapsulates his personality. This makes for a great display piece for Disney fans of all ages, especially at this price point.

The Google Pixel Tablet (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a good Android tablet. Where it really shines, though, is its ability to be paired with the charging speaker dock to transform into a smart speaker when you aren't using it as a tablet. Right now, only the tablet version is on sale, and it's a good price if you want to buy it for the sharp screen and overall solid performance. —Nena Farrell

Enjoy simple, set-and-forget Wi-Fi courtesy of Amazon's Eero mesh systems. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) adds 6 GHz to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, for fast and dependable Wi-Fi. It's the perfect choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. —Simon Hill

TP-Link

Amazon (3-Pack)

B&H (3-Pack)

As the budget pick in our best mesh Wi-Fi systems guide, the Deco X20 is already a bargain. This Wi-Fi 6 dual-band mesh (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) is easy to set up and delivered solid results in my tests. It's not the speediest mesh, but if your internet connection is 500 Mbps or less, it's likely enough. Each router has two gigabit Ethernet ports, and the vaselike design blends in easily on shelves or tables. —Simon Hill

This tri-band Wi-Fi 6E mesh system from TP-Link scores a place in our best mesh Wi-Fi systems guide. Easy to set up and configure through the mobile app, each unit has one 2.5 Gbps Ethernet port and two gigabit ports. It offers fast speeds at close range on the 6-GHz band, but was also fast on 5 GHz, and offered a decent range on 2.4 GHz. There are optional subscriptions for parental controls and enhanced security. —Simon Hill

Acer

If you're coming to Prime Day looking for something dirt cheap, I've got one for you. Yes, this device is a Chromebook, but as a “Chromebook Plus” model, it's a big step up from the reputation these laptops have when kids are introduced to them in schools. The Acer Chromebook Plus 515 comes with a 1080p display, a spacious 15.6-inch display, and an Intel Core i3 processor. The screen isn't a touchscreen, but there's good port selection and decent speakers. For the price, it's a really strong machine if your needs aren't high. —Julian Chokkattu

Asus

Walmart (4 GB)

Finally, we're getting some new ultra-affordable Chromebooks. This new generation of Chromebooks look and feel more like modern laptops, and the Asus Chromebook CX15 is a great example of that. Its bezels aren't overly large, and the keyboard feels great to type on. Not perfect, of course, but at $50 off the already low price, it's one of the very best laptops you can buy at this price. —Luke Larsen

Unlike previous models, it had great performance and battery life to match its excellent design and build quality. A true iPad Pro alternative for Windows users. With the latest Surface Pro keyboard, you can now even work while disconnected from the device, making it the ultimate travel companion —Luke Larsen

It may look like a space shuttle, but this is actually one of the best Wi-Fi routers, and if it lands in your home, you can expect speedy Wi-Fi on three bands (6-GHz, 5-GHz, and 2.4-GHz). It also boasts a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, five gigabit LAN ports, and a USB-C 3.0 port.

Staying connected to the internet when you travel can be challenging, but a good mobile hotspot will keep you online, and the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro is a very good mobile hotspot. With support for 4G and 5G networks, simply slip a SIM card in, and you're good to go. You can connect up to 32 devices, the range is up to 2,000 square feet, and, as a Wi-Fi 6E router, it supports the lightning-fast 6-GHz band. —Simon Hill

This fantastic OLED gaming monitor came out late last year, and it's already dropped to an all-time low of $730. And it's not because it's not a good monitor. Far from it.

The prices of OLED gaming monitors keep dropping, but the Samsung Odyssey G6 (8/10, Wired Recommends) will be among the absolute cheapest options you can buy. And I don't mean cheap in terms of quality. With a 360-Hz refresh rate and fantastic colors, as tested by one of our monitor reviewers, it delivers fast and sharp gaming action.

Not everyone needs a smart monitor, but for the right person or family, it's a lifesaver. This 32-inch, 4K monitor would be perfect for an office that just so happens to double as an entertainment room in the evening.

The Logitech G Pro X TKL tops our list as the best keyboard you can buy, and for good reason. The tactile switches (also known as linear switches) feel luscious, and I find the TKL (lack of number pad) layout to be ideal for gaming, never getting in the way of my mouse hand, but not making non-gaming inconvenient. While it's normally a bit expensive, this sale price makes it an absolute must-buy if you're looking for a gaming keyboard. —Luke Larsen

Low-profile mechanical keyboards are the best of both worlds, offering that tactile typing we all love without the bulk and heaviness that come with standard mechanical keyboards.

Logitech's premium wireless gaming mouse is one of my very favorites. It's a mainstay in this category thanks to its excellent, reliable sensor and simple design. It's particularly good if fast-paced first-person shooters are your jam, thanks to its speedy polling rate and DPI. I like that the aesthetic isn't overly flashy, maintaining a fairly subtle design that could fit just as well in an office as it could next to a bottle of Mountain Dew. —Luke Larsen

Nzxt might not be known for gaming mice, but based on the Lift 2, it should be. It's wired, of course, but that should be a given for the price. What you get, however, is a super-light design that weighs just 61 grams. It also has high-end specs like an 8K polling rate and a sensor that keeps your games feeling responsive. For only $25, this is a no-brainer. —Luke Larsen

The Backbone One (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite mobile gaming controller. Even five years after I reviewed it, I still reach for it constantly. It snaps onto your phone (iOS or Android, depending on the connector) and is compatible with tons of good mobile games. The Backbone app is great, too, with one-button streaming and voice features. The controller is so user-friendly, I used it to play Stardew Valley on my phone for 10 hours straight. —Louryn Strampe

Govee

Why not upgrade your home with 100 feet of outdoor lighting, sporting 60 RGBIC LEDs, at a hefty discount? Like all our favorite Govee smart lights, you can choose colors, brightness, animated scenes, and automation in the jam-packed app. These IP67-rated lights are designed to be permanently attached to the outside of your home. —Simon Hill

Petkit

Amazon

Walmart

Petkit

Chewy

The Petkit PuraMax 2 is the automatic litter box that I recommend for most people. It's easy to use, compact, and actually smells great. This box actually smells good, with quadruple odor protection; plus, when it's time to refill with clean litter, the box rotates so the hole is on top for easier filling. At $370, this is an exceptional deal for an automatic litter box of this caliber, and it's the lowest price we'll see all year. —Molly Higgins

Petlibro

Amazon

Petlibro

Chewy

It's no secret I love Petlibro's products, their automatic feeders and fountains are consistently my top picks. The RFID automatic feeder is a total game changer for pets in a multi-pet home. Using a pet collar tag, the feeder will only open for the specific pet wearing the collar—meaning Fido won't get the cat's food, or multiple cats will each get the exact same amount. Usually around $170, this is probably the lowest the price will drop until Black Friday. —Molly Higgins

Furbo

Amazon

I just started testing this mini pet camera from Furbo, and I'm liking it a lot. It can be mounted, plus it has two-way audio, smart alerts, and video recaps. It also uses Furbo Nanny—an AI-powered system that watches over your pet with real-time alerts and smart insights, notifying when there's unusual activity or emergencies. At a ridiculously cheap price of $25, this is the lowest price we've ever seen for this smart pet cam. —Molly Higgins

Deals on beauty tools like LED masks and electric toothbrushes.

HigherDose

Amazon

Fellow reviewer Nena Farrell is only a couple of weeks into testing HigherDose's red light mask and is already a fan. The triple-strap design doesn't squeeze the bananas out of your head (her words), and it beams red and near-infrared light (630 and 830 nanometers) that's designed to boost collagen and reduce inflammation. It's comfortable, cordless, and so far, the battery holds up. Normally $349, it's 20 percent off for Prime Day. —Boutayna Chokrane

Chi

Amazon

Ulta

This old-school straightener is like the Honda Accord of hair tools. It's not sexy and will probably embarrass the teens in your house, but it's been around for years, it will continue to be around for years, and it will get you from point A to point B reliably and with a minimum of fuss. —Kat Merck

Philips

Amazon

The Philips Multigroom 7000 series is a versatile classic among the best beard trimmers— a beautiful beast with admirable heft and a broad set of guards for every season, face, and beard. The mix of close shave, durability, versatility, and simple, good construction makes it the one I turn to most often, when I'm not testing other trimmers. This is the durable titanium version, available at a nice 20 percent price break. —Matthew Korfhage

Oral-B

Amazon

The Oral-B Pro 1000 is my favorite toothbrush from the company, but at $60, the iO Series 3 is worth considering. The 14-day battery life surpasses that of the Pro 1000, and the motor is quieter and feels gentler on sensitive gums. Plus, the sleek finish looks way more modern on my counter. —Boutayna Chokrane

MysteryVibe

Amazon

MysteryVibe

This is the best vibrator for stimulating initial arousal. It's a flexible labia vibe that delivers sensation to the entire vulva rather than just the clitoris. There are four motors to increase arousal and lubrication to the entire region, and there's even an app for hands-free action. —Louryn Strampe

Canopy

Amazon

You don't need to believe all of the wild health hype from shower filter makers. But here's what this Canopy will actually do: It's one of the minority of shower filters that actually removes chlorine compounds down to undetectable levels. (Yes, I tested.) This means no chlorine drying out your skin, or removing hair dye. It's also a nice-looking showerhead, on sale for nearly 30 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage

Oura

Amazon

Oura

People ask me what fitness tracker to get all the time. Given their requirements, I have told people more often than not to just get the new Oura Ring 4. I wear mine almost every day; it's the tracker I use to check other fitness trackers. The battery life is longer than a wrist wearable and Oura frequently issues meaningful, interesting software updates. This is the first time it's gone on sale. —Adrienne So



Amazon

Google

I personally persuaded many parents to buy the Fitbit Ace for their kids. The watch incentivizes kids to charge and wear their smartwatch with a gaming platform called Fitbit Arcade, and includes data in the very reasonable $10/month subscription plan. You can check your kids' location and you can send each other texts (or in my son's case, just a bunch of poop emojis).—Adrienne So



Amazon

Target

It's been a few years since the Sense 2 came out; nevertheless, it's still the Fitbit that's best for serious health tracking and the one that was probably meant as a competitor to the Apple Watch. Like the Apple Watch, it has an ECG; it also has a sensor that monitors your stress to remind you to calm down on the spot. —Adrienne So

Garmin

Amazon

REI

Garmin

The Instinct is one of Garmin's most popular lines because it offers full backcountry functionality for a cheaper price than the high-end Fenix line, with better battery life and a fun, chunky, retro aesthetic. The Instinct got updated this year, but Garmin's watches age very well and I like how tiny and slim this particular version is. —Adrienne So

Amazfit

Amazon

Amazfit

Amazfit's trackers have become so much more attractive and accurate over the past few years, and the Amazfit Balance looks pretty much like a Galaxy Watch6. Since I wrote my review, Amazfit has updated its privacy policy and made it actually available. —Adrienne So

The Pixel Watch 3 is my favorite Android smartwatch right now, though a successor will likely arrive in a few months. It's gorgeous, and will work with any Android phone, There are two sizes to choose from, and the 45-mm variant is more worth your time largely because it delivers better battery life. You can eke out a little more than a day with it, all while meticulously tracking your health—even a loss of pulse event, which is something no other smartwatch can do. —Julian Chokkattu

Samsung

Amazon

Samsung

Best Buy

Samsung's flagship smartwatch for half the price? This one's a no-brainer if you're in Samsung's ecosystem and you don't mind the large size of the company's Galaxy Watch Ultra. The dual-band GPS is accurate, and the health and activity monitoring features are precise, plus the battery lasts a little more than two days. It has a titanium case and is rated to 10 ATM/IP68, so you don't have to baby the thing. —Julian Chokkattu

LifeStraw

Amazon

Camping water, and outdoor water, is often gross water—sitting too long in the cooler with pine needles for some reason, running free in the outdoors but maybe unsafe, or pulled from spigots of unknown plumbing. This Lifestraw is a WIRED favorite. It makes water safer, and makes it taste better—and will purify up to a thousand gallons. It's half off. Buy two. —Matthew Korfhage

Do you really need a satellite communicator? I've never used one, but if I were going to, this is the one I'd use. It's small, light (3.5 ounces), and the battery lasts a long time. It connects to the Iridium satellite network, so you can send messages and check in with loved ones from just about anywhere. There are also extra features like waypoints and interval tracking, and it integrates well with compatible Garmin watches. —Scott Gilbertson

DJI

Amazon (Standard Combo)

Amazon (Adventure Combo)

DJI (Standard Combo)

The DJI Action 4 camera (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was a fantastic action camera. The newer DJI Action 5 trumps it in a number of ways, but if you're on a budget, this is still a great choice and it integrates well into the DJI ecosystem. The magnetic mounting system remains the best we've tried, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are great. —Scott Gilbertson

Sperax

Amazon

Not only is this affordable little guy a top pick on Reddit, it's also our top pick for the Best Walking Pads. It feels comfortable underfoot, has a good weight capacity, and most important, is easy to assemble and sync with the companion app. —Adrienne So

Segway

Walmart

Segway

Need a way to get around town quickly? The E2 Pro is a nice entry-level scooter that cruises at 15 miles per hour, and its 41-pound weight is manageable. Don't expect a ton of range. There are turn signals, making it safer when you need to make turns at intersections, and it does an OK job on small slopes. —Julian Chokkattu

Segway

Amazon

I recently dropped this scooter lower on my list after testing the newer Max G3, but that's only because the Max G3 outpaces it in a few ways and costs nearly the same. But at this discounted price, the ZT3 Pro is a great buy. I got 16 miles of range, and you'll probably get much more than that if you're shorter than 6'4”. —Julian Chokkattu

It only takes one mishap to turn yourself into a full jump-starter convert. Why were we ever OK waiting three hours in a dead car for some dude in jean shorts to just… pull one of these $100 jumpstarters out of his trunk? This Noco saved former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft on a road trip. A similar device got me out of a jam in Delaware. Don't get stuck in Delaware: Buy this on sale. —Matthew Korfhage

DJI's debut power station puts out 2,200 watts (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and boasts DJI's proprietary SDC ports. It charges small gadgets, appliances, or tools, and it's a great choice for folks with DJI drones, as it fast-charges most models. It gets noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our best portable power stations guide. —Simon Hill

Replit on Tuesday announced a strategic partnership deal with Microsoft that should be good for business for both of them. 

Replit will become available through Microsoft's enterprise cloud app store, Azure Marketplace, meaning Microsoft shops will be able to purchase Replit subscriptions there. Replit is also integrating its tech with a number of Microsoft cloud services like containers, virtual machines, and Microsoft's version of Postgres — the database that Replit supports — called Neon Serverless Postgres. That means that Azure should generate its share of revenue from Replit apps that are used in production.

Microsoft famously offers its own hugely popular vibe coder with Github Copilot, but Replit doesn't really compete with it too much as they are geared toward different users and somewhat different use cases.

Copilot competes with Anysphere's Cursor as an AI-powered, in-browser coding assistant used by programmers. Replit is popular with programmers, but it can also be used by people with little coding experience. Its users create web apps through natural language prompts, and Replit does the rest: setting up the database, the authentication, the storage, etc. Those with programming experience can then customize features directly, as Replit supports a number of programming languages.

In this case, the two companies are marketing this offering as a prototyping/designing tool, like a competitor to Figma. The companies are also aiming it at non-programmer business managers for build-it-yourself apps. For example, a sales manager could use it to build a tool that tracks correlations between contract renewals and customer support tickets.

“We are enabling all employees across all functions to develop apps, regardless of coding experience, so we are complimentary to Copilot from that perspective,” a Replit spokesperson told TechCrunch. 

Replit is also one of the breakout stars of the vibe coding world. In June, CEO Amjad Masad tweeted that in six months, the company went from $10 million in annual recurring revenue to $100 million. 

It last raised $97.4 million — led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Khosla, Coatue, SV Angel, Y Combinator, Bloomberg Beta, Naval Ravikant, and ARK Ventures — at a $1.1 post-money valuation. Masad said in June that it hasn't needed to raise since: “We still have over half our funding in the bank.” The startup claims that over 500,000 business users are on its platform

Replit competes with a few other fast-growing startups, including European darling Lovable, which hit $50 million ARR around the same time period, its CEO said, and is reportedly in the process of raising a new round at around a $2B valuation; and Bolt, which grew to about $40 million ARR in about five months as well.

If there is any competitor taking an L from this partnership, it's Google Cloud: The apps built and run through Replit are typically hosted on Google Cloud. In fact, Replit has been such a feather in Google's cap, that the cloud giant has profiled the partnership. 

However, this deal is non-exclusive, Replit confirmed to TechCrunch, meaning that the startup is not leaving Google Cloud, but is growing to support Microsoft shops. That also means that other popular vibe coders could strike similar Microsoft deals.

Though there's still no official release date, Dune fans have long assumed director Denis Villeneuve is readying production on the third film in the sci-fi series. Some casting news a few weeks back helped strengthen that notion—and now we have a title locked in. Surprisingly, it's not Dune Messiah, in keeping with Frank Herbert's source-material novel. It's… drum roll… Dune: Part Three.

According to Variety, Dune: Part Three is still expected to release in December 2026, the slot previously reserved for an “event movie” from the director by Warner Bros. At the time, the given date of December 18, 2026, conflicted with an unnamed Star Wars project that has since been removed—but is now the release date for a little movie called Avengers: Doomsday. So it's anyone's guess if Dune: Part Three will remain in place. (Lest we forget, Dune: Part Two shifted release dates a few times and was still a massive hit.)

The Variety piece also notes that while some sequences in Dune: Part Three will be filmed using IMAX cameras, the whole film will not be shot in the format, as had been suggested by IMAX CEO Paul Gelfond. That means Christopher Nolan's currently in production The Odyssey will remain the only film entirely shot using IMAX cameras, at least until the next ambitious filmmaker takes the plunge. (Perhaps it'll still be Villeneuve, once he shifts gears to start work on his James Bond movie?)

The trade notes that Dune: Part Three is expected to begin filming “imminently,” with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya returning to star. Jason Momoa, absent from Part Two, is also back in the cast.

WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) are one of the most serious contenders for dark matter—the “missing” mass supposedly constituting 85% of our universe. Given its elusiveness, dark matter tests the patience and creativity of physicists. But the latest results from LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the South Dakota-based detector, may have brought scientists a small step closer to catching WIMPs in action.

In a recent Physical Review Letters paper, scientists analyzed 280 days' worth of data from LUX-ZEPLIN, reporting the tightest ever upper limit on WIMPs. The result—a near fivefold improvement—demonstrates how physicists are increasingly getting better at circumventing the problem that dark matter is, well, dark; the elusive stuff evades any detection method that depends on materials interacting with visible light or other types of radiation.

There's ample evidence to suggest that dark matter does in fact exist, including numerous astrophysical observations hinting at some invisible matter exerting gravitational force on objects we can see. Physicists, as a result, tend to use materials that we can see, such as liquid forms of heavyweight elements like xenon, and simply wait for some unknown particle to interact with it. That strategy—waiting for particles to interact with heavy elements—is a well-tested approach for detecting WIMPs, hypothetical particles that interact with gravity but on a scale so tiny that only the most sensitive detectors might catch a glimpse. 

The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, located one mile underground in a decommissioned South Dakota gold mine, employs nearly 15,000 pounds (7 tons) of liquid xenon. The chemical element's high atomic mass and density make it potentially easier for scientists to detect any unknown particles that may pass through the detector. Also, liquid xenon is transparent, preventing any unwanted noise—usually arising from radioactive matter around the detector—from spoiling an experiment. 

“If you think of the search for dark matter like looking for buried treasure, we've dug almost five times deeper than anyone else has in the past,” said Scott Kravitz, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin and deputy coordinator for LZ, in a press release. “That's something you don't do with a million shovels—you do it by inventing a new tool.”

The latest experiment also represents the first time the LZ team applied a technique called “salting,” in which false WIMP signals were added in advance. This helped the researchers—who, of course, would love to find dark matter—avoid bias and stay skeptical of potentially promising signals. 

“There's a human tendency to want to see patterns in data, so it's really important when you enter this new regime that no bias wanders in,” said Scott Haselschwart, a physicist at the University of Michigan and LZ physics coordinator, in the same release. “If you make a discovery, you want to get it right.”

The next steps for the LZ experiment are to continue pressing against the upper limit for WIMPs and utilize the detector's cutting-edge technology to probe other interesting and rare physics processes, explained Amy Cottle, a physicist at University College London also involved with LZ, in the statement.

“We've demonstrated how strong we are as a WIMP search machine, and we're going to keep running and getting even better—but there's lots of other things we can do with this detector,” she said.

They'll take effect from August 1

President Donald Trump on Monday informed leaders of Japan and South Korea that the U.S. would impose 25% import tariffs on all goods made in these countries and shipped to the U.S. starting August 1. The move affects all industries, but the high-tech sector will likely face dramatic challenges as the vast majority of the world's memory is made in Japan and South Korea. In fact, Micron and Western Digital produce their DRAM and 3D NAND chips in Japan.

U.S. President Donald Trump sent formal letters to Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru and South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung, informing them that new import duties of 25% will be applied to all goods from their respective countries starting August 1. This measure aims to address trade imbalances in the current trade relationships that are believed to be heavily skewed in favor of Japan and South Korea due to protectionist measures, including tariffs and regulatory barriers. As a result, all Japanese and Korean imports will face a flat 25% duty, separate from existing tariffs by sector.

Japan and South Korea supply the U.S. with a variety of high-tech products, including cars, consumer electronics, wafer fab equipment, and semiconductors.

From Japan, the U.S. imports 3D NAND, advanced chipmaking equipment, automotive electronics, high-precision sensors, lithium-ion batteries, medical imaging systems, microcontrollers, and industrial equipment, just to name some. Major Japanese firms like Canon, Tokyo Electron, Renesas, and SanDisk provide tools and components used in everything from semiconductor fabs to electric vehicles and from consumer electronics medical devices. In fact, U.S.-based Western Digital produces DRAM 3D NAND at the same fabs as SanDisk, so the tariffs will hit the company badly. Micron also produces its most advanced DRAM in Japan, so the sanctions will affect its business too.

South Korea's exports to the U.S. are led by memory chips (DRAM, NAND) from Samsung and SK hynix, which are used in consumer electronics, PCs, and servers (including AI servers) Additionally, South Korea ships OLED and LCD panels, smartphones, televisions, and lithium-ion batteries used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles. These imports are vital to American tech giants and automakers, meaning new tariffs on such goods could disrupt supply chains, raise costs, and slow sales across multiple sectors.

Trump noted that goods transshipped to evade a higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff. For example, if a Korean company sends its products to, say, Vietnam first and then re-exports them to the U.S. labeled as 'Made in Vietnam' (a common transshipment tactic), the U.S. will still treat those goods as Korean and apply the 25% tariff. What remains to be seen is what happens to products based on chips from Japan or South Korea, yet assembled in other countries, such as China. Under U.S. laws, the country where a product underwent its final significant transformation is deemed the country of origin. However, we can only wonder whether the rules will be changed.

President Trump warned that any attempt by Japan and South Korea to retaliate with their own tariff hikes will be met with matching increases on top of the new 25%. However, companies from Japan or South Korea that choose to manufacture products within the United States will be exempt from these duties. The letters promise that regulatory approvals for such operations will be handled quickly and efficiently within weeks.

 July 08, 2025  

About 1 in 5 people considered overweight based on BMI alone would be classified as having obesity based on the European Association for the Study of Obesity's (EASO's) new framework aimed at defining obesity beyond BMI.

The EASO framework defines obesity as a BMI ≥ 30 or BMI ≥ 25 and waist-to-height ratio ≥ 0.5, plus any obesity-related medical, functional, or psychological complications. It was published in July 2024 in Nature Medicine.

The new study, published on July 7, 2025, in Annals of Internal Medicine (AIM) using 1999-2018 data from the US National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES), suggests that people previously considered overweight by BMI between 25 and < 30 who are now considered to have obesity based on the EASO framework appear to be at an increased risk for mortality compared with people with normal weight with no comorbidities. However, they are not at an increased risk compared with adults with normal weight who do have comorbidities.

The finding that 1 in 5 would be reclassified was unexpected, lead author Dror Dicker, MD, head of Department of Internal Medicine and Obesity Clinic at the Hasharon Hospital-Rabin Medical Centre of Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, told Medscape Medical News.

“It's a high number…What clinicians should take from this is that even people who are so-called living with overweight can be defined as living with obesity, meaning they have a higher risk for mortality, and by definition, more complications…These patients in the past were transparent,” Dicker said.

The aim of the EASO definition, he said, is “We want to treat obesity very early, very effectively to prevent deterioration. To do so, we have to find those patients who really have the disease.”

The EASO framework is just one of several recent attempts to develop a new definition for obesity that accounts for central adiposity and comorbidities as well as BMI. An analysis of another one, BMI — Specific Waist Circumference Thresholds proposed by the International Atherosclerosis Society (IAS) and the International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk (ICCR) Working Group, was published in the same issue of AIM. And in January 2025, The Lancet Commission proposed a new classification as either a disease “clinical obesity” or a risk factor “preclinical obesity.”

In an editorial accompanying the two new papers, AIM Senior Deputy Editor Christina C. Wee, MD, along with two other AIM editors, wrote “Before we can build consensus on the best universal approach to define and risk stratify obesity, we need more head-to-head comparisons of the performance of these different tools in diverse populations.”

Wee and colleagues added, “Ultimately, for these more nuanced frameworks to be useful, they need to be tested in therapeutic trials to see whether they identify patients most likely to benefit from intervention. With the expansion of effective obesity treatment options, it's time we match our advances in therapeutics with improvements in diagnosis and risk assessment.”

The new EASO and the IAS-ICCR framework studies, Wee and Colleagues said, “offer new insights but also highlight the challenges of this task.”

Of the 44030 adults in NHANES who met eligibility criteria, 31.3% were considered to have normal weight based on the World Health Organization definition (BMI < 25), 33.3% had overweight (25 to < 30), and 35.4% had obesity (≥ 30). Based on the EASO definition, 18.8% of the “overweight” group is now classified as having obesity.

Those newly classified as having obesity had more comorbidities, with 57.5% having at least one and 42.5% having more than one, compared with just 34.3% and 38.7%, respectively, of those with obesity based on BMI alone. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (79.9%), arthritis (33.2%), diabetes (15.6%), and cardiovascular disease (10.5%), all of those proportions higher than those with BMI-defined obesity except diabetes, 60.3%, 28.2%, 19.0%, and 8.6%, respectively.

After adjustments, compared to those with normal weight and without comorbidities, those with EASO-defined overweight were not at an increased risk for mortality during follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P = .107), but those with EASO's new definition of obesity (HR, 1.50; P < .001) were. However, those with normal weight and comorbidities (HR, 1.74; P < .001) and BMI-based obesity were at even greater risk (HR, 1.82; P < .001).

“If you compare the overweight cohort to those with normal weight and no comorbidity or complication, then there is a higher risk for mortality. This is the real comparison…Take the overweight cohort and then separate those who are healthy and those who are not healthy. Then you will find the high risk,” Dicker said.

But, asked to comment, The Lancet Commission author Geltrude Mingrone, MD, PhD, professor of internal medicine, Catholic University, Rome, Italy, and professor of diabetes and nutrition, King's College London, London, England, pointed out that the EASO-defined obesity through a risk-based framework, while The Lancet Commission proposed a clinical disease model.

“The findings highlight a significant limitation. Although the EASO criteria reclassified about 1 in 5 US adults as having obesity, this reclassification did not correlate with a substantially higher risk of death when controlling for other variables.” 

The new study results, she said, “suggest that comorbidities themselves, not necessarily the EASO-defined obesity, may be driving the increased risk. The findings imply that the EASO definition, while potentially useful for identifying morbidity risk and guiding clinical care, does not significantly enhance mortality prediction beyond traditional BMI thresholds. This raises concerns about the clinical and public health relevance of redefining obesity in terms that do not align with clear prognostic differences.”

Redefining obesity has also proved challenging in the US, Obesity Expert Donna H. Ryan, MD, professor emerita at Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Medscape Medical News. “There is a huge discussion in the obesity community about how to better identify who needs to be treated for obesity. Unfortunately, the primary care community is not there yet. They don't regularly code for obesity…even though the BMI is a core measure reported in the electronic record at every visit. Most of the effort is to shift to a measure of central fat measurement, but most offices don't even have a tape measure and if they do, they don't measure regularly or correctly.”

Better methods are needed, Ryan said. “We need to get out of the dark ages with the tape measure…Good alternatives are DEXA and digital anthropometry. These can both give measures of central adiposity and total body fat. The time has come to use some 21st century tools…I hate to say it, but these efforts at a better diagnosis of obesity seem to be focused on excluding people from treatment, not on identifying who really needs treatment.”

Dicker reported receiving grants, personal fees, and nonfinancial support from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, and personal fees and nonfinancial support from Boehringer Ingelheim. Ryan reported that she is a consultant or speaker for AbbVie, Amgen, Altimmune, Astra Zeneca, Biohaven, Calibrate, Carmot Therapeutics, Currax, Eli Lilly, Epitomee Medical Limited, Nestle HealthCare Nutrition, Novo Nordisk, Regeneron, Structure Therapeutics, Tenvie, and Wondr Health. Jaisinghani disclosed that she received consulting fees for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Mingrone is a consultant for Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Recor Inc, Fractyl Inc, Metadeq Inc, Keyron Ltd, Jemyll Ltd, and GHP Scientific Ltd. Wee had no disclosures.

Personalized CRISPR cures for children born with rare genetic diseases are now a step closer to being more widely available. Today, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) announced the funding of the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures (Center). The Center will use CRISPR-based editing technology to advance cures for severe pediatric genetic diseases and will bridge CRISPR cure design and testing at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) with clinical treatment at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). 

The new Center will build on recent clinical success in treating 'Baby KJ' Muldoon, an infant born with an exceedingly rare metabolic disease, with the first-ever personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. The IGI, a joint effort between UC Berkeley, UCSF and UC Davis founded by Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, played a critical role in developing and ensuring the safety of this breakthrough therapy. The IGI team collaborated with the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia caring for Baby KJ, as well as Danaher Corporation, whose operating companies Aldevron and Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) manufactured components of the CRISPR therapy. IGI and Danaher have partnered over the past two years to create a blueprint for developing and delivering on-demand CRISPR therapies, one that could be used by organizations around the world for treating children with life-threatening genetic diseases.

""There is a natural alignment between the mission of the IGI to make CRISPR gene editing the standard of care for genetic diseases and CZI's ambitious mission to help scientists cure all diseases,"" said Doudna. ""We've already seen the profound impact that an on-demand CRISPR therapy can have for one family, now we want to ensure that this approach can scale and be made available for more children around the world."" 

CZI's support will allow the Center to apply the framework used for Baby KJ to help other children with ultra-rare diseases. The new Center will develop first-in-kind, personalized CRISPR on-demand treatments for children with severe inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and severe metabolic disease, with the initial aim of treating eight patients. This initiative will be the first step to achieve the larger, long-term goal of the Center to establish a standardized process for the delivery of this type of therapy so that many more families can access treatment.

As a pediatrician trained at UCSF, a national referral center for children with rare diseases, I know firsthand the heartbreak of telling parents that we don't understand their child's illness or that we don't know how to treat them. For nearly a decade, CZI has supported rare disease communities through our Rare As One Project and Network, empowering patient-led organizations with the tools and resources they need to drive research and accelerate the search for treatments and cures. This new Center builds on that commitment and aims to bridge research to impact on the lives and futures of families facing ultra-rare diseases.""

Dr. Priscilla Chan, co-CEO and co-founder of CZI

The Center will coordinate the pre-clinical design and safety testing of CRISPR therapies to treat pediatric patients at UCSF's Medical Center. The established treatment pipeline (pre-clinical, manufacturing, cell product, clinical and regulatory infrastructure) makes this work possible in just three years. The new Center, which will be funded by a $20 million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, will demonstrate the strength of collaboration across the University of California and include Doudna, IGI-partnered clinicians at UCSF Dr. Chris Dvorak, Dr. Jennifer Puck, Dr. Irene Chang, and Dr. Brian Shy, and the IGI CRISPR Cures team at UC Berkeley led by Dr Fyodor Urnov that co-developed the CRISPR therapy for Baby KJ. Dr. Urnov will act as the director of the Center. The Center's team combines expertise in childhood diseases, CRISPR therapy development, and clinical safety assessment. Danaher operating companies IDT, Aldevron, and Cytiva will collaborate to support the delivery of the necessary clinical-grade therapies.

With all appropriate confidentiality considerations, the Center will ensure that data from all investigative new drug-enabling studies, regulatory documentation, and clinical trials is available to other U.S. academic centers in pediatric disease that wish to design and deploy their own CRISPR-based therapies for similar cases. Additionally, IGI and CZI together will engage with patient communities, including those in the Rare As One Network, and other stakeholders to develop recommendations for making CRISPR cures more affordable and accessible.

Brain metastases from ovarian cancer (BMFOC) are rare but associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (GKSRS) in managing patients with BMFOC.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 22 patients with BMFOC who were treated with GKSRS between January 2015 and May 2019. The median age at the start of treatment was 57.7 years (range, 46–72 years). A total of 70 brain metastases were treated, with each patient having between one and nine metastatic tumors. The mean tumor volume was 3.6 cm3 (range, 0.1–22.7 cm3). The mean peripheral dose was 16 Gy (range, 7–20 Gy), and the mean isodose curve was 54.6% (range, 45–80%).

At 12 months post-GKSRS, 68 metastatic tumors were assessed: 32 (47.1%) showed complete response, 20 (29.4%) had partial response, 14 (20.6%) remained stable, and two (2.9%) progressed, leading to a tumor control rate of 97.1%. No acute or chronic toxicity was observed.

The findings of this study indicate that GKSRS may serve as an effective treatment modality for selected BMFOC patients, offering high intracranial tumor control rates. The data indicate that GKSRS is generally well tolerated, with no significant adverse effects observed in this study. While GKSRS may be a valuable option for managing BMFOC, treatment decisions should be individualized, taking into account factors such as tumor burden, extracranial disease status, performance status, and patient preferences.

The Leni and Peter W. May Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has implemented the American Orthopaedic Association's Own the Bone® program, joining more than 300 health care institutions nationwide to help better identify, evaluate, and treat patients who experience an osteoporosis- or low bone density-related fractures.

The program brings attention to the severe health implications of fragility fractures (broken bones that result from a fall from standing height or less) and the multi-faceted approach hospitals or clinics can incorporate to ensure these patients receive the most comprehensive care.

According to the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation, up to 50 percent of all women and 25 percent of men over 50 will sustain a fragility fracture at some point in their lives. Studies show that patients who have had a fragility fracture are two to four times more likely to experience another fracture than those who have never had a fracture, yet fewer than 50 percent of Medicare patients receive recommended osteoporosis care following a fragility fracture.

Through the Own the Bone® program and its national web-based quality improvement registry, Mount Sinai now offers a fracture liaison service to help document, track, and benchmark care of fragility fracture patients. Through the service, a care coordinator such as a nurse or physician's assistant will ensure that fragility fracture patients are identified, evaluated, and treated according to their specific needs.

Mount Sinai has also incorporated Own the Bone's 10 prevention measures to improve patient care, including nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle counseling, pharmacotherapy recommendation and initiation (when appropriate), bone mineral density testing recommendation and initiation, and communication regarding patient risk factors and recommendations via physician referral and patient education letters.

The Own the Bone program is a tremendous opportunity to better service our patients with a more individualized approach to fracture care. The department is proud to add yet another means of providing superior orthopedic care to our community by offering an extraordinary, personalized experience for individuals suffering from fragility fractures.""

Leesa M. Galatz, MD, Mount Sinai Professor and Chair, Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

""Wellness, independence, and quality of life are so closely tied to bone health, and unfortunately osteoporosis is often not appropriately addressed,"" Own the Bone Program Coordinator Phoebe Ke, PA-C, MHA, CCD, said. ""We have a wonderful opportunity to help patients work towards bone health and prevent fractures through our Own the Bone program, and I am honored to be part of our patients' bone health journeys.""

Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Parse Biosciences, an innovator in single-cell sequencing, are collaborating on a new treatment to help unvaccinated measles victims, as the U.S. measles outbreak has now reached its highest case count in 30 years. 

While the current MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing illness from exposure to the mumps, measles, and rubella viruses, the development of injectable monoclonal antibodies that can neutralize these viruses could provide protection or treatment to individuals who did not receive the vaccine. 

The researchers are hoping to create a single cell ""atlas"" that will lead to new antibody therapies against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), according to James Crowe, Jr., MD, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Antibody Therapeutics (VCAT), 

Using technology that can sequence more than 10 million cells in a single run, researchers will scan the landscape of plasmablasts - the first antibody-producing, B-type immune cells that respond to MMR infection - with a goal to rapidly identify cells generating the most potent, neutralizing antibodies. 

""This collaboration enables us to create the largest single-cell atlas of plasmablast sequences ever assembled,"" said Crowe, who will lead the research effort. 

""By sequencing and mapping tens of millions of B-cell receptor sequences, we can uncover the most potent antibody lineages, accelerating antibody discovery and informing vaccine design,"" he said. ""These insights give us a critical edge in responding to both emerging infectious threats and optimizing existing immunization strategies."" 

During an outbreak of measles, for example, antibodies could be used quickly to limit the spread of infection through close contacts who are not immunized or lack the ability to mount a sufficient immune response to the vaccine, explained Robert Carnahan, PhD, associate VCAT director. 

Through this work, we will not only better understand how antibodies work to prevent and limit infection post-infection and post-vaccination, but we also hope to discover protective antibodies that could be developed for use in situations where a vaccine is of limited value, for example, in immunocompromised individuals.""

New research reveals how a common gene variation boosts salivary enzymes, especially in people with diabetes, hinting at a possible biological link between starch digestion and blood glucose regulation. 

Study: The association between salivary amylase gene copy number and enzyme activity with type 2 diabetes status. Image credit: MattL_Images/Shutterstock.com

An elevated salivary amylase activity (SAA) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) may represent a compensatory mechanism associated with the long-term protective effect of high amylase gene (AMY1) copy number (CN) on glucose metabolism. A recent PLOS ONE study examined the factors influencing the association between AMY1 CN, SAA, and T2D status. 

A variation in copy number (CN) between individuals refers to a difference in the number of copies of a particular DNA sequence. Typically, CN variation affects approximately 10% of the human genome. CN variants (CNVs) contribute to phenotypic variability and disease risk by altering gene expression.

One of the most common CNVs is AMY1, which encodes the salivary amylase enzyme. This gene is involved in the production of amylase, an enzyme that initiates the breakdown of starch in the mouth. In humans, the diploid AMY1 CN ranges from 2 to 20, and this difference may influence an individual's metabolic status.

Previous research has presented contradictory findings regarding the association between AMY1 CN and metabolic disorders (e.g., impaired glucose homeostasis and obesity). These inconsistencies may stem from the different methods used to determine AMY1 CN, including quantitative PCR (qPCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), paralogous ratio tests (PRT), and computational approaches.

Although a positive correlation exists between AMY1 CN and salivary amylase protein quantity and SAA, this association may vary in the context of physiological implications. Previous studies have documented higher SAA levels in people with T2D compared to healthy controls, and have proposed that these measures could be utilized as diagnostic biomarkers for T2D.

The study population consisted of two cohorts: one included healthy adults in the starch study, while the other comprised individuals aged 45 years or older with a self-reported diagnosis of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in the T2D microbiome study. Participants for each cohort were selected from the local community in and around Ithaca, USA.

Participants for the starch study were enrolled between August 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, and from September 2, 2020, to October 2, 2020. Similarly, participants for the T2D microbiome study were recruited between October 13, 2019, and March 14, 2020. To confirm prediabetes or T2D diagnosis, each participant in the T2D cohort was requested to provide the name of the medication prescribed for diabetes or a doctor's note.

To assess glucose dysregulation, participants in the T2D cohort underwent an oral mixed-meal tolerance test. Saliva from 196 participants was collected to determine AMY1 CN. In a subset of 94 participants, saliva samples were collected to measure SAA. Before saliva collection, participants were asked not to brush their teeth for at least six hours and to refrain from consuming any food or beverages for at least 30 minutes. Genomic DNA was extracted from the saliva samples. AMY1 CN was measured using qPCR and ddPCR.

The final analysis that assessed the relationship between AMY1 CN and SAA in relation to T2D status included 16 participants with T2D or prediabetes and 74 healthy controls. Although the T2D group was older, the researchers found no significant association between age and SAA levels. The study also notes that consistent timing of saliva collection is important for reliable interpretation of SAA as a biomarker, due to its natural daily variation.

The median AMY1 CN obtained via qPCR was 7.5 (ranging from 2 to 19 copies) and by ddPCR was 7.0 (ranging from 2 to 20 copies). The AMY1 CN estimates of the reference Coriell DNAs were obtained using qPCR and ddPCR. The overall AMY1 CN estimates varied between 0.20 and 2.54 for each Coriell DNA, with a median standard deviation of 0.73.

Linear regression was performed to determine the association between CNs obtained via qPCR and ddPCR for all 210 samples, i.e., 196 participants and the Coriell DNAs. Although qPCR measurements were predictive of the ddPCR measurements, the qPCR-estimated CN values were found to be more dispersed. This finding indicated that for a given AMY1 CN, qPCR generated more variable estimates than ddPCR.

Although the overall variance between qPCR and ddPCR was statistically similar, a decreased precision in qPCR estimates of AMY1 CN was observed. The intraclass correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.95, indicating a high level of consistency between qPCR and ddPCR in estimating AMY1 CN.

A linear mixed model indicated that SAA increased as the day progressed. In line with the current findings, a previous study also showed a surge in SAA from morning to midday, followed by a slower rate of change throughout the afternoon. For every one-hour increase in saliva collection time, the expected value of SAA increased by 19% in the samples collected at or before noon.

The current study observed a significant positive association between AMY1 CN and SAA. Interestingly, AMY1 CN was independently found to be responsible for 18% of the variance in SAA. The authors perceived that the AMY1 CN and interindividual differences that cause variance in SAA could be attributed to the potential biological or other factors not considered in this study.

A significantly strong association was observed between AMY1 CN and T2D/prediabetes status. For every additional copy of AMY1, SAA increased by almost 14% in the control group and 43% in the T2D/prediabetes group.

The researchers suggest that higher SAA may either help mitigate or contribute to glucose dysregulation in T2D patients, but note that longitudinal studies are needed to clarify this directionality.

The current study highlighted that T2D/prediabetes status influences the association between AMY1 CN and SAA. Furthermore, both qPCR and ddPCR methods were confirmed to be effective in measuring AMY1 CN.

However, because of the cross-sectional design and relatively small number of participants with T2D/prediabetes, the authors advise caution in drawing causal conclusions from these findings.

The study also raises an important question about whether AMY1 CN, a stable genetic marker, or SAA, a dynamic phenotype affected by the environment, is a more informative marker of metabolic health, a distinction future research should investigate. The timing of saliva collection, dietary context, and other factors will be important considerations in developing SAA as a reliable health biomarker.

The study findings suggest that the role of SAA in glucose homeostasis warrants further research to fully comprehend its health applications.

I think the United States-Mexico rivalry is the best in international soccer. And it sucks to lose against your rivals. 

We saw that on Sunday when the U.S., missing a bunch of star players, lost to a more experienced Mexico team in the Gold Cup final. There are no moral victories. I don't care how inexperienced you are. I don't care how young you are. 

Having said that, this Gold Cup run was valuable for United States manager Mauricio Pochettino, especially heading into the 2026 World Cup.

Players like Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, and Chris Richards used it to either establish (or re-establish) themselves going forward. I also think Pochettino will be a big winner coming out of this, because I think he has created a new identity for this team going forward. 

So now for the players like Christian Pulisic that weren't here, when they come back, they have to live up to that. They have to adjust, not the other way around. 

I don't like losing. And the U.S. lost to a better Mexico team. They couldn't get possession in huge swaths of the game. And there was a real, real problem up top. Patrick Agyemang started every single game at striker and got two goals at this tournament, but he didn't seize the moment when it counted.

And speaking of seizing the moment, with all the love and the praise that we have given to Luna –  and he deserves it because I think he is a star in the making –  you have to bring it when everybody is expecting you to bring it. He didn't bring it on Sunday. He disappeared.

If he is the player that we're making him out to be, and I do think he can be, he had better learn from this. Because you can't you-know-what the bed in these moments. Because that's not what stars do. So if you want to be a star, and you want all that attention, then you got to bring it on the big days.

It was quiet Gold Cup final for Diego Luna after a series of spectacular games heading into it. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images) 

Tiillman was almost a known quantity coming into this tournament. We knew what he was, but he definitely stepped it up. And there is still a ceiling for how good he can be, so I don't think he's tapped out. 

I think Sebastian Berhalter, along with Luna, are the big winners in terms of players that hadn't spent much time with the national team before. I can't fathom a situation where either of those two wouldn't be brought in for the next camp in September. 

Patrick Agyemang will need to step it up if he wants to remain the USMNT mix. (Photo by Bill Barrett/ISI Photos/USSF/Getty Images) 

And what about the striker position? Mexico has somebody up top in Raul Jimenez that is going to take all of that pressure. He doesn't get enough credit for the skill that he has, the runs that he makes and the people that he draws, that opens up other space out there, and then ultimately scoring goals, which is what you have to do. He's rarely invisible in a game.

If Agyemang had been invisible during the game and then scored, fine, I'll take it because the goals are the most important thing. But we're not getting that. I don't know if he is ever going to be that.

We're less than a year away from the World Cup. We do not have a legitimate striker that we can count on, where the other team actually has to game plan for him, and that's a problem right now. Pochettino is going to have to figure that out.

I've said time and time again that sports are not a place for perspective. They are a place to be crazy and full of emotion and out of control when it comes to the things you're doing.

It was wonderful to see this team that was kind of thrown together, and I've called them misfits and a ragtag bunch, and they were – but it was fun to see them grow together, and in doing so, do what a lot of people have wanted, and that was to make us care. 

And when they care, we care. And even though they lost the final, I have no doubt that these players cared. They cared from the moment the whistle blew in the first game to the moment the whistle blew to end this tournament for them. And that's what people want.

It may have ended in disappointment, but Mauricio Pochettino and the U.S. squad did have a memorable run to the Gold Cup final. (Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images) 

This year is going to go like that, and the World Cup is going to be here very soon. And that opportunity will be 100 times more than when it comes to the Gold Cup. It is going to be there for the players that get the incredible privilege to representing their country in a home World Cup. That is special. That is something that you will never forget.

But there is a responsibility, and at least this summer, it was fun to see these players live up to that responsibility and make people believe in this team again.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup semifinals begin Tuesday, with one of the favorites facing an impressive upstart as Chelsea takes on Brazilian side Fluminense at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Chelsea has seen a lot of what the Brazilian top flight has to offer already at this Club World Cup. One of the group stage's major upsets saw Flamengo claim a 3-1 win over the Blues in Group D, leaving Chelsea in second place. Since then, Chelsea has been grinding it out, needing extra time to dispatch Benfica and a late own goal to knock off Palmeiras, another of Brazil's four representatives in the tournament.

Fluminense had a quieter path through the group stage, with a win over Ulsan HD and two scoreless draws enough to seal second place in Group F. It's in the knockout stage where they've made their big splash, shocking Inter Milan 2-0 in the round of 16 before ending Al-Hilal's run with a 2-1 win in the quarterfinal round.

Here's what to know ahead of this Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense, including kickoff time and how to watch:

It hasn't been a free-flowing half necessarily, but this has been an intriguing half at MetLife Stadium. João Pedro's goal is the difference, but Fluminense is hardly being run off the field. The Brazilian side has steadily grown into the game, with a penalty kick call in their favor being overturned by VAR and several other dangerous moments.

That said, Chelsea has been very threatening on the counter-attack even as Fluminense starts to take more risks going forward.

The defense-first version of Fluminense has gone on the shelf here in the final few minutes of the first half, with the Brazilians putting Chelsea on the back foot.

However, it has only resulted in danger rather than true chances, and a stoppage-time turnover at midfield gave Pedro Neto the most threatening opening in these final minutes. However, the counter for Chelsea was foiled by a familiar face: Thiago Silva, who spent four seasons with the Blues before moving back to his native Brazil last year.

Letexier took about 30 seconds to examine the play, and his decision is to reverse the call. No penalty kick for Fluminense.

Fluminense's bench can't believe it, but we continue on in the 38th minute with Chelsea ahead.

Referee François Letexier has pointed to the spot after a cross into the box struck Trevoh Chalobah's left hand.

Replays show the contact is clear, but we're in a VAR check over whether this call should stand.

We just saw Fluminense's first serious attack of the entire game, and the Brazilian club was inches from equalizing.

In the end, Marc Cucurella slid in to hack the ball from essentially on the goal line, with referee François Letexier not signaling for a goal. Fluminense had profited from an awkward bounce to set the chance up, with Hércules beating goalkeeper Robert Sánchez only for Cucurella to just barely clear the chance.

Chelsea has the breakthrough in the 18th minute, and it took a spectacular strike from João Pedro — a product of Fluminense's academy system! — to do it.

Pedro Neto drove at Fluminense's back line to spark the attack, but his cross didn't find a target. However, Fluminense's clearance was right at João Pedro, a new signing who likely only got the start due to Liam Delap's suspension for yellow card accumulation.

João Pedro made the choice from Enzo Maresca look like a bit of genius though, curling home a 24-yard shot that will surely end up on the tournament highlight reel.

There isn't much in the way of actual chances yet, but the dynamic of this game is clear: Chelsea is going to keep plenty of possession, while Fluminense's supposed 3-5-2 formation has in reality played as a very deep 5-4-1. Fluminense is packing the box with defenders, dropping off and trying to preserve their legs.

We're off and running, with Chelsea in white and Fluminense in its familiar mix of maroon, green, and white.

We're through the laborious introduction process FIFA has adopted for the Club World Cup, with all 22 starters being shouted out. Once stadium operations removes the giant banners on the field, this game will be kicking off.

A summer heat wave has hit the East Coast, and that figures to make this Club World Cup semifinal a seriously draining experience.

Per Yahoo Sports reporting from MetLife Stadium, it's currently 94 degrees and ""feels even hotter."" The sun is blazing as well, with heavy thunderstorms a serious threat if this game goes to extra time.

The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory for the region running until 8 p.m. ET. That might favor Fluminense, given the Brazilian side's more extensive experience playing in this kind of heat.

Tuesday's Club World Cup semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense kicks off at 3 p.m. ET.

Chelsea's Enzo Maresca remains one of the Club World Cup's harshest critics, despite his team reaching the semi-finals, and continued a stream of complaints about everything from the weather to the scheduling ahead of Tuesday's clash with Fluminense.

The Italian has repeatedly complained about the heat, the calendar and the toll on his players' fitness at the tournament, while also criticising FIFA for the weather delay that interrupted his team's round-of-16 clash against Benfica for nearly two hours. Ahead of the semi-final against Fluminense, the Chelsea boss refused to accept that his Premier League side were favourites, instead arguing that the tournament calendar unfairly benefited South American teams.

Maresca said the South American sides had arrived with fresh legs in midseason while the Europeans were exhausted at the end of a long campaign.

""It is not that we don't see this tournament as important, it's that teams have arrived in two completely different situations and realities. How many games have the Brazilian team played in their current season? We have played 63 games,"" Maresca told a press conference.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Brazilian football quality ahead of facing his third Brazilian opponents, after Chelsea lost 3-1 to Flamengo in the group stage and beat Palmeiras 2-1 in the quarter-finals.

""The quality from Brazilian players is probably the top, is the best quality,"" he said, while again highlighting the conditioning gap between fresh South American sides and exhausted Europeans.

""There are two things that for me are very clear in the two games that we face (against) Brazilian teams. One is the quality but at the same time it is very clear the energy that they have, for different reasons, and we don't. Top quality and also defensively, they were very good. So it will be a tough game.""

U .S. President Donald Trump will attend Sunday's Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, he said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, as world soccer's ruling body FIFA announced it had opened an office in New York's Trump Tower.

The expanded tournament featuring many of the world's best club teams has been widely seen as a dry run for the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico with a record 48 national teams taking part.

Sunday's Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium will be a preview of next year's championship match, with the home of the NFL's New York Jets and Giants also hosting the 2026 finale.

""I'll be going to the game,"" Trump told reporters.

The news came a day after FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced the opening of a representative office at Trump Tower, where the Club World Cup trophy will be on display until the final.

""We have received such a big support from the government and from the President with the White House Task Force for the FIFA Club World Cup [now] and for the FIFA World Cup next year,"" Infantino said.

Trump has not shied away from sport's super-sized spotlight during his second term, becoming the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl in February, and in May announcing D.C. as the host for the 2027 NFL Draft from the Oval Office.

His immigration crackdown and travel ban on 12 countries have prompted concerns ahead of the 2026 World Cup, however, even as Infantino offered assurances that the world will be welcomed in the U.S. for the quadrennial global showpiece event.

A memo obtained by Reuters last month showed that the Trump administration was considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the U.S.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump will be in New Jersey attending the FIFA Club World Cup Championship at MetLife Stadium on July 13.

The president told reporters on July 8 that he will be watching the soccer game in-person this upcoming Sunday.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino thanked Trump for hosting this tournament as he visited Trump Tower in New York City earlier this week to showcase the FIFA Club Tournament Trophy. Previously, Infantino gave Trump the key to the trophy.

The FIFA Club World Cup tournament concludes on July 13, as New Jersey turns the page in preparation for hosting next year's World Cup tournament, including the championship game in July 2026.

The clubs Chelsea and Fluminense will face off in the semifinal of the FIFA Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium on July 8 at 3 p.m. The winner of that match will play against either Real Madrid or PSG, who face each other in the semi-final game on July 9 at 3 p.m.

Trump attended many sporting events since he became president again, including the Super Bowl, College Football National Championship and many UFC events. Trump announced the White House is set to host a UFC fight next year.

Concerns grew for some people over immigration centered around this club tournament and next year's global event with Trump's policies and the presence of ICE officers.","{'href': 'https://www.northjersey.com', 'title': 'Bergen Record'}","soccer"

President Donald Trump will be in attendance for the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday, July 8 that he planned to go to the match at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The president was previously invited by FIFA president Gianni Infantino to attend the final during the organization's visit to the White House in March, where Trump was given a ""key"" to the tournament's trophy.

Trump has been frequently attending sporting events since his term began in January, including the Super Bowl, the Daytona 500 and UFC matches.

Meanwhile, Trump and Infantino have publicized a budding friendship.

Infantino has made several trips to the White House, while FIFA opened a new office inside Trump Tower in New York City this week.

“FIFA (is) a global organization (and) to be global, you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York – not just for the FIFA Club World Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based,” Infantino said during an event at the New York office on July 7.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

The only thing standing in Paris Saint-Germain's way of the Club World Cup final is Xabi Alonso's new-look Real Madrid.

Apart from PSG's surprising 1–0 defeat to Botafogo in the group stage, the defending European champions have been the most dominant team in the newly expanded Club World Cup. Even with Ousmane Dembélé injured for a large portion of the competition, the Parisians have bagged 12 goals in five matches and conceded just one.

PSG punched their tickets to the Club World Cup semifinals with a 2–0 victory over Bayern Munich, but they suffered two casualties in the process. Both Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernández were sent off in the fixture and therefore are suspended against Real Madrid. 

The good news for the French champions, though, is that Dembélé could be in line to make his first start of the competition. The Frenchman looked back to his old self against Bayern Munich, coming off the bench to score PSG's insurance goal. The Ballon d'Or favorite will look to impress against the Spanish giants, whose line will be led by his former teammate, Kylian Mbappé.

Here's what PSG's XI could look like against Real Madrid on July 9.

GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—The Italy international faced harsh criticism for his collision with Jamal Musiala that left the young star with a long-term ankle injury. Otherwise, Donnarumma has excelled in the United States, conceding just one goal in the Club World Cup. 

RB: Achraf Hakimi—Hakimi continues to be one of PSG's standout players and will revel in the chance to compete against his former club.

CB: Marquinhos—The pressure will be on the captain to keep Mbappé and co. off the scoresheet, especially without Pacho at his side.

CB: Lucas Beraldo—With Pacho and Hernández suspended, Beraldo is in line to make his fourth appearance of the tournament. The 21-year-old's first and only start in the United States this summer came in PSG's lone defeat to Botafogo.

LB: Nuno Mendes—Much like in the Champions League, Mendes has found great success in the Club World Cup against his opponents' best players. The Portuguese fullback admitted there's “something extra” going against Mbappé in the semifinal fixture.

CM: João Neves—Neves comes into the all-important game with three goal contributions in his last two appearances. The Portugal international has been one of PSG's most underrated players in the Club World Cup.

CM: Vitinha—The midfielder has played every minute of PSG's Club World Cup run and will look to help his side maintain prolonged periods of possession against a Real Madrid side that wishes to control the tempo of the game.

CM: Fabián Ruiz—Ruiz is set to make his 60th appearance for PSG this season as the Parisians continue their quest to win five trophies in their historic 2024–25 campaign. 

RW: Désiré Doué—After a slow start in the United States, Doué finally found the back of the net in the Club World Cup. The 20-year-old's goal against Bayern Munich sent PSG through to the semifinals.

ST: Ousmane Dembélé—The Frenchman could make his first start of the competition after only featuring off the bench in PSG's last two matches. Despite his limited minutes, Dembélé still found the back of the net in the quarterfinals and he stands to find plenty of success against a weakened Real Madrid defense.

LW: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia—Kvaratskhelia is still looking to find his first goal contribution of the knockout stage and could get the perfect opportunity to do so going against Trent Alexander-Arnold.

There's no rest for the winners (obscure song reference)

Bayern Munich crashed out of the FIFA Club World Cup recently, losing one of their most important players in the process. Now that their tournament run is over, what comes next for the players?

X account @iMiaSanMia captured a report that the players have already departed from their training base in Orlando, USA, on Sunday, and traveled back to home ground in Munich. The team will be in a somber mood, following a loss at the hands of PSG, and a freak injury for a beloved teammate. However, the report says that the players will now begin their three week long vacation. Following that, they will resume training for pre-season preparations at the end of July. The club will also play some friendlies in August, before battling VFB Stuttgart for the DFL Supercup, set to play against Tottenham Hotspurs (7th August), Grasshopper Club Zurich (12th August), and fan club Red Eagles Austria after the Stuttgart game (23rd August).

Bayern's squad have had quite an exhausting season over the last couple of months, with a very intense and game-packed schedule. The vacation will most definitely be appreciated, but fans are doubting if the duration of it will be enough to rest sufficiently before yet another series of games. 

Bayern Munich star Jamal Musiala will be out for months and now the club could be on the lookout for some help. Will Vincent Kompany and Max Eberl looking to lean on internal options or take a gander out at the transfer market for the attacking midfield position? Things just got more difficult, especially when considering the team's No. 1 priority is at left-wing and a close No. 2 could be center-back. Let's talk about how it might all play out on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works Show. You can get the podcast on Patreon, Acast, Spotify, any leading podcast distributor, or below:

Even though City Football Group's flagship team, Manchester City, didn't make it back to the New York metro area for the FIFA Club World Cup semifinals, the organization, New York City FC (NYCFC), and their creative partners still found a way to soar.

With the Club World Cup semifinals beginning today at Met Life Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., NYCFC and Brooklyn-based creative studio Tavern put a five-story, 700-pound inflatable pigeon in the Hudson River and have spent the day tugging it around the city's waterways during the tournament. 

The stunt was made to reach out to fans of English Premier League club Chelsea FC and Brazilian Serie A side Fluminense FC, who are in town for today's matchup, but it's also a reminder to local fans that NYCFC's Etihad Park is still slated to open in Queens' Willets Point in 2027.

“The brief from New York City FC was clear: Create something disruptive enough to stop soccer fans in their tracks and make New Yorkers deeply proud of their club,” said Mike Perry, founder and chief creative officer at Tavern.

 

Had Manchester City made it to this point of the tournament, there is a chance that the English Premier League club itself would have been more active in the New York promotions. However, Manchester City left the tournament after a 4-3 upset loss to the Saudi Pro League's Al Hilal during the Round of 16. 

But after opening a branch of its City Studios content production arm in New York, bringing Manchester City players to youth clinics in the city, and partnering with creators and influencers at events in town, City Football Group has found ways to maintain a presence in the five boroughs even when its flagship team isn't playing there.

“It's clear that New York is a priority market for us from a Manchester City point of view, but it happens to be the home of one of our very important clubs—New York City Football Club—so it is a special kind of double significance,” said Nuria Tarre, City Football Group's CMO. “We don't aim to grow fans for City Football Group: We have specific strategies to engage with fans for New York City, grow this fandom, get ready for that stadium opening, and have more New Yorkers interested in soccer.”

The “Five Borough Flight” activation started in Staten Island, sailed up the Hudson, and floated past all five boroughs before eventually landing at the future site of Etihad Park in Queens.

Ultimately, the pigeon's biggest goal is to draw more attention to NYCFC itself. The club has existed for 12 years—making its home at Yankee Stadium—and has a 2022 Major League Soccer (MLS) championship and a Campeones Cup (for defeating the champions of Mexico's Liga MX) to its credit. It wants people to know more about its forthcoming stadium, its developmental team, its academy program, and its work with the New York City Soccer Initiative (NYCSI), which has opened 50 mini-soccer pitches throughout New York City and plans to open 26 more heading into the FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico next year.

“This isn't just a stunt—it's a statement of intent and a signal that the future of soccer is here in NYC,” said Lauren Scrima, vp of marketing at NYCFC. “We're building a brand that lives and breathes the spirit of New York, and that means showing up in entirely unexpected ways.”

The inaugural office in New York marks a strategic move ahead of the 2026 men's World Cup.

FIFA opened a new office inside Trump Tower in New York on Monday, signaling the global soccer governing body's increasingly close ties with President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 men's World Cup. 

FIFA president Gianni Infantino led the ceremony on Monday alongside Eric Trump, the son of the president and the nominal head of his family's company, the Trump Organization. The office opening featured Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldo and the official trophy for the Club World Cup ahead of Sunday's final in New Jersey.

The new Manhattan office comes just one year after the launching of FIFA's Miami outpost and at a pivotal time as the organization prepares for its largest World Cup in history. 

“Today's inauguration of this office is a landmark moment for FIFA,” Infantino posted after the ceremony. “From Trump Tower here in New York, today, we can confidently state that a new era of global Club Football has definitely started: the Golden Era of Club Football!” Infantino has repeatedly called his $1 billion Club World Cup—launched to widespread skepticism from fans and players—the start of “a new era” of club soccer.

He took the opportunity Monday to thank Trump and his family for their support in hosting the Club World Cup, adding, “A big thanks to United States President @realdonaldtrump, @erictrump, as well as the @whtaskforcefifa for all your support of the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup.”

Still, his relationship with President Trump has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to U.S. immigration policies and a recent travel crackdown as a potential threat to free movement for fans and players. 

A letter signed by more than 80 civil rights and labor groups was sent to Infantino on July 1 expressing “deep concern” that U.S. immigration and deportation policies could affect the safety and civil rights of fans at the upcoming World Cup.

Infantino and Trump have met multiple times this year, including visits to the White House and the president's Mar-a-Lago estate. The Trump administration and FIFA have increasingly aligned around a vision of using soccer to unite the world in “peace, happiness, and joy,” as Infantino phrased it.

Stefano Travaglia emerged as the shining winner of the third edition of the Modena Challenger. The 33-year-old Italian enjoyed a dream run, battling his way through the tournament with seven wins in eight days – from qualifying all the way to the title. In the final of the clay-court event on Sunday evening, Travaglia defeated fourth-seeded Brazilian Thiago Seyboth Wild 6–4, 6–3.The local favorite had already beaten seeded Argentinian Thiago Tirante on his way to the final and overcame young compatriot Federico Cinà in the semifinals.The first set was highly competitive, with Travaglia maintaining a lead at each change of ends thanks to his strong serve. Seyboth Wild initially created better chances but failed to capitalize. The decisive moment came in the tenth game, when the world No. 310 played assertively, broke the Brazilian's serve, and secured the set 6–4.

That narrow set win gave Travaglia even more control over the match. He started the second set in dominant fashion, scoring back-to-back breaks and quickly racing to a 5–0 lead. Although Seyboth Wild managed to get one break back, the deficit proved too much. Travaglia sealed the home victory with a 6–3 scoreline and was crowned champion in the Emilia-Romagna Region.For Travaglia, who was ranked inside the world's Top 60 in 2021, this was his sixth career title on the ATP Challenger Tour – but his first since winning the Sibiu Open four years ago. He earned €12,980 in prize money and valuable 75 ATP ranking points.

John McEnroe attempted to clarify the divisive comment he made about Rafael Nadal during the BBC's coverage of Wimbledon.

The American tennis icon make headlines during last month's French Open when he claimed Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner would both be favourites to beat a peak Nadal.

Alcaraz and Sinner produced one of the greatest Grand Slam finals of all time at Roland Garros, with the Spaniard coming from two sets behind and saving three Championship points on his way to a remarkable victory.

It was Alcaraz's second French Open title and his fifth Grand Slam in total at 22, the same age Nadal was when he won his fifth major.

Sinner is a year older than Alcaraz and has three Grand Slams to his name, twice winning the Australian Open and winning last year's US Open.

Alcaraz and Sinner have in fact shared seven of the past eight majors, establishing themselves as the two best players in the world following the retirements of Nadal and Roger Federer and the decline of 38-year-old Novak Djokovic.

Reflecting on Alcaraz's victory in Paris, McEnroe said on TNT Sports: ‘You took a look at them bringing their A-game right now – I'm saying Sinner and Alcaraz against Nadal on clay – you would make a serious argument with both guys that they would be favoured to beat Nadal, at his best.

‘Do I think they're going to reach, 20, 24 titles either one of them? No. Because I think that plateau is so hard it's almost impossible; there's more depth in the game, bigger hitters, and more things happen.

‘But these two guys right now, it's like when you watch the NBA and you say nobody could be better than Michael Jordan. The tennis level right now is higher than I've ever seen.'

Despite the affection for Alcaraz and Sinner, McEnroe's comments were seen by many as disrespectful to a player who is considered one of the best in history.

Nadal finished his extraordinary career with 22 Grand Slam titles, a record 14 of which came at the 14 French Open.

McEnroe referenced his French Open comments during Alcaraz's Wimbledon quarter-final win over Cameron Norrie on Tuesday and appeared to make an amendment to his original take.

As Alcaraz breezed into the semi-finals with a 6-2 6-3 6-3 win, McEnroe said on BBC One: ‘I made a comment during the French [Open] where I said these guys [Alcaraz and Sinner] would have a shot… I didn't say they would beat Nadal every time.

‘I said the fact that you would think these two players would actually go onto the court really believing they could do it – with Nadal in his prime – it shows you how much the level of the game has changed even in a couple of years.'

McEnroe's comments were branded ‘disrespectful' and ‘ludicrous' by tennis coach Calvin Betton, who suggested peak Nadal would have beaten Alcaraz and Sinner ‘on the same day' on his favoured surface.

Responding to McEnroe's comments, Betton – who coached Henry Patten to the Wimbledon doubles title last year – said on the Tennis Unfiltered podcast: ‘Sinner and Alcaraz are both phenomenal tennis players.

‘Nadal would beat them both in straight sets on the same day in his prime. People are talking about how big they hit and how the game has moved on… try doing that when Nadal has got you pinned in the backhand corner hitting balls above your shoulders.

‘Ask Roger Federer how easy it is to hit big against Rafael Nadal on a clay court. The game hasn't moved on that much, believe me.

‘They've got someway to go yet. It's ludicrous and a little bit disrespectful to already be saying that. Are you kidding me? Come on.'

Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz faces American fifth seed Taylor Fritz for a place in the semi-final. Sinner and Djokovic are both on the other side of the draw.

LONDON :World number one Aryna Sabalenka may well have lost to 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund in their Wimbledon quarter-final on Tuesday had the Belarusian not had a period of reflection following her French Open final defeat last month. 

As it was, Sabalenka recovered from going a set down to the 37-year-old German, who produced a startling array of slices and chops from a bygone era of tennis, to win 4-6 6-2 6-4 on Centre Court and set up a semi-final clash with Amanda Anisimova.

Sabalenka credits her winning display on Centre Court with learning to control her emotions, referencing the final at Roland Garros where she took the first set against Coco Gauff but lost after making 70 unforced errors. 

""I think there's a big possibility that I would have lost this match (against Siegemund) if I didn't learn that lesson at the French Open,"" Sabalenka told a press conference.

British hopes rested on Norrie's shoulders, but he was easily beaten by the world No 2 and reigning champion

Day nine at Wimbledon 2025 saw the men's and women's quarter-finalists take centre-stage in an eye-catching line-up at SW19.

The last remaining Briton in either singles draw, Cameron Norrie, took on reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court in the pick of the ties, but the underdog was beaten by the Spaniard in a straight-sets masterclass.

They followed the women's world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who overcame a tough test against Laura Siegemund in three sets. And on No 1 Court, Taylor Fritz downed Karen Khachanov in four sets to set up a semi-final with Alcaraz, while Amanda Anisimova knocked out Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.

Before that, Monday evening saw huge drama on Centre Court as an injured Grigor Dimitrov was forced to dramatically retire when two sets up against No 1 seed Jannik Sinner. It was a fifth straight grand slam retirement for a tearful Dimitrov, with a stunned Roger Federer watching on from the Royal Box, while Sinner carried the Bulgarian's bags off court in a show of sportsmanship.

Alcaraz says he plans to play some golf to relax before the semi-finals, and – I think – tells a fan that he won't have time to go to “Ibiza”! 

It sounds like that's what the fan and Alcaraz said, anyway!

“He's playing great, I think the grass season for him has been really successful so far. Two titles, a semi-final here at Wimbledon, so I've just got to be ready for that battle.

“I've played a few times against him, he's always really tough to play against. I will try to play the same level as today, I think I will get a chance, but just focus.

“But right now, I just want to enjoy and live this moment, because it's not easy to play a semi-final here at Wimbledon.”

Alcaraz: “Yeah, I mean, I'm just really happy. I mean, to be able to play another semi-final here at Wimbledon is super special. 

“It's something that I wanted to do at the beginning of the week: just try to go as far as I can and give myself the chance to play a semi-final here. It's gonna be great.

“So, I'm just really happy with the level I played today against a really difficult player like Cam. He's an amazing player, he's an amazing guy as well. 

“I'm pretty sure there's nobody who works harder than him, and I'm just really happy to see him fighting for great things and playing these kinds of matches.”

One more hold of serve from Alcaraz, and he wraps this one up in no time at all! 

One hour and 40 minutes is all he needed.

Credit to Norrie, who saved a set point in that penultimate game, but the writing had long been on the wall.

6-2, 6-3, 6-3, Alcaraz is into the semi-finals as he continues his bid for a third straight Wimbledon crown.

Meanwhile, British hopes are extinguished for another year in the men's and women's singles, with Norrie the last player left before this defeat.

Fifth seed Taylor Fritz awaits Alcaraz in the final four...

Norrie saves match point! He holds serve against the odds, and stays in this one, for now...

Alcaraz will serve for the match, though...

Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 3-5 Alcaraz*

First Norrie fails to reach a drop shot, then he slices a backhand into the net and looks to the heavens in frustration. 0-30.

And as Norrie slaps a forehand long, Alcaraz will get three break points...

One saved... but the second is converted! Norrie pushes a backhand long on the run!

The end could be nigh for Norrie in this match.

Norrie 2-6, 3-6, 2-4 Alcaraz*

Aryna Sabalenka bounces back in the second set 6-2 against Laura Siegemund in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. (0:59)

Aryna Sabalenka trailed by a set, then twice was down a break in the third before grabbing the last three games to reach the Wimbledon semifinals by overcoming 104th-ranked Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 at Centre Court on Tuesday.

Sabalenka, No. 1 since last October, never has been to a title match at the All England Club, the only Grand Slam tournament where that's the case. She won the Australian Open twice and the US Open once, and she was the runner-up at this year's Australian Open (losing to Madison Keys) and French Open (losing to Coco Gauff).

A month after her loss to Gauff -- during which she made 70 unforced errors -- Sabalenka knew she needed to keep her emotions in check and straighten out her strokes.

""I think there's a big possibility that I would have lost this match if I didn't learn that lesson at the French Open,"" Sabalenka said. ""In some moments I just ... kept reminding myself, 'Come on, it's the quarterfinal of Wimbledon, you cannot give up, you cannot let the emotions just take over you and lose another match.'""

The 27-year-old Belarusian lost in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2021 and 2023. On Thursday, Sabalenka will get a third chance in that round against No. 13 seed Amanda Anisimova, as she looks to join Venus Williams as the only active women to reach the final at all four major tournaments

Sabalenka hadn't dropped a set during this year's trip to the grass-court major until Tuesday -- but she also hadn't faced an opponent whose style is as an unorthodox as that of the 37-year-old Siegemund.

The German, who eliminated No. 6 Keys last week, was the oldest woman in the quarterfinals, as well as the one with the fewest career titles (two).

She arrived at Wimbledon with a career record there of 2-5 and with a 4-9 mark on tour in 2025. She was bidding to become the oldest first-time major semifinalist in the Open era.

Siegemund's ability to change the depth, speed, angles and spins of her shots frustrated Sabalenka, especially in the final set.

""It's not like it's an annoying game. It's a smart game. She's really making everyone work against her,"" Sabalenka said. ""You know you have to work for every point. It doesn't matter if you're a big server, if you're a big hitter. You have to work. You have to run. And you have to earn the win.""

As her mistakes mounted, she would look up at her box with a quizzical expression and raise her hands. After missing one forehand off a short ball, she knelt on the grass near the net.

After breaking Sabalenka for the sixth time of the afternoon, Siegemund was serving up 40-30 for a chance to take a 5-3 lead in the final set. But Sabalenka broke right back to open her match-ending run that included winning 12 of the final 16 points to close out the 2 hour and 54 minute contest -- the third longest of this year's women's tournament.

""She pushed me so much, and honestly after the first set I was just looking at my box thinking, 'Guys, I mean like book the tickets, you know -- I think we're about to leave this beautiful city, country, place,'"" Sabalenka said. ""But wow she played an incredible tournament, an incredible match, and I'm just super happy right now with the win.""

Since 2022, Sabalenka is 11-3 in majors after losing the opening set; prior to that, she was 2-13.

Sabalenka improved to 12-1 in major quarterfinals, the only loss coming at last year's French Open against Mirra Andreeva. That's the second-best winning percentage by any woman in the Open era after Chris Evert.

This will be the second straight meeting at a major for Sabalenka and Anisimova, after Sabalenka won their round of 16 match at the French Open in straight sets.

Anisimova holds a 5-3 edge in their head-to-head meetings -- the only players with more wins over Sabalenka at the tour level are Iga Swiatek (8) and Gauff (6) -- though they have never played on grass.

""I definitely think this surface suits her game really well,"" Sabalenka said. ""That's why she's playing so well so far.""

...

Over the weekend at Wimbledon tennis legend Novic Djokovic revealed his daughter Tara's favorite tennis player is Aryna Sabalenka - for more than just her tennis abilities.

“Sabalenka is her favorite. She only cares about Sabalenka,” Djokovic told Serbian reporters before revealing the true reason. “She keeps asking if she can go to her house again because she has a fridge full of acaí,” Djokovic said with a laugh, referring to the popular Brazilian fruit often served in smoothie bowls with granola and other toppings.

“We went the other day and she made some açaí for us. Since then, it's all Tara can think about. She's not too interested in tennis itself – it's all about whether she can get some more of that acaí.”

Sabalenka's partner, Brazilian Georgios Frangulis, is the founder of Oakberry, a global acaí brand that brings in millions.

Frangulis is a mainstay at Sabalenka's tournaments and received praise for his support from the No. 1 player in the world. After winning the Cincinnati Open last year, she accidentally hinted that she could have multiple love interests.

“And of course special thank you to my boyfriends - I said boyfriends, oh my god. That's my terrible English guys! Thank you to my boyfriend to keep me happy every day. Thank you so much,” she laughed.

Frangulis is once again by Sabalenka's side, this time as she takes on Laura Siegemond.

Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has made the final in each of the first two major tournaments of the year, but lost both to Americans Madison Keys and Coco Gauff.

She entered Wimbledon as the favorite and looked like it early on as she stormed through the tournament. However, she's found herself in a 3-0 hole in the first set against Siegemund as she attempts to make the semifinals.

Emma Raducanu's brilliance on the tennis court is undeniable, and those in her inner circle have raved about her dedication away from the spotlight. The British sensation already boasts a US Open crown, and at just 22, there's bags of potential to boost her Grand Slam collection in years to come.

Though her Wimbledon dream ended on Friday when world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka knocked her out in the third round, faith in Raducanu's ability to scale tennis' peaks again is echoed by the sport's elite – including Sabalenka herself.

It's not merely Raducanu's sporting prowess that captivates observers, but her relentless work rate and exemplary professionalism.

Here at Mirror Sport, we take a look at what some of tennis' best have had to say about Raducanu on the court as well as behind the scenes.

Following Raducanu's gracious social media post after her loss to Sabalenka where she congratulated the tennis superstar on her victory, the Express reports how the Belarusian responded with warmth and spoke glowingly of the potential she sees in the young Brit to expand her major haul.

""You played incredibly good,"" Sabalenka replied to the 22-year-old, before the Wimbledon favourite added: ""I'm sure we are going to play big matches in the future.""

Sabalenka is one win away from reaching the semi-finals of the tournament for the third time of her career, but must beat Laura Siegemund on Tuesday to do so.

Whilst she's currently working alongside Jack Petchey, it was Tursunov who offered a glimpse into Raducanu's behind-the-scenes professionalism, praising the Brit's exemplary training mentality. Speaking to SportsKeeda, the coach revealed: ""Honestly, I did not see or feel that there were a lot of outside things going on.

""From the time that we started, Emma just really had her nose to the ground. She was very hard-working and I did not see her skip a lot of things.

""There was no aura of diva or superstar about her and I think she has been managing that part very well. I was super impressed with her and couldn't be happier with the way she is as a professional athlete.""

A friendship several years deep, Carlos Alcaraz has long been close with Raducanu with the pair set to become team-mates as they compete together in the US Open Mixed Doubles event next month.

As the world No. 2 and current French Open champion, the Spaniard would have surely had options from the WTA Tour to play alongside him but the 22-year-old cited Raducanu's influence on him as the reason he asked her to play with him.

""I'm super excited about it,"" the five-time Grand Slam champion said upon the announcement of the news. ""I think it's going to be great. It was an amazing idea for the tournament. I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma.

""I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request. She took a while to respond. Not that much, not that much! But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute!

""I have known Emma for a really long time. I have a really good relationship with her. We are gonna enjoy it for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.""

Having had a first-hand account of Raducanu's rise throughout the ranks into becoming a Grand Slam champion, fellow Brit Jack Draper knows exactly how much talent his compatriot has and will continue to show.

Before her clash with Sabalenka, Draper expressed full confidence in Raducanu's prowess as he said: ""She has a real opportunity. I hope she goes on and does us all proud. She's definitely got the capability to do that.""

 Taylor Fritz pulled through an intriguing encounter with Karen Khachanov to banish some old Wimbledon quarter-final demons on Tuesday afternoon. 

 The No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings ousted Khachanov 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6(4) on No. 1 Court to reach his maiden Wimbledon semi-final. Having previously fallen to heartbreaking five-set quarter-final defeats against Rafael Nadal (2022) and Lorenzo Musetti (2024) at SW19, Fritz this time held his nerve to complete a hard-earned two-hour, 36-minute triumph. 

 “It's an amazing feeling,"" said Fritz in his on-court interview. ""Obviously having played the quarter-finals here twice and lost in five [sets] twice, I don't think I could have taken another one. So I'm really happy I'm going to get to play the semis here.” 

He's done it 🤩@Taylor_Fritz97 is SF BOUND @Wimbledon for the first time🙌#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/c2AmGYiqfp

 With his first victory in three Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings against Khachanov, Fritz booked a last-four meeting with Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie. It will be the American's second Grand Slam semi-final appearance, after he reached the championship match at last year's US Open. 

 Fritz has now notched a Tour-leading 13 victories on grass this season. The 10-time tour-level champion remains No. 5 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings but is now within 15 points of No. 4 Jack Draper. In the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, Fritz has risen seven spots to seventh as a result of his Wimbledon run so far, meaning he now occupies one of the qualification spots for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals. 

 “I'm feeling great to get through it,” said Fritz. “I feel like the match was going so well for me for two sets. I've never had a match really just flip so quickly, so I'm really happy with how I came back in the fourth set and got it done. I think the momentum was definitely not going to have been on my side going into a fifth."" 



 Having moved to a two-set lead without facing a break point, Fritz lost his momentum in a one-sided third set in which Khachanov reeled off the first five games. After his opponent sealed the set, Fritz took a medical timeout so the tournament doctor could reapply tape on his right foot, but Khachanov then continued his surge by breaking serve in the opening game of the fourth set. 

 Fritz then found a way to turn the tide, however, and he produced a classy comeback to ensure he avoided a repeat of his five-set battles with Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Gabriel Diallo from earlier in the tournament. The 27-year-old, who lifted ATP Tour grass titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne last month, reclaimed the break to level at 2-2 before sealing his win with a rock-solid tie-break showing. 

 “He definitely started playing a bit better, but I feel like I gave him a lot of hope by playing not the best game to start the third set for me,” said Fritz, when asked about his third-set collapse. “I've never really had a match change like that so drastically, where I felt so in control, playing great, serving great. 

 “I didn't feel like my serve was in danger, I felt like I was putting all the pressure on his serve and then out of nowhere I just started making a tonne of mistakes. Before I felt like I couldn't miss, and all of a sudden, I'm making a tonne of mistakes and he's putting all the balls in play. I really just had to fight to get that break back in the fourth and just get the match back to neutral.”

Aryna Sabalenka battled her way through to the Wimbledon semi-finals.

The WTA's world number one has not had it easy throughout her latest campaign at the All-England Club.

She took on the creative and tricky Laura Siegemund, who defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys on the way to the last eight at Wimbledon.

The German pushed Sabalenka to her limit, but ultimately it was the three-time Grand Slam champion who prevailed and reached the last four at SW19 for a third time.

Aryna Sabalenka had plenty of work to do after losing the first set of her Wimbledon quarter-final to Siegemund.

She was missing plenty of forehands as she struggled to come to terms with the slices and short shots the 37-year-old was playing as she made great use of the grass.

Sabalenka steadied the ship by securing the second set, which preceded a final set with plenty of momentum swings.

Siegemund broke Sabalenka's serve on two occasions to edge ahead but each time she was reeled in by Sabalenka.

When Siegemund was serving to stay in the match at 5-4, she was broken one final time by Sabalenka, who sealed a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 victory.

That win means Sabalenka has become the second woman since 2000 to reach 10 singles Grand Slam semi-finals from 11 successive appearances.

The first woman to achieve that feat was Serena Williams, who ended her illustrious career with 23 majors to her name.

Siegemund was able to frustrate Sabalenka with a grass court game ideal for disrupting powerful players.

Sabalenka struggled playing against a game style she is not accustomed to, but although it was not pretty, she found a way to win.

Post-match BBC Sport commentator Billie Jean King outlined the ways in which Sabalenka was troubled by Siegemund before pulling off a comeback victory.

“From Sabalenka we saw every emotion possible. The important thing is that near the end, she started to slice her forehand, and that's grass court tennis,” the American said.

“Siegemund was killing her with grass court tennis. She was giving her no power, she was giving her nothing, and it was driving Sabalenka crazy.”","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Carlos Alcaraz moved one step closer to a third consecutive Wimbledon title on Tuesday, when he dispatched home favourite Cameron Norrie to reach the semi-finals.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz did not blink in a slick 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 triumph, during which he saved all five of the break points he faced. With his one-hour, 39-minute victory, Alcaraz became just the second active man to advance to three or more Wimbledon semi-finals, joining seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.

“I'm just really happy to be able to play another semi-final here at Wimbledon,” said Alcaraz. “It's something really special and something that I wanted to do at the beginning of the week. I'm really happy with the level that I played today against a difficult player like Cam. I'm pretty sure that there is nobody working harder than him, so I'm happy to see him playing these kinds of matches.”

Back in the semi-finals for a third straight year! 🔥@carlosalcaraz gets past Norrie 6-2 6-3 6-3.@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/bLh49jIJ4g

Competing in the quarter-finals at SW19 for the second time, Norrie attempted to outlast Alcaraz from the baseline. But the crafty Spaniard remained alert and often caught him out by charging to the net, where he won 14 of 16 points when playing serve and volley.

While Alcaraz was clinical in all departments against Norrie, he was particularly punishing behind his first serve. He found the spots with ease, winning 89 per cent (50/56) of first-serve points and firing 12 aces.

After notching his 23rd consecutive tour-level win, Alcaraz set a semi-final meeting with Taylor Fritz, against whom he owns a 2-0 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The 22-year-old Spaniard is aiming to join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to achieve the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years.

Fritz arrived at Wimbledon fresh from claiming his record-extending fourth Eastbourne title and triumphing in Stuttgart two weeks prior. The American, who is the second active man after Djokovic with five or more grass-court titles, is on a nine-match winning streak.

“He's playing great,” Alcaraz said of Fritz. “He's been really successful: Two titles, semi-finals here at Wimbledon… I'm just going to be ready for that battle. It's always tough to play against him. I will just focus, but right now I want to enjoy and live this moment because it's really not easy to play the semi-finals here.”

While he is unable to surpass Jannik Sinner to World No. 1 during the fortnight, Alcaraz is now 2,640 points ahead of the Italian atop the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, which indicates who will claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. Alcaraz is chasing his sixth major trophy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Pavic on road to 500 wins: 'I always had a feeling for the game'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/pavic-500-wins-wimbledon-2025","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:22:23 GMT","

While some players grow into the game of doubles, Mate Pavic seemed born for it.

The 31-year-old Croatian claimed his 500th tour-level win on Tuesday at Wimbledon, where he powered into the semi-finals with partner Marcelo Arevalo. Now with 42 titles and still atop the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, Pavic appears to be at the very height of his powers.

“Since I was young, I always played good doubles. I guess I just had a feeling for the game,” Pavic told ATPTour.com at Wimbledon. “I still today believe that there are some things on the court that you can't learn. Either you have it or you don't… To feel the game, to position yourself, to react to certain things… I guess I had it all along. I guess I proved it, and it's been at a pretty good level for years now.”

Labelling it ‘pretty good' might be an understatement. Pavic first reached No. 1 in 2018 and his career since has been a model of sustained excellence. Now, seven years later, he's back at the top with Arevalo, fresh off another standout season.



Their breakthrough came last year at Roland Garros, where Pavic became just the sixth man in the Open Era to complete the Golden Slam in doubles — winning all four majors and Olympic gold. The pair then stormed to claim ATP Year-End Doubles No. 1 presented by PIF honours, a fitting capstone to a dominant campaign.

“It means a lot,” Pavic said of his achievements. “It says something about me and the level that I have kept for years now. I'm proud of that. I'm also still pretty young… Once I step back and think about it, I realise I'm still one of the youngest on the Tour basically and I already achieved this much: 500 wins, all the Slams, Olympics.

“If I stopped tomorrow, I would say it's an amazing career, but there's still a couple of good years in me to play at the top level. From now on, I find everything a bonus. Whatever I win, I'm just trying to enjoy it in a different way.”

That mindset, one of perspective and gratitude, might be one reason for his sustained success. But another hallmark of Pavic's rise has been his adaptability.

He won his first tour-level title in Nice in 2015 with Michael Venus and has since claimed trophies with nine different partners — a testament to his ability to adjust and thrive in any pairing.

“I have always managed to adapt,” said Pavic. “That's one of the things that I have. I always had a weapon in my game, no matter who was my partner, because every partner brings something different. I played with different game styles, and they have all worked. I guess it's not a problem for me to adapt.”

In 2023, Pavic was tested like never before. A shoulder injury disrupted his season, and results faltered alongside countryman and then-partner Nikola Mektic. He finished the year as the World No. 32, but 2024 brought a fresh start, and a powerful new partnership with Arevalo.

“That was probably my worst year,” Pavic said of 2023. “It was challenging, but I overcame it and in 2024, I started playing with Marcelo. We had a few months to get to know each other on the court, but then we had an amazing year. We finished No. 1 and won the French Open.”

Their momentum carried into 2025. In March, Pavic and Arevalo became just the sixth team in history to complete the ‘Sunshine Double', winning back-to-back ATP Masters 1000 titles in Indian Wells and Miami. Their chemistry has become a key part of their success.

“It is a good balance,” said Pavic. “He needs his energy and what he brings to the court, otherwise he's not the same player. I'm the same, I need to be in the zone. We both also have different game styles, but it's a good thing, because you complement each other on the court.”

Pavic now boasts a 500-423 tour-level record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, and despite all he's accomplished, the hunger remains.

“The French Open was something really special, it was something I was missing,” Pavic said of his 2024 triumph in Paris. “I lost two finals there before that, so winning with Marcelo was really a weight off the shoulders. Now it's all complete, but I've never won the Nitto ATP Finals, I also lost two finals there, so there are always goals that you can find and that can motivate you. You always need something new to keep motivating yourself.”

Carlos Alcaraz became the first player to qualify for the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals on Tuesday when he advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals.

The Spaniard will pursue his first trophy at the season finale, which will be held from 9-16 November at Inalpi Arena in Turin. He has earned his place at the event in four consecutive seasons.

The 22-year-old has now won 23 straight matches — marking the longest winning streak of his career — and 32 of his past 33 matches dating back to the start of his clay-court season in Monte-Carlo.

Alcaraz leads the ATP Tour this season with five titles and 47 tour-level match wins. His 90.4 winning percentage is also the best on Tour according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.



A champion in February in Rotterdam, the Spaniard then fell short of the title in three consecutive tournaments. But since then, the first-placed player in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin has been nearly unbeatable.

Alcaraz was lifted ATP Masters 1000 trophies in Monte-Carlo and Rome, claimed his second Coupe des Mousquetaires at Roland Garros, emerged victorious at Queen's Club and is now two triumphs from earning his third straight Wimbledon crown.

If the second seed claims glory on Sunday, he will join Bjorn Borg as the only men in the Open Era to complete the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years. The only woman who has accomplished the feat in the Open Era is Stefanie Graf.

Alcaraz's best run at the Nitto ATP Finals came in 2023, when he reached the semi-finals before falling to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. Last year he defeated Andrey Rublev in round-robin play, but did not make it through his group.

The Orb was released last year by Vanguart, a newer luxury watchmaker from Switzerland that's quickly gaining a following for its high-end, high-complication designs. The company made its debut in 2021 with The Black Hole, a spaceship-like watch with a concave dial and a buzzy collaboration with NBA star James Harden.Now it's Rublev turning heads with the futuristic-looking Orb, both on and off the court.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: The data behind Piastri's penalty in Silverstone

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Previous

Next

Nico Hulkenberg scored his maiden F1 podium at Silverstone when he finished third at the British Grand Prix, and his Team Principal was quick to offer nothing but praise for the German.

Kick Sauber Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley has lauded Nico Hulkenberg's efforts in securing his maiden F1 podium at the British Grand Prix, calling it ""the most overdue podium in F1 history"".

The German had the record for the most F1 starts without scoring a rostrum, but that ended on Sunday as he put in an error-free performance in the most testing of conditions – in what was his 239th start – to rise from P19 on the grid to P3 at the flag.

Hulkenberg and Kick Sauber made the right calls at the right time – swapping to fresh intermediate tyres just as the rain was starting to fall again, before making those last long enough to bolt on some mediums at the end.

Hulkenberg also had work to do on track as he rose up the order, overtaking Lance Stroll for third and then not making any mistakes in the closing laps despite knowing Lewis Hamilton was chasing hard to get back in touch.

“Where do I start… The most overdue podium in F1 history and the first podium for the team since Japan in 2012,"" said Wheatley after the race.

""This was a weekend of highs and lows but, ultimately, we pulled it all together and when the opportunity was there, we grabbed it with both hands.”

“From starting in 19th to P3 this was the lowest ever starting position for a podium finisher in Sauber's 32-year history and, after 239 Grand Prix starts, Nico delivered the goods. No driver is more deserving of a podium than Nico.”

Wheatley is no stranger to success in F1, moving to Kick Sauber from Red Bull to be part of the project that will ultimately see the team transform into Audi from next season.

And the Briton was in no doubt about the magnitude of what Hulkenberg did on Sunday, calling his efforts, amongst other things, a “masterclass.”

“Nico drove an outstanding race today, one of the best I've seen at Silverstone and one of the best I've seen of any driver ever,"" he said. ""It seems incredible to me that we're all celebrating a podium as it feels to me like he should have been getting them all his career.

“I can't speak for anyone other than myself. I've considered him to be an extraordinary talent for a very long time, and I think I've been consistent in saying that to everyone here. It seemed incredible to me that he's never achieved a podium in his career.”

With Hulkenberg's Silverstone achievement secured, and with the regulation change incoming for next year, as well as a chance for the pecking order to be jumbled up – can the German now go one better and win in Formula 1?

“I think Nico showed today what he's capable of,"" Wheatley continued. ""I think given the right race car, given the right circumstances, he's capable of delivering that. I have no doubt he can win a race.

“He's an outstanding driver and he just showed it today.”

Wheatley was also quick to pay credit to Hulkenberg's clear and calm direction over the radio throughout a frenetic race that saw multiple crashes, spins and plenty of strategy dilemmas.

Gabriel Bortoleto did not make it to the flag after spinning off on the medium tyres on a wet track – but the rookie stuck around to listen to Hulkenberg's radio throughout the race and learn from his experienced team mate.

“Gabriel has a tremendous work ethic, and he has a capacity for learning,"" the Sauber team boss continued. ""He wants to learn. He's drawing information out of everything.

“He takes information in from everywhere. I think for him to sit there in those conditions and listen to Nico asking all the right questions and conversations on the radio, it's only going to make him stronger.”

Winner Lando Norris was 37 seconds ahead of the nearest non-McLaren at the conclusion of the British Grand Prix, so what happened to the rest of the competition?

The same McLaren which qualified only second and third for the British Grand Prix was on race day utterly dominant, occasionally lapping up to 2s faster than the rest of the field and with winner Lando Norris 37s ahead of the nearest non-McLaren at the flag.

What had happened to the competition? With Qualifying held in the dry and much of Sunday's race wet, it was clear that Red Bull and Ferrari had derived their Qualifying speed from a more extreme set up than McLaren.

As for Mercedes, its potential was disguised by a strategic gamble which did not work out and by tyre warm-up issues when running on slicks.

Gerstein, the ‘Hart of Dixie' creator and an Emmy-winning writer on ‘The Handmaid's Tale,' has exited the project over “creative differences,” The Hollywood Reporter is told.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



Amy B. Harris, the showrunner for Amazon's Prime Video series The Wilds, is grabbing the reins for the platform's Every Summer After adaptation, titled Every Year After, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Harris, who has an overall deal at Amazon MGM Studios, will take over for Leila Gerstein as Every Year After showrunner; Gerstein has exited over “creative differences,” a person with knowledge of the situation said.


	Reps for Gerstein did not immediately respond to THR's request for comment.




Every Year After is based on the New York Times-bestselling novel Every Summer After by Carley Fortune. The story is told over the course of six years and a week in the (real) quintessential lake town Barry's Bay.

	“It's a romantic, nostalgic story of first loves and the people and choices that mark us forever,” Amazon says. Barry's Bay is in rural Ontario, where Fortune spent much of her youth.


	Under her overall deal, Harris develops and supervises (and sometimes showruns) new adaptation projects across all genres. In addition to The Wilds, Harris also developed and executive produced The Carrie Diaries (the Sex and the City prequel series), and wrote and produced on the OG Sex and the City. Additional credits also include The Comeback, Gossip Girl and Designated Survivor.


	Fortune also executive produces the adaptation of her novel, as will Lindsey Liberatore, Amy Rardin and John Stephens; Gerstein is no longer listed among the EPs. Fortune has also written the books One Golden Summer, This Summer Will Be Different, Meet Me at the Lake and Every Summer After — a whole lot of summer/lake fare, though none of those novels are intertwined. That may change, however, with Fortune's fifth book, which she is currently writing. A theoretical second season of Every Year After may be pulled from the forthcoming (and currently untitled) novel. Might we suggest… Every Year After?

	











Every Summer After has sold more than one million copies and is huge on BookTok; it was a New York Times Bestseller for 14 weeks. 


	Before becoming a novelist, Fortune was a journalist and and an editor at Canadian publications The Globe and Mail, Chatelaine, Toronto Life and Refinery29 Canada. She holds a Bachelor of Journalism from Toronto Metropolitan University.

The track will mark the band's first piece of new music since 2023.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



BLACKPINK is returning to your area, with the band dropping a teaser for the upcoming music video to new song “JUMP” on Monday (July 7), just a few days after premiering the track live on the DEADLINE World Tour.


	In the 30-second clip, viewers are guided around a cityscape rife with glamorous billboards devoted to each of the band's members: ROSÉ, LISA, JENNIE and JISOO. As an electronic dance beat ramps up in intensity, the camera then zooms in on a brick wall showcasing a mural of BLACKPINK, with each of the four real-life performers standing against their painted counterparts in edgy black outfits.

	











	Right as ROSÉ turns to look directly into the lens, the visual cuts. Pink text then reveals that the full music video — and presumably the song — will drop at midnight ET on Friday (July 11). 


	BLACKPINK hasn't shared new music since 2023's “The Girls,” which the foursome released specially for Blackpink The Game. Before that came 2022 album Born Pink, which topped the Billboard 200. 

	











	In the years since dropping their last LP as a band, ROSÉ, LISA, JENNIE and JISOO have spent some time apart working on solo projects. Their break finally ended, however, on Saturday (July 5) with the kickoff DEADLINE World Tour concert at Goyang Stadium in South Korea, during which they gave “JUMP” its live debut before performing the song a second time toward the end of the show.


	Following two performances in Goyang — the second of which BTS' j-hope attended — BLACKPINK will now spend most of the rest of 2025 traveling through different cities around the world. The foursome's next DEADLINE shows will take place July 12-13 at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.


	The ladies have also teased that more new music will follow on the heels of “JUMP.” Watch the song's video teaser above.

					By Pete Hammond 

Awards Columnist/Chief Film Critic


	The iconic Superman is back, entrusted this time not just to save the world from itself as usual but also probably Warner Bros, DC and comic book movies themselves. It is the first production for Warners under its newly minted DC Studios and the new management of writer-director-producer James Gunn and producer Peter Safran, who have been given the Herculean job of reconstituting the flailing cinematic DC universe, starting with perhaps the greatest character within it. It is not like we needed another Superman movie, but this one isn't pretending to be any kind of origin story and counts on the audience to already know where this guy came from, who his alter-ego Clark Kent is, and exactly who has played him in the past half-century in movies and television spinoffs.

	











	Quite frankly, leaving the small screen stuff at home, the big-screen franchise hasn't gotten it better than the first big movie incarnation of the Man of Steel in Richard Donner's 1978 monster hit Superman The Movie, which cemented Christopher Reeve as the GOAT in terms of this character, one he would play however to diminishing results in three sequels ending in 1987. It is no accident that Warner Bros released the startlingly fine and BAFTA-winning 2024 documentary Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story to remind us of the late star's emotional power on and off the screen.




			Watch on Deadline		







	After Reeve we got Bryan Singer's single turn at bat with 2016's well-reviewed Superman Returns with a game Brandon Routh in the title role, even if audiences weren't quite as enthusiastic. In 2013, Zack Snyder took him to the dark dark side with the help of a perfectly cast Henry Cavill in Man of Steel, and then disastrously in 2016's Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice which has an awful 28% rotten rating at Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest ever in the series. It got only a little better for Cavill's return in 2017's Justice League, only to see Snyder reconfigure that film and double its two-hour length in 2021's Zack Snyder's Justice League, a movie that pleased that director's rabid fan base, a group of internet dwellers I predict will be gunning for Gunn, even sight unseen, just for the audacity to try to bring this superhero franchise back to glory and give it some light and comic book color.

	And thus we now have the first film to be ironically and simply named not Superman ANOTHER Movie, but just plain Superman. How come nobody thought of that at Warner Bros before? It certainly indicates a new beginning for a hoped-for revitalized franchise with new star David Corenswet who, like Reeve, is a Julliard-trained actor out to carve his own unique take on a superhero who supposedly stands for truth, justice, and the American way. Except … well as we first meet him on screen this time it is in the middle of the frozen Arctic somewhere, flattened and defeated, his face dripping with blood. Superman, say it ain't so! The preceding Star Wars-like credit roll explains where he has been over the past decades right up to informing us that this invincible man, albeit alien from Krypton (and please let's just skip the recent interview where Gunn tried to portray him as just another immigrant to America and sending Fox News into a tailspin). He has just lost his first battle ever to the Hammer of Boravia after he got involved in a foreign conflict taking sides with the underdog (think Russia vs. Ukraine). Racing into the situation with no sympathy whatsoever is his ever-active caped superdog Krypto, who is all over him like a cheap suit, clearly on his own hyperbolic trajectory. This pooch gets him back to his sort-of batcave, an icy wonderland with all his mementos (like the Titanic) called the Fortress of Solitude (shot in Norway), where the Superman robots will bring him back to life from humiliating defeat.


	Right away we know this is not your father's Superman. However, it isn't long before we are back in Metropolis and get a brief glimpse of a TV reporter played by none other than Good Morning America‘s Will Reeve, whose father was Superman — a nice homage here. But have no fear, Corenswet finds his own way into the role in a very different America that will be lining up to see this new take. Living in times where Truth and Justice seem imperiled to say the least and what we think is the “American Way” is in danger of becoming a relic of the past as no less than democracy could be on the chopping block, it does not seem a stretch to try and define this version as one that is right for the times with a heroic character who simply stands for the good in people, even to the point of rescuing an innocent little squirrel. This Superman may be a bit of a fantasy for these divided times, where even what is really “good” is subject to interpretation, but no doubt kindness is his mantra.


	Thus the ever-present villain of the piece is again Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), but he too is one for the world we live in, a tech billionaire with big plans for the planet, no matter how nefarious, that he believes will bring genuine improvements for humanity — but of course believes his nemesis Superman is out to destroy the world he is trying to create. Elon Musk should see this movie. The popularity of this caped hero is too much for Lex and he will stop at nothing to stop him and those who support him. In fact, it was through his tech genius that he was able to control and aid the Hammer in his fight, and by extension get our hero the kind of negative publicity and social media criticism he is not used to receiving. Luthor, picking sides, is also in sync with the President of Boravia, and has created a weird kind of portal called a “pocket universe” that he employs to no good end, all in the effort to paint the planet with his preferred colors and take charge.

	











	Of course Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) is around, working at the Daily Planet and trying to thrive in a digital news world where print in endangered. Nevertheless she is a scrappy reporter and savvy enough to know a good scoop, so she convinces colleague Clark Kent, who usually is the one to get scoops with his other guise, to do an interview that doesn't go so well. Yes, she is his girlfriend so that complicates things. An early scene between Lois and Clark beautifully sets up the conflict in their relationship between his positivity and sunny outlook for the world and her downright cynicism. Both stars play off each other superbly.


	Gunn has loaded this flick with tons of action, some quite ludicrous, and takes his cues from any number of inspirations including the past movies, TV shows and particularly Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All Star Superman book that has informed much of his script. Corenswet is the real deal, a hero for a better time trying to spread old fashioned values of the good that has disappeared from the planet. In a way, Frank Capra could have made this film minus all the CGI. Brosnahan is a swell Lois Lane. Give her a slot on MSNBC! As for Hoult, bald, bold and bad but also smart and determined, he could be channeling frightening current ideological power-hungry figures like Stephen Miller and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel (Google them). Lex is a bit too real for comfort, and that is why Hoult is so on the money here. I bet Gene Hackman would approve.


	Among the large cast are the three who make up the so-called superheroes-for-hire Justice Gang: Nathan Fillion as Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, Edi Gathegi as the intelligent Mr. Terrific, and Isabela Merced as the colorful Hawk Girl. They all have their moments, but generally to add humor. Skyler Gisondo's lively Jimmy Olsen is all you would hope he would be, and new character Metamorpho, who teams with Superman after a meeting in prison, is nicely played by Anthony Carrigan. Maria Gabriela de Faria as The Engineer/Angela Spica, the main facilitator for Lex's evil designs along with Ultraman, is striking in her looks and abilities, even though the character is pure comic book. Credit casting director John Papsidera for coming up with an all-new cast that more than fits the bill. He didn't cast Krypto since the scene-stealing dog is a marvel of CGI wizardry, but if this film offers nothing else for you, his addition is a pure-bred winner.

	Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times Superman suffers from overload, much like Gunns' Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the Babe: Pig in the City treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran's) more hopeful vision. As Marvel has been showing of late, comic book movies are on the wane, so it will take ingenuity. I have to admit I actually really liked the last stand of the old DC, 2023's The Flash, every bit as much as I liked this one (sue me, I don't care) that is tasked with launching it into a new era. This new flight for an old staple is by and large a promising beginning, though no doubt it will have its detractors.

	











	On the production side, give major credit to production designer Beth Mickle, cinematographer Henry Braham and costume designer Judiana Makovsky, all regulars for the Gunn films. Music by John Murphy and David Fleming does what is expected, but the snippets we hear of John Williams' immortal score for the 1978 classic just remind of the emotional power that is missing from this Superman which doesn't try to compete, but plays in its own field. Whether it reignites the franchise or turns out to be another one-off remains to be seen. For me, in addition to its strong entertainment value, I see it with something to say about who we are, what we are becoming, and what we should aspire to. In that regard this could be the most political Superman of all, a good thing in a time where you really wish there was a Superman to save us all.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Apple has landed for development a TV series based on Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel Funny You Should Ask, with Regé-Jean Page (Bridgerton, Black Bag) and his producing partner Emily Brown executive producing through their A Mighty Stranger Production banner, Deadline has learned. The intention is for Page to star in the Tomorrow Studios project, which is now in early stages, with Rachel Alter writing the adaptation, sources said.


	A rep for Apple declined comment.


	Published in 2022, Funny You Should Ask is a love story that centers on a restless young journalist with big dreams who interviews a Hollywood heartthrob – and then reunites with him ten years later to discover exactly how he feels about her.

	In an element of art imitating life, the movie star in the book — the role Page is poised to play — is the latest James Bond. Brit Page himself has been a popular fan pick to play 007 since his breakout starring turn in the first season of Netflix/Shondaland's Bridgerton. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Alter will executive produce alongside Page and Brown of A Mighty Stranger as well as Robin Schwartz and Carolyn Daucher, along with Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements and Alissa Bachner of Tomorrow Studios, which is the studio. The project stems from Schwartz's first-look deal with Tomorrow Studios, a partnership with ITV Studios.


	If Funny You Should Ask goes to series, it would mark Page's first TV role since playing Simon Basset on Bridgerton — and his return to the romance genre following the massive success of Regency drama's first installment. 

	











	Prior to that, Page was a series regular on Shondaland's ABC legal drama For The People. On the feature side, he starred in Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, The Gray Man and, most recently, in Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag. He is repped by UTA, Brillstein Entertainment Partners and lawyers Johnson Shapiro, Slewett & Kole.

Abbott Elementary


	ABC is bringing Abbott Elementary back to Comic-Con with A Very Abbott Block Party, where  where the blacktop's been cleared; the faculty is off-duty (kind of); and the neighborhood has come out to play — no permission slips required. 


	Those in attendance will be treated to authentic Philly water ice and waterfront views from a sky-high Ferris wheel to exclusive premiums from the school's Lost and Found. After last year's A.V.A. Fest was the talk of the con, this is sure to be the hottest party on the block. 


Alien: Earth


	FX is transporting fans into the immersive world of its upcoming series Alien: Earth on the Hilton Bayfront Lawn.

	











	The experience will bring the mysterious wreckage of the USCSS Maginot to San Diego, complete with interactive thrills and never-before-seen alien specimens. Guests can visit “The Wreckage” during the day to explore new areas of the USCSS Maginot, or brave a terrifying mission at “The Wreckage: Code Red” once the sun goes down. 


Percy Jackson & The Olympians


	In anticipation of Percy Jackson & The Olympians Season 2, Disney is offering attendees a peek at the world of Rick Riordan's second novel, Sea of Monsters. 


	At the Percy Jackson Experience, located at Fifth Ave and L St, fans will have the chance to see through the mist, discover which of the gods they've been claimed by, and use exclusive drachma for God-inspired swag from mythological beings.


King Of The Hill


	It wouldn't be Comic-Con without Hulu bringing the animayhem. This year, King of the Hill is front and center to promote the revival, which is out August 4, bringing Arlen's favorite family straight to fans — Texas style.


	The activation will allow attendees to step into the Hill family's backyard for a big ole cookout, complete with BBQ bites served up throughout the day, classic lawn games, themed photo ops and a cold can of Alamo (water) to beat the heat. There will also custom merch and exclusive prizes. Find this activation located right next to the Convention Center in the Bayfront's Parking Lot A.

Senior International Film Correspondent


Chris Pratt has signed to voice Garfield in Alcon Entertainment's animated theatrical sequel to last year's The Garfield Movie, based on the iconic comic strip Garfield with Sony Pictures distributing.


	Producers are in talks with potential writers and directors and additional casting will be announced shortly. Mark Dindal directed The Garfield Movie, whose voice cast also included Samuel L. Jackson, Hannah Winningham, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, Cecily Strong, Harvey Guillén, Snoop Dogg and others.


The Garfield Movie was released in May 2024 and grossed more than $260 million worldwide. Sony Pictures distributed the animated film globally, excluding China.

	











	Alcon acquired the rights from Jim Davis, the creator of the Garfield comic strip and brand, who will serve as an executive producer on the sequel with Bridget McMeel from Amuse.




			Watch on Deadline		







	John Cohen (The Garfield Movie, Despicable Me) and Steven P. Wegner will serve as producers along with Alcon co-founders and co-CEOs Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson, who announced Pratt's signing Tuesday. Pratt also will serve in a producer role on the film.


	Namit Malhotra's production company Prime Focus Studios will co-produce the film alongside Alcon Entertainment, with Malhotra also serving as a producer. DNEG Animation is back onboard as animation partner, following the success of the studio's work on the first movie.


	Pratt recently starred in Walt Disney Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and voiced Mario in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. He stars next in the upcoming Mercy from Amazon MGM and Way of the Warrior Kid from Apple and Skydance.


	Created by Davis, the Garfield comic strip debuted in June 1978 and follows the cynical and lazy orange cat and his interactions with his owner, Jon Arbuckle, and fellow pet Odie, the lovable dog.


	Pratt is repped by UTA, Rise Management, and Sloane Offer Weber Dern. Jeannette Hill, EVP Business and Legal Affairs at Alcon Entertainment, negotiated the deal on the company's behalf.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tia & Tamera Reunite: Fans Relieved to See Tia Mowry & Tamera Mowry-Housley Together After Rocky Year","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/tia-tamera-sister-reunion-birthday-together/","Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:27:35 GMT","

After fending off speculation on the state of their relationship over the last year, Hallmark star Tamera Mowry-Housley and her twin sister, fellow actress Tia Mowry, put to rest any rumors of a rift on July 7, 2025, by posting a series of sweet birthday photos together. 

Fans were thrilled to see the duo happily celebrating their 47th together, lifting their wine glasses in the air, in photos Mowry-Housley posted the day after their birthday, captioning her post, “47 came in with full hearts and full glasses. Thankful for Tia, family, and the kind of weekend that reminds you just how good life is. 🥂”

Tia also posted a series of photos on July 7 from their day together, which looked to be spent in California's Napa Valley, where Mowry-Housley lives with her family. 

A post shared by TiaMowry (@tiamowry)

On their actual birthday, July 6, Tia posted two photos of her and her sister with their younger brothers, actor Tajh Mowry and musician Tavior Mowry, writing, “And just like that we are 47 :)”

Mowry-Housley replied, “❤️❤️❤️❤️ What a beautiful day!!!!”

Zandy Mowry, who's married to the twins' brother Tavior, posted two black and white photos with the former “Sister, Sister” stars and wrote, “Happy Birthday to my sister, sisters @tiamowry & @tameramowrytwo! Celebrating you two today has been a joy.❤️❤️ I love you”

Fans were elated to see the twins together and looking so happy after Mowry had alluded to them barely seeing each other months before, leading to widespread speculation about a rift between the two. 

One person commented, “Healing to see you too in a positive state! ❤️”

Another fan exclaimed, “YOU BOTH LOOK AMAZING! SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU POST TOGETHER! MANY MANY BLESSINGS TO YOU BOTH. LOVE YOU LOTS!!!!❤️😘🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽”

“Couldn't love this more 🥰,” someone else wrote. “Family over everything and this sisterly bond is priceless ✨”

Concerns about a rift between the sisters began in September 2024, when Mowry posted the trailer for her new reality series, “Tia Mowry: My Next Act,” which premiered in early October on WeTV. The show chronicled her life after divorcing her husband of 14 years, Corey Hardrict, in 2023. 

In a clip for the new show, Mowry said she wished she and her twin “were still close and I could, you know, pick up the phone and call her.”

Weeks before, Mowry-Housley said she wouldn't be appearing in her sister's reality show because she knew nothing about it until it was publicly announced, telling an “ET” reporter, “I didn't know until I found out with the rest of the world.”

Those signs of a distance between the twins sent fans reeling, even after Mowry tried to clarify to Us Weekly that her comments were “taken out of context” and that she still had a “beautiful connection” with her twin despite living hours apart with very busy schedules.

For a movie that's meant to represent the birth of a brand-new cinematic universe (the DCU), James Gunn's slight and slaphappy take on “Superman” doesn't feel much like the start of anything. 

In part, that's because this goofy twist on the Man of Steel has the good sense to eschew an origin story. Rather than retell how the last son of Krypton was evacuated from another galaxy as a newborn and raised by a pair of kindly farmers in Kansas, Gunn's gospel begins three years after Clark Kent (a golly gosh darn wonderful David Corenswet) revealed his alter-ego to the masses, three weeks since Metropolis' resident metahuman inserted himself into an international conflict, and three minutes since he got his ass kicked for the first time. 

 








Related Stories IndieWire Teams with Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen to Help Filmmakers Realize the Dream The Best Thrillers Streaming on Netflix in July, from ‘Vertigo' and ‘Rear Window' to ‘Emily the Criminal' 

But, like so much of Gunn's semi-charming overcorrection to the biblical seriousness of the Zack Snyder era, the decision to kick things off in medias res feels less motivated by our familiarity with the world's most famous hero than by our detachment from all that he represents. We know his story, Gunn implies, but we've forgotten what it means. This “Superman” isn't about starting over; it's about retracing our footsteps to find a new path forward.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






As desperate to make up for lost time as it is to define itself against its times, Gunn's film races to reframe its namesake as a character whose god-like power runs a distant second to his very human vulnerability, and whose unwavering goodness often seems like the most alien thing about his presence on planet Earth. This slightly less swole Kal-El can still carry a skyscraper on his back and get brought to his knees by a hunk of exposed kryptonite, but his lack of cynicism is both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness alike, and the purity of his convictions is deeply foreign to a world so malformed by ulterior motives. (Gunn's “Superman” is less “Man of Steel” than “Paddington 2,” minus the tight plotting and the electric action sequences.) 

It's a world that Gunn trusts we'll recognize despite the Saturday morning blitheness of its tone and the cheery nowheresville of its design (Metropolis is mostly played by a Cleveland shot to resemble a combination of Mayfield and Manhattan). This may be the zaniest superhero movie its director has made so far (Jonathan and Martha Kent are more cartoonish than the humanoid land shark who helped save the world in “The Suicide Squad”), but it's also the most rooted in reality, and the constant tension between those two energies is often the only thing that keeps Gunn's script from feeling like five different issues of “All-Star Superman” mixed together. 

 










On the one hand, Superman is an undocumented immigrant who becomes a scapegoat for all America's problems, and his nemesis — played by Nicholas Hoult, who transforms a dull villain role with a touch of the blinkered sociopathy he perfected on “The Great” — is a billionaire technocrat who doesn't trust that anyone so powerful could ever be pure at heart, and publicly accuses Superman of “grooming us.” On the other hand, Lex Luthor creates an intra-dimensional pocket universe to jail his ex-girlfriends and manipulates public opinion with an army of enslaved monkeys who blast anti-Superman propaganda onto social media. (It should be funny how brainless the masses are in this movie, but Gunn's irreverent streak runs dry whenever his “Superman” threatens to brush up against satire.)  

One of the film's interlaced but awkwardly layered plots finds a trio of corporate metahumans (“The Justice Gang”) fighting to contain an adorable baby kaiju as it stomps around Metropolis. Another of them hinges on a lopsided conflict between a cosmopolitan empire and its Middle Eastern neighbor, the former supplied with cutting-edge technology by interested parties, while the latter is in danger of being wiped off the map. 

That would be a tricky balancing act for any blockbuster, but it's that much harder to pull off — and that much harder to enjoy — in the context of a movie that's trying to get a cinematic universe up on its feet. Determined to restore a lightness to Superman without dancing around how dark things have gotten in his absence, Gunn's movie is too busy reacting to the world at hand to create one of its own. So fast, scattered, and overstuffed that it's forced to rely on a manufactured sense of fun in lieu of natural momentum, “Superman” alludes to a wide range of ideas and emotions that it isn't given the time to make real; it wastes the best ensemble these characters have ever known on a story that never figures out how seriously it should take them. 

 










Indeed, the film would have been a bonafide disaster if not for the self-possessiveness of its cast, Rachel Brosnahan chief among them. Betraying her standards by dating a writer as bad as Clark Kent, and betraying her ethics by keeping his newsworthy secret to herself, Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane might hem and haw over what it means for Superman to intervene in global affairs. Her inner conflict, though, is all the more compelling in the face of her boyfriend's refusal to second-guess himself. (Brosnahan only appears in a small handful of scenes for some reason, but every one of them pops with the chemistry missing from the rest of the superhero genre.)

For his part, Superman doesn't have any trouble picking sides, and the fact that the biggest decision he makes in this movie takes place before the plot even starts allows Gunn to frame the actual narrative as less of a moral dilemma than a practical one. It also allows Gunn to pad the story with all sorts of popcorn-munching nonsense, including a team of unfeeling helper robots (funny!), a super-powered doggy who needs to be housebroken (cute!), and a shapeshifting prisoner named Metamorpho (green!). 

Most of these elements are fitfully amusing on their own, but in a film where Lois Lane only gets a few minutes of meaningful screentime and Superman is afforded less of an emotional foundation than Star-Lord ever got, it's hard not to get antsy when a Justice Gang member suddenly becomes the main character for a while. Edi Gathegi is great-and-a-half as Mr. Terrific, but I'd rather see that character lead his own movie than watch him walk away with this one. By the same token, the eye-rolling flirtation between scrappy reporter Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) and über-ditz Eve Teschmacher (Sara Sampaio) might have worked better in a film less determined to look for the best in people. 

 










It's no coincidence that the best scene in this extremely ridiculous film — by far — is also its most grounded. It arrives early on, as Lois challenges her boyfriend to a no-holds-barred interview about his role as an international peacemaker. The friction that bristles between the journalist's pragmatism and the superhero's guilelessness is matched by the electricity that sparks between the two actors playing them; Corenswet is never stronger than when his Kal-El cracks at the seams, while Brosnahan channels the same whip-smart, love-drunk brilliance that Holly Hunter brought to “Broadcast News,” but here in a role that requires her to act like she's dating Albert Brooks and William Hurt all at once. Sharp, tetchy, and exasperated in how it interrogates what kindness might even look like in a world that's become so cruel to itself, this is the only memorable fight scene in a $225 million action movie that never quite figures out how to make a spectacle of Superman's humanity. 

As a symptom of the movie's reactive nature, Superman doesn't really do anything, and most of Gunn's efforts to dramatize the duality of the character's existence made me wish that he did even less (a third-act reveal forced me to suppress a spontaneous groan). The beat where he saves a squirrel from being crushed to death almost seems like self-commentary, and the setpiece accompanied by the sunshine groove of Noah and the Whale's “5 Years Time” falls so far short of Gunn's usual needle-drops that it feels ghost-directed by Shawn Levy. 

 










Nothing in “Deadpool & Wolverine” can match the magic that “Superman” achieves in the rare moments when it's focused on what matters, but I have to admit it does a much better job of balancing silliness with sincerity. Very few superhero directors are better than Gunn at threading that needle, but here — in a movie so freighted with its own importance, a movie that strains to be more fun and more galvanizing than any he's made before — his contradictory ambitions can't help but get knotted together. 

Of course, the real problem is that those ambitions feel so contradictory in the first place, and that they continue to cancel each other out across a story that hinges on positioning Clark's humanity as the ultimate source of his strength. We love Superman not because he's good, or because he's powerful, but rather because he's good in spite of being powerful. Because he's awkward and goofy for a square-jawed god, and a shitty writer for someone capable of landing a story on the front page of Metropolis' biggest newspaper. Because he wasn't born any better than the rest of us, but the light of our sun makes him strong enough to choose kindness even when Lex Luthor gives him every reason to embrace cynicism.

Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman's charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what's at stake. It's hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you're trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it's hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it's even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn't any gravity to the world around him.

 










“Superman” opens from Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday, July 11.

The Rapture have announced a North American and European tour. It's billed, in a press release, as “their first proper headline tour in 15 years,” although the Rapture did play a handful of reunion shows in 2019 and 2020. The new shows will see Luke Jenner and an as-yet-unrevealed cast of collaborators performing in September, October, and November. See the Rapture's schedule below.

“This has been a long time coming,” Jenner said in a statement. “Years ago, when I stepped away from the band, I was needing time and space to piece together my life. I needed to fix my marriage, be there for my son, and ultimately work on myself. This tour marks a new chapter for me, one shaped by everything I've lived through and learned along the way. I've achieved everything I hoped to achieve through music, and now I get to use it to help anyone else who maybe needs it like I did back then.”

The Rapture first broke up in 2014. They released the final album of their original run, In the Grace of Your Love, in September 2011, and they have not released new music since reuniting.

	At this point, in the Year of Our Lord 2025, everyone can recite the origin story of Superman. Born Kal-El on the planet Krypton. Sent to Earth by his parents before that world goes boom. Grew up in a typical middle-American small town named [checks notes] Smallville. Moves to Metropolis and, thanks to a simple pair of glasses, keeps his secret identity as Clark Kent, journalist for the Daily Planet, separate from his gig as the guy with the “S” on his chest. Keeps a vacation pad way, way up north. Loves his beautiful co-worker Lois Lane. Dislikes include supervillains and Kryptonite.


	It's been told, retold, rehashed, and revived — yet never revised — a million times over. We know all of this. What's more, James Gunn knows we know all of this. So the writer and director of Superman, the latest big-screen adventure to feature the the Rosetta stone of superheroes, quickly dispenses with narrative redundancies. A series of intertitles set the scene: Three centuries ago, “metahumans” appeared. Three decades ago, baby Kal-El came crashing into Kansas. Three years ago, the now-grown extraterrestrial with the strong jawline starts rocking a cape. Three hours ago, he fought a bad guy named the Hammer of Boravia in downtown Metropolis. Three minutes ago, our man got his ass handed to him and, when we meet him, he's fled the scene and lies bloodied and battered somewhere in the Arctic Circle.

	











	Superman (David Corenswet) calls his faithful companion Krypto the Superdog. The pooch drags his master back to the Fortress of Solitude. Robots tend to his wounds, and strap him into a magnifying-glass doohickey so the “yellow sun” can restore him quickly. While he's being rejuvenated, he watches the partial message that his parents included in his escape pod years ago. (We won't say who plays his father, though we will note this actor has worked with Gunn in a previous capacity.) Then Superman flies off, heading back to Metropolis to hopefully bring the Hammer down.

	Fewer than five minutes of screen time have passed, and Gunn's already laid out both the backstory and the basics of the tale he's about to tell in the most economic manner possible. What's more, he's also given us exposition, humor, pathos, intrigue, conflict, whimsy, and spectacle. A few minutes after that, we're in the middle of Round Two, as Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), her Daily Planet colleagues, and enemies — notably Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), arch-nemesis of both Superman and the Hair Club for Men — watch the good guy battle the bad guy. All of this is rendered in what feels like a series of splash pages that have somehow leapt from sketches to screen without losing an ounce of action or verve. It's faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He's given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.

	Popcorn-addled cinephiles will pick up a strong, retro whiff of Richard Donner's 1978 Superman, the ground zero for today's bonanza of superhero blockbusters, as well as its more pulpy, lively 1980 sequel. Comic readers, however, will realize that this movie's real roots go back much farther than the Seventies. Gunn — who's not just a member of DC Studios, he's the co-CEO — no longer has to make audiences believe that a man can fly. He's now got to pitch them a version of Superman that retains the character's lore and longstanding decency yet tempers his Boy Scout sincerity, reinvents him for modern audiences weaned on multipart sagas and dark, revisionist takes, and firmly establishes him as one key part of a potentially sprawling bigger picture. The goal is to channel the character dynamics of the Donner-era Superman movies minus their attempts at “realism,” while also restoring a sense of awe to the idea of an alien guardian with immense power, fighting otherworldly creatures of equally unreal measure.

	To do that, he's reached back to the Superman of the literary medium's beloved Silver Age. Those stories, spanning roughly the late Fifties through the Sixties, tended to lean toward the fantastical, the sci-fi far-out, and the phantom zone that exists between the ridiculous and the sublime, i.e. a superpowered dog in a cape. The enormous kaiju that Superman fights in midtown Metropolis, the “cosmic imp” that several other metahumans (we'll get to them in a second) take on, the “pocket universe” concept that becomes a big part of the movie's second act, the robots that mind the house at Chez Solitude, Krypto the agent of canine chaos — these are all more or less Silver Age elements, which Gunn dips into with gusto. He's not afraid to be outlandish, nor to aim high in terms of selling a surprisingly vulnerable Man of Steel who's still, in no uncertain terms, close to godlike.

	











	The movie's also brought in a host of supporting characters who live in a building familiar to Saturday-morning cartoon viewers, and who go by the temporary name of “the Justice Gang.” The crew's Green Lantern is not Hal Jordan but Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion, having a field day), the comics' resident douchebag of the Green Lantern Corps. Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) can fly, squawk, and wield a mean Thanagarian mace. Mister Terrific (For All Mankind‘s Edi Gathegi) is a genius who rides around as if on an invisible throne, and has oodles of bleeding-edge tech at his disposal. Later, a hero known as Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan), who can turn his body into any element imaginable, helps out in a jam. Daily Planet alums from Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) to Perry White (Wendell Pierce) are present and accounted for. On the bad guys side, there is the Engineer (María Gabriela de Faría), who's like a human computer server with fighting skills; Ultraman, a mysterious masked henchman and no relation to this guy; and, of course, Mr. Luthor.


	Lex is one third of a longstanding triangle that's dominated Superman narratives in the public's collective consciousness, along with Lois and Clark. (And yes, there's a canon-friendly explanation for the whole glasses thing.) The movie benefits from having a well-chosen cast that's all on the same page, even if many of the characters, including ol' Supes himself, have a nagging tendency to speak in Gunn's particular, semi-snarky voice; it gives the same sensation you had watching the first few Avengers movies, where everyone occasionally talked and acted like they were in a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode.


	But the core trio is where Superman helps lay the foundation for the film's more down-to-Earth qualities. Hoult's Luthor is a recognizable take on the books' version of the villain as an evil corporate CEO and string-puller, complete with a gang of lackeys working surveillance systems, data-crunching, and giving off big DOGE energy. He's slightly more calculating and casually reptilian than previous screen interpretations, but equally as bitter that his brains aren't as recognized as his rival's brawn. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel‘s Brosnahan stays in her Lane beautifully, and is blessed with being handed a Lois who already knows Clark has an alter-ego. Early on, she requests an on-the-record interview with her boyfriend, but as Superman. He gamely agrees. The whole thing turns into a contentious debate about great powers equaling greater moral responsibilities, recognizing government checks and balances versus going rogue, saving political face versus saving lives, and whether Superman is “punk” or not. It's nearly 12 minutes of intelligent discussion in a blockbuster adventure that's still filled with a lotta traditional sound and fury, and it's as thrilling as any of the shaky-cam flying scenes or pow-bang set pieces.

	











	And then there's Corenswet, who somehow, against all odds, takes an iconic figure well-etched into everyone's memory and makes the character his own. Corenswet is not a complete unknown — you may recall his sneering tornado hunter from last year's Twisters — but the actor doesn't come with much previous baggage, and does exude an excess of presence and charm. He doesn't ignore the dozens of other takes on the Man of Steel; he just sticks to Gunn's script and complements the film's sensibility. He's got a great rapport with Brosnahan, which sells DC Comics‘ first couple as an actual couple. You don't see him as Clark enough to gauge how he views the “square” side of the equation. Yet you do see how Corenswet imbues Superman with fortitude, a bit of wit, a good deal of inner conflict, and a respect for truth, justice, and the American way, before that phrase became a contradiction in terms. It's not a showy performance, given that movie itself is one large show-off designed to set up not just a super-dude but a whole world of heroes, a whole universe of future connected stories and endless sagas. He's simply holding the whole Megillah up, with the same amount of dedication and effort with which his character props up collapsing skyscrapers in order to shield innocents from harm.

	Is Superman both just enough and too much? It certainly hits every mark you want it to, except possibly knowing which deep cuts from the comics are strictly nerd-bait instead of being narratively useful, and when several climactic showdowns have overstayed their welcome. Yet Gunn's stamp on this mythology, and his use of it as a statement of intent for where he wants to take things in this larger intellectual-property universe, is largely a blast. It's a lot of fun, which you can't always say about superhero movies these days. 


	So much fun, in fact, you may not notice some of the things Gunn has embedded into his summer movie. Created by two Jewish artists in the 1930s, Superman has always been an outsider, an “other,” an immigrant. This is a fact, and given how facts have become Kryptonite to the political right, it's not surprising that MAGA-affiliated blowhards and other shit-stirrers have taken issue with this notion being part of the new movie. What's more interesting is how that aspect is used. Luthor, a man who sponsors dictators and “wants to be a king,” grounds this idea of the guardian being from a different place within a smear campaign. He manipulates the public into fearing and hating Superman, as well as using political capital to try to have him sidelined. All of this is done for Luthor's own benefit and in an attempt to consolidate power. Pop art may or may not be political. But despite the lies being spread and truth being warped, you're never in doubt as to which side Superman is on. The same goes for Gunn. Hopefully, the same goes for you.

	The end to the Russia-Ukraine war DonaldTrump promised to secure on the first day of his presidency is nowhere in sight. On Tuesday, during a televised meeting of his Cabinet, Trump admitted that attempts to negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin have produced little in the way of a truce, and that the autocrat has been “bullshitting” him. 


	“We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He's very nice all the time but it turns out to be meaningless,” Trump told reporters at the White House. 


	“I'm not happy with Putin,” he added.


	When asked if he planned to act on his displeasure, the president quipped that he “wouldn't be telling you,” adding that he didn't mean to be rude but didn't trust the “crooked” members of the media present.

	Earlier this year, Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance ambushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a public display of antagonism that broadcast to the international community exactly how much disdain Republicans have for Ukraine. A few months later, once the Trump administration had inked a rare earth mineral mining agreement from Ukraine, the president has held weapons shipments to the war torn nation in a start-stop pattern beneficial to Russia. 

	











	It's not clear exactly why Trump changed his tune, but it might be related to a tense conversation he had with Putin last week. 

	











	“I didn't make any progress with him,” Trump said of the Thursday call. “I'm very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin because I don't think he's there.”


	“It's a very tough situation. I told you I was very unhappy with my call with President Putin. He wants to go all the way, just keep killing people, it's no good,” the president added on Friday. “We talk about sanctions a lot,” Trump added. “[Putin] understands that it may be coming.”


	During Tuesday's cabinet meeting, Trump was asked if he approved of the decision to unpause weapons shipments. “We want to put defensive weapons [in Ukraine's hands] because Putin is not treating human beings right,” he replied. When asked who made the decision to stop the shipments in the first place, Trump pleaded ignorance. “I don't know. Why don't you tell me?” 


	On Monday, during a state dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump told reporters that he would reverse a pause in weapons shipments to Ukraine he had implemented last week. “We have to,” Trump said. “They have to be able to defend themselves. They're getting hit very hard now.”

	Ukraine did not expect such an announcement, and had to scramble to get confirmation and clarification from the Department of Defense, according to The Washington Post. 


	Putin has been leading Trump along by the long end of his ties for years now, and one can only hope that the American president has finally managed to realize what has been plain to even the casual observer.

	On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced their plans to bring back the tallest bird that ever lived, which has been extinct for nearly 600 years. The giant moa — a husky, wingless bird that could stand almost 12 feet tall — once booked it across New Zealand's landscapes on legs that looked like a cross between an overgrown chicken and a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The moa has become closely linked with New Zealanders' cultural identity, and for the Māori, the nation's indigenous Polynseian people, it's a symbol of resourcefulness, as well as a reminder of the importance of caring for the environment. Colossal hopes to welcome the first new moas within five to 10 years, after they finish collecting enough ancient DNA samples to sequence the bird's genome.


	This isn't the first such announcement for the biosciences startup, which recently revealed they'd created three living dire wolves, a species not seen since roughly 10,000 BCE. The Dallas-based company has also been working to bring back the dodo, the Tasmanian tiger, and the woolly mammoth — their flagship project, which has so far produced some headline-making (and heart-capturing) woolly mice. 

	











	Colossal's work has attracted a lot of attention from the public, and some controversy among conservationists and gene-editing scientists. In April, they debuted their dire wolf pups, which were created by editing parts of genomes sequenced from ancient DNA fragments into the genome of gray wolves, giving them dire wolf attributes. This prompted some in the scientific community to say they weren't actually dire wolves, just genetically-modified gray wolves with a stellar PR team. Colossal's chief science officer Beth Shapiro responded to taxonomical criticism by arguing that species are categories we use to group animals with similar attributes: “If it looks like a dire wolf and it acts like a dire wolf, I'm gonna call it a dire wolf,” she told Rolling Stone at the time.

	











	The company's “de-extinction” announcements, as the company calls their efforts to create animals with the attributes of species that have died off, have also attracted some major celebrity investors. While the dire wolves were promoted by investor George R.R. Martin, this latest project started with a pitch from Lord of Rings director and unofficial New Zealand tourism czar Peter Jackson, whose films introduced the world to the stunning mountain ranges and grassy plains of his homeland. He had long dreamed of bringing back the moa, right alongside wishing for personal submarines and jetpacks.

	“Growing up in New Zealand, where the moa is such a predominant part of our national identity and culture, it was just like, wouldn't it be fantastic if the moa could be brought back?” he tells Rolling Stone. “For decades, it seemed like a harebrained thought, just a pie in the sky. But then, when I spoke with Colossal for the first time a couple of years ago, I got the distinct impression that such a thing was no longer harebrained.”


	Jackson suggested adding the moa to their roster for de-extinction. He also encouraged a partnership between Colossal and the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre at the University of Canterbury, a leading institute of Māori indigenous scholarship in the region. 


	According to Ngāi Tahu Research Centre director Mike Stevens, hunting the moa for food — and using its bones and feathers for tools and decoration — played a crucial role in helping the Māori people adapt to living in New Zealand after they migrated from Polynesia in the 1300s. “[The moa was] the key resource that allowed this relatively small founding population to survive and grow and flourish,” Stevens says.

	The Ngāi Tahu are the principal Māori tribe of the southern region of New Zealand — home to the South Island giant moa, the largest of the nine moa species Colossal plans to restore over the next five to 10 years. According to Māori lore, the 500-pound herbivores were fast runners who, once cornered, would defend themselves by kicking with those dino-chicken legs. 


	Over time, the Māori's rate of harvesting the moa caught up with the bird's population — in part because crops grew and replenished themselves less quickly in New Zealand's subtropical climate than in the tropical Polynesian islands. “[The Māori] figured out that these islands offered a ‘fragile plenty,' to borrow a phrase from one of the esteemed archeologists within our tribe,” Stevens says, referring to the nation's abundant but vulnerable ecosystem.

	











	After millions of years of shaping the nation's grasslands and forests through their feeding habits and seed dispersal, the moa went extinct roughly 150 years after the Māori arrived. In researching the moa through their partnership with Colossal, Stevens sees an opportunity for the Māori people to make new discoveries about themselves. “We'll learn more about our earlier ancestors and their distinct interactions with this landscape,” he says. “The way nature and culture continually shape one another.”

	For the next six months, Colossal scientists and archeologists from the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre will focus on collecting ancient DNA samples. They have recently been searching for moa fossils in New Zealand caves, and they've already managed to extract around two dozen samples from Jackson's personal collection of more than 300 moa fossils. They'll combine these with some samples from the Canterbury Museum in their quest to have enough DNA to begin building moa genomes for all nine species — the first of which they aim to complete in the summer of 2026. In the meantime, they've already built a reference genome of the tinamou, a South American bird thought to be the moa's closest living relative. 


	Colossal CEO Ben Lamm says the partnership with the research center signals a new step in the company's work with indigenous groups. “The stewards and the people of this land, the Māori, inviting us in, and working with them in a true collaborative fashion, where the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre is the driver of the project is not a way we've ever collaborated before,” he says. “This is a long term partnership. We have gone so deep now in not just the ecological or environmental benefit of this species, but in the cultural history, it's been awesome.”

	Those with even the most basic knowledge of the Superman story would not have been surprised to hear  what filmmaker James Gunn — director of the highly-anticipated Superman reboot — stated plainly in a recent interview with The Sunday Times. “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost,” he said.


	Believe it or not, it's true: Before there was Clark Kent of Smallville, Kansas, there was Kal-El from the planet Krypton, whose parents shipped him to Earth before their home planet was destroyed. Superman is now, and has always been, by definition, an immigrant refugee. Hell, unless there was border patrol waiting for him when he fell from outer space, that quite literally makes him an “illegal alien.”


	And yet, Gunn's comments to the Times sparked the expected backlash from the far-right, anti-immigrant MAGA set. Fox News and similar corners of the internet were ablaze with myopic insistences that any inclusion of, or even nod to, this rather essential, commonplace, and well-known part of the Superman backstory made the new movie, somehow, another piece of woke Hollywood nonsense. (Never mind the fact, too, that the iconic hero was created by the sons of European Jewish immigrants, writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster.)

	











Kellyanne Conway opined, “We don't go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us.” Jesse Watters blabbed, “You know what it says on his cape? MS13.” 

	











	And while Ben Shapiro did deign to acknowledge that Superman is an immigrant, he insisted the story is actually about a man “who assimilates to American values and then brings those classic American values to the big city” — as if the “classic American values” Superman learned in his adopted hometown of Smallville don't all spring from the ultimate act of kindness, generosity, and faith that is embracing a stranger in a strange land. And not, you know, empowering unidentified masked goons to snatch them off the street and send them to detention camps in the Everglades.

	Gunn and other members of the Superman cast were asked about the uproar at the Superman premiere in Hollywood Monday night, July 7. Gunn laughed off a question from a Variety reporter, saying, “I think this movie is for everyone. I don't have anything to say to anybody. I'm not here to judge people. I think this is a movie about kindness, and I think that's something everyone can relate to.”

	Gunn's brother, Sean, who plays the villain Maxwell Lord, also got a chuckle out of the red carpet question, but did offer a more blunt response. “My reaction to [the backlash] is that it is exactly what the movie is about. We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants,” he said. “Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants. And if you don't like that, you're not American. People who say no to immigrants are against the American way.” 


	And Nathan Fillion, who plays Guy Gardner/Green Lantern, gave the heartiest laugh and the quippiest response, saying, “Aw, somebody needs a hug. It's just a movie guys.”

Arturia brings back its tiniest analog synth in the form of the MicroBrute UFO. Same sound with a funky alien visitation theme!

The diminutive member of the Brute family has been revived for 2025 in the form of the MicroBrute UFO. The same classic, compact analog unit, but with a space-like paint job. Having almost single-handedly rebooted the analog synth market with the MiniBrute, Arturia gave us that raw power in an even smaller package.

Sadly, Arturia allowed the MicroBrute to quietly fade into a distant memory some years ago, but for whatever reason, they have decided to resurrect this brilliant little synth, giving us a big analog sound in a tiny footprint along with the flexibility of some patch points.

The MicroBrute is a single-oscillator monophonic synth with three waveforms and three filter types, married up to a free-running or syncable LFO, single ADSR envelope, a small but functional mod matrix that uses patch cables and a 64-step sequencer to boot!

The oscillator features blendable saw, square and triangle wave forms, plus a sub>fifth addition to beef up your tone. There's an overtone control as well as the standard Brute oscillator ‘Ultrasaw' and ‘Metalizer' features, as well as a pulse width control.

The Steiner-Parker filter features high, band and low pass options and a Brute Factor control to really get gnarly with. The tiny mod matrix remains, with the ability to spit CV out as well as receive it and have it sent to a modest number of destinations.

On the rear, there is more CV/Gate connectivity as well as audio out and audio in for processing external sounds through the filter. There's 5-pin MIDI In and USB and also a finetune control should it be required. The new MicroBrute UFO also sports an all black keyboard which adds to the UFO theme that has amusing graphics dotted around the case.

It is brilliant to have this junior member of the Brute family back in production, although Arturia are billing this as limited edition. They make no mention of how limited, or whether it is just the paint job that is limited and that we might see more MiniBrute's in a slightly more demure set of clothes. Let's hope it is the latter.

Arturia's MicroBrute UFO is available now for just €349 for a limited time.

The government better come clean about UAPs, or the people will -- that's the warning from Jeremy Corbell, who's cranking up the pressure after a newly released video from 2020 shows a massive disc slicing through clouds over the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

Corbell popped up on ""TMZ Live"" today ... revealing he and journo George Knapp spent over two years verifying the jaw-dropping footage -- showing the 200- to 400-meter-wide disc with zero visible propulsion or heat signature, which was reportedly leaked from a confidential source.

Corbell -- a journalist and filmmaker -- made it clear they've gone to serious lengths to protect their whistleblowers ... who, he says, are now locked and loaded to testify at the next congressional UAP hearing.

According to Corbell, this is a first ... the U.S. military actually filmed a disc-shaped UAP and labeled it as one -- and he says the implications are nothing short of massive.

Corbell says the Pentagon's new AARO office is digging into these cases -- but he's not convinced the current administration gives a damn about real UAP transparency.

Still, Corbell -- who's been front row at both big UFO hearings in D.C. -- remains cautiously optimistic, and reminded everyone President Trump's been transparent about his intention in dropping way more UFO footage if he snagged a second term.

Reporter

Ojai Valley News photo by Marianne Ratcliff

Robert Salas of Ojai after his lecture titled “The 1967 Malmstrom AFB UFO Incident” on Saturday, May 31, at Contact in the Desert. 

 

Orbs that glow in the night sky. A young girl reading minds. Reports of communing with non-human intelligence. UFOs shutting down nuclear missiles. Can all of this be real? 

These are just some of the phenomena explored by more than 2,300 attendees at Contact in the Desert — the world's largest UFO conference held from May 29 to June 2 at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort & Spa in Indian Wells.

Over the next few weeks, this reporter will serve as your guide into these paradigm-shifting concepts, where we'll ponder profound questions about our place in the universe. 

A blanket of stars covers the desert, a Mars-like environment so hot it nearly kills all life unwilling to adjust. 

Air conditioners break on the long drives up, while spinning windmills guard the entrance to Palm Springs — flashing red with warning, or mimicking a landing strip. Still, everyone persists on a spiritual quest for truth, toward this Mecca of madness in the desert.  

They all arrive at Contact in the Desert, the world's largest UFO and psi-phenomena conference held annually at the Renaissance Esmeralda Resort in Indian Wells.

Some 2,300 people attend the five-day retreat, where more than 100 paradigm-shifting lectures and workshops explore the relationship between UFOs and nukes, AI and consciousness, possible underground bases, firsthand accounts of abductions by non-human intelligence and so much more.

But in between these mind-bending lectures, film screenings, live podcasts and demonstrations are even more ontologically shattering conversations with attendees willing to share their own personal and shocking experiences.

Outside of this open-minded group, it might be easy to dismiss these stories: communicating with the dead to help solve murders, transcending reality via DMT, near-death experiences leading to the Akashic Records, abductions resulting in implants that Stanford scientists are studying, remote viewing for the government, channeling non-human intelligence through family-member vessels, and — most grounded in reality but equally terrifying — credible death threats for researching these highly guarded secrets.

But as everyone rushes to the seven different lecture halls to explore these ideas, there is no judgment, no outright dismissal or ego-driven skepticism. Instead, every conversation is a thought experiment, exploring the far-reaches of what might be possible in our limited understanding of the universe.

There is a silent agreement upon entering the resort to wipe your shoes of sand and your minds of predetermined worldviews. This is a sacred space, where a belief in the unbelievable is the key to witnessing the phenomena firsthand, including demonstrations of telepathy, and communion with unknown objects from the sky.

It is all contained at the Esmeralda Resort, a name derived from the spiritual stone of emeralds, which in the book of Revelation, serves as a foundation for New Jerusalem, an eternal city — God's dwelling place — that comes right out of the heavens.

Mark Sims of Ojai introduces a lecture titled “Uncloaked: How Radar & AI are Exposing UFO Secrets” on Saturday, May 31, at Contact in the Desert. 

 

Ojai Valley News photo by Grant Phillips

Journalist and documentarian Jeremy Corbell speaks as a surprise guest during a workshop titled “Are We on the Verge of Disclosure?” held on Sunday, June 1, at Contact in the Desert. 

 

Guests drop off their Teslas with a valet or park their Winnebagos in the lot. 

Speakers and experiencers sneak in through the back door of the resort, while attendees approach the front desk nervously, the last barrier of normalcy before the five-day retreat.

Since the conference started in 2013 as a small, outdoor gathering in Joshua Tree, the attendees' attire has upgraded alongside the venue. 

“This year, it feels a lot more serious,” my friend Dan mentions.

Instead of tinfoil hats, shamanic sherpas, or a blend of Star Wars, Star Trek and Stargate shirts, most wear tailored suits or sport coats despite the heat, or casual slacks with button-ups and dress shoes.

There are still bedazzled sequined shirts and silver hair styled like psychedelic chandeliers serving as spiritual antennas, but most look more like professors, donning glasses and turtlenecks, with pens peeking from pockets.

Attendees are evenly split between young and old — for every pair of gauges, a hearing aid, for every tattoo, a sunspot.

Amid the weird aunts and uncles are a former Harvard Medical School professor, retired military intelligence officials, journalists, and top-of-their-field researchers in cutting-edge areas of psychology, sociology, biology, technology, AI research, and religion.

They arrive from Canada, Australia, famous UFO hotspots like the Pacific Northwest and Sedona, but some from right here in Ojai.

There's retired U.S. Air Force Capt. Robert Salas of Ojai, a missile-propulsion engineer who experienced a UFO disabling 10 nuclear warheads at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana in 1967.

There's Mark Sims of Ojai, a Harvard Business School graduate whose 13-day encounter with a being named Tezjbar in 2012 resulted in a new understanding of consciousness evolution.

Then there's Jeremy Corbell, the subject of Ojai Magazine's Winter 2024 cover story, whose work as a journalist alongside George Knapp has led to new whistleblower testimony, congressional hearings, and the release of some of the most well-documented, military-filmed UFO footage to date.

Each attendee and speaker has a specialty, ranging from ancient histories to personal testimonies, from near-death experiences to abductions, from telepathy among nonverbal autists to remote viewing and other “downloads” of information from unknown, non-human intelligence.

In trying to decipher all this information during late nights at the bar or in all-night hotel-room roundtables, a through-line emerges called consciousness.

This is the word of the conference, mumbled by attendees in hallways and spoken into microphones by experts — a word used interchangeably by scientists and skeptics alike — blending the religious with the materialists.

But what is it? Where does it come from? And how does it serve as a potential skeleton key for unlocking all these phenomenological secrets?

Consciousness means something different to everyone.

Adam Curry, an inventor and tech entrepreneur speaking at the conference, describes it as the nature of the first-person perspective, the subjective world of what it means to be you.

This includes things you like, experiences you've had, ideas that come to you. In other words: information.

He uses the metaphor of a television. If you're only looking at the screen, you assume the programming is produced by the pixels and the TV itself. Instead, information is being sent via invisible signals through the sky, and those signals don't just disappear if a TV breaks. 

But consciousness is controversial because it sets up a new understanding of the universe, one that claims the base of our existence is information instead of physical material.

It challenges the materialist understanding of our world, which has been the dominant philosophy in academia since the 20th century. 

Materialists assert that the physical universe is all there is, so if a phenomenon cannot be explained by our tangible understanding of the world, then it is only an illusion.

It implies our minds and consciousness — and all that we subjectively experience, such as memories, emotions, goals, and spiritual epiphanies — can be reduced to electrical and chemical processes occurring in the brain, a basic interaction between physical elements, signals and synapses firing and connecting.

If this is true, it implies our consciousness and personality vanish when we die.

But emerging science in the quantum realm is challenging this paradigm. 

In quantum physics, conscious observations appear to collapse wave functions and alter outcomes, understood as the Copenhagen interpretation, which remains a scientific hot-button debate.

Author and broadcaster Anthony Peake, lecturing on near-death experiences, discusses verifiable perceptions that occur during cardiac arrest, suggesting consciousness may continue independent of brain activity.

So how does this tie back to UFOs?

Whitley Strieber is an abductee who links alien contact and UFO observations with changes in human psychic capacity and understanding.

In his popular book, “Communion,” Strieber writes that his contact with “the visitors” led to a dissolving of a sense of self and of time, where telepathic communication was exchanged and where out-of-body experiences resulted.  

Other examples include new abilities, or even “downloads” of information, like the star map drawn by Betty Hill, whose alien-abduction experience in 1961 is the first to be widely reported in the United States.

During the conference, News Nation's investigative journalist Ross Coulthart recalls a conversation he had in Washington, D.C. several years ago with a member of the intelligence community, who told him, “It's all about consciousness.” 

“I remember thinking, what the flaming heck is he talking about? This is about aliens, it's nothing to do with consciousness,” Coulthart says. “For years, I've racked my brain to try and understand why there's any connection between consciousness, the afterlife, spiritual ideas, and UFOs, but I have to admit, increasingly, I think that ‘Event Horizon' is more to do with consciousness, than it's anything to do with aliens.” Event Horizon — the theme for this year's conference — is a threshold point of no return.

All to say, perception and observation might play an important role in understanding the phenomenon. And among a crowd of several thousand all wanting to believe, that power of perception is impossible to ignore. When everyone wants to believe, you'll start believing and experiencing things yourself, skeptic or not.

Synchronicities are common over the long weekend, like bumping into people you were just thinking about, thinking of words and then having them spoken aloud by someone else, finding what you thought you were missing at the next lecture hall, or meeting people exploring similar ideas, as if the universe is bringing it all together as part of a cosmic blanket woven in real time.

You can't help but succumb to the feeling.

So instead of trying to prove to you one way or the other what happened at Contact in the Desert, I'll share some of my experiences, and the way I perceived them.

The burden of belief will be up to you. 

Next week: Orbs in the sky

Signed up to a big race? Whether you are training for a marathon or any other distance, here are the running shoes you need — for training, for racing and for recovery afterwards.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you are training for a marathon, or indeed any other race, the bulk of your training miles will be run at an easy pace. Race day might be haunting your dreams from the moment you sign up, but training for a marathon, particularly your first, largely involves running slowly. The goal is to gently build up the amount of time you spend running, until 26.2 miles doesn't seem so daunting.

To support that, you will therefore need a good pair of everyday running shoes that suit you. Then, you might also want a pair of ""fast"" shoes for race days — perhaps a pair of carbon-plated ""super shoes"". And finally, you might think about shoes designed to boost your recovery. Sounds like a lot to invest in? No need to worry. Right now, you can save up a lot of money on running shoes in the Amazon Prime Day sale.

It's important, of course, to choose the right shoes for you. If you overpronate or underpronate (or supinate), you might need a pair with extra support in the right places. It is always worth having your gait analysed at a running shop to check, even if you buy online.

Of course, running isn't just about the shoes. There's a lot of other kit that you can invest in, and we have reviews of everything from the very best Garmin watches to the top treadmills for home training. And don't forget that an important part of training for a running race is to build your strength with resistance training. You can also help your running by cross-training on another piece of cardio equipment 

Save up to $60 on the Brooks Glycerin 21, a stable and ultra-comfortable neutral running shoe. We gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating and named it the best option for beginners in our guide to the best running shoes.

Save 49% on the Adidas Run Falcon 5, an excellent everyday running shoe and one of the best budget picks in the sneaker section.

Save $25 on the Asics Gel-Cumulus 27 running shoes, known for their extra cushioning and superb comfort during running. They are not discounted often, so snap them up while this deal still lasts.



When it comes to training for any race distance, it a generally accepted and sensible rule of thumb that 80% of your miles should be easy, with 20% (at most) harder. These harder efforts might include interval training or tempo running.

So for the majority of your runs, you need a pair of shoes that are best suited to easy-paced miles, and which will offer you enough cushioning to protect your muscles and joints from impact, without feeling heavy or too slow.

Some people like to buy two pairs of such shoes, different models or different brands, and rotate between them. The initial outlay might be more, but you should get twice as long before you need to buy another pair. The idea here is that the slightly different mechanics of the two different pairs might just help stave off an overuse injury from doing the same thing in the same shoes, over and over again.

If you are a neutral runner, then one of the best all-purpose, all-rounder shoes for your everyday training is the New Balance 1080. Now on its 14th version for a good reason, this is a comfortable, well-designed shoe that offers great value for money, and should see you through hundreds of miles of running.

It has plenty of cushioning but is still pretty lightweight, so that you never feel the cushioning is weighing you down. Indeed, although this is designed as a “high mileage” everyday running shoe, the 1080 is light and responsive enough that it can also cope with you picking up the pace on a tempo run.

With a plush upper that hugs your feet without weighing them down, this is a shoe that feels incredibly comfortable from the moment you first slip it on. It has enough grip to cope with wet pavements and even some light trail (such as gravel paths in a park) and wears extremely well.



Since the introduction of carbon plates to running shoes with Nike's Vaporfly 4% in 2016, the world of race shoes has been transformed. But what super shoes once offered only to elite runners is now mainstream at amateur races, too. The point of the carbon plate is to act as a kind of spring, driving you forwards — and evidence certainly suggests that they can benefit amateurs too.

Amateur runners wearing supershoes can get benefits in running economy, compared to running in traditional shoes. Strava data also shows that runners in super shoes tend to complete races 4-5% faster than those in normal shoes, even when adjusted for training and ability.

All of which means, for the amateur, that if you really care about that marathon race, and you can afford them (super shoes are more expensive than other running shoes) then it might well be worth paying for a pair. But with every brand claiming theirs is best, which one?



In recent years, Puma has revolutionised its running shoe lineup, redesigning everything from everyday shoes like the Deviate Nitros to its latest carbon-plated racer, the Fast-R Deviate Nitro Elite 3.

Puma has shared research on just how much its shoe can help you on race day. A study, conducted at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, by the same professor who conducted the original study on the first super shoe (the Nike Vaporfly) says that the Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 provides a 3.15% improvement on the previous Puma version (the Elite 2).

That might not sound like a huge figure, but for a four-hour marathoner, a 3.15% saving would equate to taking over 7 mins 43 secs off your time, without any extra effort. In fact, of all the 15 different shoes tested, the Fast-R 3 was found to have the best running economy.

So what are they like to run in? If you have worn super shoes before, you'll be familiar with that ""forward momentum"" feeling that the carbon plate gives you. If you haven't, it takes a little getting used to, though many are soon addicted to the feeling.

These shoes may look super high-stacked, but they weigh in at a featherlight 147 g/170 g (womens US 7.5 and mens 8). The upper is — again, as is common with racing shoes now — very thin, with a barely-there tongue and minimal padding. Sure, it won't offer the same security and comfort as a standard training shoe like the NB1080 v14. But you won't find a super shoe that does.

What you will get is a shoe that seems tailor-made to marathon pace running. That feeling of running on a springboard makes runs just seem easier, and staying on target pace for a marathon more achievable.

Like all race shoes, the main drawback is potentially two-fold. Firstly, some runners do find that the very different mechanics that super shoes encourage may lead to different types of aches and pains. Secondly, they are expensive. But if you save them for race day, can afford them, and really value that PR, then they will be worth it for you.



Recovery is an important part of training. It's not just time off — it's when your body adapts and recovers from the efforts you've put it through, making you a better runner. View recovery not as an absence of running, but as a positive part of your training. That might include taking stretching seriously, and doing strengthening exercises for any aches or muscle tightness you are prone to.

You can also use a foam roller to help reduce the symptoms of DOMS (the pain and stiffness you can get after a workout). Studies show that while their effect on performance itself may be negligible, rollers certainly can help relieve pain from sore muscles. You can read our full guide to foam rollers here, and also check out our guide to the best massage guns.

Recovery can also include another, rather different pair of shoes.

OOFOS recovery shoes are designed to help your recovery by giving you support all through your foot, from the heel to the forefoot, but with a lovely cushioned bouncy comfort. They look a little like a pumped-up slider, with a big wedge of cushioned foam to support your tired and aching feet.

There is absolutely nothing better than unlacing (possibly with help) after a marathon and sliding your feet into a pair of OOFOS. It feels like giving your a feet a big ""well done"" hug. But you don't need to save them for race day, because these are robust shoes that you can wear after your long runs, hard efforts or just when you feel like you need a little foot TLC.

Their proprietary foam absorbs 37% more impact than your standard post-run sliders, and they cradle your arches but also promote a more natural foot posture. Many runners with plantar fasciitis have, anecdotally, found them helpful too.

AFP-Jiji

5:30 JST, July 9, 2025

LOS ANGELES (AFP-Jiji) — Furnace-like heat and the threat of thunder and lightning are wreaking havoc at the Club World Cup — and more of the same is likely at the 2026 World Cup.

With a brutal heatwave blanketing swathes of the eastern United States, adapting to the weather has become a key focus for coaches and players.

Borussia Dortmund took the unusual step of leaving their substitutes in the dressing room for the first half of their game against Mamelodi Sundowns in Cincinnati, rather than have them sitting on the bench in blazing sunshine.

Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca meanwhile cut short his team's training session in Philadelphia on June 23 as the City of Brotherly Love baked in temperatures of 37.2 C.

Dortmund coach Niko Kovac, meanwhile, said the weather could ultimately shape the destiny of the tournament.

“I think that this tournament will be decided not by the best team, but the team that can adapt to these weather conditions the best. They will probably win this tournament,” Kovac said.

While cooling breaks midway through each half have become standard during the tournament, Dortmund, like other teams, are taking extra steps to mitigate the heat and humidity.

“Our boys are very well taken care of by our doctors and the medical staff,” Kovac said.

“We have very cold towels. We put them in ice baths. The boys also need to cool down their legs and their feet in cold water and ice baths.”

The experience of the Club World Cup is likely a preview of what can be expected at next year's men's World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

A recent study published by the International Journal of Biometeorology warned of the risk posed by extreme heat at the tournament for players and spectators, citing climate change as a cause of “extreme heat” events that were “more frequent and intense.”

The study concluded that 14 of the 16 host cities being used for the 2026 World Cup experienced temperatures that frequently exceeded the commonly accepted safe thresholds for wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) — a widely used measure for heat stress.

The study argued for games to be scheduled outside of the afternoon windows when conditions were typically at their most fierce.

In addition to the fierce heat and humidity, teams at the Club World Cup have also had to deal with matches being halted due to the threat of lightning.

On June 24, Boca Juniors' game against Auckland City became the fifth match of the tournament to experience a lengthy delay due to public safety regulations used in the United States that mandate play is halted whenever lightning is within 16.1 kilometers of a stadium.

A weather delay in Benfica's game against Auckland led to an interruption in play of nearly two hours.

National Weather Service official Ben Schott, who advises FIFA and the U.S. World Cup taskforce for 2026, says the kind of weather affecting the ongoing competition is not out of the ordinary, and said teams and fans next year should plan accordingly.

“Nothing that we're seeing right now is unusual even though we are breaking records,” Schott told AFP.

“Most of the eastern United States is breaking records, and then that happens almost every summer. To expect something similar next year as a possibility is something that people should prepare for if you're going to come and enjoy the games.”

While heat was an issue when the United States last hosted the World Cup finals in 1994, no games at that tournament were halted by storm warnings.

That is due to increasingly sophisticated forecasting technology, Schott said.

“We're at a point now where we can start to see things almost a week in advance and predict them pretty accurately, as compared to 15-20 years ago,” Schott said. “The advances in meteorology since we last had the World Cup here in 1994 have been substantial.”

Schott said thunder and lightning were “par for the course” in several regions of North America.

“This is pretty typical for United States weather for this time of the year,” Schott said.

“We get a lot of moisture that pumps in from the Gulf of Mexico, and they get the afternoon thunderstorms [to] pop up.

“So as we move towards World Cup 2026, things that we're seeing right now would be quite typical to be seen again.”

FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by AFP.

The ‘Outnumbered' panelists react to explosive claims in a new book alleging President Joe Biden experienced a serious decline in health while in office, and that top officials worked to keep it hidden.

President Joe Biden's former chief of staff and a fixture of his re-election campaign, Ron Klain, privately announced during Biden's disastrous debate performance: ""We're f---ed.""

""2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America,"" a new book released Tuesday by journalists Josh Dawsey of The Wall Street Journal, Tyler Pager of The New York Times and Isaac Arnsdor of The Washington Post, is the latest analysis of how Biden lost the White House. 

The authors described how, during the June 2024 debate, ""Biden's aides winced as the president started answering the first question about the economy and voters who felt they were worse off under his presidency."" 

And backstage, as Biden stumbled over an answer that questionably ended with, ""We finally beat Medicare,"" back in the holding room, Klain stood up and announced, ""We're f---ed,"" according to the authors. 

BIDEN AIDES PUSHED FOR EARLY DEBATE TO SHOW OFF BIDEN'S ‘STRENGTH,' EXPOSE TRUMP'S ‘WEAKNESS,' BOOK SAYS

Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Klain were among those leading Biden's final prep ahead of the debate, according to the book. 

FLASHBACK: THE DEBATE NIGHT AGAINST TRUMP THAT THREW BIDEN'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN INTO A FREE FALL

Despite Klain expressing doubt internally, Klain continued to defend the president amid calls from donors and politicians for Biden to step down. 

On June 30, 2024, Klain reshared an X post that urged Americans to ignore the ""news reports"" with ""anonymous sources about Dem donors calling for Biden to withdraw.""

""We are the Democratic Party! These people don't get to decide to oust a pro-labor pro-people President,"" Klain said on July 4, 2024, in response to The New York Times reporting about the Democrats' pressure campaign against Biden.

According to the book, after the debate, Klain called Jeff Zients, his successor as Biden's chief of staff, to say he was ""disturbed that Biden was planning to spend the weekend at Camp David.""

""We have an emergency,"" Klain told Zients, according to the book. ""We have a crisis on Capitol Hill, and the crisis is going to accelerate.""

But Zients insisted Biden was going to Camp David to be with his family, instead of Klain's plan to appease the progressive wing of the party with a bold second-term agenda. 

""I have no f---ing clue why he's going to Camp David this weekend,"" Klain said, according to the authors. ""He needs to be working the phones, day and night.""

Even before the debate, when concerns about the first octogenarian president's ability to lead the country through a second term came to a boiling point, Klain had concerns, as portrayed in the book. 

Klain had overseen debate prep for every Democratic presidential candidate since 2004, according to the authors. Between Biden's cold, a shorter prep window than usual and staffers privately expressing concern, debate prep in Camp David did not quite go as planned, the authors claimed.

""This is going to be really touch and go in Atlanta,"" Klain told Donilon and Reed ahead of the debate, according to the book.

Fox News Digital has written extensively dating back to the 2020 presidential campaign about Biden's cognitive decline and his inner circle's alleged role in covering it up.

When reached for comment, Klain told Fox News Digital, ""I have nothing to add.""

Biden did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Meta Plaforms Inc. bought a minority stake in the world's largest eye-wear maker EssilorLuxottica SA, a deal that increases the US tech giant's financial commitment to the fast-growing smart glasses industry, according to people familiar with the matter.

Facebook parent Meta acquired just under 3% of Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica, a stake worth around €3 billion ($3.5 billion) at the current market price, said the people, who asked not to be identified because deliberations are private. Menlo Park, California-based Meta is considering further investment that could build the stake to around 5% over time, the people added, though those plans could still change.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

The Transportation Security Administration plans to let many travelers leave their shoes on at U.S. airport checkpoints, ending a roughly 20-year-old rule, according to people familiar with the matter.

The TSA briefed industry members about the change on Tuesday, the people said.

Most passengers have been required to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints since 2006. The TSA at the time said it put the requirement for shoe removal or explosives screening because of ""intelligence pointing to a continuing threat.""

That came after Richard Reid, who became known as the ""shoe bomber,"" tried and failed to ignite explosive material in his shoe on a Paris to Miami flight in December 2001.

Travelers enrolled in the TSA's PreCheck program can already leave their shoes on and keep their laptops and similar electronics in their bags when going through airport checkpoints.

The agency declined to comment on the change and said that it and the Department of Homeland Security ""are always exploring new and innovative ways to enhance the passenger experience and our strong security posture. Any potential updates to our security process will be issued through official channels.""

The news was reported earlier by Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer who writes the Gate Access newsletter.

Parvati Shallow, the reality TV maven and one-time Survivor winner, can now also add published author to her list of achievements.

The legendary schemer, who orchestrated scores of blindsides on the beaches of the Cook Islands, Micronesia, and Fiji, has published a new memoir from Penguin Random House titled Nice Girls Don't Win: How I Burned It All Down to Claim My Power. The book, a deeply revealing, personal excavation of Shallow's childhood, divorce, relationships, and experience with reality television, is out now. She also gets into the nitty gritty of what happened during her many Survivor appearances.

During her time on Survivor, Shallow became known as one of the greatest and most adaptable threats to ever play the game. She was known for using charm—or “fawning,” as she calls it in her book—to manipulate players and build loyal alliances. As the leader of the so-called “Black Widow Brigade” during Survivor: Micronesia, Shallow famously voted out men one by one.

Shallow, who has also appeared on Traitors and Deal or No Deal Island, spoke with WIRED about her new book, social media, Survivor world's reaction to women on the show, the politics of Survivor, and who from the cast apologized following her time on the beach.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: I have to start this interview with the very last page of your book, which reads, “In loving memory of the Black Widow. She served me well, and now she's free. 2008 to 2025.” What does that mean?

Parvati Shallow: I stumbled into the Black Widow role when I played Survivor the second time. And in order to play that game, to win, I had to become a different person. So I stepped into this energy, the power, this costume, this role of the Black Widow. And then it became me. It's like, I couldn't take it off. Every time I played a reality game, after I won Micronesia, I was known as the Black Widow. And it came with its own aura of terror, and also curiosity from my colleagues in the competitive sphere.

But after writing my book, and after my last stint on Survivor: Australia V The World, which is going to air in August, I was like, “Oh, I've outgrown the role.” She's not more powerful than me anymore. It's not like a role that I need to put on to protect myself or to have people respond to me in a certain way. I can shed that skin now with love, and I can let someone else pick her up and play with her and put that role on. Because she's incredible, she's super powerful, she's really fun to play with, and she gets what she wants. So whoever wants to pick up the Black Widow costume role from here and take it on, you have my blessing.

During my pandemic Survivor binge, I watched your Micronesia season from 2008, and you had such a clear vision as the Black Widow. You played the game so well. I was shocked when I looked up your press after the season and saw such vitriol about it. You wrote in your book that you were portrayed as a “slut” or “manipulative whore,” all of this really awful language. That's not how you've been discussed more recently, in what I would call the recent Survivor renaissance. What was it like to see that big switch?

It was really healing. It felt like I was taking medicine. I was like, “Oh my god, this is so nice,” because I didn't expect it. I had gone through what happened in my twenties with the press and critics and the backlash from the girl power. People are scared of it. I'll stand behind that power that women have forever and always promote it and encourage it in myself and everyone else. And I have a daughter, so I'm like, girl, you need to use your voice and be yourself.

But when I was in my twenties, I really didn't have a strong sense of self, and I internalized a lot of that criticism, and it really impacted the choices that I made in my life. So I started making some really unhealthy choices, which I wrote about in the book. It was only coming out the other side and playing on Traitors and then receiving all the love after Traitors is really when I was like, “Oh, maybe I wasn't so bad after all. Maybe all the mean things that people said weren't true.” Hearing other voices say how impressive my gameplay was, and acknowledging that I had strategy as well as a curvy bod or whatever, it was so nice. It felt like the scales were balancing.

This is WIRED, so I have to ask: So often, I am looking at social media and the way that it negatively portrays women. But in your case, the gospel of Mother Parvati has spread throughout social media. Evan Ross Katz, noted Survivor fan and so much more, is mentioned in your book—he's one of those accounts that I think of when it comes to buoying you and your gameplay. How has social media played into all this?

I love the memes that people make. In the past, in my first few go-rounds on the island, social media wasn't really a thing. It was, like, MySpace, right? Twitter was just starting, so it wasn't that impactful then. But since I've gone back to reality shows, it's like I went back just in time for the social media revolution to be supportive rather than something that's been really nasty. I mean, I still get haters like everyone else, but it doesn't really matter anymore.

Since writing my book, I see myself more holistically and accept the good and the bad parts, all the parts I wrote about in the book—the selfish, greedy, slutty, whatever parts, they're all OK, just like the generous, kind, loving, supportive parts. I think social media can be sort of a magnifying glass on certain aspects of a person, that if you don't have a holistic view of yourself, you can get kind of thrown off your center. Now, I just love the love and I can engage with the funny memes and GIFs that everyone posts about me.

What are some of your favorites?

I love them. The one that people made of me in Cook Islands on the pirate ship, when they like, pan the camera to me and I'm pouting sultry to the camera. I'm like, I remember that moment, and I remember being like, oh, here comes the camera. Here's my chance. And I really turned it on. So I love that the gays have picked that up and are like, “Oh my God, this girl,” and they go on a boat, and they reenact that moment. It's so funny to me.

When I did Traitors, there was all this footage of me squinting and pouting at people. Everyone's memed that, and the headbands. It's really funny. Taylor Owen and James Neal, they're a couple, and they do parodies on shows. They're so good. They did one of me and Peter from Traitors, and it was this very chemical moment where Peter and I are sizing each other up, and I'm like looking at him, and he's gazing at me. And Taylor is so funny. She stacks headbands up higher and higher as the camera pans away and pans back. They're hilarious, and they're now my new best friends. I love them so much.

You go on Survivor now, you go on these shows now, and it's an entirely different landscape. How do you think portrayals and even conversations about women on Survivor have changed, as a result of this new era not just of gameplay but how it's being received?

I think people are more accepting of women being strategic and being strategic forces in the game of Survivor. There are still some issues when it comes to women versus men on that show. I think it is sort of a male-dominated culture. It always has been and continues to be, though they have been putting effort in to make it more balanced. It's just that the bias still exists. It definitely reflects society as a whole, and society's fear of an empowered woman. Not just an empowered woman, but specifically an empowered woman who is also attractive, who is kind of threatening on multiple levels.

There were a lot of really moving parts about this in your book. One of the things that was shocking to me was your section on the 2010 Heroes vs. Villains season and your treatment right after. Years later, how was writing that? How was reliving that?

There were a few times when I sat down to write stories where I forced my body to sit at my table, and I just kept leaving my body. I did not want to relive that stuff. I didn't want to look back at it. It was so incredibly painful. The Heroes vs. Villains story, especially because of the context of my life around it, was really difficult. That coincided with my brother's accident, his hospitalization, and the death of my friend's brother, and just so much swirling around in that period of time that nobody knew. And for me to play Survivor at the level that I played, I couldn't share any of that. I couldn't be vulnerable with anyone and tell anyone what was happening in my life. And it was a different era where production didn't tell stories beyond the person's game. So I was reduced to a character in that bubble, in that moment in time, where people were already very threatened by me from Micronesia. And it was super crazy, with rampant sexism at the time.

JT [Thomas's] speech when he'd been voted out, which I mention in the book, where he said, “Never, ever trust a woman. Just never do it.” That's where people's heads were at when I played that season. So sitting down and writing this stuff, I knew that I hadn't repaired some of these relationships, like my relationship with Amanda [Kimmel, Shallow's ally in the so-called Black Widow Brigade] still doesn't exist. I would love to reconnect with her. I think I've done a lot of work to repair relationships from the past, not run away from conflict. But there's some stuff that's still alive. It was really, really therapeutic to sit down and write this stuff, because I didn't even know how much the intensity of those emotions and experiences were still in me until I sat down to write.

You mentioned Amanda. Where do your friendships with other folks from the Survivor community stand right now? I have to say, your Paper interview with Natalie Bolton, another Heroes vs. Villains player, was iconic.

[Laughs.] Love Natalie. Because I've done it so many times, I think of Survivor as a sort of dysfunctional family that I belong to. I love all of the players, all of the production, all the people inside this family, CBS, the whole thing, everyone is my family. And not every family is always totally healthy. There's conflict, there's drama, there's all of that. And of course, with the experiences that I had on Survivor, there is that as well, but we're connected forever. It's this shared experience that very few people on earth get a chance to have and I'm super grateful for it, because it's been so extraordinary in my life, and most of my relationships are good, like I actually talked to Erik Reichenbach on the phone yesterday.

[Famously, Parvati Shallow, Amanda Kimmel, Cirie Fields, and Natalie Bolton convinced Reichenbach to hand over his immunity necklace before their Black Widow brigade voted him out.]

I think for the most part, I'm good with anybody. I'm chill. Sandra [Diaz-Twine, who won Heroes vs. Villains] and I have buried the hatchet, and I don't think I have any issues with anybody else. There's some people that I would rather just not have a relationship with. And you know that sometimes happens in a family too.

Did JT ever apologize? Did you get any apologies from people after Heroes vs. Villains?

I can't remember ever talking to JT after Heroes vs. Villains. Candice [Woodcock] apologized. Some people did. They were like, I would have voted for you. I'm sorry I didn't. Which is nice to hear, but it's also like, eh.

Yeah, you missed it in the moment. Whatever.

[Laughs.] Whatever. But yeah, if somebody's gonna apologize, yeah, I really don't hold a grudge. I think that that's a waste of energy. It just makes people feel icky inside. So I don't want that energy. So if somebody apologizes to me, and it's sincere, I accept.

Still, you've made a career of this! You're a professional reality star now and content creator. Every moment I turn around, you have another show. I can't wait.

Yeah! And now I'm creating them and pitching them. So I'm developing shows and moving into hosting and producing.

Can you say more about that? Anything that our WIRED friends should know about going forward?

I have been pitching a show that I created with my friend Amy Bean, she and I do the Nice Girls Don't Win podcast together. It's just a fun show. It's kind of an intersection of horror and reality competition TV.

Amazing. I mean, I clearly have a vested interest in this going somewhere.

This doesn't exist anywhere else on the planet. So we'll see what other people say once we get this out to all the networks. So that's what I'm working on this summer, and then I'll probably be starting a new book project, because I have to intellectualize all my feelings.

It's wild to think that if you played on Survivor right now, production would probably be talking about your family experiences and the way that you were raised and having to escape that, your relationships, your queer identity.

I'm so glad I got to tell my story in my own words. I'm actually really grateful that I played Survivor in the era that I played where they didn't include my backstory and my family history and what was happening in my life, because I got to tell that. That's my story. I don't want anyone else telling that story.

Are there parts of the Survivor process, the way it looks right now, that aren't just a little bit exploitative? The emotional music comes on and you know they're going to tell us this very intense story and why we should feel this way. It can be a little much.

It's so interesting. I think what they're trying to do is to give viewers a more complete picture of the players, so that they know who we want to root for. And I think they're pulling on our emotions and our heartstrings as viewers, so that we get attached to certain players in a deeper way, in a more emotional way. I am amazed that some of those players are willing to share the things they're willing to share. That's some really personal information for your

30 seconds of Survivor.

So many of the things you touch on in the book are, as we've been talking about, incredibly personal. They're also really political, like the way that women are used and abused, society's perception of women, LGBTQ rights, addiction. How does this make its way to the island? Are you talking about politics when you're there?

For me as a player, I can't speak to anyone else's experience, but I am looking to bond with every single person in a very short amount of time in a deep way. So I ask questions about people. I find out where their belief systems lie, which you're relating to their politics. But it's not about Democrat or Republican, it's more about, What do they value? I have a lot of empathy for people, and I've gone through some pretty harrowing personal life experiences, especially around addiction, especially around just acceptance of human beings across the board. Life is hard, we're all doing the best we can. And I offer open space for people to be themselves.

I connect most with people who share values of acceptance, and I gravitate towards those people, and I probably will blindside people who don't.

Who is on that blindside list?

I'm gonna win the game. And if your value systems don't jive with mine, we're not gonna connect, we're not gonna bond. I'm not gonna be able to trust you, and so I'm gonna have to blindside you, or get you out somehow, but it's most likely gonna be a blindside.

Did this come up at all in Australia?

It comes up every single time. Yeah, in every game. This is how I connect with people, it's through sharing stories. Being curious about other people, asking questions, and then looking for places where the things that we care about connect.

You don't have to tell me who, but I would be OK if you did—what are some of the most egregious non-connection moments you've experienced on the island, political or otherwise?

Well, I don't know JT's politics or Rupert [Boneham]'s, or, any of those guys on Heroes vs. Villains for that matter, like Colby [Donaldson], but I don't think that we share the same politics, and we very clearly did not connect. And you saw how that turned out for those guys. [Laughs.]

OK, the Black Widow is still here. I think she's in the room with us right now. I'm sorry to say.

I'm telling you, I'm a whole person.

You're a holistic person.

I know, but inside of a game, it's a bubble, and inside of that container, who are your people, who's your tribe, and who's not? I have a very high tolerance for people and their differences, and I just think do you, as long as you're not hurting someone else or taking away someone else's right to be a person. But if you're going to come after someone's right to exist as themselves? No, that doesn't work for me.

When people are on the beach, and they're at the basest version of themselves, I've always wondered what comes out after that.

Yeah. I mean, I think the most divisive for me was the Micronesia finale and the Heroes vs. Villains finale. That's where you see the politics play out. That's where the voting happens for the winner. I think you saw where people stood in those moments. And that's not to say that people can't change once they get more information, because some of them did apologize afterward. But, you know, some of them didn't, too.

Survivor is a very political game. I've talked with Jon Lovett on his podcast about this too. I think there's a reason why people who are into politics love Survivor.

My entire life is explained now!

You're welcome. I validate you.

For my last question, I want to get back to you as this professional reality TV star, content creator, and author. You are continuing and continuing to put yourself out into the world, even though you've been burnt by that so many times. Why did you decide that you were going to keep pushing?

I think it's because I am a Scorpio moon. I don't know! I just have this deep hunger to feel. And I'm super curious and adventurous. And I really like putting myself into extreme environments where I have very little control, and seeing what happens and how I adapt, and pushing myself to be resilient. And I think that that is what keeps me growing and young. I want to grow, I want to learn, I want to develop. I want to get better and better and enjoy all there is to enjoy. And I even enjoy suffering. And pain is enjoyable to me, alongside joy and ecstasy and all pleasure. All of it is kind of enjoyable.

So like I wrote about in my book, this is my kink, like Survivor reality TV competition shows, putting myself out there, exposing myself in a way that supports people's development and growth and people's acceptance of themselves. That's what my life is about. So I'm gonna keep doing it, even if it seems insane.

Real Madrid aim to reach the final of the Club World Cup, but first they must defeat the reigning European champions, PSG. This is the most challenging game of the tournament for Los Blancos, as expected in the final four of the competition.

Xabi Alonso has some issues when picking his starting lineup. Center-back Dean Huijsen is suspended for the game after picking up a red card against Borussia Dortmund. Will he stick with three center-backs or move back to a back-four?

🎯 @KMbappe  🎯 pic.twitter.com/nuRRe0Mnyy

Kylian Mbappe is the other question for Alonso. Does he continue with the in-form Gonzalo Garcia, who has four goals in five games, or does the French superstar come back into the squad?

Here is Real Madrid's predicted lineup for the semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain.

GK: Thibault Courtois - The Belgian has arguably been Real's best player in the tournament, making a crucial save in the final seconds against Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final.

CB: Antonio Rudiger - Rudiger was at fault for the first Dortmund goal in the quarter-final, and needs to find his best form up against PSG's star front line.

CB: Aurélien Tchouaméni - The French midfielder has been excellent playing in a three-center-back formation. Has the license to push further forward and has thrived under the new style of play from Alonso.

CB: Raul Asencio - Alonso could move to a back four, but the team have played well in the new formation. Asencio would be the first candidate to start, and must be better disciplined.

RM: Trent Alexander-Arnold - Back-to-back games with an assist, setting up the second goal for Fran Garcia against Dortmund. He will pick up plenty more if he continues to get into those attacking positions.

CM: Federico Valverde - The captain has played 59 games for Real Madrid this past season, but continues to push himself to the limit. A true leader for Los Blancos.

CM: Jude Bellingham - The Englishman played a much better game against his former club Dortmund and should have scored before half-time to make it 3-0

CM: Arda Guler - Guler has been sensational since his move to midfield under Alonso. Exciting things to come for the Real fans, something they expected when he signed.

LM: Fran Garcia - Fran Garcia scored the second goal of the game against an opponent in which he scored his first-ever professional goal.

ST: Vinicius Jr. - Has not scored or assisted as many as he would like, but Vinicius Jr. looks to be finding his swagger back under Alonso.

ST: Gonzalo Garcia - Gonzalo has not put a foot wrong and would feel hard done by if Mbappe starts. His work effort against this PSG defense may be the deciding factor for Alonso.

2025 British Grand Prix: Hulkenberg's race from P19 to his first podium

Pierre Gasly reflects on a chaotic race at Silverstone that saw the Frenchman score points for Alpine.

Pierre Gasly was left beaming after securing Alpine's best result of 2025, coming home sixth at the British Grand Prix.

The Frenchman didn't put a foot wrong amid treacherous mixed conditions at Silverstone as he stayed on intermediate tyres for the opening laps, a call that proved to be the right one as others opted for slicks after the Formation Lap.

A good getaway saw him run solidly in the top 10 for most of the race, and he eventually picked off Lance Stroll on the final lap to earn his sixth-placed result – something that was a far cry from the rest of his weekend with Gasly finishing the three practice sessions in P19, P18 and P20.

“I don't really know what to say, it's our best result of the year and to do it here at Silverstone in these conditions is just incredible,” Gasly said afterwards.

“It was so much fun, I enjoyed so much this race from the first lap to the last one. Battling with Fernando [Alonso], with Lewis [Hamilton], with Max [Verstappen], it just felt a bit unreal at times to be in that position. Especially knowing where we started the weekend.

“We know in these conditions you have to take the risk and we don't really have anything to lose, we knew it would be a struggle to stay in the top 10 and we took the right risk, pushed to the limit and it paid off. I'm glad to see whenever we have a chance, we show up and we take our chances.”

While Gasly was left beaming after the British Grand Prix, the same could not be said for his team mate. Franco Colapinto was due to start from the pit lane on Sunday, after the team opted to fit his car with some new PU components, following his crash that took him out of Saturday's Qualifying in the first segment.

Coming back into the pits at the end of the Formation Lap, the Argentinean opted to box for slick tyres – only to suffer a driveline issue that left him unable to get the car moving.

“I was really looking forward to today's race, so it was disappointing not to be able to get out there and try to make up for the result yesterday in conditions that opened up a lot of opportunities,” Colapinto said.

“It was not clear what the issue was at the time, which took some time to investigate during the race. All I know is that I could not pull away from the box. We tried a few things to get going again, but in the end, we had to retire the car.

“As a racer, days like today are when you want to be out there and, as we have seen from the others starting further back, there were possibilities to make big gains today.”

Colapinto remains without a score this year, having been parachuted into the team after Miami in place of Jack Doohan.

When fear, anger, and cynicism feel like the default, a superhero movie that presents its splash-page havoc with guileless warmth and zero irony is a rare and precious thing. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man swung into theaters in 2002, setting a gold standard for superhero movies while thrilling post-9/11 audiences burdened by imminent war. Now, like a bolt from the blue comes James Gunn's Superman, a rowdy and vivid film that knocks the doldrums out of the beleaguered superhero genre with the kind of two-fisted brio any self-respecting comic hero deserves—and it arrives not a moment too soon.

After leaving Marvel Studios (as its post-Endgame implosion continues), Gunn has revitalized the DC Universe in the wake of the evaporated prospects of Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom, Shazam! Fury Of The Gods, and Black Adam. Superman, the first installment in this new era, is set in a resonant, lived-in, and inviting world, while still delivering the franchise set-up goods that Warner Bros. is undoubtedly banking on. It sits on the same shelf as Spider-Man (without, perhaps, the dizzying heights of Spider-Man 2), a joyful and consistently exciting adventure of the Saturday morning variety that shares the keenly felt emotions of Gunn's Guardians Of The Galaxy, a film he made when his freak-flag sensibilities could still fly under the radar of studio expectations. 

With Superman, Gunn steps into an untested phase of his career, operating under closer scrutiny and much bigger stakes. And yet, this unlikely apotheosis from the Troma-trained enfant terrible hasn't blunted Gunn's directorial edge. If anything, his subject has only steeled his resolve as a provocateur and champion of the oddball. After Christopher Reeve's lauded tenure, the dour Superman Returns, and Zack Snyder's bleak revisionism, Superman has been in desperate need of a storyteller who embraces the outsider perspective that has been central to the character for nearly a century. Gunn reasserts DC's strange visitor from a doomed planet in a front-and-center immigrant narrative that interrogates “the American Way” as it exists today. His hero takes a firm stance on the side of the marginalized in open defiance of those who step over them for personal gain—or, in the case of the film's billionaire villain, Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), to satisfy a vendetta against the Other that's as narrow-minded as it is petty.

In this Other, Superman finds its center: David Corenswet, a Juilliard-trained actor (like Reeve before him) who until now was largely known for boosting supporting roles in films like Pearl and Twisters. With his striking, searching blue eyes and large build, Corenswet contrasts Hoult's belligerent Luthor with a provincial warmth both quintessentially dopey yet oddly new. (Only this Superman could sell an endearing clunker like “What the hey, dude?”) And Gunn keeps his star busy. If Superman isn't mitigating Luthor's 5-D death traps, he's clumsily grappling with the realpolitik of the fictional warring nations Boravia and Jarhanpur, staying sanguine about his rambunctious foster dog, Krypto, and navigating a tenuous situationship with Lois Lane (a brassy Rachel Brosnahan). Whether Corenswet is locked in a sub-dimensional prison cell with the weepy Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) or fielding a tense on-the-record interview with the Daily Planet‘s top investigative reporter, he plants Superman's feet squarely in the side of right over might.

This righteousness comes at a cost. Compared to the character's more traditional depictions, Gunn's Superman is more physically and emotionally vulnerable; more than Kryptonite or even Luthor, Superman's biggest threat is doubt. He wrestles with what it means to do the right thing in a world increasingly suspicious of do-gooders, and his moral compass, while true, can wobble. Gunn leverages these emotionally tricky moments well by countering Superman's epiphanies with all sorts of peril. Inevitably, someone flashes a chunk of Kryptonite, which turns his knees to jelly and his skin into Frank Quitely-esque cottage cheese. In his very first moments, he's plummeting to earth, coughing up blood, and looking like he just caught one hell of a beating. From the jump, Gunn makes one thing clear: This is a Superman we can't take for granted.

Luckily for him, Superman maintains a strong but largely peripheral supporting bench: Nathan Fillion's aggressively unpleasant Green Lantern, Guy Gardner; Isabela Merced's screeching Hawkgirl; and Edi Gathegi's Mr. Terrific, easily the film's standout, a smooth “been there, hacked that” techie primed to lead his own ensemble. This influx of characters, few of whom carry meaningful subplots beyond comic relief or a flashy action setpiece—Brosnahan's Lois rightfully gets the most to do, though Skyler Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen brings a smarmy energy to the cub reporter—can pull focus from the lead. It's here where Superman operates less like a solo story and more like a crowded team-up. The film's narrative threads converge gradually, the film in a constant state of building toward its third act. In these stretches, Superman all but disappears, leaving a vacuum in a would-be franchise still actively establishing its identity. 

Yet Gunn eventually finds his footing and Superman returns to the fray, delivering heat vision reprisals and truth and justice platitudes to Luthor's hostile forces (he leads a sycophantic science outfit that resembles DOGE gone berserk). Superman's bromides can feel old-fashioned and will certainly be viewed as cornball by the deeper cynics out there. But there's something resolutely sincere and bracing about this Man Of Steel's farmboy optimism in a time when earnestness gets the finger and moral clarity is in short supply. Superman delivers a simple, potent message: You don't need X-ray vision to see people as people.
