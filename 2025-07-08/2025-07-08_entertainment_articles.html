                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Raimi's Spider-Man swung into theaters in 2002, setting a gold standard for superhero movies while thrilling post-9/11 audiences burdened by imminent war. Superman, the first installment in this new era, is set in a resonant, lived-in, and inviting world, while still delivering the franchise set-up goods that Warner Bros. is undoubtedly banking on. With Superman, Gunn steps into an untested phase of his career, operating under closer scrutiny and much bigger stakes. And yet, this unlikely apotheosis from the Troma-trained enfant terrible hasn't blunted Gunn's directorial edge. After Christopher Reeve's lauded tenure, the dour Superman Returns, and Zack Snyder's bleak revisionism, Superman has been in desperate need of a storyteller who embraces the outsider perspective that has been central to the character for nearly a century. Gunn reasserts DC's strange visitor from a doomed planet in a front-and-center immigrant narrative that interrogates “the American Way” as it exists today. In this Other, Superman finds its center: David Corenswet, a Juilliard-trained actor (like Reeve before him) who until now was largely known for boosting supporting roles in films like Pearl and Twisters. With his striking, searching blue eyes and large build, Corenswet contrasts Hoult's belligerent Luthor with a provincial warmth both quintessentially dopey yet oddly new. (Only this Superman could sell an endearing clunker like “What the hey, dude?”) And Gunn keeps his star busy. If Superman isn't mitigating Luthor's 5-D death traps, he's clumsily grappling with the realpolitik of the fictional warring nations Boravia and Jarhanpur, staying sanguine about his rambunctious foster dog, Krypto, and navigating a tenuous situationship with Lois Lane (a brassy Rachel Brosnahan). Whether Corenswet is locked in a sub-dimensional prison cell with the weepy Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) or fielding a tense on-the-record interview with the Daily Planet‘s top investigative reporter, he plants Superman's feet squarely in the side of right over might. He wrestles with what it means to do the right thing in a world increasingly suspicious of do-gooders, and his moral compass, while true, can wobble. Gunn leverages these emotionally tricky moments well by countering Superman's epiphanies with all sorts of peril. In his very first moments, he's plummeting to earth, coughing up blood, and looking like he just caught one hell of a beating. From the jump, Gunn makes one thing clear: This is a Superman we can't take for granted. Luckily for him, Superman maintains a strong but largely peripheral supporting bench: Nathan Fillion's aggressively unpleasant Green Lantern, Guy Gardner; Isabela Merced's screeching Hawkgirl; and Edi Gathegi's Mr. Terrific, easily the film's standout, a smooth “been there, hacked that” techie primed to lead his own ensemble. This influx of characters, few of whom carry meaningful subplots beyond comic relief or a flashy action setpiece—Brosnahan's Lois rightfully gets the most to do, though Skyler Gisondo's Jimmy Olsen brings a smarmy energy to the cub reporter—can pull focus from the lead. Superman's bromides can feel old-fashioned and will certainly be viewed as cornball by the deeper cynics out there. But there's something resolutely sincere and bracing about this Man Of Steel's farmboy optimism in a time when earnestness gets the finger and moral clarity is in short supply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The iconic Superman is back, entrusted this time not just to save the world from itself as usual but also probably Warner Bros, DC and comic book movies themselves. It is not like we needed another Superman movie, but this one isn't pretending to be any kind of origin story and counts on the audience to already know where this guy came from, who his alter-ego Clark Kent is, and exactly who has played him in the past half-century in movies and television spinoffs. After Reeve we got Bryan Singer's single turn at bat with 2016's well-reviewed Superman Returns with a game Brandon Routh in the title role, even if audiences weren't quite as enthusiastic. It got only a little better for Cavill's return in 2017's Justice League, only to see Snyder reconfigure that film and double its two-hour length in 2021's Zack Snyder's Justice League, a movie that pleased that director's rabid fan base, a group of internet dwellers I predict will be gunning for Gunn, even sight unseen, just for the audacity to try to bring this superhero franchise back to glory and give it some light and comic book color. RELATED: Men of Steel: Every Actor Who Has Played Superman – Photo Gallery And thus we now have the first film to be ironically and simply named not Superman ANOTHER Movie, but just plain Superman. How come nobody thought of that at Warner Bros before? Except … well as we first meet him on screen this time it is in the middle of the frozen Arctic somewhere, flattened and defeated, his face dripping with blood. The preceding Star Wars-like credit roll explains where he has been over the past decades right up to informing us that this invincible man, albeit alien from Krypton (and please let's just skip the recent interview where Gunn tried to portray him as just another immigrant to America and sending Fox News into a tailspin). He has just lost his first battle ever to the Hammer of Boravia after he got involved in a foreign conflict taking sides with the underdog (think Russia vs. Ukraine). Racing into the situation with no sympathy whatsoever is his ever-active caped superdog Krypto, who is all over him like a cheap suit, clearly on his own hyperbolic trajectory. This pooch gets him back to his sort-of batcave, an icy wonderland with all his mementos (like the Titanic) called the Fortress of Solitude (shot in Norway), where the Superman robots will bring him back to life from humiliating defeat. Right away we know this is not your father's Superman. However, it isn't long before we are back in Metropolis and get a brief glimpse of a TV reporter played by none other than Good Morning America‘s Will Reeve, whose father was Superman — a nice homage here. But have no fear, Corenswet finds his own way into the role in a very different America that will be lining up to see this new take. Living in times where Truth and Justice seem imperiled to say the least and what we think is the “American Way” is in danger of becoming a relic of the past as no less than democracy could be on the chopping block, it does not seem a stretch to try and define this version as one that is right for the times with a heroic character who simply stands for the good in people, even to the point of rescuing an innocent little squirrel. Thus the ever-present villain of the piece is again Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult), but he too is one for the world we live in, a tech billionaire with big plans for the planet, no matter how nefarious, that he believes will bring genuine improvements for humanity — but of course believes his nemesis Superman is out to destroy the world he is trying to create. The popularity of this caped hero is too much for Lex and he will stop at nothing to stop him and those who support him. In fact, it was through his tech genius that he was able to control and aid the Hammer in his fight, and by extension get our hero the kind of negative publicity and social media criticism he is not used to receiving. Luthor, picking sides, is also in sync with the President of Boravia, and has created a weird kind of portal called a “pocket universe” that he employs to no good end, all in the effort to paint the planet with his preferred colors and take charge. Of course Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) is around, working at the Daily Planet and trying to thrive in a digital news world where print in endangered. Nevertheless she is a scrappy reporter and savvy enough to know a good scoop, so she convinces colleague Clark Kent, who usually is the one to get scoops with his other guise, to do an interview that doesn't go so well. Yes, she is his girlfriend so that complicates things. Gunn has loaded this flick with tons of action, some quite ludicrous, and takes his cues from any number of inspirations including the past movies, TV shows and particularly Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's All Star Superman book that has informed much of his script. In a way, Frank Capra could have made this film minus all the CGI. Terrific, and Isabela Merced as the colorful Hawk Girl. They all have their moments, but generally to add humor. Skyler Gisondo's lively Jimmy Olsen is all you would hope he would be, and new character Metamorpho, who teams with Superman after a meeting in prison, is nicely played by Anthony Carrigan. Credit casting director John Papsidera for coming up with an all-new cast that more than fits the bill. He didn't cast Krypto since the scene-stealing dog is a marvel of CGI wizardry, but if this film offers nothing else for you, his addition is a pure-bred winner. RELATED: ‘Superman' Character Posters: David Corenswet, Nicholas Hoult, Edi Gathegi, Isabela Merced and Nathan Fillion Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times Superman suffers from overload, much like Gunns' Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran's) more hopeful vision. As Marvel has been showing of late, comic book movies are on the wane, so it will take ingenuity. This new flight for an old staple is by and large a promising beginning, though no doubt it will have its detractors. On the production side, give major credit to production designer Beth Mickle, cinematographer Henry Braham and costume designer Judiana Makovsky, all regulars for the Gunn films. Music by John Murphy and David Fleming does what is expected, but the snippets we hear of John Williams' immortal score for the 1978 classic just remind of the emotional power that is missing from this Superman which doesn't try to compete, but plays in its own field.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. For a movie that's meant to represent the birth of a brand-new cinematic universe (the DCU), James Gunn's slight and slaphappy take on “Superman” doesn't feel much like the start of anything. In part, that's because this goofy twist on the Man of Steel has the good sense to eschew an origin story. Rather than retell how the last son of Krypton was evacuated from another galaxy as a newborn and raised by a pair of kindly farmers in Kansas, Gunn's gospel begins three years after Clark Kent (a golly gosh darn wonderful David Corenswet) revealed his alter-ego to the masses, three weeks since Metropolis' resident metahuman inserted himself into an international conflict, and three minutes since he got his ass kicked for the first time. Related Stories IndieWire Teams with Ari Aster and Lars Knudsen to Help Filmmakers Realize the Dream The Best Thrillers Streaming on Netflix in July, from ‘Vertigo' and ‘Rear Window' to ‘Emily the Criminal' But, like so much of Gunn's semi-charming overcorrection to the biblical seriousness of the Zack Snyder era, the decision to kick things off in medias res feels less motivated by our familiarity with the world's most famous hero than by our detachment from all that he represents. As desperate to make up for lost time as it is to define itself against its times, Gunn's film races to reframe its namesake as a character whose god-like power runs a distant second to his very human vulnerability, and whose unwavering goodness often seems like the most alien thing about his presence on planet Earth. It's a world that Gunn trusts we'll recognize despite the Saturday morning blitheness of its tone and the cheery nowheresville of its design (Metropolis is mostly played by a Cleveland shot to resemble a combination of Mayfield and Manhattan). On the one hand, Superman is an undocumented immigrant who becomes a scapegoat for all America's problems, and his nemesis — played by Nicholas Hoult, who transforms a dull villain role with a touch of the blinkered sociopathy he perfected on “The Great” — is a billionaire technocrat who doesn't trust that anyone so powerful could ever be pure at heart, and publicly accuses Superman of “grooming us.” On the other hand, Lex Luthor creates an intra-dimensional pocket universe to jail his ex-girlfriends and manipulates public opinion with an army of enslaved monkeys who blast anti-Superman propaganda onto social media. (It should be funny how brainless the masses are in this movie, but Gunn's irreverent streak runs dry whenever his “Superman” threatens to brush up against satire.) One of the film's interlaced but awkwardly layered plots finds a trio of corporate metahumans (“The Justice Gang”) fighting to contain an adorable baby kaiju as it stomps around Metropolis. Another of them hinges on a lopsided conflict between a cosmopolitan empire and its Middle Eastern neighbor, the former supplied with cutting-edge technology by interested parties, while the latter is in danger of being wiped off the map. So fast, scattered, and overstuffed that it's forced to rely on a manufactured sense of fun in lieu of natural momentum, “Superman” alludes to a wide range of ideas and emotions that it isn't given the time to make real; it wastes the best ensemble these characters have ever known on a story that never figures out how seriously it should take them. Indeed, the film would have been a bonafide disaster if not for the self-possessiveness of its cast, Rachel Brosnahan chief among them. Betraying her standards by dating a writer as bad as Clark Kent, and betraying her ethics by keeping his newsworthy secret to herself, Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane might hem and haw over what it means for Superman to intervene in global affairs. For his part, Superman doesn't have any trouble picking sides, and the fact that the biggest decision he makes in this movie takes place before the plot even starts allows Gunn to frame the actual narrative as less of a moral dilemma than a practical one. It also allows Gunn to pad the story with all sorts of popcorn-munching nonsense, including a team of unfeeling helper robots (funny! ), a super-powered doggy who needs to be housebroken (cute! Most of these elements are fitfully amusing on their own, but in a film where Lois Lane only gets a few minutes of meaningful screentime and Superman is afforded less of an emotional foundation than Star-Lord ever got, it's hard not to get antsy when a Justice Gang member suddenly becomes the main character for a while. Terrific, but I'd rather see that character lead his own movie than watch him walk away with this one. By the same token, the eye-rolling flirtation between scrappy reporter Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) and über-ditz Eve Teschmacher (Sara Sampaio) might have worked better in a film less determined to look for the best in people. It's no coincidence that the best scene in this extremely ridiculous film — by far — is also its most grounded. Sharp, tetchy, and exasperated in how it interrogates what kindness might even look like in a world that's become so cruel to itself, this is the only memorable fight scene in a $225 million action movie that never quite figures out how to make a spectacle of Superman's humanity. As a symptom of the movie's reactive nature, Superman doesn't really do anything, and most of Gunn's efforts to dramatize the duality of the character's existence made me wish that he did even less (a third-act reveal forced me to suppress a spontaneous groan). Nothing in “Deadpool & Wolverine” can match the magic that “Superman” achieves in the rare moments when it's focused on what matters, but I have to admit it does a much better job of balancing silliness with sincerity. Very few superhero directors are better than Gunn at threading that needle, but here — in a movie so freighted with its own importance, a movie that strains to be more fun and more galvanizing than any he's made before — his contradictory ambitions can't help but get knotted together. Of course, the real problem is that those ambitions feel so contradictory in the first place, and that they continue to cancel each other out across a story that hinges on positioning Clark's humanity as the ultimate source of his strength. Because he wasn't born any better than the rest of us, but the light of our sun makes him strong enough to choose kindness even when Lex Luthor gives him every reason to embrace cynicism. Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman's charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what's at stake. But it's even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn't any gravity to the world around him.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, Apple has landed for development a TV series based on Elissa Sussman's best-selling novel Funny You Should Ask, with Regé-Jean Page (Bridgerton, Black Bag) and his producing partner Emily Brown executive producing through their A Mighty Stranger Production banner, Deadline has learned. Published in 2022, Funny You Should Ask is a love story that centers on a restless young journalist with big dreams who interviews a Hollywood heartthrob – and then reunites with him ten years later to discover exactly how he feels about her. 'For All Mankind' Spinoff 'Star City' Casts Priya Kansara As Series Regular Madeline Delp, Rob Delaney & Ray Fisher Join Apple's 'Being Heumann' Brit Page himself has been a popular fan pick to play 007 since his breakout starring turn in the first season of Netflix/Shondaland's Bridgerton. Alter will executive produce alongside Page and Brown of A Mighty Stranger as well as Robin Schwartz and Carolyn Daucher, along with Marty Adelstein, Becky Clements and Alissa Bachner of Tomorrow Studios, which is the studio. If Funny You Should Ask goes to series, it would mark Page's first TV role since playing Simon Basset on Bridgerton — and his return to the romance genre following the massive success of Regency drama's first installment. Prior to that, Page was a series regular on Shondaland's ABC legal drama For The People. On the feature side, he starred in Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, The Gray Man and, most recently, in Steven Soderbergh's spy thriller Black Bag.

Thankful for Tia, family, and the kind of weekend that reminds you just how good life is. Tia also posted a series of photos on July 7 from their day together, which looked to be spent in California's Napa Valley, where Mowry-Housley lives with her family. On their actual birthday, July 6, Tia posted two photos of her and her sister with their younger brothers, actor Tajh Mowry and musician Tavior Mowry, writing, “And just like that we are 47 :)” Fans were elated to see the twins together and looking so happy after Mowry had alluded to them barely seeing each other months before, leading to widespread speculation about a rift between the two. One person commented, “Healing to see you too in a positive state! “Family over everything and this sisterly bond is priceless ✨” Concerns about a rift between the sisters began in September 2024, when Mowry posted the trailer for her new reality series, “Tia Mowry: My Next Act,” which premiered in early October on WeTV. Weeks before, Mowry-Housley said she wouldn't be appearing in her sister's reality show because she knew nothing about it until it was publicly announced, telling an “ET” reporter, “I didn't know until I found out with the rest of the world.” Those signs of a distance between the twins sent fans reeling, even after Mowry tried to clarify to Us Weekly that her comments were “taken out of context” and that she still had a “beautiful connection” with her twin despite living hours apart with very busy schedules.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced their plans to bring back the tallest bird that ever lived, which has been extinct for nearly 600 years. The giant moa — a husky, wingless bird that could stand almost 12 feet tall — once booked it across New Zealand's landscapes on legs that looked like a cross between an overgrown chicken and a Tyrannosaurus Rex. This isn't the first such announcement for the biosciences startup, which recently revealed they'd created three living dire wolves, a species not seen since roughly 10,000 BCE. In April, they debuted their dire wolf pups, which were created by editing parts of genomes sequenced from ancient DNA fragments into the genome of gray wolves, giving them dire wolf attributes. This prompted some in the scientific community to say they weren't actually dire wolves, just genetically-modified gray wolves with a stellar PR team. Colossal's chief science officer Beth Shapiro responded to taxonomical criticism by arguing that species are categories we use to group animals with similar attributes: “If it looks like a dire wolf and it acts like a dire wolf, I'm gonna call it a dire wolf,” she told Rolling Stone at the time. While the dire wolves were promoted by investor George R.R. Martin, this latest project started with a pitch from Lord of Rings director and unofficial New Zealand tourism czar Peter Jackson, whose films introduced the world to the stunning mountain ranges and grassy plains of his homeland. He had long dreamed of bringing back the moa, right alongside wishing for personal submarines and jetpacks. “Growing up in New Zealand, where the moa is such a predominant part of our national identity and culture, it was just like, wouldn't it be fantastic if the moa could be brought back?” he tells Rolling Stone. But then, when I spoke with Colossal for the first time a couple of years ago, I got the distinct impression that such a thing was no longer harebrained.” Jackson suggested adding the moa to their roster for de-extinction. According to Ngāi Tahu Research Centre director Mike Stevens, hunting the moa for food — and using its bones and feathers for tools and decoration — played a crucial role in helping the Māori people adapt to living in New Zealand after they migrated from Polynesia in the 1300s. Brain Drain: Scientists Are Fleeing the U.S. as Trump Cuts Funding According to Māori lore, the 500-pound herbivores were fast runners who, once cornered, would defend themselves by kicking with those dino-chicken legs. In researching the moa through their partnership with Colossal, Stevens sees an opportunity for the Māori people to make new discoveries about themselves. “We'll learn more about our earlier ancestors and their distinct interactions with this landscape,” he says. “The way nature and culture continually shape one another.” ‘They're Gonna Be So Mad': Trump Admin Braces for MAGA Revolt Over Epstein Memo 7 Overlooked Provisions in Trump and the GOP's Ugly Tax Bill For the next six months, Colossal scientists and archeologists from the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre will focus on collecting ancient DNA samples. They have recently been searching for moa fossils in New Zealand caves, and they've already managed to extract around two dozen samples from Jackson's personal collection of more than 300 moa fossils. They'll combine these with some samples from the Canterbury Museum in their quest to have enough DNA to begin building moa genomes for all nine species — the first of which they aim to complete in the summer of 2026. We have gone so deep now in not just the ecological or environmental benefit of this species, but in the cultural history, it's been awesome.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

Believe it or not, it's true: Before there was Clark Kent of Smallville, Kansas, there was Kal-El from the planet Krypton, whose parents shipped him to Earth before their home planet was destroyed. Superman is now, and has always been, by definition, an immigrant refugee. Hell, unless there was border patrol waiting for him when he fell from outer space, that quite literally makes him an “illegal alien.” Fox News and similar corners of the internet were ablaze with myopic insistences that any inclusion of, or even nod to, this rather essential, commonplace, and well-known part of the Superman backstory made the new movie, somehow, another piece of woke Hollywood nonsense. And while Ben Shapiro did deign to acknowledge that Superman is an immigrant, he insisted the story is actually about a man “who assimilates to American values and then brings those classic American values to the big city” — as if the “classic American values” Superman learned in his adopted hometown of Smallville don't all spring from the ultimate act of kindness, generosity, and faith that is embracing a stranger in a strange land. And not, you know, empowering unidentified masked goons to snatch them off the street and send them to detention camps in the Everglades.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lewis Capaldi is giving back to his fans in a big way. On Monday (July 7) the “Someone You Loved” singer announced an initiative with the online therapy company BetterHelp to provide 734,000 hours of free virtual therapy to those in need. “Therapy is the reason why I am able to be a musician again,” the singer says in a video announcing his effort. “In partnership with BetterHelp and to reflect my experience of therapy and the importance I feel it has in my life and other people's lives, we're giving away 734,000 free hours of therapy.” The number represents 1,000 hours for every day since Capaldi was last on stage. This is my way of giving back,” Capaldi said in a statement announcing the deal. The nine-minute clip touches on the June 24, 2023 set by Capaldi at the Glastonbury Festival in England that he was unable to finish due to a strained vocal cord and a series of debilitating tics he suffered on stage due to his Tourette's syndrome diagnosis. Six days before Capaldi's dramatic, surprise return to the same Glastonbury stage on June 27 of this year for his first show since the 2023 incident — after which Capaldi announced what turned into a two-year break from touring to focus on his health — the 28-year-old singer sat down with one of his best friends to talk about what the past few years of his life have been like. In the video, Capaldi says that he realized about two songs into his 2023 Glasto set that he couldn't do it. “‘I can't keep doing this to myself, and other people as well,'” Capaldi recalls thinking at the time. Realizing the experience was difficult for his fans as well, Capaldi says he thought in that moment, “‘I'm done indefinitely. Though the loving audience seemed to pick up on Capaldi's struggles and helped him finish singing his breakthrough smash hit “Someone You Loved,” the singer says he was on “complete autopilot” during the 2023 show and felt like he was “1,000 miles away… I watch it back and I actually feel sad watching it.” When he reviews it, Capaldi doesn't see the wonderful, beautiful example of perseverance his fans experienced, but he is thankful for them helping him make it a “much less embarrassing moment. If no one was singing along it would have been pretty bleak.” He says the reason he got so anxious was that he wasn't living in the moment, but fretting all along about all the things that could have gone wrong. It was like a weird mix of emotions… I'm probably the only person who doesn't see it as an uplifting, happy video. Because I get it… watching it… I'm struggling,” he says, noting that a much happier outcome would have been if he was part of the singing and not watching someone having “the worst moment of his life.” Capaldi says he was doing therapy before the Glasto incident, but he was lying his way through it before finding the therapist he's made great strides with over the past two years. After a series of secret gigs to warm up for Glastonbury in his native Scotland earlier this year, during which he is not ashamed to say he cried quite a bit, Capaldi says he wasn't nervous at all in advance of his Glastonbury return. At the first show in Edinburgh, Capaldi says he felt great through the first two songs and was then hit with a rush of adrenaline that made him shake and was able to calm himself down. So it was a weird feeling.” As a testament to the work he's done, Capaldi says that in the lead-up to this year's Glastonbury he had “no anxiety or fear or impending doom.” According to BetterHelp, users can get a free month of therapy when they join — as long as they've never used the service before — and will not be charged if they cancel within one month; the offer is available through Dec. 31 of this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Watts proudly took the front row as her daughter, Kai Schreiber, 16, stole the spotlight during Celine's Spring/Summer 2026 runway show at Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week on Saturday, July 6. While all eyes were on Kai during her big moment, Watts, 56, was seen in the audience smiling proudly. Kai wowed on the catwalk in a flowy, white short-sleeve A-line dress paired with a straw hat, clutch, silver jewelry, and oversized sunglasses. Forever grateful.” Her mom reacted to the post and dropped a sweet comment: “SLAAAAY 🙌🙌🙌” Daughter of Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber, Kai is quickly making a name for herself not only in modeling but also as a transgender activist. In a June interview with Interview Magazine, she shared how fashion became a meaningful outlet: “Struggling with gender identity from a young age most likely had something to do with it,” she explained. “I always wanted to grow up and be a beautiful, glamorous, influential woman, like Marilyn [Monroe].” She also revealed that modeling was something she's been preparing for her entire life: “I've been practicing my walks in the kitchen for years; my mom can show you all the videos I forced her to film.” Despite the breakup, Watts and Schreiber have remained close co-parents. In a 2020 interview with Hamptons magazine, Watts spoke candidly about juggling her acting career and being a mom.“Sometimes you feel like you're a supermom — baking cake, playing board games, teaching them how to use the vacuum cleaner,” she said. “Other times, you're like, ‘Oh God, just let me hand them the devices so I can get things done,' you know?”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a week of fretting over whether or not Office star Craig Robinson is actually retiring, Variety reports that a series of billboards announcing the comedian's retirement have begun popping up around L.A. So either this is either a marketing campaign aimed square at the hearts of every red-blooded American or a last-ditch effort to sell tickets for the year of stand-up dates Robinson has booked. The billboards, which read, simply, “Craig Robinson is quitting comedy,” began appearing in Los Angeles last week, when the “retired” comedian posted on Instagram: “Life update: I'm officially quitting comedy to focus on my true calling. While that job likely pays better than “Comedian at Comedy,” it's more likely that this is a part of a new promotional campaign for AT&T's world-class service and support. Though, as noted in our initial report, there was plenty of reason to doubt Robinson's intentions, namely because he had the aforementioned whole year of stand-up dates booked, which, as far as we know, isn't the type of retiree behavior we've come to expect from people exiting comedy. Usually, they just become pseudo-public intellectuals complaining about the woke mind virus. Since announcing his retirement, however, Robinson has continued to play into the idea. Last week, he posted a video asking for tips on getting his small business started. “Hey guys, big shoutout to all my small business owners,” he says in the video. “Hey, you guys got any advice for me while I'm trying to get my business afloat. Craig, what kind of engagement bait are you going for here?
