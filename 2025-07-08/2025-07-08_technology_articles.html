Amazon Prime Day has officially started in both the UK and the U.S., and with it comes a slew of deals on everything from 4K monitors to 4TB solid state drives (SSDs). Unfortunately, as usual, there's more quantity than quality in all of the tech bargains at Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&H Photo, and other retailers. We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is. We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life. HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match. At a whopping 42% off ($150), the 2TB Seagate Expansion Card is just $15 shy of its all time low price and a great way to expand your Xbox's storage. If you want an OLED monitor with almost no downsides, this might be the ultimate Prime Day deal. We've clocked our five-star rated, "near-perfect" Alienware 360Hz 1440p QD-OLED AW2725DF at $300 off, making it just $599 and a steal this Prime Day. It delivers knockout HDR performance for movies and games alike, features 0.03ms response times, and rocks a futuristic design on the back. This is already an easy recommendation, now at its reduced price, we're almost begging you not to miss it. As you can see from our testing, this monitor shines in benchmarking; the only downsides we could find were no internal speakers and no 3.5mm headphone jack. But at $300 off, we're quite happy to put those quibbles aside. You can get a super fast external storage device sale this Prime Day, but for that you'll have to opt for an SSD. You can also get a slower yet more capacious and affordable hard drive that hits the spot at a sweet deal, too, bringing us to your two options. The WD 5TB Elements portable external HDD hits the spot with 5TB of storage for a mere $115, a nice savings for Prime Day. Naturally this won't be the fastest drive out there due to its spinning platters, but it'll get the job done for bulk storage. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. The Crucial X10 is a lightning-fast portable SSD with sequential read speeds up to 2,100 MB/s. You can opt for faster SSD storage, but the upcharge is steep. At least these 30% off deals help with that! These drives are much faster, naturally, peaking at 2,100 MB/s. The company also has 1TB, 6TB, and 8TB models on offer at stellar prices, which you can read about here. Grab yourself a $1,000 saving on this Gigabyte Auros gaming PC at Newegg. For $2,999, you get an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, RTX 5080, 64GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD. We'd have like to have seen a bit more storage in a $3k rig, but this is still an epic saving. There are some astonishing processor savings at Amazon for Prime Day right now. Two standouts include these AMD Ryzen 9000 CPUs, with discounts of up to $215. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. If you want to save even more, then check out this AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, now just $165 at Amazon, an all-time low price. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Get plug-and-play compatibility with any USB-capable device and speeds of up to 1,050MB/s. Get a whopping 37% off this external solid state drive from Samsung, perfect for professionals working with media or even as a backup drive. Perfect for picking up an extra SSD or a new case! Factor in that saving and you're looking at getting the card for just $789, which is as good as it gets for the 5070 Ti. You can get a 5070 Ti for $829 from Amazon without a gift card, so the saving is less but you're saving hard cash, rather than in store credits. Buy the 5070 Ti at Newegg and get $110 of store credit after you've made your purchase. This is perfect if you want to complement your new card with an upgrade to your SSD, PC case, or even a monitor. Want a slimmer saving but in cold hard cash? I recommend the Zotac 5070 Ti at Amazon, now $829, a $170 saving. The SteelSeries Arena 9 are our top pick for best PC speakers when it comes to surround sound. With 5.1 configuration and 300 watts of power they are a truly wall-shaking solution to your gaming setup. We've seen them for less, but it's unlikely this price will be beaten during the Prime Day week. We loved these speakers in our Arena 9 review, specifically because they're very powerful and offer fantastic audio with true surround sound. Aside from how much space any 5.1 system takes up, our only ever gripe has been the price, which makes this 34% saving all the more alluring. That's definitely the case with this gaming PC from CyberPowerPC, which is one of the cheapest ways to get your hands on an RTX 5070. This system is currently 15% off for Prime Day, saving you $300. The CyberPowerPC Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC features an RTX 5070 and an Intel Core i9-14900KF, paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. This is enough power to let you play the latest titles at 1440p and enjoy your favorite VR games. For $1,680, the Gamer Xtreme VR Gaming PC comes armed with an RTX 5070 paired with Intel's fastest gaming chip, the Core i9-14900KF. The system is also equipped with 32GB of RAM that will keep things snappy even during multi-tasking, and a 2TB SSD. I have a feeling this one will sell out quickly. At least two Tom's Hardware editors own the HOTO NEX 01 Pro screwdriver which has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. Charging is via USB-C and from each full charge you get around 1000 screws. I am one of the staff members who owns this screwdriver, and I've built many IKEA cabinets and recently built an arcade cabinet using this great screwdriver. This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap! With noise cancelation, long-range Hollyland Lark M2 microphones are an excellent choice for conference calls, content creation, and interviews. To control the microphones, there is a single button that turns on / off noise cancellation. A long press will mute / unmute your microphone. For more features there is an accompanying Android / iOS app that enables individual control of audio levels, and noise cancellation. The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the charging case and they will charge ready for the next interview. Paired with a good set of headphones, you have an excellent platform for content creation. I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers. Amazon Prime Day has brought us a massive sale on the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD range. Ideal for gaming, computing, or workstations, they're some of the most premium hard drives around. Ideal for gaming or workstations, this 9100 Pro from Samsung has read speeds of up to 14,800MB/s and is a hefty $150 off, down to its lowest-ever price of $399. For a small amount extra on each model you can also get one with a heatsink if you want to optimize your cooling. As noted, these 9100 Pro drives are some of the fastest we've ever tested. High resolution resin 3D printing without breaking the bank A 10 inch 12K mono LCD ensures that your resin prints come out crisp and perfect. In the box you get a super high resolution (12K!) resin 3D printer with a generous 218.88x122.88x250 mm build volume. The build plate is laser-carved for excellent bed adhesion and the Fresnel Collimating Light Source emits a uniform beam of light for better print accuracy. Elegoo are experts in resin 3D printers, and we've tested the older Saturn 2 8K and awarded it the Editor's Choice award back in 2022. Grab yourself a bargain gaming laptop with this ROG Strix G16, down to its lowest-ever price of $1,359. This Strix G16 comes with GeForce RTX 4060, Intel Core i9-14900HX, 16GB DDR5-5600, 1TB PCIe SSD, Wi-Fi 6E, and Windows 11. Now Prime Day has started there are laptops galore, so it really pays to peruse for a bargain if you've got the time. With the stroke of midnight PT, Amazon Prime Day has now gone live in the U.S., stay tuned as we start tracking deals across PC hardware, components, and beyond. I've been eyeing an OLED gaming monitor for years, and Samsung now has two great options with hefty savings for Amazon Prime Day. Its new OLED G8 is now almost a third off in the UK. You can score the 27-inch model for £799 instead of £1,099, a 27% saving, or grab the larger 32-inch model for £849 instead of £1,199. If you want a bit more monitor for your money, there's an even bigger saving on the larger 32-inch model. Get £350 off the larger 32-inch model, the first saving we've ever seen on this monitor, and a great one to boot. There are definitely still some cheaper 4K OLED monitors in the UK, but this is the best price we've seen yet on Samsung's premium offerings. That gets you a Gigabyte GeForce RTX 5070 WINDFORCE OC SFF 12G Graphics Card, which is discounted by 19% from its usual price of £619. You can also save big on this MSI RTX 5070 Ti. This deal, which gets you £160 off, brings the card within £10 of MSRP. You also get the 76MB L3 cache and support for DDR5 memory. This Zen 5 processor has 12 cores for a total of 24 threads. An unlocked multiplier means you can manually overclock the chip. As you can see, it stacks up very well in our CPU testing hierarchy, check out the benchmarks below: Good morning, sports fans, and welcome to the start of Amazon Prime Day in the UK - deals switched over at midnight, and there are some handsome hardware savings to be had in the early running. Stephen here to take you through some of the early savings. It's a great time to pick up an all-purpose gaming mouse — Razer's Basilisk V3 Pro is currently on sale for $91.63 at Amazon (was $159.99). This wireless gaming mouse features an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape, 11 programmable buttons, and a dual-mode tilt wheel (though, unlike the tilt wheel on the Logitech G502 X Plus, the Basilisk V3 Pro's is software- and not hardware-based). The Basilisk V3 Pro is an ergonomically-shaped all-purpose wireless gaming mouse with 11 programmable buttons, a dual-mode tilt wheel, and Razer's FocusPro 30K optical sensor. While there's a newer version of the Basilisk V3 Pro out — the Basilisk V3 Pro 35K, which features Razer's newest FocusPro 35K optical sensor — this is still a fantastic deal. The mouse features tri-mode connectivity (2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, and wired via USB-C), up to 90 hours of battery life, and supports up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate via Razer's HyperPolling Wireless Dongle (sold separately). It's on the larger side, but it's still a very comfortable mouse, with textured, grippy sides, a well-placed buttons, and tactile, clicky optical switches. Read our full review of the Basilisk V3 Pro here.— Sarah However, this Prime Day has seen even deeper cuts — in fact, these are the lowest prices we've ever seen for the current family of AirPods. At $89, the AirPods 4 are entering impulse buy territory, and they are great-sounding earbuds for people who don't need a lot of fancy features to enjoy their music. Apple's entry-level Bluetooth earbuds have 5 hours of runtime, which can be boosted by another 30 hours with the included USB-C charging case. The AirPods 4 with ANC bring Active Noise Cancellation, Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and a Qi Wireless charging case. They can also be used as hearing aids. For $119, you get Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, and a USB-C charging case that also supports Qi wireless charging. Logitech's G735 wireless gaming headset isn't the only lightweight white wireless headset on the market, but it is exceptionally comfortable and very pretty. The G735 is part of Logitech's Aurora line, which launched in 2022 at a premium price — the G735 retailed for $229 at launch and currently retails for $259.99, but it's currently on sale for just $129.99 at Amazon. Logitech's G735 is a lightweight, comfortable wireless gaming headset with a detachable boom mic, dual wireless audio mixing, and pretty pastel dual-zone RGB lighting. It features simultaneous dual wireless connections, which means you can listen to and mix audio input from both a 2.4GHz wireless and a Bluetooth source at the same time. It also comes with a detachable boom mic and features replaceable earpads (Logitech sells different colors, for those who want to mix it up). It's an extremely lightweight headset, weighing just 9.6 ounces (273g), and offers up to 56 hours of battery life with the lighting turned off. Inside, it sports 40mm dynamic drivers with a frequency response range of 20 - 20,000 Hz. Read our full review of the Logitech G735 here. If you're looking for a gorgeous and responsive all-around gaming mouse, Logitech's G502 X Plus is currently on sale for just $114.99 at Amazon — down 36% from its current retail price of $179.99 (though it was $159.99 at launch), and close to the lowest price we've ever seen it at. The flagship gaming mouse features Logitech's Hero 25K optical sensor, 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel that switches easily between tactile and free-scrolling modes, and an eight-zone LED strip that makes it one of the prettiest mice we've ever tested. The Logitech G502 X Plus gaming mouse is close to its lowest price ever — this comfortable, all-purpose gaming mouse features 13 programmable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel, Logitech's Hero 25K sensor, and an attractive, customizable RGB lighting strip with 8 seamlessly blended zones. The G502 X Plus is a large, comfortable gaming mouse with an ergonomically contoured right-handed shape. Read our full review of the Logitech G502 X Plus here. The price of SSD storage continues to stay low, surprisingly, in the face of economic turbulence, so you can still score some great deals on big 4TB SSDs. 4TB SSDs are on sale for $0.05 per GB, or even as low as $0.06 per GB for a premium Samsung SSD. We have a much larger list of both 4TB and 8TB SSDs over in our tracking deals post, which you can view here. Our resident Wi-Fi expert, Brandon Hill, has dug up several great Prime Day deals that will enable you to upgrade your wireless network to either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7, depending on your budget. The TP-Link Archer AXE75 combines excellent performance and value in a Wi-Fi 6E router. The AXE75 Wi-Fi 6E router is now at $120, a nice savings of $30. This router blasts out up to 574 Mbps of bandwidth on the 2.4 GHz band and 2,402 Mbps on the 5 and 6 GHz bands. It also features four Gigabit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port, allowing you to connect a shared storage device to the network. It also supports the OneMesh standard, which makes expanding your network with satellite devices to extend range a snap. It really doesn't get much easier than OneMesh, where you can simply plug in a networking device and get it working with zero networking hassle. The TP-Link Deco BE23 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that features three nodes and covers up to 6,500 square feet. Each node features 2.5 GbE ports and supports wired backhaul. This entry-level Wi-Fi mesh setup includes three devices that support MLO, just not on the 6 GHz band. You can check out Brandon's in-depth analysis of these deals here. For students, the MacBook Air (read our review) offers a slim profile, battery life so good you won't need to charge between classes, and strong performance without a fan, so your machine stays silent. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. Both MacBook Airs come in the same silver, starlight, midnight, or new sky blue colors.While Apple Intelligence isn't the most useful tool yet, at least it means these laptops start with 16GB of RAM alongside 256GB of storage. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. For those looking for a desktop, the Mac Mini offers a bit more power with the same M4 chip thanks to an active cooling fan. But it makes up for that curious design decision with lots of ports and quiet operation. It also sports a fast 1ms response time and AMD FreeSync tech. An all-time low price for this mid-range gaming monitor. It also comes with AMD FreeSync and several other features designed to give you an advantage over your opponents in every match. This monitor is also built for use with other monitors — the three-sided borderless design eliminates the thick bezels found on many panels, thus allowing you to stack up side-by-side displays so you can use up to three panels with minimal bezel nastiness to distort your view. This monitor is at an all-time low pricing, and we don't know how long the deal will last. While not quite the best price we've ever seen on it, this Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L Core 360mm cooler is 15% off and now just $85 at Amazon. If you're looking for a great CPU cooler that can shift heat from your processor, then this is a great bet. This is a great price on a really excellent all-in-one CPU cooler that will fit AMD Ryzen AM5/AM4 and Intel's LGA 1700/1200 sockets. Don't just take our word for it though. We're continuing to see good deals (and perhaps even better deals) at Amazon rivals like Newegg, including these Samsung EVO Plus SSD's, available in 2TB and 4TB models with hefty savings on both. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty that covers an impressive 2,400 TB of writes, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality. Save even more money with Samsung's 2TB version of the 990 EVO Plus, with the same 7,250 MB/s speeds and a saving of $37. The latest Steam hardware survey indicates most players only have between 100GB to 249GB of free storage space on their hard drives, barely enough for a couple of AAA games in 2025. Now's the perfect time to upgrade your storage. Amazon Prime Day hasn't even started yet, but it's already proving enormously fruitful for CPU savings from both AMD and Intel. We're tracking discounts of up to 58% on some models, with prices starting at just $66. If you want to save even more money, there's a fantastic Ryzen 5 9600X that's 41% off, now just $165. This is the perfect processor for those building a powerful workstation. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X comes with six cores and 12 threads, with a maximum boost speed of 5.4GHz and 32 MB of L3 cache. Curious as to how these stack up to other great CPUs on the market, here's our extensive testing data from years of CPU benchmarking. We've been hungry for some RTX 50-series laptop deals in the run-up to Amazon Prime Day, and we finally have our first one, and it's a great one at that! Right now, you can grab $400 off the list price of this Alienware Aurora 16-inch 120Hz Gaming Laptop. Best Buy is hosting it's own Black Friday in July sale to rival Prime Day, and has stolen a march on Amazon with this an other laptop deals that are really quite excellent. Speedy SSDs get all the flashbulbs and attention, but the humble hard drive continues to chug along today in an untold number of desktop PCs, NAS, and various other bulk storage applications. That's because you simply can't beat the pricing for the sheer amount of capacity that you get for an HDD. This drive is specifically for PC use with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, 190MB/s top speed from its desirable CMR tech, and a two-year warranty. The BarraCuda is geared specifically for desktop HDD use, so its tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also uses the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, and not that cheap, performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) tech found on bargain basement drives. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity trumps speed every time. This Fnirsi soldering iron deal brings the heat! The HS-01 has become my go-to smart soldering iron, and for good reason. Its not compact, but it is designed for travel thanks to an aluminum chassis and protective lid that keeps the soldering tip free from damage or debris. So no accidental keypresses when you are concentrating on soldering. The soldering iron heats up in seconds, and it can hit 420C (788F) with ease. I've soldered up countless projects with it, including a full Zilog Z80 computer kit, and a hexagon shaped PCB with slow color-changing LEDs. The HS-01 didn't skip a beat, it just worked. But Fnirsi has also given us a selection of six soldering iron tips that slot into the HS-01. From fine needle points used in surface mount soldering, to much broader tips used to lay vast amounts of heat into large ground planes or for speaker wires that greedily wick away heat. Bambu Lab has some great deals on the A1 3D printer for UK readers! But what if you don't want or need such an expensive and quite rightly one of the best 3D printers? We gave the A1 4.5 stars and an Editor's choice award because it was fast, intuitive, inexpensive and it comes with a direct drive extruder, useful for flexible filaments like TPU. Saving £130 on this great 3D printer is a really good deal. It may look simple, but this printer packs every automation necessary to plug in and print. This is the same Bambu Lab A1, but you also get a multi-color/material printing system for more advanced prints. Amazon has a couple of excellent UK deals on Crucial's P310 right now. With speeds of up to 7,100MB/s, it's perfect for running as your OS boot drive, the foundation of a budget build, or as a handy storage expansion/upgrade for your existing PC. With a whopping 21% off, the 4TB model is a great saving and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Gaming laptop deals on Amazon UK are fairly scarce right now, but I have found this rather nifty Acer Nitro V16, now 17% off and £829 instead of £999. A similar spec Dell G15 5530 will set you back £1,049 on Amazon, as will the HP Victus 15-inch, both of which come with the same RTX 4050. There's also a 4060 option, but you won't find any savings on that right now, so it's much more expensive. We reviewed this laptop's forebear, the Acer Nitro 16, back in 2023. Since then, Acer has updated it with the aforementioned 8040 series Ryzen processors. With the uprated processor and this excellent deal, it's a pretty handy gaming laptop if you want to beat the Prime Day rush. While not totally solved, OLED burn-in concerns are minimal these days, and Samsung's OLED G6 is an alluring 25% off at Amazon right now, less than £600 for a 27-inch display. This deal is so good that it actually makes that 360Hz refresh rate option cheaper than the same resolution screen with just 240Hz, which you can still expect to pay £680 for. The lowest-ever price we've seen ahead of Prime Day, save some £200 (25%) on this Odyssey OLED G6 replete with HDMI 2.1, 360Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and more. If you want to save even more money, Philips' excellent gaming offshoot Evnia is flogging its own 27-inch QHD OLED monitor for just £499. You'll get the same 1440p resolution, 360Hz refresh rate, response time, and connectivity. While the savings might not be as juicy as the Samsung, you'll save another £100 for a monitor with ostensibly the same spec sheet, only with a slightly less appealing brand and less eye-catching design. Prime Day doesn't officially kick off until midnight, but there are already some good early deals. This NZXT H6 Flow mid-tower PC case with panoramic class and 3 x 120mm fans (included) just hit its lowest ever price, a full 24% off and now just £76.44 instead of £99.99. We reviewed NZXT H6 Flow RGB and loved its impressive thermal results and the fact that it's very easy to build in. While that's modest for a case of this size, it's not a huge issue in the age of the M2 VNMe. This excellent mid-tower case comes with a panoramic glass panel and three 120mm fans. The dual chamber design makes for excellent thermal performance and there's optimized airflow all-round, as well as intuitive cable management. A four-star Tom's Hardware pick at full price, it's now fully 24%/£23 off for a limited time, the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. Move fast, it's a limited run deal with constrained stock. Check out some of the benchmarks from our H6 Flow testing, including thermal and acoustic performance. As you can see, it's a little louder than some alternatives from Hyte under load, but outperformed both cases significantly in terms of thermal performance, with notable GPU cooling and a rather spiffy average. Snag a Samsung's award-winning 49-inch Odyssey OLED G9 monitor for only $959 at Amazon It has a dense resolution that measures in at 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate that can get as high as 240Hz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Though there's still no official release date, Dune fans have long assumed director Denis Villeneuve is readying production on the third film in the sci-fi series. Surprisingly, it's not Dune Messiah, in keeping with Frank Herbert's source-material novel. According to Variety, Dune: Part Three is still expected to release in December 2026, the slot previously reserved for an “event movie” from the director by Warner Bros. At the time, the given date of December 18, 2026, conflicted with an unnamed Star Wars project that has since been removed—but is now the release date for a little movie called Avengers: Doomsday. So it's anyone's guess if Dune: Part Three will remain in place. (Lest we forget, Dune: Part Two shifted release dates a few times and was still a massive hit.) The Variety piece also notes that while some sequences in Dune: Part Three will be filmed using IMAX cameras, the whole film will not be shot in the format, as had been suggested by IMAX CEO Paul Gelfond. (Perhaps it'll still be Villeneuve, once he shifts gears to start work on his James Bond movie?) The trade notes that Dune: Part Three is expected to begin filming “imminently,” with Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya returning to star. Jason Momoa, absent from Part Two, is also back in the cast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) are one of the most serious contenders for dark matter—the “missing” mass supposedly constituting 85% of our universe. Given its elusiveness, dark matter tests the patience and creativity of physicists. But the latest results from LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), the South Dakota-based detector, may have brought scientists a small step closer to catching WIMPs in action. In a recent Physical Review Letters paper, scientists analyzed 280 days' worth of data from LUX-ZEPLIN, reporting the tightest ever upper limit on WIMPs. The result—a near fivefold improvement—demonstrates how physicists are increasingly getting better at circumventing the problem that dark matter is, well, dark; the elusive stuff evades any detection method that depends on materials interacting with visible light or other types of radiation. There's ample evidence to suggest that dark matter does in fact exist, including numerous astrophysical observations hinting at some invisible matter exerting gravitational force on objects we can see. Physicists, as a result, tend to use materials that we can see, such as liquid forms of heavyweight elements like xenon, and simply wait for some unknown particle to interact with it. That strategy—waiting for particles to interact with heavy elements—is a well-tested approach for detecting WIMPs, hypothetical particles that interact with gravity but on a scale so tiny that only the most sensitive detectors might catch a glimpse. The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment, located one mile underground in a decommissioned South Dakota gold mine, employs nearly 15,000 pounds (7 tons) of liquid xenon. The chemical element's high atomic mass and density make it potentially easier for scientists to detect any unknown particles that may pass through the detector. Also, liquid xenon is transparent, preventing any unwanted noise—usually arising from radioactive matter around the detector—from spoiling an experiment. “If you think of the search for dark matter like looking for buried treasure, we've dug almost five times deeper than anyone else has in the past,” said Scott Kravitz, a physicist at the University of Texas at Austin and deputy coordinator for LZ, in a press release. “There's a human tendency to want to see patterns in data, so it's really important when you enter this new regime that no bias wanders in,” said Scott Haselschwart, a physicist at the University of Michigan and LZ physics coordinator, in the same release.

President Donald Trump on Monday informed leaders of Japan and South Korea that the U.S. would impose 25% import tariffs on all goods made in these countries and shipped to the U.S. starting August 1. U.S. President Donald Trump sent formal letters to Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru and South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung, informing them that new import duties of 25% will be applied to all goods from their respective countries starting August 1. This measure aims to address trade imbalances in the current trade relationships that are believed to be heavily skewed in favor of Japan and South Korea due to protectionist measures, including tariffs and regulatory barriers. As a result, all Japanese and Korean imports will face a flat 25% duty, separate from existing tariffs by sector. Japan and South Korea supply the U.S. with a variety of high-tech products, including cars, consumer electronics, wafer fab equipment, and semiconductors. From Japan, the U.S. imports 3D NAND, advanced chipmaking equipment, automotive electronics, high-precision sensors, lithium-ion batteries, medical imaging systems, microcontrollers, and industrial equipment, just to name some. These imports are vital to American tech giants and automakers, meaning new tariffs on such goods could disrupt supply chains, raise costs, and slow sales across multiple sectors. Trump noted that goods transshipped to evade a higher tariff will be subject to that higher tariff. For example, if a Korean company sends its products to, say, Vietnam first and then re-exports them to the U.S. labeled as 'Made in Vietnam' (a common transshipment tactic), the U.S. will still treat those goods as Korean and apply the 25% tariff. What remains to be seen is what happens to products based on chips from Japan or South Korea, yet assembled in other countries, such as China. However, we can only wonder whether the rules will be changed. President Trump warned that any attempt by Japan and South Korea to retaliate with their own tariff hikes will be met with matching increases on top of the new 25%. However, companies from Japan or South Korea that choose to manufacture products within the United States will be exempt from these duties. The letters promise that regulatory approvals for such operations will be handled quickly and efficiently within weeks. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The team at Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based AI video generation startup, doesn't think you can prompt your way to making a movie. That's why the company on Tuesday opened up its “3D-aware” model to the public, promising a “hybrid” approach that gives filmmakers more control than other standard text-to-video models. Users can generate clips up to five seconds long, which is in line with industry standards for publicly available video generation models. The startup, co-founded by former DeepMind researchers who worked on Google's own video generation model, claims Marey is one of the few models trained entirely on openly licensed data. For independent filmmaker Ángel Manuel Soto, Marey's biggest selling point is that it democratizes access to the top AI storytelling tools, especially for people who have long felt shut out of traditional filmmaking. Now, Soto says, Marey has helped him cut production costs by 20% to 40% and work more freely. Soto previously worked with Moonvalley's studio, Asteria, on the HBO docuseries, “Menudo: Forever Young.” Asteria, also known as XTR, was acquired this year by Moonvalley, according to Hemant Taneja, CEO of General Catalyst. (GC was a major shareholder in Asteria, and invested more money into the combined entity.) Talukdar told TechCrunch that Marey has an understanding of the physical world that could translate to more interactive storytelling as the tech develops. Right now, that sort of understanding — which Marey shares with other models like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's still-private Sora — allows Marey to do things like mimic motion while still respecting the laws of physics. Or, Marey can superimpose a character that looks like George Washington onto an actor, translating everything from the actor's facial movements to the muscles in his forearms as he gesticulates. Perhaps more unique is Marey's support for free camera motion. He also noted that Marey could achieve near-360-degree camera motion, and obey instructions to create footage as if it was shot from a handheld camera or dolly. Moonvalley's plan over the next few months is to roll out new controls like lighting, deep object trajectories, and character libraries, said Talukdar. Marey's public release puts it in direct rivalry with a growing field of AI video generators – models like Runway Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, Pika, and Haiper.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What has Jack Dorsey, the founder of Twitter (now X) been up to lately? Among other things, creating experimental little projects, like a new private messenger that doesn't need the internet to function. On Sunday, Dorsey announced the beta launch of a new messaging app that he says relies on mesh networks to pass messages from user to user via the power of Bluetooth technology. The service sounds vaguely like Amazon's Sidewalk project (which similarly used mesh networks to power IoT devices), and which we advised against using back in 2020. According to Dorsey, his messenger—called Bitchat—allows for decentralized, private communication, in such a way that does not require internet infrastructure. In a white paper he published to his Github page, Dorsey explained a little bit about how Bitchat is supposed to work: “bitchat addresses the need for resilient, private communication that doesn't depend on centralized infrastructure,” the page says. “By leveraging Bluetooth Low Energy mesh networking, bitchat enables direct peer-to-peer messaging within physical proximity, with automatic message relay extending the effective range beyond direct Bluetooth connections.” Some quibble over whether Bluesky is a decentralized project on the same level as other Fediverse sites, though it's certainly much more so than Elon Musk's monstrosity. Mesh networks work by pooling power and digital resources between devices as a sort of bandwidth-sharing arrangement. Dorsey claims the service is private because it requires no “phone numbers, emails, or permanent identifiers” to function—which sounds pretty good. Dorsey also claims the messenger offers end-to-end encryption, which is what you want. The app's lack of reliance on internet infrastructure is intended to make it “resilient to network outages and censorship,” which also sounds good on paper. Jack doesn't always seem to be super interested in taking a consistent executive role (some claimed that he wasn't all that involved in day-to-day operations at Twitter), and seems content to start new projects and not really follow through with them (he notably bowed out of Bluesky just as it was taking off as an organization). That said, Bitchat, like Bluesky, certainly provides the opportunity for Dorsey and other like-minded individuals to take off running in a new direction, which is never a bad thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Amazon Prime Day is arguably the best time of the year to upgrade your pet's digs for way less dough. As the pet tech writer here at WIRED, I have strong opinions about which (often pricey) pet gear is worth the money. From automatic litter boxes to feeders and fountains, and even DNA testing kits and pet cameras, I've pulled together the best Prime Day pet deals on WIRED-tested gear for this event, which runs July 8-11. This automatic feeder is specifically designed to store and schedule wet-food meals using what's essentially a mini fridge. With the newest upgrade, the bowls are now stainless steel—less chance for whisker fatigue with wide bowls or feline acne with bacteria-harboring plastic—and they're numbered, so you can easily correlate feedings to specific bowls in-app. Through the connected app, you can alter schedules, manually feed on demand, and control how long it's opened—there's even a sensor to make sure it doesn't close while your kitty is feeding. This automatic feeder is my personal favorite and the one I recommend for most people. Like other high-tech pet gadgets, it's controlled via an app on your phone, where you can make and adjust feeding schedules remotely, and it logs when feedings occurred. Best of all, the built-in 1080p HD camera with night vision allows you to watch and hear your pet eat even when far away, and you can communicate with them via speaker. This automatic litter box (8/10 WIRED Recommends) uses a camera and AI to monitor usage and actually lets you see your cat's stool to help more closely monitor their health. The front arm has a camera attached, which manually and automatically tracks motion so you can see the outside and inside of the litter box (it doubles as a built-in security camera, too). It uses AI to recognize which cat used the box and takes videos so you can replay exactly what was happening inside of the box, and can even review the images of their stool to make sure nothing looks out of whack. Now at $750, this usually pricey upgrade is the lowest price we'll probably see this year (or at least until Black Friday). I have a fluffy and beautiful (but dumb) dilute calico named Clover whom I've long suspected has some Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest cat in her. Testing is super simple—they send you everything you need, and all you have to do is register your kit online, swab your cat's mouth with the provided instrument, seal the package back up, and send it to the post office. It takes about five or so weeks for results, which include important information about genetic health markers, dental conditions, ancestry, and DNA. It's compact and relatively inexpensive—made even more affordable with the Prime Day discount. This little camera can be mounted for greater range, has two-way audio so you can talk to and hear your pet while away, has video recaps, and uses Furbo Nanny. Nanny is a subscription service that offers real-time alerts and smart insights and sends notifications when there's unusual activity or emergencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The deal gives Arbor $41 million to help it build its first commercial-scale power plant in southern Louisiana that will burn waste biomass to generate electricity for a data center. “We are able to market it as two products,” Arbor co-founder and CEO Brad Hartwig told TechCrunch. “One of the great things about BiCRS is that you get the capture part for free because plants are drawing down the CO2, and all you have to do is strip it out in and store it,” Hannah Bebbington, head of deployment at Frontier, told TechCrunch. Burning biomass is older than human civilization, but Arbor adds a space age twist to the practice. Hartwig, who previously worked at SpaceX, drew inspiration from rocket turbomachinery in developing Arbor's power plant. The company's first facility will generate between five and 10 megawatts of electricity. In the power plant, waste biomass is first transformed into syngas. The startup had previously intended to use an off-the-shelf gasifier, but none of them were up to snuff, so it developed its own. The hot gases are then fed through a turbomachinery to generate electricity. Most of the CO2 is diverted to a pipeline that'll transport it for permanent storage, while a portion of it is routed back to the gasifier. Hartwig has previously, aptly described the power plant as a “vegetarian rocket engine.” Bebbington said Frontier estimates there is between one to five gigatons of waste biomass available every year. Others might decompose on a farm field to fertilize it. “We require that every ton delivered also meets sustainable biomass principles in a very clear way.” Even if only one gigaton meets those standards, there's still a lot of potential for BiCRS and its close cousin, bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS), to make a significant dent in future energy needs. Arbor's power plant could theoretically burn any source of hydrocarbons, including natural gas. “The system is specifically designed to be fuel flexible,” Hartwig said. “We would like BECCS to be a major player for data centers, industrial electrification, grid resilience,” Hartwig said. “But if any new fossil assets that are built, we'd like those to all be zero emission as well.

This year, the Dyson V11 Origin cordless vacuum has hit a record low, and it's selling out quick (over 9,000 units have been sold in the US alone since midnight). The Dyson V11 Origin, usually priced at $569, is available right now for $399. That's a $170 discount, or 30% off, which makes this the most affordable opportunity to bring home Dyson's advanced cleaning power. The digital motor within this V11 vacuum operates at an optimal speed of 125,000 RPM, and offers 60% more suction than the previous model Dyson cordless vacuums. This powerful motor gives a thorough clean on any type of floor surface, hardwood or carpet and moves smoothly through dust, debris, and pet hair. With up to 60 minutes of runtime on one battery, you can clean your entire home without interruption. The vacuum comes with a Motorbar cleaner head that's designed to give every kind of floor a deep clean, automatically detangling long hair and pet hair along the way. The accessories that come with it /such as the mini soft dusting brush, crevice tool, and hair screw tool) are ideal for dusting and cleaning everything. You will also be surprised by the great LCD display where power modes, maintenance notices, and remaining running time to the second are displayed. Last but not least: Dyson's advanced whole-machine filtration system traps 99.99% of particles as tiny as 0.3 microns, and circulates cleaner air back into your home. Now this is your chance to experience Dyson without paying full price. Don't wait too long, as deals like this tend to disappear quickly once Prime Day ends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From electric screwdrivers to SSD cloners, these are inexpensive game-changers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. As much as I love high-priced tech like my 4K projector or Audioengine A5+ speakers, most of us can't regularly spend several hundred dollars on a tech gift or purchase. But that doesn't mean you can't substantially improve your tech life (or the lives of your friends and family) while spending a comparatively small amount of money. Each of these products has made my nerdy world a little nicer in its own way. If you're looking for a small tech splurge for yourself during this Prime Day week, or an affordable gift for that techie friend or family member, one of these 50-or-under options might be just what you're after. A family member recently asked me for help with an older PC, which was desperately trying to run Windows 10 while housing several programs on an old 110 GB SSD. I figured, sure, I could clone the boot drive onto a more spacious drive so the OS and programs had more room to stretch their legs. But then the thought of using multiple USB enclosures or shuffling drives in and out of my desktop filled me with dread as I pictured being there for hours getting everything done and the system back up and running. With support for NVMe M.2 SSDs and offline cloning, this device makes it simple to move your OS or files from one drive to another. And with a 20 Gbps USB-C interface, it's also speedy in your OS of choice if you want to use software to clone or move your data between drives. Rosewill's NVMe SSD cloner is one of the more affordable options, and while I don't love its glossy plastic shell, it does support both NVMe M.2 drives as well as older AHCI models. The whole process took just a few minutes; the Rosewill cloner supports 20 Gbps USB, and I wasn't exactly copying a huge partition. Sure, unless you're in IT, a drive cloner might not be something you use all the time, but it's handy to have around. You can also use it to save some money by buying a laptop with a cramped SSD and swapping in something much roomier – provided, of course, the laptop's storage isn't soldered to the motherboard. I also own this model from Fideco, which costs less than $20. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found HOTO's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (and variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also good for assembling furniture.The HOTO won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. HOTO NEX O1 PRO 3.6V Screwdriver Set: now $32 at Amazon with coupon code FTTEU755 (was $60)HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I own the previous version of this device and love it for controlling and muting music at my treadmill desk while I work. It's totally plug and play as no drivers are needed. Vaydeer Volume Control Knob + Media Buttons: now $26 at Amazon with coupon (was $32)Just plug this simple USB device into a USB port and you can control the volume and select tracks without reaching for your keyboard or mouse. Between testing peripherals, external storage, and just generally being PC power user, I never seem to have enough USB ports within easy reach. Or at least that used to be the case until I picked up this 11-port USB 3.2 (10 Gbps) powered hub, and mounted it near the edge of my desk. Ikuai 11-in-1 Hybrid USB Hub: now $39 at Amazon (was $49) With 11 ports and up to 10 Gbps speed, a solid aluminum shell, and buttons so you can cut the power to individual ports, this USB hub is a great addition to your desk. If you often find yourself in need of more easily accessible USB ports, this is the best option I've found without spending more than twice as much on a laptop dock. OK, this one's only for the DIY-inclined, because it involves cutting a hole in your desk (or anywhere else you might want some flush-mount power ports, like a nightstand). Jgstkcity's recessed power strip lets you drop a couple of AC outlets and two USB charging ports (one 30W USB-C) anywhere you need them – again, once you've cut a hole for it.While it's always smart to be wary of no-name power strips, I've owned the older non-PD version of this strip for over two years and it's been functioning just fine. It's a super-convenient place for power outlets, especially when friends or family stop by. I just warn people not to put drinks there. Jgstkcity Recessed Power Strip: now $19 at Amazon (was $29)You'll likely need a drill and a saw to install it, but having a couple of power plugs and USB-C PD power right on the surface of your desk or nightstand is super convenient. Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices conk out while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus MVP 3 flat-top USB-C charging cable: $11 on Amazon with coupon (was $15)Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths. THe shorter model is better if you're charing off a battery pack nearby, but I'd definitely opt for the 6.6-foot model if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall. Note that the large top of the USB-C port will block adjacent ports or vents on some gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider that before buying. Also, as with most charging specific cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at USB 2.0 speed. But you also usually need a travel adapter to plug your devices into the outlets of other countries. Anker's Nano Travel adapter serves both needs well, as it's roughly half the thickness of other adapters and is designed to work in over 200 countries. The Nano Travel Adapter also has four USB ports for charging, which I've found super convenient for keeping my phone, ereader, and earbuds juiced up without needing a separate charger. Anker Nano Travel Adapter: now $19 at Amazon, was $25Anker's slim travel adapter is 43% smaller than many other adapters, while supporting over 200 countries with its fold-down plugs. The major downside over other travel chargers is that the Nano Travel Adapter doesn't support plugging in devices with three-prong (grounded) plugs. But I haven't found this an issue since I typically plug things like my Baseus flat laptop charger in while traveling, rather than high-power devices like a desktop PC or hair dryer. Panasonic's Eneloops arguably ushered in the rechargeable AA and AAA renaissance, but PowerOwl's batteries are a lot more affordable and I haven't had a single one fail in over three years of using them in my various remotes, smart door locks, and other devices. PowerOwl 8 AA Rechargeable Batteries With Charger: now $21 at Amazon with coupon (was $28)These  PowerOwl Pro AA batteries are rated to 2800mAh (though I wouldn't put stock in that spec) and are rated to keep 60% of their power for two years. Clip the coupon to get it at this price. If there's one thing everyone with modern tech could probably use at this point, it's an extra high-speed and compact charger. The Baseus 65W Flat Wall Charger is my new-found favorite. It's smaller than a deck of cards and easily fits in pretty much any bag pocket.Its slim shape should also help keep the device fully inserted in loose hotel room power sockets, and while the outer shell is plastic, the build quality feels solid, and it includes a 3.3-foot USB-C charging cable for those of us who aren't already drowning in cables from other devices. And who doesn't have an extra USB-A charging cable at this point? This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. TP-Link's AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter is here to solve that problem for you. It's quite large by USB Wi-Fi dongle standards, but I've found it works quite well with the Wi-Fi 6 router I bought in 2020. I have the router running downstairs from my office. And it instantly fixed an issue I was having with very poor reception from the SFF PC I built in the Fractal Terra case. TP-Link AX1800 WiFi 6 USB Adapter: now $26 at Amazon (was $49)Sure, it's big and bulky with two antennas, but this Wi-Fi 6 USB adapter can deliver some serious speed to your desktop or laptop when paired with a Wi-Fi 6 or later router. This is a four-port USB hub that's designed to clamp onto your desk and give you extra convenient connectivity. Orico's device delivers USB 3.0 speeds, which is good enough for most modern devices. It comes in black or silver and has a nice sturdy metal frame. Just note that its clamp section is pretty shallow and its adjustable screw can only open between 10 and 32 mm, so it won't fit on all desks. Orico USB 3.0 Clamp Hub: now $15 at Newegg (was $25)An otherwise standard four-port USB 3.0 hub, this Orico model stands out for its metal frame and clamp design. If you to get a handle on the PC cables in your home or office, some cheap cable management trays will do the job. This two-pack comes with tape, though heavier loads will ultimately require some screws.Besides the trays, this kit also comes with cable ties and a few cable clips you can place along the bottom or sides of your desk. But I had to screw it into my desk because it's holding one of the above Anker power strips, plus the large external power brick from my LG OLED TV/Monitor. Delamu 2-Pack Under Desk Cable Management Tray: now $23 at Amazon (was $29)If there's a rats nest of cables under your desk, attaching some trays can help you clean it up.

A class-action lawsuit against TSMC has now just gotten more intense. The class-action lawsuit accused TSMC of bias against American employees at its Fab 21 in Arizona, and the lawsuit has now expanded to include over 30 plaintiffs, with allegations ranging from discrimination and harassment to unsafe working conditions. One former senior technician, Phillip Sterbinsky, said he was insulted by managers who called him 'stupid and lazy' and ultimately became the last non-Asian in his department before resigning in 2024. Among the accusations are reports of openly racist remarks from Taiwanese staff members. Sterbinsky recounted hearing colleagues say that Black individuals were lazy and emitted unpleasant odors. Another plaintiff described arriving at the workplace to find a rubber chicken hanging over a Black coworker's desk, which he perceived as an act of targeted humiliation. Several plaintiffs claimed that TSMC held meetings and sent invitations in Mandarin, effectively excluding employees who did not speak the language. Even when positions did not require Mandarin proficiency, job postings often listed it as a desired skill. The complaint further alleges that TSMC's Taiwan-based HR team funneled pre-approved Taiwanese candidates to the U.S. branch, where they were hired without any publicly advertised openings. This practice allegedly enabled the company to bring in more foreign workers and reduce the number of union positions available to U.S. staff. Generally, it is believed that approximately half of TSMC Fab 21 employees are from Taiwan. "TSMC believes strongly in the value of a diverse workforce and we hire and promote without regard to gender, religion, race, nationality, or political affiliation because we respect differences, and believe that equal employment opportunities strengthen our competitiveness," a statement sent to Tom's Hardware read. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. One plaintiff, Marcus Hernandez, reported multiple safety violations at Fab 21. He described incidents in which managers pressured him to activate chemical systems without adequate protective gear. According to the lawsuit, TSMC even attempted to procure safety harnesses from the online marketplace Temu rather than from trustworthy suppliers. One male employee said he was repeatedly touched on the buttocks by older Taiwanese engineers. The same individual claimed he witnessed similar behavior directed at other American workers. Complaints about the work culture also included long shifts, frequent weekend assignments, and relentless pressure to meet production targets. Employees described the environment as excessively harsh, with inadequate training and constant stress contributing to high turnover. When questioned about why American employees had been replaced by Taiwanese nationals, TSMC's senior HR director, Ted Chiang, allegedly explained that the company was Asian. Meanwhile, former chairman Mark Liu previously stated that U.S. staff were not expected to match the strict work practices common in Taiwan, suggesting their conditions were easier.
