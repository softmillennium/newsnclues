                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The leading self-custody Web3 wallet, Best Wallet (BEST), is quickly becoming the go-to choice for crypto users, and much of that momentum comes down to one thing: user experience. In just about a year since launch, Best Wallet has captured significant market share by delivering a seamless, intuitive interface that appeals to both beginners and experienced traders alike. Its recent WalletConnect Certification, awarded last week, clearly validates that focus. The certification highlights Best Wallet's commitment to delivering a smooth, reliable user experience across thousands of dApps, without the friction common in older wallet models. That UX credibility, paired with its growing multichain capabilities and built-in discovery tools, is likely a major reason the project is now nearing the $14 million milestone in its ICO. Early investors are positioning themselves for long-term growth by securing the project's native token, BEST, during its current funding phase. BEST token is currently priced at $0.025295, with just five hours remaining in this round before the next scheduled price increase takes effect. On July 2, Best Wallet officially became WalletConnect Certified, a designation awarded to wallets that meet strict security, performance, and protocol integration standards. This certification, issued by the leading Web3 infrastructure provider WalletConnect, requires proven blockchain support, feature completeness, and high user adoption. This recognition highlights our commitment to reliable dApp connectivity, clean UX, and trusted infrastructure. This means faster connections, smoother sign-ins, and a better experience for every user. Earning a spot in this guide not only validates Best Wallet's rapid growth but also confirms its status among the top 50 most-used wallets in the crypto space. As a certified wallet, Best Wallet gains increased visibility and seamless access across thousands of WalletConnect-enabled dApps – with multichain compatibility already live and Solana integration on the way. That goal hinges on a balancing act that few wallets have pulled off: offering advanced functionality for power users while keeping the experience simple and accessible for beginners. This design philosophy is grounded in research showing that user-friendly interfaces lead to higher adoption rates. Once inside, users can import and manage wallets from multiple chains in one place, thanks to Best Wallet's multichain support. That unified experience is especially helpful for users who may be holding assets across ecosystems but want to manage everything in a single interface. Through integrations with MoonPay and Alchemy Pay, users can onramp fiat directly into supported networks – removing the need for external exchanges or complicated transfers. Best Wallet uses Fireblocks' MPC-CMP technology to split private keys into encrypted shards distributed across separate entities – removing any single point of failure. It also features automatic scam filters that detect and hide malicious tokens, plus two-factor authentication to secure app access at the device level. Best Wallet's growing user base – now averaging around 250,000 active users per month – isn't just a product of smooth design. It's also being driven by what the wallet empowers users to do. For advanced users, that means Best Wallet isn't just solving UX hurdles – it's also maximizing profit potential and execution efficiency at every step. One of the standout features driving this growth is Upcoming Tokens, a discovery tool that highlights promising crypto projects before they reach major exchanges. Since its launch, the feature has helped users get early exposure to projects that later made significant gains. For instance, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) recently surged 370% in 30 days and remains up 64% over the past two weeks. Another early highlight, Solaxy (SOLX), is up 10.5% in the past week. This combination of seamless trading, intelligent discovery, and portfolio-building tools shows how deeply Best Wallet integrates user-focused functionality. Best Wallet is no longer an upstart – it's now operating at the level of serious contenders. Upcoming features include the launch of Best Card for debit transactions, derivatives trading, a staking aggregator, MEV protection, gasless transactions, automated DCA tools, and real-time market intelligence – all aimed at making Best Wallet a complete Web3 command center. For users ready to be part of that evolution, the Best Wallet presale is open. Readers are advised to conduct their own research before engaging with any company mentioned.

Soluna Holdings (SLNH) shares rose in early trading Tuesday after the maker of green data centers announced an expansion of its Texas site with a company it called a “top-tier Bitcoin miner.”

“With this deal, Project Dorothy 2 is now fully marketed and contracted,” Soluna said.

The data center developer said it has expanded its flagship project site Project Dorothy 2 by 30 megawatts in its third buildout with this customer, which it didn't name.

“It's a major milestone in our growth pipeline, bringing 100% of our active facilities to full capacity,” Soluna CEO John Belizaire said.

Soluna shares rose 4.6% in early trading Tuesday. The company's shares have fallen almost 70% so far this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cardano Foundation, one of the main entities dedicated to advancing the Cardano blockchain, has unveiled Reeve, an enterprise-grade solution designed to enhance financial data management through blockchain technology. The solution, built on the Cardano blockchain, aims to streamline ESG reporting and audit compliance while addressing risks associated with traditional reporting platforms, such as susceptibility to error, lack of transparency, and operational inefficiencies caused by data silos. The Foundation says that Reeve allows organizations to maintain accessible, verifiable, and immutable records by anchoring financial data onto the Cardano blockchain. The platform integrates with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to provide tamper-resistant records and customizable transparency features. As part of the launch, the Cardano Foundation is inviting industry leaders and compliance-focused institutions to collaborate on early implementation. The initiative targets a broad range of sectors, including non-governmental organizations seeking to strengthen donor confidence, enterprises working to meet ESG standards, and public institutions aiming to improve transparency and accountability. The Foundation states that Reeve is not limited to financial use cases but is part of an extensive effort to demonstrate how blockchain can serve as a trust layer in enterprise environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visa-backed Airwallex, the international business payments company valued at $6.2 billion, is building a stablecoin team and infrastructure. Last month the company's CEO Jack Zhang took to social media expressing skepticism about the value of these digital currencies for cross border payments. “We are moving money at the cost of less than 0.01% and real time. The above figures point to average fees of more like 0.5%, but that's still reasonable and likely includes some card interchange fees. Outside the G10, Zhang acknowledged that stablecoins might be beneficial for exotic currencies where liquidity is poor. He also acknowledged Stripe's Bridge acquisition could usefully offer stablecoin wallets in LATAM and African countries, “but that's a regulatory arbitrage,” he wrote. However, Zhang's position proved more nuanced than initial reactions suggested. What many missed was his follow up blog post. He stood by his point about cross border payments. He argued for this to work it was essential to prove the money is clean, and only companies such as Airwallex, Stripe and Revolut have the infrastructure and distribution to do so. Most stablecoin startups without existing distribution will flounder in his view. Established platforms can convert existing money in their ecosystem to stablecoins and develop new financial products, including stablecoin cards, money market funds and lending. Business models include card interchange fees and interest income to start with. In case anyone was in doubt that he was a true skeptic, Zhang concluded that “Stablecoins aren't just about sending money between the exotic markets.</p>

The company is implementing a hybrid DeFi/TradFi financing model that combines multiple funding sources including ATM equity sales, convertible debt, and DeFi borrowing through Aave. The financing structure aims to minimize dilution while maximizing ETH holdings, with Aave borrowing offering an attractive 3% annual cost of capital with no dilution. BTCS's initiative comes as Ethereum returns to 2021 price levels, positioning the company to become a leading publicly traded entity focused on Ethereum infrastructure. BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) ha annunciato l'intenzione di raccogliere 100 milioni di dollari nel 2025 per acquisire Ethereum come parte della sua espansione strategica. BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) ha anunciado planes para recaudar 100 millones de dólares en 2025 para adquirir Ethereum como parte de su expansión estratégica. La estructura financiera busca minimizar la dilución mientras maximiza las tenencias de ETH, con préstamos en Aave que ofrecen un atractivo costo de capital anual del 3% sin dilución. 회사는 ATM 주식 판매, 전환사채, Aave를 통한 DeFi 대출 등 여러 자금원을 결합한 하이브리드 DeFi/TradFi 금융 모델을 도입하고 있습니다. 이 전략은 순자산가치(NAV) 레버리지 한도 40%를 유지하며, NodeOps 스테이킹과 Builder+ 블록 빌딩 통합을 포함하는 정교한 누적 성장 메커니즘을 활용합니다. 금융 구조는 희석을 최소화하면서 ETH 보유를 극대화하는 것을 목표로 하며, Aave 대출은 연 3%의 매력적인 자본 비용을 제공하며 희석이 없습니다. La structure de financement vise à minimiser la dilution tout en maximisant les avoirs en ETH, avec les emprunts Aave offrant un coût du capital annuel attractif de 3 % sans dilution. BTCS (Nasdaq: BTCS) hat Pläne angekündigt, im Jahr 2025 100 Millionen US-Dollar aufzubringen, um Ethereum im Rahmen seiner strategischen Expansion zu erwerben. Die Strategie hält eine Hebelobergrenze von 40 % des NAV ein und nutzt einen ausgeklügelten Akkretions-Mechanismus, der NodeOps-Staking und die Integration des Builder+ Blockaufbaus einbezieht. Die Initiative von BTCS erfolgt, während Ethereum auf das Preisniveau von 2021 zurückkehrt, und positioniert das Unternehmen als führendes börsennotiertes Unternehmen mit Fokus auf Ethereum-Infrastruktur. BTCS plans $100M Ethereum acquisition using innovative DeFi/TradFi financing, potentially strengthening their position as a public ETH infrastructure player. BTCS's announcement represents a significant strategic move in the cryptocurrency infrastructure space. The company intends to raise $100 million specifically to acquire Ethereum, utilizing what they're calling a "DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel" - an innovative financing approach combining traditional capital markets tools with decentralized finance mechanisms. The company is implementing a multi-pronged financing strategy with several components: their existing ATM (At-The-Market) equity program, convertible debt arrangements with ATW Partners, DeFi borrowing via Aave using ETH as collateral, yield generation from staking (what they call "NodeOps"), and integration with block building services. Notably, their Aave borrowing structure offers a remarkably low 3% capital cost without diluting shareholders. What makes this approach distinctive is BTCS's commitment to maintain a conservative 40% NAV (net asset value) leverage cap across their convertible debt and DeFi borrowings, suggesting a disciplined risk management framework. The company appears to be positioning itself as a publicly-traded proxy for Ethereum exposure with added operational capabilities. The timing is strategic - they specifically note Ethereum is at "2021 price levels," indicating they view current market conditions as favorable for accumulation. This move could potentially strengthen BTCS's position as one of the larger public holders of ETH while developing infrastructure around the Ethereum ecosystem. Silver Spring, MD, July  08, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS) (“BTCS” or the “Company”) short for Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions, a blockchain technology-focused company, today announced its strategic intent to raise $100 million in 2025 to acquire Ethereum. “We believe that Ethereum has significant growth potential and is central to the future digital financial infrastructure. Now, with Ethereum at 2021 price levels, is the time to deepen our exposure,” said Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS. This initiative represents a transformative expansion of BTCS's Ethereum-first strategy, leveraging a cutting-edge financing model that combines both decentralized finance (“DeFi”) and traditional finance (“TradFi”) mechanisms. The planned capital raises1 will be structured through a sophisticated DeFi/TradFi accretion flywheel consisting of At-The-Market (“ATM”) equity sales, convertible debt issuance, on-chain borrowing via Aave, yield generated from NodeOps (staking Ethereum), and vertical integration with Builder+ (block building), one of the most advanced opportunities for driving revenue and increasing ETH per share while minimizing dilution. This innovative mix of financing is designed to achieve the least dilutive cost of capital while expanding the Company's Ethereum holdings in a responsible and forward-looking manner, with the goal of increasing its ETH per share and simultaneously driving revenue growth. By utilizing both decentralized and institutional capital markets, BTCS aims to set a precedent for how public blockchain companies can bridge DeFi and TradFi to create shareholder value and foster trust in programmable financial systems. “We're engineering a capital structure that mirrors the ethos of crypto itself—efficient, transparent, and decentralized,” said Allen. “With 20 years of capital markets experience and 10 years at the forefront of crypto, BTCS is uniquely positioned to lead in this new paradigm. With a new crypto-friendly administration and increased institutional interest in Ethereum, now is the time to rapidly scale our operations.” The Company plans to provide additional updates, in accordance with its disclosure obligations under securities laws, regarding the specific timelines, instruments, and market conditions as part of its regular investor communications. Its branded block-building operation, Builder+, leverages advanced algorithms to optimize block construction for on-chain validation, thus maximizing gas fee revenues. BTCS also supports other blockchain networks by operating validator nodes and staking its crypto assets across multiple proof-of-stake networks, allowing crypto holders to delegate assets to BTCS-managed nodes. In addition, the Company has developed ChainQ, an AI-powered blockchain data analytics platform, which enhances user access and engagement within the blockchain ecosystem. Committed to innovation and adaptability, BTCS is strategically positioned to expand its blockchain operations and infrastructure beyond Ethereum as the ecosystem evolves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Semler, which spent over 15 years focused on chronic disease detection, adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May last year. The move made it only the second U.S.-listed firm, after Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Since then, the company has acquired roughly 4,636 BTC for $430 million, with an average cost basis of $92,753 per bitcoin, the report said. Palmer noted that the stock rallied 178% in the six and a half months following its Bitcoin Standard announcement, peaking at $81.56 in December 2024. However, the analyst argued that Semler still trades at a steep discount compared to bitcoin treasury peers. Its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.25, compared to 4.29 for Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) and 6.45 for France's Blockchain Group (ALTBG), the analyst noted. The report notes that resolving legal and regulatory headwinds from Semler's legacy healthcare business, including a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and Medicare reimbursement uncertainties, could help lift its valuation further. Benchmark's $101 price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that assumes bitcoin will hit $225,000 by year-end 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's latest round of tariffs – 25% on Japan and South Korea, plus vague threats to BRICS-aligned countries – have spooked investors. We've rounded up the best altcoins for safety amidst Trump tariffs. He's hitting Japan and South Korea with 25% tariffs starting August 1, threatening 10% on BRICS countries, and trying to spin it all as a deficit-fixing genius. Historically, Trump talks big, then backpedals – remember the last tariff showdown in April? So the correct narrative would be: Bitcoin dipped to around $76K in April, then recovered to hit a new all-time high (ATH) just shy of $112 K in May. But until the smoke clears, savvy investors are rotating into crypto presales and new crypto projects with utility, strong narratives, and room to grow. With Trump rattling markets again through a new wave of tariffs, many investors are searching for assets that can thrive amid chaos – not just survive it. In short: Bitcoin Hyper is where the action happens. Meme coins, payments, dApps, DeFi – it's all finally possible on Bitcoin. Right now you can buy $HYPER in the presale phase for just $0.012175, and it just passed the $2M raised milestone, signaling strong early momentum. In a world where political noise keeps disrupting the markets, Bitcoin Hyper offers what Bitcoin was always meant to be – fast, useful, and unstoppable. In moments like this, with Trump's tariff threats rattling global markets and Bitcoin dipping, smart investors look for real utility. It's the fuel behind Best Wallet, a sleek, secure, and highly functional multi-chain wallet built for both crypto newcomers and seasoned pros. There's also a major advantage for early adopters: the $BEST presale is live exclusively inside the app, rewarding people with early access and lower costs. With powerful features like iGaming bonuses, staking perks, and exclusive presale access via Upcoming Tokens, it's built to thrive even in shaky markets. Analysts predict $BEST could hit $0.072 in 2025 and $0.62 by 2026 – not bad for a ‘safe' play during tariff season. With Trump's tariffs rattling crypto sentiment, Bitcoin Solaris ($BTC-S) is another altcoin that offers a compelling alternative – real utility built on Bitcoin's legacy. This Layer‑1 hybrid blockchain combines Proof‑of‑Work security with a Delegated Proof‑of‑Stake layer, giving people 10K TPS and sub‑2‑second transaction finality – versus Bitcoin's sluggish 7 TPS and 60‑minute block times. You just tap ‘start,' and the app runs lightweight mining in the background, offering passive earnings and governance rights. $BTC‑S is currently in Phase 11 of its presale at $5, with a launch set for $20. In a nerve‑wracking market driven by Trump's political noise, Bitcoin Solaris gives investors real issuing power – not just meme hype. It represents bitcoin's evolution: scalable, accessible, and ready for action. The ones with real use cases, clear narratives, and solid tokenomics stick around. Whether you're betting on hyper-deflation with Bitcoin Hyper, better wallets with Best Wallet Token, or sharper tools with Bitcoin Solaris, these three altcoins could help you ride out the Trump storm in style.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto assets and social media are changing how finance operates. Uncertainty around the future of AI is affecting financial markets. Claudia Biancotti argues that regulators must expand their range of expertise and pursue a multidisciplinary approach to protecting society against the potential negative spillovers from these developments. Finance has a long history of shaping and being shaped by technological change. Over a century later, a consortium of financial institutions developed SWIFT, the global messaging network that enables cross-border payments to this day. From the first ATMs in the 1960s to banking apps on smartphones, new devices and communication protocols have impacted how people access, manage, and spend their money. Blockchains, digital ledgers that secure information on a decentralized basis, were originally created for financial use cases. Social media are changing the nature of retail investing, and AI is a driving force behind recent stock market trends. Whether these developments are good or bad for society, innovation is forcing regulators to rethink their strategies. This article draws on three case studies to show how financial authorities must incorporate a wider range of expertise to understand and address risks arising from the digital space. A staggering $1.46 billion in tokens was stolen in an attack attributed to Lazarus Group, a state-sponsored outfit from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). With a weak economy compounded by international sanctions, the DPRK and its nuclear program are in constant need of funding. A few years ago, Lazarus exfiltrated $101 million from the central bank of Bangladesh. It also targeted several commercial banks by leveraging compromised SWIFT credentials, with mixed results. In recent times, the attention of Lazarus and other hacker groups has shifted to crypto, which is a softer target because in most jurisdictions crypto intermediaries are not subject to equivalent cybersecurity requirements as traditional financial players. Researchers pointed out that specific technical measures, such as double-checking of all outgoing transactions on separate devices, could have prevented or mitigated the Bybit hack. Hackers are also attracted to crypto because its decentralized, anonymous features can facilitate money laundering. While jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union have made significant inroads against crypto launderers, there is still plenty of complacency elsewhere. Unlike other victims of high-profile crypto hacks, Bybit did not fold. It faced strong withdrawal pressure from customers in the days following the attack and shouldered it well, allegedly with its own resources and loans from industry partners. In the past, technical, financial, and governance vulnerabilities in crypto were a concern only for those willing to take their chances on an opaque, risky market, in exchange for the possibility of very high returns. This is changing fast, as the crypto ecosystem becomes increasingly interconnected with traditional finance. Crypto companies are listed on regulated markets, stablecoin issuers hold their reserves in government bonds and banks, and blockchains may become a part of mainstream payment infrastructure. As recently pointed out by Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot, crypto may be reaching a tipping point where it becomes a risk to financial stability. Insufficient oversight even in a single jurisdiction may lead to poor outcomes for all users. On January 28, 2021, financial news outlets were abuzz with the exceptional stock market performance of GameStop, a video game retailer. As members bought shares, congratulated each other on successful trades, and posed as champions of the people against Wall Street short sellers, the price steadily went up. Proponents maintain that new generations, contrary to their parents, have no chance at socio-economic advancement based on education and hard work alone, and that their only shot at building generational wealth is investing on the right tail of the risk distribution. Meme stocks still exist today, and 2025 has seen increasing interest in meme coins, crypto assets that are similarly propelled by popularity in online communities. Discussion of financial assets over the internet is not necessarily a negative phenomenon. Still, this only works if the information is correct. Some so-called finfluencers, internet personalities specializing in financial advice, promote fraudulent schemes. Problematic angles can emerge even if no outright fraud is present. Legal scholar Sue Guan notes that finfluencers, rather than simply seeking to disseminate facts on asset value, aim to maximize (and monetize) their own popularity. This can lead to clickbait and less-than-accurate posts, which ultimately “distort prices, negatively affecting corporate governance, capital raises, securities litigation, and market confidence.” More worryingly, malicious actors, state-sponsored or otherwise, may seek to leverage social media to undermine market fairness and financial stability, with strategic aims beyond monetary gain. There is no evidence that such actors played a part in the GameStop rally, but social media have been exploited for influence operations before, and it may only be a matter of time until this happens in the financial space. Regulators and supervisors may benefit from understanding and monitoring online culture, no matter how seemingly inane, or even toxic, internet chatter appears at times. Authorities should develop the legal and technical tools to spot potential malfeasance quickly and intervene in a timely manner, especially given the speed at which viral online content can trigger real-world market consequences, even for investors who do not partake in internet discussion forums. Its performance was comparable to that of leading U.S. competitors. Among the worst-hit companies were chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom, as the effectiveness of U.S. export controls aimed at depriving China of computational ability was called into question. Some pundits contended that Deepseek's researchers, underfunded and under-resourced, were able to score a victory against U.S. labs based on cleverness alone. On closer scrutiny, cracks emerged in this David-versus-Goliath narrative. Cutting-edge GPUs were allegedly smuggled to DeepSeek in violation of U.S. restrictions. Even if all the company's claims were true, DeepSeek's offering would still be more of a marginal improvement than foundational breakthrough. Underlying most contemporary LLMs, including R1, is a technology introduced in 2017 by researchers at Google, which was progressively refined through the years. DeepSeek's developers also failed to acknowledge important security concerns. This is especially troubling from an open-source model, which can be integrated in other applications at low cost. The world is headed into significant uncertainty about developments in AI and how they impact issues of privacy, copyright, national security, and the integrity of the marketplace of ideas.We can guess very little about the timeline and content of new discoveries, and how they will affect us. Rather than pursuing direct regulatory action, authorities may want to establish a presence in the public debate that contributes to a balanced, informed evaluation of events. Regulators cannot solve all problems of the digital sphere on their own. Financial authorities need to prepare for the future by reinforcing their ability to decipher technological progress and its interactions with broader economic and strategic dynamics. This should be done vertically, through talent acquisition in fields such as computer science, international relations, and new media. It should be done horizontally, by reinforcing ties with academia, the national security community, and other institutions, with careful consideration of complementarities and mandate limits. While no individual jurisdiction offers a perfect model, some central banks are already staffing their innovation hubs with crypto experts and AI engineers, and some countries already integrate financial authorities in national security discussions. Yet, global consensus is hard to achieve at this moment in history. Multilateral efforts should be pursued whenever possible, starting from areas where the interests of most countries are still aligned—cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, and countering terrorism financing come to mind. When agreement is out of reach, authorities should pursue local protections against the negative spillovers from weak regulation, while being mindful of possible loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis jurisdictions that opt for no or very lax oversight. As deeper and broader knowledge is acquired, it should be deployed towards the design of regulation that is commensurate with today's challenges. Authorities should be open to overseeing technology with technology, including integration of AI and even crypto-native constructs in regulatory design and supervisory practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metaplanet aims to leverage its growing Bitcoin treasury to acquire cash-generating businesses, with a digital bank in Japan among its possible targets. Japanese firm Metaplanet plans to eventually use its Bitcoin reserves to acquire cash-generating businesses, possibly including a digital bank in Japan. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich said the company is racing to accumulate as much Bitcoin (BTC) as possible before turning its holdings into leverage for expansion. “We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush,” Gerovich said. Gerovich said Metaplanet's future acquisitions would ideally align with its strategy, so “maybe it is acquiring a digital bank in Japan and providing digital banking services that are superior to the services that retail now is getting.” While crypto-backed lending remains rare in traditional banking, some institutions are beginning to explore it. In April, Standard Chartered and OKX launched a pilot program allowing institutions to use crypto and tokenized money market funds as collateral. On Monday, Metaplanet added 2,204 BTC to its reserves for $237 million, with each Bitcoin bought at about $107,700. The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 15,555 BTC at an average purchase price of around $99,985 per coin. Metaplanet's stock has climbed over 345% this year, lifting its market cap above $7 billion despite limited revenue. The company mirrors Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds over 597,000 BTC and has a $112 billion market cap.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bit Digital has gone all-in on Ethereum after offloading all of its Bitcoin to buy ETH. “Following a $172 million public equity raise and conversion of its balance sheet from Bitcoin to Ethereum, Bit Digital has accumulated over 100K ETH to become one of the largest corporate treasury companies in the world,” the firm stated on July 7. Bit Digital (NASDAQ $BTBT) sold its entire BTC stack, raised $172mn, and now holds ≈100,603 ETH, vaulting into the top tier of corporate ETH treasuries. “Ethereum's programmable nature, growing adoption, and staking yield model represent the future of digital assets.” He said the firm was aligning itself with Ethereum's “long-term potential” while positioning itself as a focused Ethereum treasury platform in the public markets. Bit Digital has joined the ranks of Joe Lubin's gaming firm SharpLink and Tom Lee's Bitmine, which launched a $250 million Ethereum treasury last week. ETH-forward treasury strategies are graduating from thesis to trend,” commented former Ethereum developer Eric Conner. As usual, Ethereum prices have not reacted and have gone in the opposite direction again, in line with the wider market retreat today. Ethereum is still tightly range-bound, in a sideways channel where it has been stuck for the past two months. Martin has been writing on cybersecurity and infotech for over two decades.

According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we're breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC. “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we'll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
