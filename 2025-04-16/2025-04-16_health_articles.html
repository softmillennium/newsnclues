                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using survey data from the Statistics Canada General Social Survey on victimization as well as interviews with 16 male survivors, the study found men were significantly less likely to seek outside help compared to women. "When intimate partner violence happens to men, it often feels like they're left to cope alone," says Alexandra Lysova, SFU criminology professor and co-author of a new study published in the Journal of Family Violence. "Many deny the abuse, withdraw from social activities and relationships and throw themselves into work to avoid what's happening at home." These avoidant strategies can prevent men from seeking support such as therapy or separation, she says. As a result, male survivors may experience worsening depression, substance misuse, and emotional distress, which can escalate the risks in the relationship. This is especially concerning, says Lysova, because while violence is mainly bi-directional, women tend to experience the most severe consequences - 79 per cent of intimate partner homicide victims are women, for example. This research highlights a critical gap in support services and the importance of addressing intimate partner violence as a human issue - not just a gendered one, Lysova argues. There is a lack of gender-inclusive public awareness campaigns, training and protocols for front-line professionals-such as police, social workers and doctors-who are often the first point of contact for someone seeking help. Even when governments issue reports or expand services, they typically highlight female victims, leaving male survivors invisible." Helping male survivors will help society more broadly, in part by reducing risk factors for future violence perpetrated by those who witnessed intimate partner abuse as children, Lysova adds. "When we help men, we also help women and children -- and ultimately, society," Lysova explains. Addressing violence in all its forms - regardless of the victim's gender - helps create safer communities for everyone."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For people with spinal cord injuries/diseases (SCI/D), performing daily tasks can be a challenge due to an impaired ability to grasp and manipulate objects with their hands. University of Cincinnati researchers, in collaboration with end users in the community, have received a $200,000 grant from Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) to design a user-centered, easy-to-use assistive device to help restore hand grasping motions. UC's Derek Wolf, PhD, the project's principal investigator, said biomedical engineers have developed many exoskeletons - robotic devices worn over the user's hand - to assist with grasping. These devices often work well in lab settings, but few end users adopt hand exoskeletons and wear them in real-world settings for the long term. We make these really cool devices, but they don't get to that next step for any number of reasons. What we're trying to do with this project is involve end users throughout and focus on actually making a device that will translate beyond the lab." "If you just put an exo on someone's hand, you're not really taking advantage of the hand that is there, arm muscles that are there," Wolf said. We can use those muscles to generate force or motion." Wolf's background includes expertise in FES and incorporating it into hybrid systems. While the goal is to eventually fully integrate FES with a motorized exoskeleton, this project will first try to combine FES with a passive exoskeleton that cannot move on its own. "FES can be hard to control and get fine motor control, so our hope is to use the exo on top of it to make that control easier while the motion is still driven by the FES," Wolf explained. "So if FES causes a finger to move, the exo is going to move with it and get a nice grasp." As paid members of the research team for the full two years of the project, advocates Sarah Elam and Dave Reed will provide input on their needs and test prototypes and new designs so that the final product can be useful and functional for end users like themselves. "Professor Wolf told me, 'You can't simulate disability,'" said Elam, 48, who has multiple sclerosis and is a quadriplegic with limited use of her nondominant left hand. It's been very important to them that I know I'm a teammate and not just the disabled person coming in to help them." "I said yes to the project because I thought it would help other people like me, and I thought it'd be interesting, from a mental health sort of view, to be part of something bigger than myself," Reed said. I thought it'd be good to be part of a kind of science project, and I'm really looking forward to doing this." Elam noted that even in the project's early stages, it has been exciting to make progress as a team. "But there's excitement around - oh, holy crap, that worked the way we wanted it to!" Wolf said engineers can often get caught up in an engineering challenge or big idea they believe will help users, but at the end of the project their innovations do not solve any real-world problems. Ryan Cuda, a student pursuing his PhD in mechanical engineering, will lead much of the day-to-day design aspects of the project and said he was envisioning working on projects like this when weighing graduate programs. "I chose UC because it offers great opportunities to work in biomechanics, and having the medical school nearby is a huge advantage for collaboration and research," he said. "At a lot of schools and in many research programs, you do the work but never see it lead to real-world change. "From there, we're working in two-month sprints: designing a prototype, gathering feedback from users, refining the design and repeating the process to keep improving with each iteration," Cuda said. Working on a PVA grant is personal for Cuda, who comes from a military family and planned to join the military himself before an arm injury derailed his plans. "I understand the kind of support veterans and service members truly need, and I constantly hear about the gaps in care they're facing," Cuda said. "My grandpa was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and since they work closely with PVA, it's really meaningful to come full circle and contribute to that same mission."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This technology did, however, yield an 8% (95% CI, 6-10) absolute increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and a 2% (95% CI, 0-4) increase in the detection rate of advanced adenomas and/or sessile serrated lesions. “How this translates into a reduction in CRC incidence or death is where we were uncertain,” Sultan said. “Our best effort at trying to translate the ADR and other endoscopy outcomes to CRC incidence and CRC death relied on the modeling study, which included a lot of assumptions, which also contributed to our overall lower certainty.” The systematic and meta-analysis included 41 randomized controlled trials with more than 32,108 participants who underwent CADe-assisted colonoscopy. This technology was associated with a higher polyp detection rate than standard colonoscopy: 56.1% vs 47.9% (relative risk [RR], 1.22, 95% CI, 1.15-1.28). It also had a higher ADR: 44.8% vs 37.4% (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16-1.29). But although CADe-assisted colonoscopy may increase ADR, it carries a risk for overdiagnosis, as most polyps detected during colonoscopy are diminutive (< 5 mm) and of low malignant potential, the panel noted. More than 15 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States, but studies have demonstrated variable quality of colonoscopies across key quality indicators. “Artificial intelligence [AI] is revolutionizing medicine and healthcare in the field of GI [gastroenterology], and CADe in colonoscopy has been brought to commercialization,” Sultan told Medscape Medical News. “Unlike many areas of endoscopic research where we often have a finite number of clinical trial data, CADe-assisted colonoscopy intervention has been studied in over 44 randomized controlled trials and numerous nonrandomized, real-world studies. The question of whether or not to adopt this intervention at a health system or practice level is an important question that was prioritized to be addressed as guidance was needed.” Commenting on the guideline but not involved in its formulation, Larry S. Kim, MD, MBA, a gastroenterologist in Denver, said his practice group has used the GI Genius AI system in its affiliated hospitals but has so far chosen not to implement the technology at its endoscopy centers. “With different priorities, other bodies could reasonably decide to recommend either for or against CADe.” According to Sultan, gastroenterologists need a better understanding of patient values and preferences and the value placed on increased adenoma detection, which may also lead to more lifetime colonoscopies without reducing the risk for CRC. Ultimately, the living guideline underscores the trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects and the limitations of current evidence to support a recommendation, but CADe has to improve as an iterative AI application with further validation and better training. With the anticipated improvement in software accuracy as AI machine learning reads increasing numbers of images, Sultan added, “the next version of the software may perform better, especially for polyps that are more clinically significant or for flat sessile serrated polyps, which are harder to detect. These guidelines were fully funded by the AGA Institute with no funding from any outside agency or industry. Sultan is supported by the US Food and Drug Administration. Theodore R.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2025 alone, doctors and legislators across the country have already introduced more than 100 pieces of legislation meant to reform prior authorization. The cumbersome approval process is a leading cause of burnout among doctors, and changing it is a top priority of the American Medical Association (AMA). Leaders in the health-tech arena believe prior authorization is ripe for an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation. The problem is that most doctors aren't on board. If the process isn't reformed to be more transparent and patient-centric, AI will simply make a flawed system work faster. For example, the Medscape Physician and Prior Authorization Report 2024 found that: “The danger of layering AI on top of a broken system is that, while it offers a lot in terms of efficiency, if you introduce more efficiency and speed into that system, you just speed up the rate at which you do bad things,” said Amy Killelea, JD, assistant research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, Washington, DC. It's unclear how widely AI is already used in prior authorization. A new survey of 93 health insurers released at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) conference in March 2025 reported that 92% use, plan to use, or are exploring AI and machine learning. The preliminary results were not explicit about how health insurers are employing AI. If they're using the algorithm to collect relevant data from the medical record more quickly, that's a use case no one would have a problem with, Killelea said. But algorithms making decisions about claims and denying care is a problem. Cigna and UnitedHealth already face class action lawsuits after investigations showed they used AI to deny claims without doctor oversight. These kinds of if/then algorithms are too fragile for the complex reasoning it takes to evaluate claims, Lenert said. Doctors are rallying to slow the use of AI in prior authorization — but contrary to popular belief and some headlines, it's not because they're anti-technology. “AI is probably a great way to save time and control cost. We have no problem with AI being involved in the first look” at a claim, said Sarah Lee-Davisson, MD, a general surgeon and an advocate for an Arizona bill regulating AI in prior authorization. Even without AI, prior authorization is already a black box. Physicians often get little or no feedback on why a claim is denied and the approval metrics are constantly changing. Brian Callaghan, MD, a neurologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, recently spent months working to get one of his patients rituximab. By contrast, he never has problems getting the drug for his patients at Veterans Affairs, where there's only one payer. “With private insurance, you feel like they are trying to deny as many things as possible,” said Callaghan, who is also lead author on a 2024 paper on using AI to refine prior authorization. Some form of cost containment is essential, but it needs to be easy, he said. He said that having a complex process means fewer things are approved — not because of science or clinical appropriateness, but because the process is challenging. And payers have a clear conflict of interest, said Lenert. Doctors already put in long hours and have designated staff members handling prior authorization. While he's a firm believer that AI could help solve some of these problems if prior authorization continues as it is — complicated, ever-changing, and hard to speak to a peer physician — then AI may very well make the process even harder, he said. Still, doctors hope that if prior authorization is made more transparent, AI could relieve a huge burden. The technology could minimize time spent on paperwork for both sides. And if the first look at a claim is automated, approvals could happen faster. Start-ups in the space are already building AI-based tools to consolidate disjointed insurance portals, speed up pre-visit insurance verification, determine where prior authorization is needed, and automatically submit electronic requests to appropriate payers. In the future, more sophisticated generative AI algorithms probably could tackle denials, Lenert said. “Even if [AI could] turn around claim denials faster and give an explicit reason why, that would be a service.” That would give doctors far more information than they have to go on today. California and Colorado have already passed legislation limiting automated decision-making systems in prior authorization. Texas, Arizona, Connecticut, and Indiana have similar bills in the works. We accept that algorithms have some role in patient care,” he said. “But if you're denying care, it should be by someone trained to practice medicine.” She has a master's degree from NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, New York City, and a master's in molecular nutrition from Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nuclera, the biotechnology company accelerating protein expression and optimization through its benchtop eProtein Discovery™ system, today announced the addition of a new membrane protein workflow to its system. This expanded capability enables the expression, purification and stabilization of challenging membrane proteins, which are often key targets in therapeutic development. Using cell-free protein synthesis, digital microfluidics, and optimized additive screening, eProtein Discovery can express and purify functional, correctly folded membrane proteins, in 48 hours. Membrane proteins play vital roles in regulating cellular processes and many are implicated in the development and progression of disease. 60% of FDA-approved drugs target membrane proteins1 yet the extraction and stabilization of these structurally complex proteins remains challenging due to their intrinsic hydrophobic nature. In 24 hours, eProtein Discovery evaluated different expression and purification conditions, including assessing the effects of using nanodiscs, lipids and detergents, to identify the optimal conditions for producing soluble, stable MsbA and ZMPSTE24. Scale-up production of these membrane proteins was achieved within 48 hours, enabling rapid functional evaluation. MsbA and ZMPSTE24 generated using eProtein Discovery had high-yield, were functionally active, and compatible with cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Existing eProtein Discovery users can access this new membrane protein production capability through a software update. Membrane protein production has long been a technical challenge, often resulting in misfolded or inactive proteins. eProtein Discovery overcomes these challenges, enabling scientists to rapidly produce functional membrane proteins, accelerating drug discovery and structural biology workflows.” Dr Toby Ost, SVP of Product Development, Nuclera Dr Konstantinos Beis, Reader in Membrane Protein Structural Biology, Imperial College London, added: “The eProtein Discovery System is a welcome new toolkit for membrane protein production. We were commissioned via Imperial Consultants to test the protein quality in our lab - and the early results are promising.” Posted in: Device / Technology News | Histology & Microscopy Please use one of the following formats to cite this article in your essay, paper or report: Nuclera expands eProtein Discovery capabilities to enable membrane protein production.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Could a planet-friendly diet also shield your brain? New study links EAT-Lancet eating patterns to lower dementia risk, but only if your genes play along. Study: Associations between the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet and incident dementia. In a recent study in The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, researchers used a large (n = 25,898, age = 45–73 yrs) Swedish cohort to elucidate any relationships between the EAT-Lancet diet and dementia incidence. The impacts of covariates, including APOE ε4 status, were also estimated. Study findings revealed that the EAT-Lancet diet does not exacerbate dementia risk, instead potentially reducing incident dementia in non-carriers of the APOE ε4 gene. Participants excluding red meat entirely scored lower on some metrics, challenging assumptions about “all-or-nothing” approaches to planetary health diets. Advances in medical research and clinical interventions are allowing humans to live longer than ever before. While the benefits of these advances cannot be understated, they have resulted in more of the global population surviving beyond reproductive age, increasing the incidence of non-communicable age-associated diseases such as cancers and dementia. To combat the burden of these diseases, several past and ongoing scientific studies aim to unravel the risk factors associated with these diseases, thereby equipping public health agencies with the knowledge required to curb their incidence. Using these research findings, the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention has identified several (n = 14) modifiable factors that can exacerbate dementia risk, including physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity. Some 'healthy' diets, such as the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), have been found to reduce dementia risk, while unhealthy diets like the Western diet (WD) exacerbate it. The diet is primarily plant-based, leading some experts to believe that it may reduce mortality risk, while others argue that it may negatively impact brain health via nutrient deficiencies. The study tracked participants for an average of 18 years, offering insight into how midlife eating habits might shape brain health much later on. Study data were obtained from Swedish Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) participants, a long-term, extensive (n = 68,905) cohort investigation of Swedish individuals initiated between 1991 and 1996. The present analyses included individuals aged 45–73 with complete dementia and dietary data. The collected study data included dietary assessment, dementia evaluation, genetic risk determination, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation evaluations, and sociodemographic information. The comprehensive dietary assessment comprised participants' dietary history, recorded using validated 7-day food diaries, participant-completed food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) comprising 168 items, and seven EAT-Lancet adherence scores. Genetic predisposition to dementia risk was evaluated using participants' apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles as proxies, with APOE ε4 status (carrier/non-carrier) serving as a binary analysis variable. Participants' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ42 measured via INNOTEST ELISA were used for Aβ analyses. Sociodemographic information, particularly body mass index (BMI), physical activity levels (17 activities), alcohol consumption, education level, and smoking status, was used for potential confounder analyses. For further details, please refer to section 1 of the Commission. There was no link between following the EAT-Lancet diet and amyloid-β pathology, a hallmark of Alzheimer's, which points to other possible ways diet could protect the brain. Diet-dementia association analyses revealed that five of the seven evaluated scores suggested that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence lowered the risk of developing (all-cause) dementia. However, after adjusting for education as a potential confounder, three scores remained statistically significant, and after full adjustment for all confounders (including age, sex, season, education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, and energy intake), only one score (the Kesse-Guyot score) continued to show a significant association with reduced all-cause dementia risk. When evaluating AD risk, one score suggested that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence was positively associated with reduced AD risk. None of the models (with or without covariate corrections) suggest that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence increases dementia risk, validating its safety. This highlights the importance of how dietary adherence is evaluated in such research. When correcting for participants' APOE ε4 status, logistic regression analyses revealed an interplay between diet and genetic predisposition to dementia, particularly for non-carriers. Carrier participants did not reveal any changes in their risk, but non-carriers were observed to significantly reduce their all-cause (three scores) and AD (five scores) risk following EAT-Lancet dietary adherence. VaD risks demonstrated no such associations with genetic status. No associations were found between EAT-Lancet dietary adherence and amyloid-β (Aβ42) pathology, as measured in the subsample with available CSF data. The authors also performed a range of sensitivity analyses, such as excluding participants with diabetes or those who developed dementia within five years of baseline, and found similar patterns in results, supporting the robustness of their main findings. Instead, the diet may significantly reduce dementia (all-cause and AD) risk, particularly in APOE ε4 non-carriers. However, since this was an observational study, the findings cannot prove causality, and limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, potential misreporting of dietary intake, and changes in diet over the long follow-up period. "While intervention studies are needed to further clarify the impact of the EAT-Lancet diet on dementia incidence, results from this study indicate that environmental sustainability can be implemented into dietary guidelines in dementia prevention strategies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Johns Hopkins Medicine-led analysis of medical information gathered on a diverse group of almost 250,000 people over four years has significantly clarified the link between the "exclusive" use of e-cigarettes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as high blood pressure in a sub-group of adults 30 to 70 years of age. 15 edition of Nicotine & Tobacco Research, underscore the potential risks of e-cigarette use, and should provide context to inform advice and regulatory policies about the health risks of so-called vaping products. The new analysis, they note, further verifies that while the use of either e-cigarettes or traditional "combustible" cigarettes is linked to higher risks and rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the effect is substantially stronger for traditional cigarettes. While e-cigarettes are often marketed as being safe, some studies have indicated that e-cigarette aerosols may contain significant levels of dangerous organic compounds and higher levels of nicotine, which can be addictive and harmful. Studies over many decades have shown that combustible cigarettes consistently increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. According to the CDC, combustible cigarette users account for 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths in the US. As a result, "there remains great uncertainty about the relative harm of e-cigarettes as compared to traditional smoking. Until now, there has been scant longitudinal data in large high-quality datasets linking exclusive e-cigarettes use to new-onset cardiometabolic health conditions," says Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., senior author of the study and professor of cardiology and epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. For the analysis, researchers used medical information on 249,190 people, including 203,932 who reported never using e-cigarettes or combustible cigarettes (203,932), 3,164 who reported exclusively using e-cigarettes, 33,778 who reported exclusively using combustible cigarettes, and 8,316 who reported using both e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. Those who experienced disease were characterized by their e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use patterns. Of those cases, it was found that exclusive e-cigarette use was not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes, heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but it was significantly associated with COPD. In contrast, results showed that exclusive use of combustible cigarettes significantly increased the risks for all outcomes, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, COPD, heart failure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar results were shown for dual use of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes although risk estimates were slightly larger than for exclusive combustible cigarette use. These results are a critical stepping stone for future prospective research on the health effects of e-cigarettes. While in this short-term study there was no association between exclusive e-cigarette use and cardiovascular events, there was an association with incident COPD and possibly hypertension that will need to be closely watched over longer term follow-up." Blaha says the new study suggests that e-cigarettes have definite potential health risks, although the risks may be less than what is seen for traditional combustible cigarette smoking alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vision is one of the most complex functions of our brain and requires a seamless interaction between many different brain structures to decode shapes, colours, depths, and movements and turn them into a meaningful whole. Just like other brain functions, vision also depends on a balanced and controlled interaction between the chemical signals that "activate" and "brake" activity in the eye's cells – much like the accelerator and brake of a car. Neuroscientific researchers have long been particularly interested in understanding how networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons work together. It has been a fundamental challenge to uncover how these complex interactions in neural circuits create the precise and targeted actions that underlie both vision and other cognitive processes. In total, the researchers mapped 44 different visual cells – some of which had never been described before. What was even more interesting was that these cells were characterized by a higher degree of systematic organization than previously known. "Our result can be compared to finding a complicated map of an unknown landscape. Previously, we thought the landscape was randomly divided, but now we have mapped it, so we can see that each region has its own precise path and function," explains Professor Keisuke Yonehara, elaborating: "By understanding how the different cells in the retina are organized and work in specific directions, we have revealed how the brain can precisely 'see' movement and orientation in our visual field – as if they have found the most efficient route through a complex network." The research group's results have just been published in the prestigious journal Nature Neuroscience, and according to Keisuke Yonehara, this could be a breakthrough in understanding where and how certain eye disorders develop and occur. Many eye disorders are linked to imbalances in inhibitory signalling, including congenital nystagmus, where the eyes move involuntarily, quickly, and rhythmically. Now we have a 'map' that can give us deeper insights into this condition and hopefully also others related to this area."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology have discovered a promising strategy to improve treatment responses in multiple myeloma patients by blocking a protein that plays a key role in drug resistance. The study, published in Pharmacological Research, offers a potential new strategy to improve outcomes for patients whose disease has become less responsive to standard therapies. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. Patients are often treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid frequently used in the clinic to regulate immune responses and slow cancer growth. However, as the disease progresses, many patients develop resistance to glucocorticoids. CCR1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of myeloma cells, through which the cells respond to chemical signals in the bone marrow environment and helps cancer cells to grow and survive. When we block CCR1 signaling, we see enhanced anti-cancer effects of dexamethasone in both lab models and patient samples." Bert Luyckx, first author of the study The team used a CCR1 inhibitor called BX471 and found that it helped to restore the effects of dexamethasone in cells that had started to become resistant. "By targeting CCR1, we were able to partially reverse glucocorticoid resistance in multiple myeloma cells," said Prof. Karolien De Bosscher. "This could offer new therapeutic opportunities for patients who no longer benefit from existing treatments." The findings suggest that CCR1 inhibitors could be used alongside current treatments to enhance their effectiveness. Further research is needed to explore how this approach can be applied in clinical settings. CCR1 inhibition sensitizes multiple myeloma cells to glucocorticoid therapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pediatric infectious diseases experts stress the importance of vaccination against measles, one of the most contagious viruses, which is once more spreading in the United States. The most effective way to prevent measles is vaccination. If parents are concerned that their child was exposed to measles or may have measles, they should call their child's doctor. They should not attempt to treat measles on their own without a physician's advice." Caitlin Naureckas Li, MD MHQS, lead author, infectious diseases specialist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Measles carries risk of serious complications that may require hospitalization. Dr. Li and colleagues point out that in 2024 in the U.S., 40 percent of people with confirmed measles were hospitalized, including 52 percent of children under 5 years and 25 percent of those 5-19 years. Encephalitis – an illness that can be fatal or lead to long-term brain damage in survivors – occurs in about one out of every 1,000 cases. SSPE, a near-universally deadly brain disorder that occurs years after measles infection, is another potential complication that strikes one in 100,000 cases, with higher risk in children under 1 year of age. "MMR vaccination is safe," emphasized Dr. Li. "This vaccine is the best way for families to protect their children from potentially life-threatening complications." Ann & Robert H.
