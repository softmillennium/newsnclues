                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an eleventh-hour scramble before a key contract was set to expire on Tuesday night, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency renewed its funding for the longtime software-vulnerability-tracking project known as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program. Managed by the nonprofit research-and-development group MITRE, the CVE Program is a linchpin of global cybersecurity—providing critical data and services for digital defense and research. The CVE Program is governed by a board that sets an agenda and priorities for MITRE to carry out using CISA's funding. A CISA spokesperson said on Wednesday that the contract with MITRE is being extended for 11 months. “Last night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. “Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a US government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract. The CVE Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment. Researchers and cybersecurity professionals were relieved on Wednesday that the CVE Program hadn't suddenly ceased to exist as the result of unprecedented instability in US federal funding. And many observers expressed cautious optimism that the incident could ultimately make the CVE Program more resilient if it transitions to be an independent entity that isn't reliant on funding from any one government or other single source. “The CVE Program is critical, and it's in everyone's interest that it succeed," says Patrick Garrity, a security researcher at VulnCheck. Federal procurement records indicate that it costs in the tens of millions of dollars per contract to run the CVE Program.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eric Mueller of the punk rock record label Pirates Press was wondering whether he could classify his company's records—which include colored vinyl releases by bands like Rancid, the Slackers, and Cock Sparrer—as “informational material.” Doing so would allow the records to be imported from overseas pressing plants without incurring a tariff under a little-known law. More than anything Mueller is hoping to find peace of mind. Manufacturers and brokers, mom-and-pop and otherwise, are aligned in recognizing that any additional costs incurred by tariffs will ultimately be passed onto consumers. Even a 10 percent increase incurred by Trump's (as of this moment) revised, across-the-board tariffs could make a significant dent in an industry already negatively impacted by inflation and rising costs. “Look at the math: Peoples' incomes haven't gone up by that much,” he says. If the cost of records goes up, it's not a good thing. But the industry's potential, label-saving exception comes from the Berman Amendment, which provides exemptions to “informational materials” like books, films, tapes, CDs, and other media containing material protected under the First Amendment, regardless of their country of origin. Passed by Congress in 1988 and authored by Democratic Representative Howard Berman, the amendment was one of the earliest obstructions in lawmakers' attempts to ban TikTok, with a Washington Post headline calling it “an obscure hurdle.” “What this exemption does,” Mueller explains, “is make sure there's still a free flow of information.” Under the current Berman Amendment carve-outs, all of those records could be imported Stateside without being impacted by massive tariffs. “There's no tariff paid on importing a completed record, but there are tariffs paid bringing in the materials,” explains Michael Greig Thomas, director of the Athens, Georgia, vinyl manufacturer Echo Base. Actual, US-based vinyl companies stand to face hefty increases, importing raw materials essential to the manufacturing process: paper products from Canada, aluminum discs used in stamping the records (called lacquers) from Japan, and so on. The Trump administration had originally threatened Thailand with a substantial 36 percent tariff, which would naturally raise costs for US manufacturers. Certain specialized industrial equipment used in the processes (boilers that heat the PVC pellets, chillers to control temperature) also tend to be manufactured and serviced from abroad. Steven Walker, owner of mom-and-pop manufacturer 33 Grooves Records, is worried that repairs could soon become exceedingly costly. And if I have to get any parts sourced from China, it's pretty scary.” (As of this writing, Chinese imports have been hit with a whopping 125 percent import tariff.) There's an absurd irony here, which is perhaps not all that shocking given the overwhelming erraticism of Trump's economic schemes. Because the import and export of vinyl records is exempted from tariffs, US brokers can still get their product pressed abroad in Central Europe and shipped back Stateside, with little in the way of additional cost beyond the usual duties. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar US-based manufacturers face potential increases in their bottom line, as they have little option but to import their raw materials from across the globe. So far, the Trump administration's approach to tariffs has benefited bigger businesses. Vinyl record manufacturing is a billion-dollar business, supporting over 1,500 jobs nationwide. “There's a really big concern that our voices are not going to be heard. The looming threat of a broader economic recession also figures into industry-wide anxieties threatening not just record manufacturers and retailers but trickling down to labels and artists. Beyond increasing prices, both for manufacturers and the end-consumer crate digging at their local record shop, the feeling of economic uneasiness can breed hostility. Dave Eck, who runs Waxy Poodle Record in Wisconsin, says Trump's spiked trade rhetoric has impacted his relationships as much as the actual policies. It's a tense situation, which has fostered anti-American sentiment north of the border. “All my vendors up there don't like me anymore, because I'm American,” Eck says. “I'm having a harder time getting my product turned around, because the whole feeling in Canada right now is not to support us.” Of course there are, at some stops in the supply chain, a few Trump loyalists. Eck recalls a cardboard box salesman who recently encouraged him to bone up on some of Donald Trump's negotiating tactics.

These adapters improve GPU scalability and unlock high-bandwidth NVMe storage configurations on platforms where PCIe lanes are limited or require efficient redistribution. The newly launched adapter series includes the PCIe Gen 5 x16 Rocket 1628A and PCIe Gen 4 x16 Rocket 1528D, each providing up to four MCIO x4 or SlimSAS x4 channels. This makes it possible to split a single PCIe x16 slot into multiple high-speed connections, which is ideal for connecting multiple NVMe SSDs, GPUs, or other devices without sacrificing performance. HighPoint's PCIe Gen 5 adapters, in particular, seem to be a compelling option for AI workloads, GPU-heavy setups, and enterprise-grade storage solutions. Each adapter is said to be designed with minimal signal loss in mind, using advanced PCB layouts and high-quality components to maintain signal integrity at Gen 5 speeds. While primarily aimed at OEMs and enterprise users, enthusiasts working with compact systems or unconventional GPU/storage layouts may also benefit from these adapters' modularity. Last year, HighPoint made headlines by launching its SSD7540 RAID card, a PCIe Gen 4 x16 adapter capable of delivering transfer speeds up to 56 GB/s. That card featured eight M.2 NVMe slots and targeted high-performance storage arrays for data-intensive workloads.. The new MCIO and SlimSAS adapters build on this legacy by offering even more flexible connectivity options for modern systems, especially as Gen 5 adoption accelerates. Though pricing hasn't been announced, the new MCIO and SlimSAS x16 adapters will be available through HighPoint's distribution channels soon. As more Gen 5-capable motherboards and processors enter the market, these innovative adapter solutions will become increasingly relevant for balancing bandwidth-hungry components in dense systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a bid to inject AI into more of the programming process, OpenAI is launching Codex CLI, a coding “agent” designed to run locally from terminal software. Codex CLI appears to be a small step in the direction of OpenAI's broader agentic coding vision. Recently, the company's CFO, Sarah Friar, described what she called the “agentic software engineer,” a set of tools OpenAI intends to build that can take a project description for an app and effectively create it and even quality assurance test it. But it will integrate OpenAI's models, eventually including o3 and o4-mini, with the clients that process code and computer commands, otherwise known as command-line interfaces. “[Codex CLI is] a lightweight, open source coding agent that runs locally in your terminal,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. In a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI added, “You can get the benefits of multimodal reasoning from the command line by passing screenshots or low fidelity sketches to the model, combined with access to your code locally [via Codex CLI].” It's best to keep that in mind before giving AI access to sensitive files or projects — must less entire systems.

Instead, Synology customers will have to use the company's self-branded hard drives. While you can still use non-supported drives for storage, Hardwareluxx [machine translated] reports that you'll lose several critical functions, including estimated hard drive health reports, volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analyses, and automatic firmware updates. The company also restricts storage pools and provides limited or zero support for third-party drives. For reference, precious few companies make hard drives, and Synology is not one of them. The 2024 Synology models and older are not affected by this change. The company first applied this limitation to its enterprise solutions, where reliability is of utmost priority. This practice is fairly common in enterprise settings, as huge corporations are willing to invest in expensive storage solutions that minimize downtime and ensure the security of their data. However, smaller companies would probably think twice before dropping massive amounts of cash on self-branded hard drives that have no added functionality over third-party drives, especially if they can get them for cheaper from other reputable manufacturers. The company told ComputerBase [machine translated] that it made using Synology-branded and Synology-certified drives compulsory because of the success it saw with its high-performance NAS systems, and that users of the upcoming Plus Series models would “benefit from higher performance, increased reliability, and more efficient support.” Furthermore, Seagate, one of the bigger manufacturers in the storage industry, has recently been rocked by a fraudulent HDD scandal that affected its NAS drives. Nevertheless, there is still a way you can circumvent this hard drive requirement. If you're using an “unsupported” hard drive with an already existing Synology NAS system and migrate it to a new Plus model, you can continue using it without any restrictions.

The U.S. recently issued fresh restrictions on AI chip exports to China and other countries, further reducing the maximum allowable performance that manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD can deliver to their customers in the affected regions. Because of this, AMD reported in an SEC filing that it might suffer “charges of up to approximately $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.”The U.S. government has been taking steps to limit Beijing's access to America's most advanced chips to ensure the U.S. will retain its edge in artificial intelligence and prevent its East Asian rival from outpacing it. Because of this, both AMD and Nvidia have created AI GPUs specifically designed to meet the federal government's restrictions. The Company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted.”AMD isn't the only one taking a substantial cut thanks to expanded export controls. The U.S. Department of Commerce said (via Reuters) that it's enacting these requirements to act on “the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security.”This new restriction will make it harder for Chinese companies to acquire the chips they need to train their AI models. We've already seen some examples of Chinese businessmen importing sanctioned Nvidia H200 GPUs, and it's widely reported that you can get these advanced chips into China by using an intermediary located in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Singapore and Malaysia are making moves to reduce the leakage of AI chips into China, but we won't know how effective their moves will be in interdicting the massive black market demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The only office within the US State Department that monitors foreign disinformation is to be eliminated, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirming reporting by MIT Technology Review. The Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub is a small office in the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy that tracks and counters foreign disinformation campaigns. In shutting R/FIMI, the department's controversial acting undersecretary, Darren Beattie, is delivering a major win to conservative critics who have alleged that it censors conservative voices. Created at the end of 2024, it was reorganized from the Global Engagement Center (GEC), a larger office with a similar mission that had long been criticized by conservatives who claimed that, despite its international mission, it was censoring American conservatives. In 2023, Elon Musk called the center the “worst offender in US government censorship [and] media manipulation” and a “threat to our democracy.” Shortly after publication, employees at R/FIMI received an email, inviting them to an 11:15AM meeting with Beattie, where employees were told that the office and their jobs have been eliminated. Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed our reporting in a blog post in The Federalist, which had sued GEC last year alleging that it had infringed on its freedom of speech. For years, conservative voices both in and out of government have accused Big Tech of censoring conservative views—and they often charged GEC with enabling such censorship. GEC had its roots as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC), created by an Obama-era executive order, but shifted its mission to fight propaganda and disinformation from foreign governments and terrorist organizations in 2016, becoming the Global Engagement Center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The only office within the US State Department that monitors foreign disinformation is to be eliminated, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirming reporting by MIT Technology Review. The Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub is a small office in the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy that tracks and counters foreign disinformation campaigns. In shutting R/FIMI, the department's controversial acting undersecretary, Darren Beattie, is delivering a major win to conservative critics who have alleged that it censors conservative voices. Created at the end of 2024, it was reorganized from the Global Engagement Center (GEC), a larger office with a similar mission that had long been criticized by conservatives who claimed that, despite its international mission, it was censoring American conservatives. In 2023, Elon Musk called the center the “worst offender in US government censorship [and] media manipulation” and a “threat to our democracy.” Shortly after publication, employees at R/FIMI received an email, inviting them to an 11:15AM meeting with Beattie, where employees were told that the office and their jobs have been eliminated.

Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed our reporting in a blog post in The Federalist, which had sued GEC last year alleging that it had infringed on its freedom of speech. For years, conservative voices both in and out of government have accused Big Tech of censoring conservative views—and they often charged GEC with enabling such censorship. GEC had its roots as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC), created by an Obama-era executive order, but shifted its mission to fight propaganda and disinformation from foreign governments and terrorist organizations in 2016, becoming the Global Engagement Center. It shut down last December after a measure to reauthorize its $61 million budget was blocked by Republicans in Congress, who accused it of helping Big Tech censor American conservative voices. In a Wednesday morning meeting, those employees were told that they would  be put on administrative leave and terminated within 30 days. Beattie, a controversial pick for undersecretary—he was fired as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration for attending a white nationalism conference, has suggested that the FBI organized the January 6 attack on Congress, and has said that it's not worth defending Taiwan from China—had instructed the few remaining staff to be “pencils down,” one State Department official told me, meaning to pause in their work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, platforms like Airbnb and Turo have made it simple for people to earn extra cash by renting out their spare bedrooms or cars—but what about a pair of jeans from Zara or a lawn mower that's been catching dust? It turns out, there's a market for that stuff too. Recently, a number of online services have begun to normalize peer-to-peer rentals of lower-ticket items, proving to young people that a limited run with their T-shirts, Bluetooth speakers, or chain saws—not just the nonexistent fourth bedrooms in their nonexistent three-story houses—might be of value to internet strangers, too. Typical customers are in their mid- to late-twenties, and the company partners with students on college campuses, which CEO and cofounder Brian McMahon calls “the perfect ecosystem” for this model to thrive. One of the app's particularly millennial-and-Gen-Z-friendly features is its door-to-door delivery service (offered in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami) which is “like DoorDash for clothes,” McMahon says. “Plans come up, and people are like, ‘I need something. Still, Pickle says it has tripled its number of monthly active users year over year and in March announced it had raised $12 million in Series A funding. Sundararajan says the popularity of these apps represents a shift toward more responsible consumerism and a decline in the fixation on owning things. “I think Instagram had a lot to do with this. People who grew up seeing other people's vacations on Instagram are more wired to think of value as coming not from what you own but what you experience,” he says. Beccah Erickson, a 33-year-old product designer living in Brooklyn, has both listed and rented through Pickle. “In New York a lot of the people listing stuff are of a certain age and size,” she says, adding that it could be “harder” for people who wear larger sizes to find items. Pickle tells WIRED it is working to address this issue by partnering with “creators, influencers, and tastemakers across a wider range of body types and aesthetics.” Erickson's own wedding is coming up, and she's considering renting her bridal accessories, primarily in an effort to make environmentally conscious choices. The financial burden of attending weddings is also what drew fellow Brooklyn resident Jane Kim, 35, to Pickle. “I don't want to have to buy another sand-colored dress,” says Kim, who has been a bridesmaid at multiple friends' weddings. While Pickle's selection heavily features high fashion, the platform welcomes any in-demand item, regardless of its price point or brand, including low-cost pieces from brands like Urban Outfitters and Edikted. The highest earning “lenders”—users who list their items for rent—earned more than $3,000 monthly in 2024. Yoodlize, a Utah-based app that operates near three college campuses, allows users to rent party supplies (bounce houses, tables and chairs), tools (tile cutters, really tall ladders), electronics (cameras, PA systems, karaoke machines), and outdoor sporting equipment like paddleboards. The average rental transaction on Yoodlize is $50, and its top users make $10,000 to $15,000 a year. By reducing the demand for products that spend most of their lives taking up space, the peer-to-peer rental model appeals to both environmental and economic concerns. Why does everybody own this $600 machine that you rarely use?” Fairbourne says. Similar platforms include BabyQuip, catered to baby items, KitSplit, which specializes in electronics, and Fat Llama, where you can rent anything from construction machinery to your wedding's selfie station backdrop. “Sometimes it is kind of a pain,” Kim says. Once, a courier rang her door bell at 1 am to return an item she rented out through Pickle when the app estimated that it would be returned by 8 pm. “There have been times where I'm like, this isn't worth 40 bucks that I'm making.” But some environmentally conscious users might tolerate inconvenience if it means combatting overconsumption: “It's nice that it makes me feel less guilty about the things I already own,” says Kim.

Then we have microphones, headphones, maybe even a drawing tablet for the artists out there. And all those need to be plugged in but you just have the one USB port on your laptop. That's exactly why you need a good USB hub. This Anker USB C splitter is precisely what we're looking for. You can save 29% which works out to a cool $10 discount. That black version is the one down to $25. It's also available in blue, green, grey, and white but those are only down to $28—still lower than full price. Do note though that the USB-C data port does not support video output. The Anker USB-C hub supports up to 85W passthrough charging so no need for you power adapter anymore. The USB-C hub can even be used to transfer files between devices and it does so super quickly. You can move files to and from your laptop at speeds of up to 5Gbps via the USB-C and USB-A ports. Right now, this USB-C hub from Anker dropped in price by 29%. It's normally sitting at $35 so after the discount, you'll only pay $25. Save yourself $10 with the black Anker USB-C hub, or save yourself $7 and go with the fancy blue, green, grey, or white options. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, there's been a lot of talk about “ideological extremism” on both the left and right, and the government has often claimed that warped political beliefs are encouraging Americans to commit violent acts. However, under the new Trump administration, the government now seems prepared to go after people who don't believe in anything at all. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein writes that the government has a new target in its war on extremism: nihilists—more specifically, Nihilist Violent Extremists, or NVEs. The government has reportedly come up with this designation as a kind of catchall for the culprits behind various violent incidents, and the term has shown up in several recent court cases. That's a good question, and the answer is: anybody. Klippenstein writes that the term was recently used in the legal proceedings of Nikita Casap, a teen from Wisconsin who was arrested in February and charged with murdering his parents. But there are plenty of people who have been accused of committing violent crimes for vaguely anarchistic reasons, be it people like Luigi Mangione, or the gaggle of people of who have recently been arrested for vandalizing and firebombing Teslas, or the Zizians. The road to this new low in law enforcement terminology has been long. In short, the government has always found reasons to justify its federal police powers, though few of them have ever been as sloppily constructed as the current government's newest fearmongering buzzword.

Cheap retro handhelds, one of the only cheap entry points for gaming, could be meeting their end, but the retro spirit should live on. The U.S. is not a safe place to visit (or live) right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company claiming it can restore lost species also wants to patent them. MIT Technology Review has learned the Texas startup is seeking a patent that would give it exclusive legal rights to create and sell gene-edited elephants containing ancient mammoth DNA. Colossal, which calls itself “the de-extinction company,” hopes to use gene editing to turn elephants into a herd of mammoth look-alikes that could be released in large nature preserves in Siberia. Ben Lamm, the CEO of Colossal, said in an email that holding patents on the animals would “give us control over how these technologies are implemented, particularly for managing initial releases where oversight is critical.” Colossal intends to file patents on additional “transgenic” animals, such as the genetically modified wolves it announced last week, Lamm said. In that case, Colossal used gene editing to insert about 15 DNA changes from the extinct dire wolf into gray wolves. Lamm has suggested that each “mammoth” could generate $2 million in "carbon capture services" and that the company could collect a share of tourist dollars if it brings back other iconic species such as the dodo, which lived on a single island in the Indian Ocean. Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical. Lamm said patents, which usually last 20 years, could provide “a clear legal framework during the critical transition period when de-extinct species are first reintroduced.” That opened the door to patents on animals, including the cancer-prone OncoMouse, glow-in-the-dark aquarium fish, and, more recently, pigs modified to grow organs for transplants. Colossal's woolly mammoth patent application, with its descriptions of modified cells and animals, represents “the current standard in biotech cases,” says Cassie Edgar, a partner at the law firm McKee, Voorhees & Sease in Des Moines, Iowa. The basic de-extinction method works like this: Researchers obtain DNA from old bones or museum specimens and then use gene-editing technology to add ancestral gene variants to a closely related existing species. So far, no modified pachyderms have been born—elephant engineering remains too difficult. But last week, Colossal set off an eruption of headlines when it claimed it had used gene editing to re-create dire wolves, a species that went extinct some 13,000 years ago. Many experts dismissed Colossal's claim to the world's first successful de-extinction. They noted that in reality, the animals are gray wolves with an unusual coat color; their genomes contain only a few bits of dire wolf DNA, but the two species differ by several million DNA letters. MIT Technology Review found that Colossal had filed for trademarks covering some extra-hairy mice it revealed earlier this year, which were offered as evidence of progress toward a mammoth. One trademark reserves the name “Mammouse” for use in the sale of “stuffed and plush toys.” Also trademarked is “Woolly Mouse,” covering its use as a motif for shirts, jackets, and athletic apparel. Lamm says Colossal doesn't currently have plans to open a gift shop. “It seems like people connect with these animals on an emotional level, which is actually quite encouraging,” he says. The existence of a patent application on mammoth-like elephants could tap into lingering public doubts over whether legal monopolies should really apply to living things, especially elephants, the world's largest land animals. Revive & Restore, a de-extinction organization in Sausalito, California, that is working toward reviving the passenger pigeon, says it doesn't think the birds should be controlled by intellectual-property claims. “Revive & Restore will not be patenting de-extinct passenger pigeons,” says Elizabeth Bennett, a spokesperson for the organization. Even some genetic engineers involved in the mammoth project, initiated more than decade ago at Harvard University, have mixed opinions on patenting de-extinct animals. Cory Smith, now a biotech executive, was a student when he helped prepare an earlier patent application on engineered elephants, which the school filed in 2021. “I am not sure it should have an owner,” says Smith. During its press blitz last week, Colossal was careful not to reveal the exact genetic changes it had made to its wolves, telling advisors it needed to keep them secret for “intellectual-property reasons.” This prevented outside scientists from fully assessing the experiment. “We take a thoughtful approach to intellectual property that balances scientific advancement with sustainable business practices,” Lamm said in his initial response. “What's important to understand is that any IP protection would be limited to specific technical methods and innovations we've developed—not the genetic heritage of extinct species themselves. First filed in 2023, it is titled “Woolly mammoth specific gene variants and compositions comprising same” and contains a list of 29 claims that seek to control both a long list of mammoth gene variants and animals whose bodies contain that genetic code. That is, this patent application doesn't cover any specific method or technology, but is instead aimed at securing rights to novel animals with genetic changes that alter their hair, body size, immune system, tolerance to cold, and even cognitive capacity. During the examination of a patent, inventors are typically required to narrow the commercial rights they're seeking to those elements that are truly “new and useful” and also must steer clear of statutory prohibitions about what can be patented, which differ widely by country. “I imagine very few of these patent claims are going to get issued as they stand,” says Sherkow. “But they'll be a stalking horse—er, mammoth?—on what aspects of revived species are patentable.” “Early-stage companies sometimes bet on long-tail events,” says Andy Tang, a partner at Draper Associates, one of the venture capital firms that put money into Colossal. Tang, who says he isn't speaking for the company, believes that “in the scenario woolly mammoth[s] become important for partners, then it would be better to create some barrier to entry.”  He adds, “I think it is just cheaper to invest in patents early. Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages. Why archaeologists are increasingly leaving historic sites untouched until we have less destructive technologies for studying them. Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.</p>
