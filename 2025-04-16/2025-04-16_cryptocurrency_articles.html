                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC) remains under pressure as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on its price action. For some, like the veteran trader Peter Brandt, this trendline is nothing but hopium. Others, however, see more reason for cautious optimism. Ultimately, price is driven by supply and demand—and while both sides of the equation are beginning to show subtle signs of recovery, they are yet to reach the levels needed for a proper breakout. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin's apparent demand — measured by the 30-day net difference between exchange inflows and outflows — is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained dip into negative territory. However, the analysts caution against prematurely declaring a trend reversal. Looking back to the 2021 cycle peak, similar conditions occurred: demand remained low or negative for months, prices temporarily stabilized or rebounded, and true structural recovery only followed extended consolidation. Time and confirmation are still needed to confirm a shifting momentum. From a trader's perspective, the apparent demand metric does not look optimistic just yet. Despite hopeful comparisons of the current price dip to that period, current volume dynamics suggest a more subdued trader appetite. Since April 3, the spot BTC ETFs have recorded continuous outflows totaling over $870 million, with the first modest inflow not occurring until April 15. Despite this, trading volumes remain relatively high — only 18% below the 30-day average — indicating that some investor appetite for Bitcoin persists. This points to a continued lack of meaningful new capital entering the Bitcoin network and, as Glassnode notes, “remains well below typical bull market thresholds.” Furthermore, the BTC balance on exchanges — often used to gauge available sell-side liquidity — has dropped to just 2.6 million BTC, the lowest level since November 2018. Yet, on a broader macroeconomic level, some analysts see reasons for cautious hope. Independent market analyst Michael van de Poppe pointed out the quickly rising M2 Supply, which, with a certain lag (here 12 weeks), has often influenced Bitcoin price in the past. Even if bullish momentum and demand returns, Bitcoin will need to clear a critical resistance zone between $86,300 and $86,500, as shown on CoinGlass' liquidity heatmap, which maps dense clusters of buy and sell orders at different levels. Alphractal adds another layer of insight through its Alpha Price Chart, which incorporates realized cap, average cap, and onchain sentiment — and comes to the same conclusion. If the price weakens again, support levels lie at $73,900 and $64,700. Overall, calling a trend reversal at this stage may be premature. Liquidity remains thin, macroeconomic headwinds persist, and investors remain cautious. Still, Bitcoin's resilience above $80,000 signals strong support from long-term holders. For such a move to be meaningful, however, it must be backed by spot market volume, not just leverage-driven activity. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Game of Silks non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), including Silks Avatar NFTs, Silks Horse NFTs, and Silks Land NFTs, and who were damaged thereby, of the important April 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. So what: If you purchased Game of Silks NFTs you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, Game of Silks created a metaverse  game that brought real-life horse racing to the blockchain, allowing users to invest in virtual versions of real racehorses and earn money based on the real-world performance of those horses. The complaint further alleges that the Game of Silks NFTs, which were first sold beginning in April 2022, are securities as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), and as such required registration statements, which were never filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Further, the complaint also alleges that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions in connection with the sale of the Game of Silks NFTs, including failing to disclose critical financial information about Game of Silks' business model and sustainability. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mantra released a post-crash statement on its OM token but offered little clarity while confirming buyback and burn plans to support the community. Update (April 16, 6:50 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add a comment by Mantra CEO John Mullin. Troubled decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mantra released an official statement addressing the reasons for a 92% flash crash of its OM token on April 13. In the update, the Mantra team pointed to “significant amounts of OM tokens moved onto exchanges for use as collateral” and "forced OM position closures" as the main factors that triggered liquidations, including automatic ones. Mantra has also been considering hiring a forensic auditor following the April 13 events. According to Mullin, the discussions involved professionals, including the business consultancy firm FTI Consulting, but no decisions have been made so far. Mullin also told Cointelegraph the Mantra team has about 90 full-time employees, adding: In the post, Mantra reiterated that there are two types of OM tokens, with one being Ethereum-based (ERC-20) and the other running on Mantra's mainnet. However, Mantra mainnet OM tokens had only 77.5 million in circulation after the Mantra Chain minted an equivalent amount of OM in October 2024. Additionally, the post mentions a divergence in OM spot prices on OKX and Binance. Among its conclusions, Mantra stated that further information from its exchange partners will “provide more clarity on these events, adding: No timeline for the rollout of this plan was provided. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, OKX CEO Star Xu called Mantra a “big scandal” in a post published hours following the crash.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bloomberg's editorial board has warned of a potential financial crisis similar to what happened in 2008/9 happening this year as geopolitical risks rise. Bloomberg warns that banks and other lenders lack the resources to absorb these potential losses. This warning comes as the U.S. has alienated itself from allies by imposing tariffs. It has even raised tariffs on goods from China to 145%, increasing the risk of a recession. Polymarket traders currently put the odds of a recession this year at 65%. It would also lead to a higher unemployment rate in the economy. However, history shows these risk assets often perform well after major crises due to Federal Reserve and government interventions. It then implemented quantitative easing, printed money, and injected liquidity into the economy. These actions helped trigger a strong rally in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.

Computing an efficient representation is just an optimization, since state can be reconstituted from a checkpoint state and those transactions that follows it. These notions are useful for reasoning about blockchain design and the design space for error/fault handling, from independent faults due to Byzantine actors to common-mode faults due to zero-day software defects. Based on considering how and when these finality properties should be achieved, we developed a preliminary design sketch for an “ideal” layer 2 system, and discussed some of the trade-offs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cryptocurrency market, once a beacon of hope for financial innovation and transparency, is now facing a crisis of confidence that threatens its very foundation. As we move through 2025, it has become obvious that the altcoin sector is plagued by a toxic mix of collusion, price manipulation, and a glaring lack of transparency—especially on centralized exchanges (CEXs). The result is a market that feels increasingly rigged, where genuine price discovery is rare and retail investors are left holding the bag. I watched this industry evolve from its idealistic beginnings to its current state, I believe the time for self-reflection and reform is now, before the damage becomes irreversible. The process is disturbingly simple: project teams allocate large amounts of tokens to market makers at deep discounts before a token generation event (TGE). These market makers then orchestrate artificial price pumps at launch, creating the illusion of demand. The median altcoin launched in 2024-2025 is down by at around 70% from its TGE price. Centralized exchanges, which still control roughly more than half of the global crypto market cap, are at the heart of this crisis. While some exchanges have made token efforts to publish proof-of-reserves or improve listing standards, these measures are often superficial. This lack of transparency is fundamentally at odds with the ethos that drew so many to crypto in the first place. This is also reflected in the poll that I have conducted, 82.4% of the respondents think that CEX should held to a higher standard and they should lead by example to help the crypto industry. I have spoken with countless retail investors who entered the market in good faith, only to be burned by the same cycle of hype, manipulation, and collapse. Many have lost significant savings, not because they made reckless bets, but because the system was stacked against them from the start. According to a poll on X conducted by me, 63% of respondents believe that most altcoin prices are manipulated, and 37% have reduced or stopped investing in new token launches altogether. Instead, TGE prices are set at levels designed to maximize returns for insiders and early backers, with little regard for long-term sustainability. New tokens losing more than half its value within the first two weeks of trading become a norm. This is not just a problem for speculators; it undermines the entire process of capital formation and innovation in the crypto space. When every new launch seems like a trap for retail investors, genuine projects struggle to attract long-term supporters. For years, the crypto industry has argued that self-regulation is preferable to government intervention. But the events of 2024 and 2025 have shown that self-regulation is, at best, a myth. The industry's inability—or unwillingness—to police itself has created a Wild West environment where bad actors thrive and honest participants are left disillusioned. Just this morning, I warned my community that “the industry is eating itself alive,” and that unless meaningful reforms are enacted, both retail and institutional investors will continue to flee. First, centralized exchanges must be held to higher standards. Some progress is being made—several exchanges have begun publishing more detailed transparency reports —but these efforts are still the exception rather than the rule. While DEXs currently account for about 25% of trading volume, they offer a level of transparency and auditability that CEXs simply cannot match. Every trade is recorded on a public blockchain, making it much harder to conceal manipulation. Uniswap v4 and dYdX have shown that it is possible to build liquid, efficient markets without relying on centralized intermediaries. Third, token launches need to be fundamentally reformed. This could include longer vesting periods for insiders, transparent allocation disclosures, and mechanisms to ensure fair price discovery—such as open auctions or liquidity bootstrapping pools. But for that potential to be realized, the industry must confront its demons. As an observer and participant in the crypto space, I have seen both the best and worst of what this market has to offer. But I have also seen the damage wrought by greed, collusion, and a lack of accountability. It can continue down the current path, sacrificing trust and legitimacy for short-term gains. Or it can embrace reform, transparency, and a renewed commitment to the values that made crypto compelling in the first place. Collusion between project teams and market makers, abetted by the opacity of centralized exchanges, has created a market where manipulation is the norm and genuine price discovery is the exception. But it does not have to be this way. By demanding greater transparency, embracing decentralization, and supporting thoughtful regulation, the industry can chart a new course. The road ahead will not be easy, and there will be resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. But the alternative—a market defined by manipulation and mistrust—is unacceptable. I urge industry leaders, regulators, and investors to seize this moment. The future of digital assets depends on our willingness to confront hard truths, to demand better, and to build a market worthy of the ideals that inspired its creation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As tensions escalate across the global financial order, three senior voices from the Bitcoin Policy Institute — Matthew Pines, Zack Shapiro, and Zack Cohen — offer a sobering and strategic forecast: America may soon revalue its gold to buy Bitcoin, fundamentally reshaping global power dynamics. But what happens when these instruments lose their luster? According to the Bitcoin Policy Institute's Head of Policy, Zack Shapiro, the current financial system is entering a historic inflection point. Recent discussions around revaluing U.S. gold holdings — still officially priced at $42.22 per ounce — could unleash nearly $1 trillion in new purchasing power should the U.S. decide to draw upon it. If BPI's policy thinkers are right, it might be deployed to acquire a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a budget neutral manner in alignment with the remit of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Executive Order. Matthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, frames the choice in stark geoeconomic terms. “In terms of strategic leverage, there's an asymmetric advantage for the United States to having Bitcoin monetize relative to gold,” he noted. Pines went to note that the U.S. and its population owns ~35% of all Bitcoin in circulation — a ratio that gives Washington serious incentive to prefer digital over metallic money. Gold, despite its historical credibility, is “centralizable, expensive to transport, and incompatible with a 21st-century economy,” said Pines. While central banks continue stacking it as a hedge against the weaponization of Treasuries, its utility as a modern reserve asset remains constrained. Bitcoin, by contrast, is fast, global, and increasingly liquid — a networked form of monetary energy that sidesteps the geopolitical chokepoints that define traditional finance. Shapiro cited Triffin's Dilemma, noting how the U.S. must increasingly choose between domestic economic goals and the international demands of reserve currency issuance. Since then, foreign central banks have responded by moving rapidly into gold — and in some cases, Bitcoin. By shifting reserves into Bitcoin, the U.S. could reduce reliance on debt issuance, secure asymmetric leverage in a digitized world, and act from a position of strength in competition with its geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia. Under the executive order now guiding Trump administration's Bitcoin strategy, departments like Treasury and Commerce are already exploring “budget-neutral” paths to Bitcoin acquisition. From Theory to Detonation: Global Fallout of a U.S. Bitcoin Pivot If America were to follow through on a large-scale acquisition of Bitcoin, the effects would be both immediate and far-reaching. “Other nation-states will see that they can't be left behind,” said Shapiro. “It would change central bank reserve strategies around the world.” Countries heavily invested in gold or Treasuries would reassess. Hard assets like gold may see diminished demand, while Bitcoin would surge in legitimacy and price. Domestically, such a move would generate massive balance sheet gains for the federal government and re-anchor U.S. dominance in the next monetary era. Both Shapiro and Pines agree: whatever your view of Triffin's Dilemma or monetary policy history, Bitcoin is now too strategic to ignore. Whether the United States will truly “dump gold” is yet to be determined. Investors and policymakers have no-doubt begun running a similar calculus.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum (ETH) derivative markets are going through another big accumulation. Historically, derivative market inflows are linked to big price moves. Ethereum (ETH) derivative markets are having another day of peak inflows. Data by CryptoQuant analysts show over 77,000 ETH flowed into derivative exchanges. Similar inflows were observed on March 26 and April 3, followed by an ETH crash to a lower range. For some analysts, the current low sentiment may be a sign of a market bottom, while for others, another drawdown is possible. The token is closely watched for signs of a bigger price move, especially with the current price pressures. After the recent inflow to exchanges, ETH open interest is slightly up to $8.28M, with around 35% in short positions. From the current price level, it remains uncertain which positions would be attacked first. ETH traded around $1,590.22, showing some weakness after retaining the $1,600 level for a day. The asset still traded near its lows of 0.019 BTC. After a period of liquidations, DeFi protocols are rebuilding their liquidity positions, showing the new risk profile for ETH. Currently, DeFi lending protocols carry $937M in positions that can be liquidated if ETH falls to a lower range. The biggest accumulation of liquidity is at $917.99, where most whales decided to secure their loans. However, borrowers remain extremely cautious in rebuilding their positions. There are almost no loans with a liquidation price in the $1,500 and $1,400 range. ETH still holds over $47B in total value locked, led by Aave and liquid staking protocols.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump will talk about American Bitcoin, a new venture formed with Hut 8 where he serves as Chief Strategy Officer. "The launch of American Bitcoin represents a transformative moment for Bitcoin mining in North America," said Trump in a statement. “I am so proud to finally unveil our bold vision for this initiative, which we believe will become the world's largest and most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner." Launched on March 31, American Bitcoin said it aims to become the world's largest pure-play Bitcoin miner, targeting over 50 EH/s of mining capacity.Eric Trump is scheduled to speak on May 15 at Consensus 2025, which takes place in Toronto May 14-16. Consensus, which is organized by CoinDesk, is known as the longest-running conference in the digital assets industry, with attendance regularly topping 15,000 people. American Bitcoin is one of several crypto ventures launched by the Trump family. In March, WLFI announced that it plans to launch its own stablecoin, USD1, with BitGo providing custody services. In addition, Eric Trump is also an advisor to Metaplanet, the largest holder of bitcoin in Japan, which is following a Michael Saylor/Strategy-type bitcoin treasury model. He's also an advisor to Dominari Holdings, a wealth management firm, which in March disclosed that it had bought $2 million of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) shares. Eric Trump told CNBC this month that the Trump Organization was drawn to crypto after being “debanked” by several financial groups during the Biden Administration. “It actually is what drove us toward cryptocurrency,” he said. Eric Trump's crypto interventions haven't all been successful. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Film Finance Group International (FFGI), a North Carolina-based film finance innovator, has officially unveiled its upcoming ERC-20 utility token: FFG Token ($FFG). Built to power a transparent, milestone-based film funding ecosystem, FFG Token is an asset-backed token that bridges real-world production workflows with secure, blockchain-based infrastructure. Backed by real-world film budgets and anchored by a proprietary on-chain accounting system, the token represents a new approach to financing indie cinema — one that aims to replace vague promises with verifiable payouts and investor control. “We've designed FFG Token from the ground up to solve the trust and transparency issues that have long plagued independent film finance,” said G. David Keaton, Co-Founder and Managing Member of FFGI and a licensed CPA. “Our platform doesn't just tokenize investment — it offers visibility, accountability, and participation. Unlike speculative tokens with no underlying benchmarks, FFG Token is tied to real production milestones. Funds are allocated in phases based on verified deliverables, promoting greater accountability and reducing risk for participants. FFGI has also structured the ecosystem with robust legal compliance in mind, including KYC-gated quarterly reporting and IP ownership through tokenized NFTs. “We've built what we believe is the most advanced blockchain-native accounting system for film finance,” said Michael Dallas, Development Manager at FFGI and a veteran systems architect. And the accounting software — held by a separate Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) — opens new revenue streams. “Our model is modular, but deeply interconnected,” added Keaton. “It's designed to support creators, protect contributors, and expand the use of blockchain in real, investable ways.” Leading up to the public offering, FFGI will conduct community activations through its Telegram & Discord servers and begin releasing technical documentation and project previews. “We want our early community to understand how this works under the hood.” More information, including tokenomics, governance design, and licensing options, will be revealed through upcoming AMAs, dev diaries, and a full launch countdown. FFGI is a blockchain-first film finance company based in North Carolina. David Keaton, CPAFilm Finance Group International (FFGI)[email protected]</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following an avalanche of concerns from current and retired state workers, as well as some state legislators, Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives have agreed to a number of changes in their proposal to invest the state pension into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.The crypto industry has contributed heavily to Republican politicians in recent years, and GOP leaders at the state and national levels have responded with new efforts to embrace the industry. In the state legislature, House Bill 92 would allow North Carolina Treasurer Brad Briner to invest billions of dollars from the State Pension Plan into cryptocurrencies.On Wednesday a House committee on pensions approved a newly rewritten version of the bill, as well as another bill, House Bill 506, thay would put new safeguards on the Treasurer's office and its investments strategies. Opponents say it's too speculative and could lead to large losses for retired state workers just a easily as it could lead to large gains.Unlike many bills at the legislature that divide lawmakers along party lines, this one has revealed generational divides. Wednesday's changes show that the bill will continue to move forward, but that skeptics have also been able to make it less aggressive than originally proposed.Briner attended Wednesday's hearing over both bills, saying he approves the measure to take away some of his power. He said 47 other states already have a similar system in place and North Carolina needs to join the rest. Allowing the treasurer to make solo investment decisions, he added, has not gone well: North Carolina ranks either 49th or 50th in pension investment returns, depending on how you look at the numbers.The investment strategies of the past, Briner said, have led to North Carolina receiving about 1.5% less on its investments than the average state.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a crypto market obsessed with altcoins like XRP, BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is beginning to draw everyone's attention. It's been a crazy few weeks for XRP holders. Despite its established position, XRP seems stuck in a battle between bulls and bears around the critical $2 level – and this battle could drag on for some time. The project's presale is blowing up right now, with tokens priced at just $0.002465 each. Their roadmap looks solid too – a DEX listing is already locked in for when the presale concludes. What's the secret behind BTC Bull Token's surging popularity? Built on Ethereum, BTCBULL is strategically designed to capitalize on Bitcoin's success while offering a reward system that BTC itself doesn't provide. As Bitcoin hits price milestones for the first time – $150K, $200K, and $250K – BTCBULL holders receive actual BTC airdrops. Plus, with a capped supply of 21 billion tokens (a nod to Bitcoin's supply cap), this symbolic link will appeal to Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide. BTCBULL also has a burn mechanism that will destroy tokens when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. When you combine this with the attractive staking rewards, estimated at 87% per year, it's easy to see why investors are flocking to the presale. Just this week, Umar Khan from 99Bitcoins released a video predicting that BTCBULL could deliver returns of 10x to 50x after its launch. Given XRP's volatile price action, Khan is essentially saying that he believes BTCBULL will outperform it in Q2. What also sets BTCBULL apart is its position in the market. When was the last time you saw a token that actually rewards you with BTC – the real coin – just for holding? Most projects don't take this approach, yet BTCBULL does, giving it a unique selling point. The timing of the project's emergence couldn't be better either.Bitcoin just bounced back above $84,000 after last week's dip, and most traders believe the coin has bottomed out and is ready for another rally in its journey back to January's all-time high. BTC Bull Token is in a great spot to benefit if this happens. So, for investors who missed Bitcoin's early days, BTCBULL is like a “second chance” at exponential returns. Altcoins like XRP might be more established, but their upside is limited, unlike BTCBULL. Disclaimer: This content is provided by a sponsor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals, not staff journalists. Despite BTC remaining inside the Cloud—a generally bullish zone—momentum appears to be fading. Daily volume has slipped below the 30-day moving average, and although OBV is still trending above its moving average, signaling underlying strength, the price action is showing hesitation. The daily RSI printed a lower high, suggesting weakening momentum. Meanwhile, two fresh TBT Bearish Divergence signals have appeared on the 4-hour chart, mimicking the bearish setup seen in late April before BTC dropped from $88,000 to $74,000. Stablecoin dominance rose slightly and closed above the daily TBO Cloud, with a short-term target at 8.22%. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, defying bearish divergence seen between price and RSI on the daily chart. This divergence suggests eventual weakness, yet BTC.D continues to push higher. Top 10 Dominance closed below the TBO Cloud but is showing strength through higher lows on RSI. OTHERS.D, on the other hand, is nearing its April 7th low. Even though it printed a higher low on RSI yesterday, the chart remains firmly bearish. TOTAL has maintained its structure inside the TBO Cloud, and OBV continues to trend higher, but two TBT Bearish Divergences on its 4-hour chart mirror the BTC setup and suggest caution. OTHERS is still strong bearish, and although OBV is holding key support, the lack of a relief rally—despite falling BVOL7D—indicates how dependent ALTs are on Bitcoin's slow grind upward. Without BTC leading, low-cap coins and OTHERS will likely continue chopping lower. This would also close the open CME gap at $121. HYPE triggered two bearish divergence signals on the 4-hour just below TBO Support, and XMR has climbed back above the daily TBO Cloud after last week's steep drop, showing unexpected resilience. IP followed with its first 4-hour TBO Close Short yesterday, and WIF was rejected at overhead resistance, targeting a move back down to 0.304. Strong OBV and RSI back the bullish continuation, making this a solid DCA Bot candidate. RAY is climbing inside the daily TBO Cloud but faces conflicting signals, with bearish divergence on the 4-hour even as it tests TBO Resistance. PENDLE remains bullish overall and is in a TBO Open Long, but weakening volume and flattening OBV raise concerns about a short-term drop to the bottom of the TBO Cloud before another push higher. The confluence of bearish divergence signals across Bitcoin, TOTAL, and many altcoins is a clear warning that a short-term correction may be underway. Until BTC can reclaim and close above overhead resistance with strong volume, expect volatility and downside risk to dominate the short term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple has urgently removed 14 dangerous cryptocurrency trading applications from its App Store following concerns raised by the South Korean government regarding potential fraud and financial instability. This action mirrors a recent move by Google, which also delisted 17 similar apps from its Play Store. iPhone users who may have installed these applications are now at risk of having their personal information compromised and facing financial losses due to fraudulent investment schemes. The removal of these apps was prompted by instructions from the South Korean Financial Service Commission (FSC), which has taken legal action against a total of 22 crypto platforms, including 17 foreign exchanges. This lack of regulatory oversight posed a significant threat to investors. Notably, many of the removed applications were already banned in India before this action. The list of prohibited apps includes prominent names such as Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. These platforms have been unavailable on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in India due to regulatory concerns. Furthermore, there were serious concerns about the security of investments made through these apps, with the possibility of funds being lost due to the lack of government protection and oversight. The FSC also pointed out the absence of adequate anti-money laundering management and supervision, raising fears of illicit financial activities. iPhone users who have installed any of these applications are strongly advised to remove them immediately to mitigate the risk of fraud, data breaches, and potential financial losses.</p>

The chase for Alexander Ovechkin collectibles remains hot after his record-setting 895th goal Sunday, which moved him ahead of Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer.

But it isn't all sticks, jerseys and pucks.

NHL Breakaway, the official digital collectible (NFT) platform of the NHL (much in the same vein as NBA TopShot), has created a 1/1 NFT in honor of Ovechkin's landmark goal and is selling it via auction at Heritage.

The pre-sale estimate for the NFT is $25,000, and bidding has topped $7,500 with two weeks remaining.

The platform launched in 2023 and is also selling digital packs dubbed “The Gr8 Chase” for $8.95.

As of early Wednesday, the platform had sold 3,000 of the 8,888 total packs created.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The best crypto projects solve key problems that Bitcoin can't. If it can, $ETH and ERC-20 tokens could lead the best altcoins to new heights, while also pushing real-world AI development into the next phase of growth. Centralized data, secretive algorithms, and Big Tech dominance have created what many call the ‘black box' problem, where users can't understand or verify how AI systems make decisions. The basic AI development process is that you feed in data, and the AI gives you an output. But the logic in between can be a mystery. This is especially dangerous when those models are used in finance, healthcare, hiring, or law enforcement. According to former Ethereum core developer Eric Conner, the blockchain could become AI's most important infrastructure layer. In recent comments on X, Conner said Ethereum is on the verge of its ‘biggest mainstream moment,' not through DeFi or NFTs, but by bringing transparency and decentralization to artificial intelligence. With Ethereum, smart contracts can log how AI models are trained, where their data comes from, and how decisions are made. And because it's the blockchain, those decisions are on-chain for everyone to audit. With token-based incentives and open governance, Conner believes that Ethereum offers an alternative to the closed ecosystems of tech giants. If Conner is right, Ethereum could be on the verge of a major leap forward. It boasts user-friendly features like built-in swapping, portfolio tracking, and exclusive presale discovery. Best Wallet's ultimate goal is to become the go-to tool for both new and seasoned investors, allowing them to get the most out of their crypto. Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token in our guide. The token, currently priced at $0.0247, has big potential – our own analysis indicates it could reach $0.072 by the end of 2025. Speaking of AI and the Ethereum blockchain, Mind of Pepe ($MIND) isn't just riding the meme wave. Instead, MIND of Pepe is out to build an interactive AI ecosystem around a beloved cultural icon. The roadmap involves building a fully autonomous AI agent and deploying it on X. By interacting with the MIND agent, users will be able to guide, shape, and even train the AI itself. Learn how to buy MIND of Pepe with our guide, and don't delay – the project just passed the $8M funding mark. How much of Ethereum's next chapter will come from AI? As Eric Conner highlighted, Ethereum offers everything AI platforms need but don't yet have: transparency, decentralization, open access to data, and built-in payments. Projects like MIND of Pepe are already building AI agents on Ethereum. And while $ETH itself isn't on presale, there's certainly still room for growth. And that infrastructure-level potential could fuel another massive wave of growth. Ethereum's smart contracts solve the black box issue by making everything visible on-chain, from how models are funded and what data they use, to who gets paid for it. It's a crucial step toward decentralized, trustworthy AI. These three projects – whether wallet-based, meme-powered, or ecosystem-defining – are poised to grow under what could be the next trillion-dollar use case for Web3. This isn't financial advice, just a heads-up on where the best new cryptos could be going. With crypto recovering from its earlier blues, don't overlook the potential of these three altcoins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People Power Party presidential primary candidate Hong Joon Pyo announced a bold five-year investment plan worth at least 50 trillion won to spur development in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence, crypto, quantum science, super gap technology-led growth, and atmospheric superconductivity. However, Hong's main focus is to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead to push for blockchain and cryptocurrency as part of the country's economy.As per the report, the announcement was made during a policy briefing focused on the economy, labor, science, and technology held at his campaign headquarters in the Daeha Building in Yeouida. Hong listed 27 major commitments, focusing on a growth plan driven by the business sector and supported by the government.“In order to foster blockchain and virtual assets as a single industry, I will eliminate regulations as much as the Trump administration in the United States did,” and “I will introduce blockchain technology to the public sector and administrative services, and foster virtual assets as a single industry,” said Hong.Additionally, Hong also proposed a ‘New Industry gate Free' system that would allow entry into new technologies and new businesses without government approval. Here's what he emphasized as direction for the economy policy: Revitalizing the economy through public-private collaboration, driving growth with super gap technologies, ensuring fair distribution based on productivity, creating jobs, and strengthening welfare for the working class.Hong identified the necessity of creating a “Public-Private Economic Revival 5-Year Plan” that will establish long-term economic growth. The initiative would propel the private sector as leader while the government supported its efforts.Hong proposed several transformative national initiatives that extended beyond economic and labor reforms, namely the sovereign wealth fund project initiated through oil development and the lunar landing mission goal by 2030, as well as extensive changes to the tax system. The tax reforms presented by Hong contain two substantial elements consisting of the elimination of the comprehensive real estate tax and major tax breaks for inheritance, which boost economic activity and real estate movement. Hong's policy package functions as a national strategic plan to establish South Korea as an innovative free-market economy with responsive leadership.

The move comes after Google asked to block 17 apps by Korea's Financial Services Commission in a similar move last month. Per a translation of the official notice, the regulator said that on its request, Apple blocked domestic access to overseas unreported virtual asset operators through Apple apps. KuCoin and MEXC are two well-known cryptocurrency exchanges included as part of the regulator's block request. This means installing the apps will no longer be possible, and existing users may not receive key updates. While South Korea has an active crypto trading culture, its regulations require exchanges to report themselves as virtual asset operators and comply with local laws. Many crypto investors also use exchanges operating in South Korea to maximise their profits through the currency-related price differences observed on these platforms. “In the future, in order to prevent money laundering risks and user damage, FIU will continue to block domestic access through mobile applications (apps) and internet sites of overseas unreported virtual asset operators through consultation with relevant organisations,” noted the regulator in its statement, highlighting dangers such as users being hacked. South Korea's Financial Services Commission noted there were 28 virtual asset operators that were legally reported, and that users should check the status of their own crypto exchanges through the www.kofiu.go.kr website.
