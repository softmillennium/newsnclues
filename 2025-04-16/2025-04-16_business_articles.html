                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese online retailer Temu, whose "Shop like a billionaire" marketing campaign made its way to last year's Super Bowl, has dramatically slashed its online ad spending in the U.S. and seen its ranking in Apple's App Store plunge following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, had been on an online advertising blitz in recent years in a bid to attract deal-hungry American shoppers to its site. With hefty spending on TV ads as well across Facebook, the company promoted clothing, jewelry, home goods and electronics at bargain basement prices. Downloads of Temu on Apple's App Store have fallen 62% in recent days, according to data from SimilarWeb, a digital data and analytics company. Ads for 50-cent eyebrow trimmers and $5 t-shirts that used to blanket Google search results and Facebook feeds have all but disappeared. President Trump's tariffs have upended Temu's business model, along with its advertising strategy. Packages shipped from China are now subject to a tariff rate of 145%, while the de minimis provision, which allows shipments worth less than $800 to enter the country duty-free, is set to go away on May 2. Both companies posted notices to their websites in recent days that warned they'll be raising prices late next week. "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up," Temu said on its site. "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025." Sellers on Amazon's third-party marketplace, many of whom source their products from China, have said they're considering raising prices as they reckon with higher costs from the tariffs. Amazon launched a competitor to Temu last November, called Amazon Haul, which features items under $20 that are largely from China. 2 top free iPhone app in the U.S., and Alibaba's Taobao, which ranked No. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that viral videos promoting their cheap products have spurred the download frenzy. A separate analysis by SimilarWeb showed Temu's paid traffic, or search, display and social media advertising that drove visits to its website, has dropped 77% since April 11. Temu's paid traffic previously outpaced nonpaid traffic to its website by 2 1/2 times, Ben Parkes, a consumer goods and retail analyst at Similarweb, said in an interview. Marketing firm Tinuiti found that 20% of U.S. Google Shopping ad impressions were bought by Temu on April 5. A week later, that number had fallen to zero. Representatives from Temu and Shein didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Temu was previously one of Meta's largest advertisers, but it appears to have dramatically scaled back its spending on the platform. As of Wednesday, Temu is running six ads across Meta platforms in the U.S., a review of Meta's ad library shows. That could be troublesome for Meta's advertising business, which has gotten a significant boost from the discount retailer. Advertising analyst Brian Wieser at Madison and Wall estimated that more than $7 billion of Meta's $132 billion in ad revenue in 2023 came from China. Meta is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 30. E-commerce analyst Juozas Kaziukenas said he expects Temu to turn its ads back on in the U.S. at some point, but that the company appears to be shifting its dollars to other markets in the interim. "But it means that new user acquisition is gone."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. importers are being notified of an increase in canceled sailings by freight ships out of China as ocean carriers try to balance the pullback in orders resulting from President Trump's tariffs and the escalation of tensions in the trade war. Major ocean freight alliance ONE has "suspended until further notice" a route it had previously been planning to bring back in May, which would include ports of Qingdao, Ningbo, Shanghai, Pusan, Vancouver, and Tacoma. Meanwhile, an existing route is planning to cancel its port call at Wilmington, North Carolina. If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage. JB Hunt shares hit their lowest level since November 2020 after commentary during the trucking company's earnings call about the uncertainty from tariffs. "We have no way of knowing how significant this drop in orders will be on vessel schedules," said Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. We won't go to zero containers, but we will see a decrease in containers and as a result, in the future, we will see a massive raft of blank sailings announced." Bruce Chan, director of global logistics & future mobility for Stifel, said the tariff policy has created significant uncertainty with respect to consumer demand, and retailers have been positioning their businesses conservatively with inventory, especially given "scar tissue" from the recent overstock after the post-Covid supply chain squeeze from 2021-2022. "That uncertainty is beginning to manifest in blanked container ship sailings on core eastbound transpacific lanes, in our view, opening the potential for a double-digit decline in inbound containerized imports as early as next month," he said. There were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. Major product categories from China that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs. As a result of the decrease in containers, ocean carriers will not only cancel vessels, but also adjust or cancel vessel routes commonly called "vessel strings," such as the ONE service from China to Vancouver and Tacoma. These routes dedicating vessels to move the ocean freight at specific ports take months of planning. The elimination of vessels also impacts U.S. exports bound for Asia and relying on ships traveling in both directions. Stretching out ship arrivals by canceling sailings is an option for container volume to better match capacity. According to Murphy, 99% of vessel services are weekly and it takes a vessel approximately seven weeks to make a round trip. "During Covid, ocean carriers parked their vessels for maintenance," Murphy said. "Ocean carriers can also blank (cancel) a sailing, omit vessel strings entirely, use smaller vessels, or slow steam the vessels where they are traveling longer." These measures will cut the available vessel capacity for containers, according to Murphy, which helps remaining ships to be filled, with uncertain implications for overall pricing in the ocean freight business. While a decline in sailings could lead to a drop in prices, during Covid, blank sailings were identified by shippers around the world as a reason for container rates that spiked as high as $30,000. In that case, shippers say the ocean carriers canceled sailings for longer than needed. The global supply chain demand and pricing situation remains fluid and subject to sharp short-term swings tied to tariffs policy. The "mid-low" ocean rates, which represent the costs of shipping goods for a larger-sized shipper on a particular ocean route, have jumped by 43% since March 30 for Vietnam. He said that is continuing after Trump's decision to pause what he called "reciprocal" tariffs on countries other than China for 90 days. "Shippers large and small all have to pay up for frontloading, as the 'pause' made the pulling forward of freight possible again," Sand added. This demand from U.S. shippers importing goods can be seen in the increase in container shipping spot rates on the Ho Chi Minh City to Los Angeles ports route, jumping by 24% going into April. According to data compiled by Xeneta for 2025, the spread between China's largest container port, Shanghai, and Vietnam's largest container port, Ho Chi Minh City, has also narrowed per forty-foot equivalent unit (FEU) for shipments to the ports of LA and Long Beach. Even with increased costs for shippers, they will continue to bring in imports from non-China nations because the situation remains highly unpredictable, Sand said. "There is every possibility the higher tariffs come into effect 90 days from now or even at an earlier stage," he added. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern in a speech Wednesday that the central bank could find itself in a dilemma between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth. With uncertainty elevated over what impact President Donald Trump's tariffs will have, the central bank leader said that while he expects higher inflation and lower growth, it's unclear where the Fed will need to devote greater focus. "If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close." Tariffs essentially act as a tax on imports, though their direct link to inflation historically has been spotty. In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Powell said tariffs are "likely to move us further away from our goals ... probably for the balance of this year." Powell gave no indication on where he sees interest rates headed, but noted that, "For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." Stocks hit session lows as Powell spoke while Treasury yields turned lower. In the case of higher inflation, the Fed would keep interest rates steady or even increase them to dampen demand. Powell emphasized the importance to keeping inflation expectations in check. Markets expect the Fed to start reducing rates again in June and to enact three or four quarter percentage point cuts by the end of 2025, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. Fed officials generally consider tariffs to be a one-time hit to prices, but the expansive nature of the Trump duties could alter that trend. The Fed's key inflation measure is expected to show a rate of 2.6% for March, he said. "Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation," said Powell. "The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored." Indeed, Powell noted: "The data in hand so far suggest that growth has slowed in the first quarter from last year's solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer spending appears to have grown modestly. In addition, strong imports during the first quarter, reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs, are expected to weigh on GDP growth." The report showed that a large portion of the growth came from car buyers looking to make purchases ahead of the tariffs, though multiple other sectors showed solid gains as well. Following the report, the Atlanta Fed said it sees GDP growing at a -0.1% pace in Q1 when adjusting for an unusual rise in gold imports and exports.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI has released its latest artificial intelligence model, which it said is capable of "thinking with images," meaning it can understand and analyze a user's sketches and diagrams, even if they're low quality. The rollout follows the September debut of OpenAI's first reasoning model, o1, which focused on solving complex problems and deliberating over its answers in multiple steps. The models can also rotate, zoom and use other image-editing tools. Since introducing its viral ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, OpenAI has been rapidly upgrading its models to go well beyond text into images, voice and videos. The company is racing to stay ahead in generative AI, where it faces heated competition from rivals including Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI. "For the first time, our reasoning models can independently use all ChatGPT tools — web browsing, Python, image understanding, and image generation," OpenAI wrote. "This helps them solve complex, multi-step problems more effectively and take real steps toward acting independently." The company, valued at $300 billion in a funding round last month, said that o3 and o4-mini are its first AI models that can "think with images." Last month, OpenAI released a native image-generation feature that went viral online for its ability to produce Studio Ghibli-style anime images. Both models were available starting Wednesday to ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Team customers. OpenAI's user community has long joked about its strange or confusing AI model names. CEO Sam Altman joined the banter this week, writing in a post on X, "how about we fix our model naming by this summer and everyone gets a few more months to make fun of us (which we very much deserve) until then?" The company also said that both models had been "stress-tested under our most rigorous safety program to date" and linked to its "Preparedness framework" updated earlier this week. OpenAI has come under fire recently for changes to its safety precautions and processes. It said this week that it reserved the right to "change its safety requirements if 'another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.'" In changing its policies this week, OpenAI wrote it would no longer require safety tests for certain fine-tuned models. In February, OpenAI launched AI agent tool Deep Research weeks before publishing its system card. OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mark Zuckerberg said that ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok posed a “highly urgent” competitive threat to Meta Platforms Inc. when it first sprang up in 2018, as he testified for a third day in the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust trial.

“We observed that our growth slowed down dramatically,” as TikTok gained popularity, the Meta chief executive officer said Wednesday. “It was highly urgent, this has been a top priority for the company for several years.”</p>

Kerrygold butter maker Ornua has sold most of the stockpiles it exported to the US ahead of a potential trade war as the threat of tariffs cloud its American sales outlook. 

“Whatever product was available to us that was allocated to the US market, we moved well in advance of the end of the calendar year, and that was in anticipation of a potential change,” Ornua Chief Executive Officer Conor Galvin said. “We're somewhat a victim of our own success in that a lot of that stuff is sold and moved through.”</p>

United Airlines Holdings Inc. reassured investors worried about wobbly demand with a vow to make money even during a recession.

The company plans to control costs and keep its planes full, dialing back flying plans as needed to keep profits coming in should President Donald Trump's trade war trigger an economic downturn. The carrier took the unusual step of issuing two profit forecastsBloomberg Terminal, saying adjusted earnings will be $11.50 to $13.50 a share this year if the current environment remains stable, or as little as $7 a share if the US economy enters a recession.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia stock fell in premarket trading and the Nasdaq was set to open lower on Wednesday after the chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar hit from Trump Administration restrictions on exporting H20 chips to China. Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in its first-quarter earnings, which ends on April 27. Shares in Jensen Huang's company had fallen almost 19% this year at Tuesday's close. Nvidia's H20 chips were specifically made to comply with Biden-era export controls on chips sent to China as the world's superpowers remain in an AI arms race. Jefferies analysts said the licensing measure was essentially a ban on H20 chips. "It should be noted that no licenses for GPU shipments into China have ever been granted and that the stated reason is concern over potential use or diversion of these chips for supercomputers in China," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote in a Tuesday note. Bernstein analysts said banning the H20 chip made "little sense." "H20 performance is low, well below already-available Chinese alternatives. Nvidia said in the filing the charges could relate to H20 chips that have already been manufactured and now may be more difficult to sell. It would also account for costs related to producing the chip and additional funds that may be needed to cover potential future losses. The Trump administration has taken steps to pave a way for tariffs on chips, including probes led by the Commerce Department into semiconductor imports. The investigations seek to determine what impacts those imports have on national security, which could give President Donald Trump a reason to implement tariffs on key tech goods. In general, Trump has said that his tariff strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic manufacturing of key goods. On Monday, Nvidia reiterated its commitment to invest $500 billion over the next four years in the US, promising AI supercomputers and data centers. In Asia, where Nvidia's supply chain is concentrated, stocks of  its suppliers declined on Wednesday. Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, fell more than 5% in Amsterdam after missing expectations and warning that tariff uncertainty could hit demand for its products.</p>

In late 2023, Cobi Blumenfeld-Gantz testified at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about how health insurance brokers target elderly Americans. “The Medicare enrollment and navigation process is broken,” Blumenfeld-Gantz told the committee. He described a thicket of marketers and lead generators who sought to persuade patients to choose private Medicare Advantage plans, often in lieu of the standard federal program known to most people as just Medicare.

Those private plans, which make up the most profitable category of the health insurance industry, provide additional benefits beyond what Medicare offers, such as dental and vision insurance, but they come with trade-offs. Whereas most doctors accept Medicare, the typical Medicare Advantage option has a much more limited network of doctors, requires prior authorization for more medical procedures and sometimes leaves patients with unexpectedly large out-of-pocket costs. According to Blumenfeld-Gantz, the people pitching those private plans don't always make these trade-offs clear. Instead, he told the Finance Committee, they “traffic in scare tactics, imitate government agencies like the federal Medicare program and inaccurately advertise plan benefits.”</p>

Energy Secretary Chris Wright says Donald Trump's administration is giving the “green light” to more US oil production, but the signal from the fracking company he used to run is flashing bright red.

Liberty Energy Inc., which Wright led until his appointment to Trump's cabinet, has tumbled 43% this year, one of the most precipitous declines among US energy stocks. The value of Wright's stake in Liberty has fallen by nearly half to about $30 million over that period.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he wanted to start a self-deportation program for immigrants in America. Trump was speaking to Fox Noticias in an interview when he said his administration would be rolling out new schemes to tackle illegal immigration in the US. Trump added that he hadn't worked out the exact details of the program, though it could involve giving immigrants a stipend so they could return to their home country. Cracking down on immigration has long been a focus for Trump. While on the campaign trail, Trump said deporting millions of immigrants would result in more job opportunities for Americans. Immigration researchers and analysts, however, told Business Insider that Trump's plans could exacerbate America's demographic challenges as well as result in a labor shortage for the agriculture and construction industries. Earlier in the interview, Trump acknowledged that farmers and business owners rely on immigrants as a source of labor and said he would help businesses hire them lawfully. "We are making it so that if a farmer can give recommendations to people, we're going to be very soothing in terms of perhaps letting that farmer take responsibility," Trump told Fox Noticias. "But you know, ultimately, at some point, we want people to go out and come back as legal," he added. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from BI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of real estate agents across the US opened their email Saturday night to find an unexpected message from Andy Florance, the CEO of CoStar Group and Homes.com. As the top executive for one of real estate's largest search websites, Florance had a lot on his mind. For months, the industry has been embroiled in a fight over "exclusive inventory" — homes marketed for sale by real estate agents but purposely kept off public search portals like Homes.com or Realtor.com. Florance wasn't writing to complain about this practice, though. Two days earlier, Zillow had unveiled a new rule threatening to blacklist scores of homes from its well-trafficked website. The surprise announcement took direct aim at exclusive inventory, also known as secret or hidden home listings. Zillow said it would permanently ban from its site any listing that had gone through this preview period. Zillow, by far the most popular destination for online home shoppers, framed the move as a defense of consumers: "Fragmented listing access — in which a home is available on one platform but not another, or shared with some agents but not others — creates frustration and distrust," the company said in its announcement. Homes.com, Florance told the agents, would happily welcome any listings scorned by Zillow. Zillow's declaration adds yet another twist, marking an explosive turning point in the long-simmering dispute over exclusive inventory and hidden home listings. The company is flexing its considerable muscle, presenting agents with a daunting choice: Either share your listing with Zillow and everyone else as soon as you so much as stake a sign in the front yard, or explain to your client why their home will never appear on the website that's become synonymous with real estate. As usual, regular consumers will bear the brunt of these changes. Sellers need to understand exactly how — and where — their agents will advertise their homes, while buyers may have to canvass a range of websites for inventory. Finding that dream home could soon become a game of hide and seek. Many agents don't bother with exclusive inventory. As soon as they agree to market a home on behalf of a seller, they add it to the multiple listing service, or MLS, a local database that shares the information with other agents, brokerages, and big search portals like Zillow. Once a listing is live in the MLS, it's pretty much everywhere. But agents have other options that are growing more popular. These are shared via email, word of mouth, or internal listing platforms, so the homes don't actually pop up on the internet for casual browsers to see. In both instances, a brokerage like Compass, the largest in the country by sales volume, can lure agents and clients with early access to homes they can't find anywhere else. It's easy to get bogged down in the details of how this all works, and it remains to be seen how Zillow will actually implement these changes. But the spirit of Zillow's new rule, spelled out in last week's announcement, is pretty simple: "If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere." Redfin, another leading search portal, has taken a similar stance, saying it will also ban listings that are not shared everywhere. Both sites notably make exceptions for homes that were originally office exclusives — if a seller wants to remain truly private, they can do so within the walls of their brokerage and turn to Zillow or Redfin later. (Zillow has said that listings can be unbanned if the seller breaks up with their broker.) At least two big brokerages — eXp Realty, the third-largest brokerage by sales volume, according to the consulting firm T3 Sixty, and NextHome, which has 6,000 agents nationwide — have made public commitments to abide by Zillow's policy. "We encourage all brokers to support Zillow's efforts to maintain the transparency of real estate markets and prevent their balkanization," Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at CPC and a former senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement. But there are problems with Zillow and Redfin's position. Ironically, they could push more home listings into the shadows by encouraging brokerages like Compass to pursue "office exclusives" rather than sharing homes publicly on the Compass website. "It's not the flex they think it is," says Amanda Orson, the founder and CEO of Galleon, an alternative marketplace that connects homebuyers and sellers directly. Zillow realized that not having all of the inventory available is their Achilles' heel, and they just telegraphed it." Glenn Kelman, Redfin's CEO, doesn't see it that way. Redfin has called on MLSes to create an option that would allow agents to share listings while preventing websites from showing price drops and days on market, which Kelman describes as a middle ground. The most important thing, he says, is for consumers to be able to see all the homes no matter which website they visit. Here's one thing I'm sure of: This is a mess. There are more than 500 MLSes around the country, each with its own policies and enforcement mechanisms. In an email to Compass agents the day after Zillow's announcement, Reffkin advised agents to "keep doing what you're doing." "This moment goes beyond a policy — it's about control versus choice," Reffkin wrote. Buyers may be forced to scour a range of websites to get an idea of what's out there, and even then, they could risk overlooking their dream home. "As much as many of us wouldn't like that to happen, it's kind of getting set up to where it could happen," Saul Klein, a longtime real estate executive and the CEO of the San Diego MLS, tells me. Indeed, Andy Florance's email to agents over the weekend included a postscript with a link to contact the Department of Justice. But government action is hardly guaranteed, and it could be years before anything happens. "There is something larger at stake than just who gets control of the inventory," Kelman tells me. "It's the US housing market, and we're supposed to all be at an age where we actually care about that. And I think everybody does, but emotions are just running high right now."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hong Kong's postal service is temporarily stopping the delivery of postal items from the US in retaliation to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs. Hongkong Post also said that from Tuesday, it would be suspending the delivery of surface mail — which is sent by land or sea — to the US. It would also stop accepting airmail destined for the US from April 27. Postal items only containing documents will not be affected, the release said. The US is one of Hong Kong's biggest trading partners. Nearly $28 billion worth of goods were exported from the US into Hong Kong in 2024. Hongkong Post's announcement comes as trade tensions between China and the US continue to escalate. The two countries have exchanged retaliatory tariffs since Trump first imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China in February. The US now imposes a 145% tariff on goods from China, and Beijing has responded with a 125% tariff on US-made products. Trump has also cracked down on the de minimis loophole, which allowed small packages under $800, like those from Chinese retailers Shein and Temu, to be brought into the country tax-free. The order added that per-item postal fees for these parcels would increase to $100 between May 2 and June 1 and to $200 after June 1.</p>
