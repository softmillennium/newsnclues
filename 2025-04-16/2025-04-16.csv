            Hatched in quiet streams and rivers, salmon undertake a perilous journey to reach the open ocean where they become mature adults. Over millions of years, generations of young salmon have migrated great distances, in some cases traveling hundreds of miles from freshwater systems to the sea. However, modern salmon face a hurdle that was unknown to their ancient ancestors: pharmaceutical pollution that changes their migration behavior.
    


            Recently, researchers discovered that when a drug called clobazam accumulates in salmon's brains, migrating fish reach the ocean sooner and navigate dam obstacles faster. On the surface, this change might seem helpful to salmon. However, any deviation from normal animal behavior through human activity — particularly when psychoactive substances are involved — is a red flag, and the full extent of how drug pollution may alter salmon health, behavior and reproduction is still unknown, scientists reported April 10 in the journal Science.

Clobazam, which is commonly found in wastewater, belongs to a group of medicines called benzodiazepines, which depress the central nervous system. The drug is used to prevent epileptic seizures, for short-term treatment of anxiety and to treat anxiety-related sleep disorders. But because neural wiring in fish resembles that of mammals, fish are highly susceptible to the effects of drugs that tweak human neurochemistry, said Dr. Christopher C. Caudill, a professor in the department of fish and wildlife sciences at the University of Idaho.
    


            “Humans share a large amount of biological architecture with fishes — our physiology and anatomy are remarkably similar. Thus, it is intuitive that psychoactive drugs alter the behavior of both fishes and humans,” Caudill, who was not involved in the research, told CNN in an email.
    


            Prior research showed that benzodiazepines could alter behavior in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), but they did so under conditions unlike those experienced by wild salmon, said study coauthor Dr. Marcus Michelangeli, a lecturer in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia.
    


            “Those studies were largely conducted in laboratory settings, only tracked movement over short distances — less than 100 metres (328 feet) — or used drug concentrations much higher than what salmon would typically encounter in the wild,” Michelangeli said via email.
    


            “Our study took a different approach. We followed the entire river-to-sea migration of juvenile salmon in a natural river system, using drug concentrations that match what fish are actually exposed to in the environment.”
    


            The field investigation's findings highlight the growing risks pharmaceutical pollutants pose to wildlife populations across the globe, according to Michelangeli.
    


            For the new study, the scientists performed trials with more than 700 young salmon, or “smolts,” in the laboratory and in the field. The research team used sound-transmitting tags to remotely track hundreds of smolts in 2020 and 2021 as the fish navigated the Dal River in central Sweden.
    


            Migrating smolts swim downriver into a reservoir, hurtle over rapids and crest two dams before finally reaching the Baltic Sea. The journey takes 10 to 13 days.
    


            Two major classes of pharmaceuticals — benzodiazepines and opioids — “are commonly detected in rivers and streams worldwide, including in Sweden, where our study was conducted,” Michelangeli said.
    


            Time-release implants in the smolts dispensed two drugs from these classes: clobazam and tramadol. Fish received clobazam, or tramadol, or both. A control group of smolts received implants with no drugs in them at all.
    


            “These two drugs are known to interact chemically when taken together in humans, and they often co-occur in the environment,” Michelangeli said. “This made them a good test case to explore how pharmaceutical mixtures might affect animal behaviour.”
    


            Along with the field trials, the scientists ran a laboratory-based study on 256 smolts to confirm that the implants worked as intended and that the drugs were lingering in the fishes' bodily tissues and brains.

            When the researchers tracked the migrating salmon with transmitters, they found that more clobazam-exposed salmon reached the Baltic than any of the other fish. Compared with the control group, more than twice as many salmon with clobazam implants made it to the sea.
    


            Lab experiments showed that clobazam affected shoaling behavior, in which smolts stick close together to evade predators. Under the influence of clobazam, fish swam farther apart even when a predator was near, “suggesting that the drug may reduce natural fear responses,” Michelangeli said.
    


            Fish with clobazam implants were also faster at getting past two hydropower dams along their migration route — about two to eight times faster than fish in the other groups. These dams are notorious death zones, where churning turbines can swiftly reduce smolts to salmon tartare.
    


            By diminishing fear in smolts, clobazam might briefly benefit the fish by boosting their migration success. But the drug could also increase their vulnerability to ocean predators, decreasing their chances of surviving long enough to return home to spawn, Caudill said.
    


            “The transition from freshwater to saltwater is one of the most dangerous times in the life of a salmon because they experience many new predators in the ocean,” he said. Drug-exposed and risk-taking salmon may be more likely to reach the Baltic, but less likely to ever leave it alive.
    


            Caudill's research investigates how environmental change affects fish ecology and evolution. In future work, he said, “I do plan to consider the potential for behavioral effects from pharmaceutical pollution.”

            Further study will clarify how behavioral changes from drug pollution affect long-term survival, reproduction and how populations change over time — in salmon and in other wildlife that are vulnerable to pharmaceutical contaminants.
    


            “While more drug-exposed salmon may reach the sea, it doesn't mean they're healthy or that the population benefits in the long term,” Michelangeli said.
    


            “The bottom line is we need to be cautious with this interpretation. Changing behaviour with pharmaceuticals — even unintentionally — could reshape whole populations in ways we don't yet understand.”

            The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit dismissed a legal claim against the NFL's New Orleans Saints from a man who says he is the “direct descendant of the Kings of France” over the trademark of the fleur-de-lis symbol on Monday.
    


            A court document shows Michel J. Messier claimed that he and his family own “intellectual property rights to the Fleur de Lys, Orleans and Saints marks” and sought to cancel the NFL franchise's patent for the symbols.
    


            However, the court ruled that his claim has no evidence, suggesting that neither Messier nor his family currently use the fleur-de-lis in any commercial capacity to merit consideration.
    


            When contacted by CNN Sports, Messier said that he plans to file a further cancelation appeal with the US Supreme Court by May 1, “including but not limited to the commercial value of my family's approximately 1,500 years of continuing business interests.”
    


            Messier told CNN that he will be filing for Name, Image and Likeness claims for the fleur-de-lis as well as “legally pursuing” the Saints' alleged characterization of him as a “‘mere intermeddler' in my (our) own family business.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Saints' legal representative for comment.
    


            The Saints were granted a trademark by the US Patent and Trademark Office in 1974 to use a stylized fleur-de-lis symbol having become a professional NFL team in 1967.
    


            Since then, the symbol – a three-petaled flower which has become an emblem of the city of New Orleans – has been closely associated with the Louisiana-based team and is displayed on players' helmets.
    


            The fleur-de-lis has long been associated with the French royalty, its origins going back almost 1,000 years.
    


            Messier's initial petition to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was dismissed in June 2024, a ruling he later appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
    


            Messier claims the fleur-de-lis symbol was used by his family for “several centuries,” according to court documents.
    


            But the federal court agreed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board's decision that Messier's claim failed to “allege any commercial interests in the mark, or that (Messier) owns or conducts any business under the mark, and thus he cannot allege entitlement,” per the court document.
    


            The ruling concluded that the case had been dismissed, saying: “As Mr. Messier does not have standing, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of his appeal.”

(CNN) — Although the two-dose shingles vaccine may force you to lay low for a day or two after getting the shot, it's over 90% effective against this painful disease and its complications.
    


            Now it turns out the shingles vaccine may have an added benefit: reducing the risk of dementia, according to a new study published in the journal Nature.
    


            It's a welcome discovery for people who have already received the shingles vaccine. And knowing the vaccine has additional benefits may convince more people 50 and older (and those 19 and older with weakened immune systems) to get it.
    


            To help make sense of the study's takeaways, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. I wondered how convincing the results are and how the shingles vaccine might be beneficial to brain health. In addition, who should get the shingles vaccine? If someone already had shingles, should they still get it?
    


            Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


CNN: To start, what is shingles?



Dr. Leana Wen: Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. This is the same virus that causes chickenpox, and people who have had chickenpox still carry the virus in their bodies. This virus can be reactivated many years later and manifests as shingles.
    


            The major symptom is a painful rash that commonly appears as a band of blisters localized to one area on the body . Where that is depends on the person; shingles can occur virtually anywhere, including over the face. Most people who develop shingles have it once in their lifetimes, although some people can have it more than once. Some serious complications are associated with shingles, including long-term nerve pain known as postherpetic neuralgia.

CNN: Is shingles contagious?



Wen: You cannot get shingles by being in contact with someone who has shingles. However, someone who never had chickenpox or didn't get the chickenpox vaccine can get the varicella-zoster virus through direct contact with a person who has shingles. An individual who has active blistering should keep the rash covered to prevent spread.
    


CNN: What vaccine is recommended to prevent shingles? Who should get it?



Wen: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends two doses of the recombinant zoster vaccine, called Shingrix, for adults 50 and older . This age recommendation is because the chance of the virus reactivating increases with age. The CDC also recommends Shingrix for people 19 years and older who have weakened immune systems. The two doses should be spaced out between two and six months.
    


CNN: What are potential side effects?



Wen: Similar to other vaccines, the Shingrix vaccine can lead to pain, redness and swelling at the injection site in the first day or so after vaccination. Some people may experience fatigue, headache, fever, shivering and upset stomach. These side effects generally subside within two to three days following the shot and are far preferred to getting shingles.
    


CNN: How convincing are the new study's findings that the shingles vaccine has this additional benefit of reducing dementia risk?



Wen: This study follows several other studies that identified a possible link between the vaccine and lowering dementia risk. The design of this one is particularly intriguing because it took advantage of a “natural experiment” that occurred in Wales as it rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. At that time, in part due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date — September 2, 1933 — were eligible for the shingles shots. People born before that date were ineligible.
    


            This rule set up a fascinating opportunity to directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time. It eliminates a bias found in many other studies of vaccine outcomes, which is that those adults who choose to receive vaccines may otherwise engage in more health-promoting behaviors than those who do not.
    


            In this study, researchers followed about 280,000 participants who were ages 71 to 88 and were without dementia at the onset and tracked their diagnosis of dementia for seven years. Nearly half of the participants eligible for the vaccine received it. The researchers found that people who received the shingles vaccine had a 20% reduction in relative dementia risk compared with those who did not.
    


            To make sure there weren't other confounding factors, researchers accounted for things such as how often the participants sought medical care. They also did a sub-analysis looking at those born in the same year, but with the arbitrary date of the September 2 birth cutoff, and found similar results, meaning that in this sub-analysis, they were comparing people who are virtually the same age .
    


            I think these are quite important findings. There are many pharmaceutical interventions being studied to delay or slow the development of dementia. If any of them found an effect size of 20%, they would be deemed substantial. Here is a relatively low-cost intervention that is already recommended to prevent another disease — shingles — that could have this added benefit.

CNN: How could the shingles vaccine benefit brain health?



Wen: Dementia is a broad category that includes many different causes. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases, according to the CDC. A lot is still unknown about the cause of Alzheimer's, but one hypothesis is that it is driven by brain tissue inflammation. Shingrix can reduce neuroinflammation caused by virus reactivation and perhaps can help reduce brain inflammation, too.
    


CNN: Is someone already had shingles, should they get the vaccine? What if they have had chickenpox?



Wen: You should get Shingrix even if you've had shingles, according to the CDC. In addition, if you had the previous version of the vaccine, called Zostavax, you should still get Shingrix because it's more effective. Zostavax was licensed and recommended in the US in 2006. It is no longer available here due to the availability of Shingrix, which was approved in 2017. If you are not sure whether you got Zostavax or Shingrix, you should try to find your immunization records. Chances are that if you got a vaccine against shingles between 2006 and 2017, it was Zostavax. It was removed from the US market as of November 18, 2020. 



            This recommendation is regardless of whether someone is known to have had chickenpox in the past. That's because more than 99% of Americans born on or before 1980 are estimated to have chickenpox, even if they don't know that they have had it.
    


            Unfortunately, not many people are getting the benefits of the Shingrix vaccine right now. In 2021, the CDC estimates that only 15.4% of adults 50 and above had had two doses of Shingrix. Perhaps this study could help to convince those eligible to get the shot. Not only can it prevent shingles and long-term nerve damage that could accompany shingles, it also may have a protective effect on their brain to reduce the risk of developing dementia.

            America's two biggest public broadcasters, PBS and NPR, are facing an up-or-down vote over their federal funding for the first time in decades.
    


            The Trump administration sees it as a worthwhile cultural fight, casting PBS and NPR as wastes of money that “spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news'” in a statement earlier this week.
    


            Station leaders assert that if you tune in, you'll see that the White House's portrayal is just plain wrong.
    


            “There's nothing more American than PBS, and our work is only possible because of the bipartisan support we have always received from Congress,” PBS CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement.
    


            Without the federal funding, some local stations could be forced off the air, especially in rural areas that are Republican strongholds. In many cases “these are the last locally owned broadcasters in these communities,” Ed Ulman, the CEO of Alaska Public Media, told CNN.
    


            So station leaders from Alaska to Maine are rallying public support and lobbying persuadable lawmakers, hoping to fend off the funding threat.
    


            “The plan is to remind people of the value proposition,” said Jim Schachter, the CEO of New Hampshire Public Radio.
    


            In Schachter's view, the Trump White House's attempt to defund NPR and PBS is part of a wider effort to control information and clamp down on independent news coverage.
    


            “This is not about the money,” he said. “It's a minuscule amount of money in the federal budget, though it's critical to meeting public media's civic responsibilities. This is about attacking a free press.”
    


            At an annual cost to taxpayers of $535 million, or roughly $1.60 per American taxpayer, stations provide free and universal access to educational shows, emergency alerts and a wide array of news and cultural content.
    


            Normally the funding is a barely-noticed line item in a gigantic budget bill. In fact, the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month included another $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations.
    


            Congress budgets money for public broadcasting two years in advance, so there is nearly $1.1 billion currently allocated for the future – and that's the amount the Trump administration wants to take back.
    


            In a Fox News appearance on Tuesday, Trump's budget chief Russ Vought confirmed that the administration will send a rescission proposal to Congress at the end of April.
    


            Such a proposal would start a 45-day clock for the House and Senate to either vote to cut the funding or ignore the proposal and keep the funding intact.
    


            On Fox, Vought said “we're really excited about” defunding public media, justifying the proposal by claiming PBS and NPR are “putting drag queens in children's programs, doing documentaries pushing for reparations, and dividing the country on the basis of race.”
    


            Republicans made the same charges at a House hearing last month. Public media executives debunked some of the claims; for instance, “the drag queen was actually not on any of our kids shows,” Kerger testified, pointing out that an image was cherry-picked from a single station's website, and “it was immediately pulled down.”
    


            The White House published a list of grievances with public media earlier this week. The list contained news reports about race, sexuality and gender identity along with many allegations of liberal bias.
    


            Public media leaders want to reframe the discussion altogether. After all, stations carry a wide array of radio and TV programming, from award-winning newscasts like “Morning Edition” and magazine shows like “Fresh Air” to educational programs like “NOVA” and children's staples like “Sesame Street.”
    


            “Without PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis,” Kerger said in a statement.
    


            NPR similarly highlighted its “trusted local and national news, culture, lifesaving emergency alerts, and public safety information.”
    


            In the country's northernmost state, Alaska Public Media operates a radio station in Anchorage and partners with 26 locally owned and operated radio stations, which reach almost every corner of the frontier. Those stations combine to form Alaska's only statewide news network, which employs nearly 60 journalists, Ulman said. “It is fair to say that many of these stations will close if federal funding is eliminated,” he said.
    


            That's because smaller outlets tend to need more federal support.
    


            This year Schachter's stations in New Hampshire will get $542,000 from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting – less than 6% of his $10 million budget. He said the federal funds “give us a solid starting point” and enable the stations to raise more money from listeners, foundations and other sources. “We fight every day for every dollar,” he said.
    


            If the federal dollars dried up, “the knock-on effects would be huge,” Schachter said.
    


            That's because, in addition to the direct support to local stations, the nationwide system provides for satellite connections, content management platforms and even music licenses.
    


            With fewer stations able to pay dues and pick up syndicated programming, the system could start to fall apart, executives warn.
    


            That's exactly what longtime conservative critics of PBS and NPR want to see happen. But public media executives are banking on public support, which they hope will translate to Republican votes to protect the funding.
    


            In a recent Pew Research poll, only 24% of adults said the government should stop funding public media, while 43% said it should continue and 33% were not sure.
    


            “The majority of Americans think it's worth the $1.60 that they pay in taxes,” Ulman said.
    


            In the coming weeks, advocates for the networks will also point to the ongoing cutbacks in for-profit local news coverage to argue in favor of public media.
    


            “The commercial marketplace for this kind of civic-minded, community-building, public service journalism is broken,” Schachter said.

            An American preacher who was taken hostage by armed men while preaching a sermon in a South African township last week has been rescued in a fierce gun battle with his kidnappers, police said Wednesday.
    


            Josh Sullivan, 45, was kidnapped last Thursday during an evening service in Motherwell, a township in Gqeberha, formerly known as Port Elizabeth, in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, the Fellowship Baptist Church said.
    


            The South African Police Service said officers launched a rescue operation after receiving intelligence the pastor was being held by his abductors at a house in KwaMagxaki, another township in the city.
    


            A rescue team was sent to the location, a police statement said, “leading to a high-intensity shootout” that left “three unidentified suspects” dead.
    


            “As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises. The suspects inside the vehicle upon seeing law enforcement allegedly attempted to flee and opened fire on the team,” the statement read.

            It added that Sullivan, whom the Associated Press reported is from the US state of Tennessee, was found inside the vehicle “miraculously unharmed” and “is currently in an excellent condition.”
    


            Tom Hatley, whom Sullivan had said on his website he was training under, also announced the rescue. “Josh has been released,” Hatley wrote in a Facebook post along with a picture of Sullivan and his family. “I just got ‘the go ahead to let it be known,'” he added while urging for privacy from the public.
    


            “Also, PLEASE respect The Sullivans privacy and their parents. A lot of folks love The Sullivans and they love you back, but give them some time,” he said in another post.
    


            Kidnappings are at a record high in South Africa with an average of 51 abductions every day, authorities said last year. The country also grapples with deadly mass shootings and a murder rate that is among the highest in the world.
    


            Sullivan's abduction comes two months after renowned Islamic cleric Muhsin Hendricks was shot dead by armed men in Bethelsdorp, also in the Eastern Cape province.
    


            Sullivan, who describes himself as “a church planting missionary,” arrived in South Africa in 2018 with plans to “finish language school … and plant a church to the Xhosa speaking people,” he said on his website.

            President Donald Trump is using tariffs to disrupt nearly everything about the global trade order. Except for a tariff policy that favors men over women.
    


            For decades, the US tariff system has taxed women's clothing more heavily than men's. Tariffs on women's clothing are currently about three percent higher than men's, a policy that's known as “pink tariffs” — similar to the “pink tax” that makes the same products for women more expensive than men's.
    


            That means women pay an average extra dollar per garment compared to men, costing them more than $2 billion a year, according to research by Edward Gresser, vice president and director for trade and global markets at the Progressive Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
    


            And with Trump imposing 10% tariffs on most trading partners, with even higher levies for Canada, Mexico and China, the cost for women could easily go higher.
    


            “As he is instituting massive new tariffs, President Trump is missing a chance to tackle historically regressive and misogynistic traits” of the global free trade system, said Steve Lamar, the president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association.
    


            Most manufactured apparel and footwear are classified by gender in the US Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), which sets out the tariff rates for all categories of merchandise imported into the United States. Tariff rates on women's clothing were, on average, 16.7% in 2022 — 2.9 percentage points higher than the 13.6% average tariff rate for men's clothing, according to Gresser.
    


            Breaking it down to individual items: Women's suits in 2017, for example, were subject to a 15.1% tariff rate, while men's suits were subject to a 13.3% tariff. Women's underwear was hit with a 12.8% tariff, while men's underwear had an 8.6% tariff.
    


            There's no single reason why tariffs on women's clothing are higher than men's, but the policy has taken shape over decades.
    


            During the 1930s and 1940s, when America helped design the global free trading system, women's clothing production was a smaller industry while men's clothing was a major source of employment and an economic driver. US textile and apparel manufacturers at the time were more focused on lobbying to lower tariffs and end trade barriers on men's clothing, trade experts say. The current tariff gap is a relic of that old trade regime.
    


            Companies have attempted to end the gender bias in tariff rates. Steve Madden, Asics, Columbia Sportswear and other companies sued the government in 2007 to strike down the tariff policy, but the suit failed because courts ruled that the tariff gaps were not designed to be discriminatory.
    


            There also has been little movement from the federal government to fix the policy. But this year, two Democratic lawmakers, Rep. Lizzie Fletcher of Texas and Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado, introduced legislation known as the “Pink Tariffs Study Act” that would direct the Treasury Department and other agencies to examine the impact of tariffs on women and other consumer groups.
    


            Trump's tariffs could unintentionally narrow the gender gap by raising the floor of tariffs on men's clothing, however, said Lori Taylor, a professor in the department of public service and administration at Texas A&M who studies trade policy.
    


            But Trump's tariffs will ultimately impact women more than men because women spend more money on average on clothing. In 2023, household spending on women's apparel averaged $655, compared with $406 for men's apparel, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    


            “My policy preference would have been to lower tariffs for both men's and women's clothing” to reduce the gap, Taylor said.
    


            Trump's tariffs will have an outsized impact on clothing because nearly all clothing sold in the United States is imported.
    


            Consumers immediately will face 64% higher apparel prices from Trump's tariffs, according to the Yale Budget Lab.
    


            Tariff disparities aren't just between women and men. Tariffs will hurt lower-income households and the goods they rely on more than wealthier households.
    


            That's because lower-income consumers spend a greater share of their income on basic clothing and necessities than higher-income consumers. Tariffs also tax cheap, mass-market goods at higher rates than luxury items.
    


            Socks, underwear, t-shirts, sneakers and other clothing basics have higher tariff rates than luxury items because tariffs vary by fabric content, said Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware. High-end fabrics such as wool, cashmere and silk have lower tariff rates than the cotton, polyester and nylon used to manufacture inexpensive clothing and sneakers.
    


            Prices for clothing basics will also rise more quickly than luxury items because of Trump's tariffs, trade experts say, because basics typically have little markup. That leaves companies with less room to absorb higher costs.



            “The cost increase will be higher at the low end than at the luxury end,” Edward Gresser said. “Hourly-wage America will be carrying a lot of the tariff burden.”

            GOP-led states are barreling ahead in a push to require voters to show documents proving their citizenship when registering, as efforts by President Donald Trump and his congressional allies to enact the mandate nationwide show little likelihood of success.
    


            Twenty-two states have considered proof-of-citizenship legislation this year, with Wyoming last month becoming the latest to enact such a policy, according to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election-related legislation. That's a dramatic increase from the six states that weighed these kinds of bills just four years ago – underscoring an intensifying campaign by some Republicans to elevate an issue that voting experts say is virtually non-existent – foreigners infiltrating the US voting rolls. In recent years, hard-right activists have claimed, without evidence, that voting by noncitizens is fueling fraud and affecting election results.
    


            The state-by-state legislative push comes as national Republicans from Trump on down have made the proposal a top agenda item, even as those federal efforts face serious legal, legislative and logistical obstacles.
    


            The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives last week passed its own proof-of-citizenship bill, reprising an effort that began last year. However, the bill faces a near-impossible hurdle in the Senate, where Republicans lack the votes to overcome an expected filibuster by Democrats.
    


            Last month, Trump – who has made repeated and baseless claims that fraud contributed to his 2020 defeat – sought to single-handedly change how local governments and states carry out elections with a sweeping executive order that included several provisions aimed to boost proof of citizenship requirements, amid attacks on other state policies for how elections are administered.
    


            Several lawsuits are challenging Trump's order, arguing that his actions amount to an unconstitutional presidential overreach into elections. And the administration is now claiming in court filings that Trump's directive that a federal elections commission do what it can to encourage the adoption of proof of citizenship requirements was more of a “proposal” that would need to go through many more procedural steps – including gaining the support of at least one Democrat on the relevant commission – before becoming reality.
    


            But even if it ends up lacking any real teeth, the executive order is a clear signal to Republican state legislators, voting rights experts told CNN.
    


            “The president is clearly telecasting that this is what he wants his allies across the country to be advancing,” said Liz Avore, a senior adviser to the Voting Rights Lab, which tracks election-related legislation.
    


            It's already against the law for noncitizens to vote in federal elections and those who do risk jail time and deportation. Currently in most states, voters confirm their citizenship by signing a sworn statement. Critics argue that requiring people provide proof, through documents such as birth certificates or passports, to register to vote could disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans who might lack ready access to those documents and could be improperly kicked off the voting rolls.
    


            One recent survey conducted by SSRS for the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, Voting Rights Lab and other groups showed that roughly 9% of eligible voters – estimated at more than 21 million people – would have a difficult time obtaining the required documents, and 2% lack access to them altogether.
    


            It is rare for noncitizens to vote. An audit of Iowa's rolls of 2.1 million registered voters released last month found 277 noncitizens on the rolls and concluded that 35 had cast ballots that were ultimately counted in the 2024 general election.
    


            Litigation over a Kansas attempt to implement a 2011 mandate in that state revealed that 31,000 Kansans were denied registration because of failure to provide a citizenship document in the roughly three years the law was in force.
    


            Opponents say the GOP-led efforts could suppress voting, particularly for poor and older voters and create additional obstacles for women who change their names after marriage because their birth certificates or other documents establishing their citizenship might not match their current last names. Republican supporters of the bill that recently passed the US House said states can help affected people overcome those barriers by choosing to include additional records, such as marriage certificates, to the list of documents they will accept in verifying citizenship.
    


            The effort to pass proof-of-citizenship statutes around the country is advancing alongside a campaign by conservative activists to change state constitutions to require US citizenship to vote, although it already is illegal for noncitizens to do so in presidential and congressional contests. (Washington, DC, and some municipalities in three states – California, Maryland and Vermont – have allowed permanent, legal residents to vote on local issues.)
    


            Eight states last year approved measures adding a citizenship requirement to their constitutions, bringing the total number of states with explicit prohibitions in their constitutions to 15, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
    


            The challenge in enacting the mandate is that most states, under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, are obligated to accept, at least for federal elections, a federal registration form that has not included citizenship documents among its requirements.
    


            As a result, Arizona – which first pursued a citizenship mandate more than two decades ago – set up a dual system for elections to implement its proof-of-citizenship law, establishing a separate a “federal only” list of voters who have not met the state's mandate and so are barred from voting for state and local offices, but can vote in federal elections.
    


            New Hampshire, like Wyoming, is exempt from the relevant provisions of the 1993 federal statute because it allows people to register on the same day that they vote. New Hampshire has a new proof-of-citizenship requirement that was in place for elections for the first time last month and will apply to all elections, including those for federal office, in a state that plays a key role in presidential politics.
    


            Reegan DePasquale, who moved to Hampton, New Hampshire, from Florida last December, said she recently became ensnared by the new provisions. She said she showed up to register and vote in her town's March 11 election at roughly 5 p.m. – after finishing work and picking up her elementary-age children from their after-school activities.
    


            But DePasquale said she wasn't aware of the law's details and had only her driver's license and US Global Entry card in her wallet as proof of her identity. Given the late hour – and realizing that she still needed to feed her kids dinner and get them settled for the evening – she gave up on retrieving her passport from her home and returning to vote before polls closed.
    


            “It was frustrating,” DePasquale told CNN. “I just don't carry around my passport and birth certificate with me.”
    


            In all, at least 96 people appeared to have had problems voting during that day's election because of the law, according to the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights – a coalition that monitored activity at nearly two dozen polling places.
    


            Liz Tentarelli, president of the New Hampshire League of Women Voters, said lawmakers in other places should view the Granite State's recent experience as a “cautionary tale.”
    


            “There will be people turned away, and if that's what a state wants, it's a mistake,” she said.  “We should not be creating laws to disenfranchise.”
    


            New Hampshire state Rep. Bob Lynn, a Republican who authored the bill that requires proof of citizenship, said voting appeared to go smoothly for most residents. “It's too bad that you didn't familiarize yourself in advance with what you needed to do” to cast a ballot, he said of cases like DePasquale's. “That's what the law is.”
    


            The new law also prohibits the use of sworn statements, which attest to a voter's qualifications if they show up at the polls without the required documentation.
    


            “We shouldn't have a trust-me situation for voting,” Lynn, the former chief justice of the state's Supreme Court, told CNN. “If you forget your ATM card and go to the bank and want to make a withdrawal, the bank isn't going to let you sign an affidavit, saying ‘My name is really John Smith, and I really have an account here.'”
    


            New Hampshire lawmakers are now weighing another bill drafted by Lynn that would extend the proof-of-citizenship mandate to those who vote by mail.
    


            Some of the country's most populous states also are moving to change their laws.
    


            One bill advancing in the Florida legislature would require first-time registrants to verify their citizenship status with one of seven forms of identification, including a birth certificate, passport or naturalization document. But proof of citizenship also would be needed to make changes to existing voter registrations, such as updating an address.
    


            And in Texas, the state Senate this month approved a bill that would require proof-of-citizenship documents to register to vote.  The measure would apply not just to new voters but to the 18 million people already on the Texas voting rolls, by mandating that election officials use federal and state databases to determine the citizenship status of existing voters.
    


            “Most of us agree that US elections are for US citizens,” Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, the bill's author, said during floor debate this month. “However, the federal government has prevented states from requiring proof of citizenship at the point of registration.”
    


            Those whose citizenship could not be verified would receive a “limited federal ballot,” allowing them to vote only for congressional candidates. Under the proposal, those voters would be barred from participating in presidential, state and local elections.
    


            The “limited federal ballot” provision is likely to become a flashpoint in legal battles should the Texas measure become law. Courts blocked a similar attempt by Arizona last election cycle to exclude people who can't prove their citizenship from casting ballots for president, though the litigation hinged on the federal form not requiring the documents, which Trump now seeks to change in his executive order.
    


            In earlier rounds of lawsuits over Arizona's requirement, the US Supreme Court has mandated that states accept for federal elections a generic voter registration form offered by the US Election Assistance Commission or EAC, which currently does not require documents proving citizenship. Trump's new executive order orders the agency to amend the form, with the goal of making it easier for states to implement the requirement.
    


            However, as the Justice Department tries to fend off the legal challenges to Trump's directives, it's arguing that the commission will have to take multiple additional steps before the form is changed to include the requirement. Among them is getting the approval of three of the four commissioners, according to a declaration from the commission's executive director filed in court. Two of the four EAC commissioners are Democrats who are not expected to support such a move and even if Trump were to fire them, the law creating the EAC stipulates that two of its four members be of the same party of the House and Senate minority leaders – i.e. Democrats.
    


            Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's law school, said Texas' effort to limit who can vote in presidential elections runs counter to federal law. “The EAC gets to change the federal form, not Texas,” he said.
    


            The various efforts under way to require proof of citizenship means “eligible American citizens will be disenfranchised in very large numbers,” Morales-Doyle added. “And that is bad policy.”

            Google is being sued in Britain for potential damages of up to £5 billion ($6.6 billion) in a class action alleging the company abused its dominant market position in online search.
    


            The class action, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal Tuesday, argues that Google's actions enabled it to charge higher prices for the advertisements that appear in search inquiries than it otherwise could in a competitive market.
    


            It said the US company, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), contracted phone makers to pre-install Google Search and the Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.
    


            The claim, filed by competition law expert Or Brook on behalf of thousands of businesses, alleges Google ensured its search engine had better functionality and more features for Google's own advertising offering than that of its competitors.

Google's search dominance is unwinding



            Google said this was “yet another speculative and opportunistic case.”
    


            “We will argue against it vigorously,” a spokesperson said. “Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.”
    


            Brook said businesses had almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services.
    


            “Regulators around the world have described Google as a monopoly and securing a spot on Google's top pages is essential for visibility,” she said in a statement. “Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers.”
    


            Britain's antitrust regulator launched an investigation into Google's search services, including their impact on advertising markets, in January.
    


            The country's Competition and Markets Authority said at the time that millions of people and businesses relied on Google's services, which accounted for 90% of searches and were used by more than 200,000 UK businesses to advertise.

            Two US service members were killed after their vehicle was involved in an accident Tuesday morning near the southern US border, the military said in a statement.
    


            The service members were “deployed in support of Joint Task Force Southern Border,” US Northern Command said in the statement.
    


            A third service member is in serious condition at a local hospital, the military said.
    


            The cause of the accident, which occurred near the border town of Santa Teresa, New Mexico, is under investigation, the task force said in the statement.
    


            The military is withholding the names of the service members until the next of kin is notified.
    


            The Joint Task Force Southern Border – announced last month – was created “to tactically synchronize the Department of Defense efforts to secure and seal the southern border,” according to a press release from USNORTHCOM.
    


            President Donald Trump mandated that the US military step up its presence along the southern border on his first day in office. Thousands of additional troops have been deployed to the border in recent months as part of his efforts to “seal” the border to migrants.
    


            CNN recently reported that Trump sent a memorandum to four federal department heads last week, instructing them to allow the military to use and take jurisdiction of federal land along the US-Mexico border.

            Harvard University is such a perfect foil for Trumpism that it's a wonder it avoided the MAGA maelstrom for so long.
    


            But the nation's oldest university is now going head-to-head with a White House that sees few limits on its power, which it wants to use to shatter elite societal pillars.
    


            Harvard President Alan Garber decided not to bend to administration demands to change its policies, declaring that the university would not “surrender its independence or its constitutional rights.” A university more used to producing presidents than defying them thus set off one of the most important clashes yet between President Donald Trump and an establishment institution.
    


            Those without an Ivy League pedigree often mock the snobbery of the country's most prestigious seats of learning, whose degrees open elite circles off-limits to most Americans.
    


            And when Trump portrays the esteemed academics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as far-left activists pushing “woke” policies on race and gender, he's not working in a vacuum. Millions of Americans agree with him. Polls show rising distrust of higher education institutions, especially among Republicans.
    


            But Trump's assault on the country's top colleges goes beyond an issue that will excite his political base.

The real stakes in Trump's confrontation with Harvard



            Administration heat on top universities is part of a broader effort to challenge centers of what it regards as liberal power, which also include the courts, the federal bureaucracy and the media. After remaking the Republican Party and the Supreme Court, Trump hopes to extend his populist ideology to higher education as a way to challenge belief systems that conflict with his MAGA creed and to shift the country hard to the right.
    


            Trump is not only taking on top academics and what surveys show are their left-leaning faculties. His immigration crackdown has stirred a culture of fear on campuses: Some students have been taken off the streets by border agents, while hundreds more have had their visas canceled on the grounds that their views are damaging to American foreign policy interests.
    


            That sense of repression threatens to stifle the atmosphere of open debate that animates a healthy university. And Trump's threats to halt funding for top schools endangers the country's world-leading scientific and medical research into killer diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's.
    


            Academics are often accused of living in an isolated bubble.
    


            This was driven home in December 2023, when New York Rep. Elise Stefanik skewered the presidents of top universities over campus protests that critics say degenerated into antisemitism following the Hamas attacks on Israel. The academics' nuanced answers might have passed muster in a campus seminar, but they turned into a political catastrophe.
    


            The moral outrage of Stefanik, a Harvard graduate, helped lead to the resignation of the university's president Claudine Gay. The New York lawmaker's performances also made her one of the fastest-rising stars in the MAGA movement and the House GOP leadership.
    


            Stefanik led the charge against Harvard again on Tuesday after the administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funds when the university refused its demands. “If you look at the faculty, the tenured faculty of all these schools, they are so out of touch with American values. Ninety-seven percent of the faculty are self-identified Democrats, progressives. They are propping up these radical, far-left ideas and really teaching anti-Americanism,” Stefanik said on Fox News.
    


            The administration has used the antisemitism charges to fuel both its wider assault on the universities and its mass deportation drive.
    


            It demanded that Harvard commission an outside party to audit multiple programs, schools and departments within the university that it said were tainted by egregious records of antisemitism or other bias.
    


            But its stunning list of demands doesn't end there. It called for an end to all diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including reductions in the power of the faculty; ending any hiring based on race, religion or sex; and new crackdowns on student protests and student groups and clubs, including those that support Palestinian sovereignty – a longtime, if lapsed, US government policy. And the White House demanded investigations into past campus protests and sit-ins that took place in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on Israel.
    


            The wish list represented an unusual attempt by a presidential administration to exert power over an independent university. The showdown, which follows agreement by other universities – including Columbia – to cede to similar pressure, is almost certain to land in the courts.
    


            But Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, told CNN that the university should not comply with a government that is being “extra-lawful.” He added: “Universities are in need of a great deal of reform, and it's come too slowly, but that's not a reason why the government can entirely suspend the law and make up self-serving political demands and impose them on universities.”
    


            Trump may believe he's onto a political winner whatever happens.
    


            When universities cave, fearful of losing billions of dollars in public funding, his power is enhanced – and he can pile on even more pressure. When they defend themselves, they give him a fight he's happy to wage. And when Democrats criticize him, they take the side of what millions of Americans believe are elitist establishment figures who are disliked by much of the country.
    


            Disdain for top universities runs deep in the MAGA movement – perhaps mostly among Ivy Leaguers like Stefanik and Vice President JD Vance, who often appear to be seeking to atone to their base for their own elite educations.
    


            This populist backlash against establishment institutions is at the root of the MAGA movement and “America first” conservativism, along with a belief that liberal faculties are responsible for propagating a belief system that is anti-American.
    


            For instance, at a National Conservatism Conference in 2021, Vance, a Yale Law School graduate, advocated a campaign against “very hostile institutions” and added, “If any of us want to do the things we want to do for our country and the people who live in it – we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country.”
    


            On the campaign trail last year, Trump lambasted universities he claimed were packed with “Marxist maniacs.”And the president's movement has long fostered suspicion of academic intellectualism and a distrust of the highly educated, which was exacerbated by his attack on experts during the Covid-19 pandemic in his first term and which now shows in his unorthodox second-term Cabinet.
    


            This highly politicized approach leaves little doubt that the administration's motives go far beyond eradicating antisemitism from college campuses.
    


            “It's a transparent effort to change what is taught, what we say in our classrooms, what we teach our students, to make sure that the only things that are actually said on university campuses are things that the Trump administration wants to hear and wants to be said,” Andrew Manuel Crespo, a Harvard Law School professor, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Monday.
    


            The administration's heavy-handed immigration enforcement has also fueled a repressive atmosphere on campuses following the detention of several students who took part in campus protests against Israel and some who did not.
    


            The Trump administration last week won a deportation order from a Louisiana immigration judge against Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident. He was accused of undermining US policy to combat antisemitism, but the government cited no allegations of criminal activity. Khalil, who is married to a US citizen, is a prominent Palestinian activist who played a central role in protests against Israel's war in Gaza on campus last year
    


            In another case, Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was detained last month by masked officers near Somerville, Massachusetts. She told a federal judge Monday she was unconstitutionally arrested and subjected to “unsanitary, unsafe and inhumane” conditions in a Louisiana immigration facility. The government has accused her of activities “in support of Hamas” but the Washington Post reported a State Department office failed to find evidence tying her to antisemitism or terrorism.
    


            This week, a Palestinian student at Columbia University went into a Vermont immigration office for his citizenship interview. But the student, Mohsen Mahdawi – who's been in the United States for a decade – was taken away in handcuffs. His attorney told CNN that he was detained “in direct retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of Palestinians and because of his identity as a Palestinian.”
    


            Ranjani Srinivasan, another Columbia University student, fled to Canada after she got an email about her student visa being canceled and federal agents came to her door. She told CNN's Shimon Prokupecz that she'd simply been caught up in a police cordon near an anti-Israel protest as she tried to walk home.
    


            Lawyers and civil rights campaigners warn that these cases, and many others, are symptomatic of an administration that disdains the law and free speech.
    


            Sarah Paoletti, a professor and director of the Transnational Legal Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School, warned of imperiled “due process and other fundamental and constitutional rights.”
    


            Paoletti added: “It's also having the effect of silencing and instilling a tremendous amount of fear. And there's an intentionality behind that. Many within this administration have long been proponents of this notion of ‘make it bad enough that people will self deport, save us the effort and the money.' And you see that through these actions, where the underlying message is, ‘if you don't self deport, these are the consequences.”
    


            The targeting of universities may also stifle the freewheeling essence of American higher education, according to Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.
    


            “People come from all over the world to study at American universities, in part because there are other people from all over the world there … You get to hear from people with extremely different experiences, life experiences and perspectives and political views, religious views. You know, that's what makes American universities great,” Jaffer told CNN's Audie Cornish in an interview for her podcast “The Assignment.”
    


            “But if the non-citizens are intimidated from speaking out or participating in public discourse, that has a cost not just to them, but to the rest of us.”

India has called for sweeping reforms to make the UN Security Council “fit for purpose,” arguing that it should have more members from underrepresented regions. 

Speaking at a meeting of the Intergovernmental Negotiations framework (IGN) – a group of countries working to reform the Security Council (UNSC) – on Tuesday, India's permanent representative to the UN, P. Harish, said the current geopolitical realities point to the need for a review of the global architecture. 

“Reform is essential to make the UN fit for purpose, to enable it to respond meaningfully to the current global challenges… And those who do not endorse real reforms that reflect contemporary realities fall on the wrong side of history, which is detrimental to all of us,” he stated on behalf of the G4 group of nations, which also includes Brazil, Germany and Japan. 

The proposed G4 model for UNSC reform discussed at the 2024 IGN meetings includes expanding Security Council membership from 15 to 25 or 26 – comprising 11 permanent members and 14 or 15 non-permanent members, according to Harish. 

Only expanding the non-permanent category ignores the existing imbalances in the permanent category and does not address the concerns of the developing world, especially Africa, the G4 said. Currently, the Security Council has five permanent members: China, France, Russia, the US, and UK, and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms.

#IndiaAtUNPR @AmbHarishP delivered the statement of G4 ( 🇧🇷 🇩🇪 🇮🇳 🇯🇵 ) at the Intergovernmental Negotiations on Security Council reforms, focused on size and regional representation. @MEAIndia@UN@GermanyUN@JapanMissionUN@Brazil_UN_NYpic.twitter.com/eRm3TfRVIw

Harish argued that there is a need to ensure “equitable geographic representation.” According to the proposal, the new permanent members would include two from Africa, two from the Asia-Pacific region, one from Latin America and the Caribbean, and one from Western Europe.

Harish also spoke against attempts to use religion as a basis for including countries. “Attempts to introduce new parameters, such as religion and faith, as the basis for representation in a reformed council runs completely counter to regional representation, which has been the accepted basis for representation in the UN.”

France, which holds the presidency of the UNSC this month, has expressed support for permanent Indian membership in the Security Council. According to France's deputy permanent representative to the UN, Jay Dharmadhikari, Paris is in favor of allocating two permanent seats to African nations, as well as permanent seats for Brazil, India, Germany, and Japan. Earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres vowed to ensure that Africa has two permanent seats before his tenure ends in 2026.

OpenAI, a San Francisco-based company best known for ChatGPT, has reportedly been working on a new social media app similar to Elon Musk's X. The early prototype features a feed centered on AI-generated images, according to sources familiar with the project cited by The Verge on Sunday.

The experimental platform reportedly includes a social media feed and is being tested internally.

CEO Sam Altman has also been seeking private feedback from individuals outside the company, the outlet reported. It remains unclear whether OpenAI intends to release the project as a separate app or integrate it into ChatGPT, which was the most downloaded app worldwide last month, with 46 million new downloads, according to Appfigures.

OpenAI's potential social media network “would likely increase Altman's already-bitter rivalry with Elon Musk,” The Verge writes. Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI but left the company in 2018. In February, Musk offered $97.4 billion to acquire OpenAI, but Altman rejected the offer, reportedly saying, “no thank you but we will buy twitter [now known as X] for $9.74 billion if you want,” according to The Verge.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, could also be in OpenAI's sights.

The report noted that Meta is planning to launch its own AI assistant app with a social media feed. Following reports that Meta is building a ChatGPT rival, Altman responded on X in February: “ok fine maybe we'll do a social app.” Having a social media platform would reportedly allow OpenAI to collect unique real-time user data to enhance its AI models, similar to how Meta and Musk's xAI currently operate, according to The Verge.

Musk has merged his AI company xAI with X. Grok is a chatbot developed by xAI. It has been integrated with X and pulls content from the platform to inform its responses.

According to a source from another AI lab cited by the Verge, “The Grok integration with X has made everyone jealous,” particularly regarding its role in helping users create viral content.

It is reportedly uncertain whether OpenAI's social media prototype will be released publicly.

Chinese imports to the US could face tariffs as high as 245%, according to a White House fact sheet released on Tuesday. The warning comes amid a growing trade rift between the world's two largest economies.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has cited Beijing's retaliation to previous levies as the reason for the latest potential hike.

“China now faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions,” the fact sheet reads. However, it's not clear from the document when the increase would come into force.

Washington has imposed several major tariff rises on Beijing in the past two months, increasing the duties from an initial 20%.

Beijing's retaliation has included a hike to 125% on all American imports, a suspension of global shipments of rare-earth metals and magnets used in tech and military industries, and an order to Chinese airlines to stop accepting Boeing jets and parts.

The standoff with China comes amid a broader US tariff campaign targeting dozens of countries. According to Trump, the measures are part of an effort to balance the US trade deficit with its trading partners.

Following turmoil on the financial markets, the US administration paused higher tariffs for most countries to allow trade negotiations, except for China.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that Trump was open to making a trade deal with the Asian nation, but that Beijing should make the first move.

China has slammed US tariffs as “a weapon to exert extreme pressure and pursue private interests” and an act of “unilateral economic bullying.” It has also vowed to continue to “take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate interests.”

Heist took place at Love Jewels in downtown Los Angeles on Sunday after thieves bore through levels of concrete

Burglars tunneled through a concrete wall to gain access to a Los Angeles jewelry store, making off with at least $10m worth of watches, pendants, gold chains and other merchandise, police said.

The heist happened around 9.30pm on Sunday at Love Jewels on Broadway in the heart of downtown, according to officer David Cuellar with the LA police department.

Investigators were reviewing security camera footage that shows the suspects entering the store from a large hole they drilled from the property next door, he said.

“They tunneled through multiple levels of concrete into the target location,” Cuellar said on Tuesday.

An unknown number of suspects fled through the same hole and drove off in a late model Chevy truck, he said. The heist was not discovered until store employees arrived for work on Monday morning.

Initial estimates were that about $10m worth of merchandise was stolen, Cuellar said, adding that the number could change. In an interview with local television station KTTV, the owner said the loss was upwards of $20m.

In security video obtained by KTTV, the sound of a drill can be heard from inside the store. Once inside, the burglars apparently cut the cameras' wires.

The TV station showed holes cut in a large safe, overturned jewel cases and an empty bottle of scotch whisky.

Love Jewels's website advertises items like a 14-karat yellow gold rope chain for $1,200, heart-shaped gold earrings for $200 and a gold cross pendant for $550. Videos on the store's social media shows glass cases filled with rings, watches and necklaces.

Phone calls and emails were sent to the store on Tuesday.

Detectives examined the scene for fingerprints and DNA, police said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Governor says import tariffs are ‘wreaking chaos' on the state's families, businesses and economy

California is preparing to ask a court to block Donald Trump's “illegal” tariffs, accusing the president of overstepping his authority and causing “immediate and irreparable harm” to the world's fifth-largest economy.

The lawsuit, to be filed in federal court on Wednesday by California's governor, Gavin Newsom, and attorney general, Rob Bonta, is the most significant challenge yet to Trump's flurry of on-again-off-again tariffs. In the complaint, California officials argue that the US constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to impose tariffs and that the president's invocation of emergency powers to unilaterally escalate a global trade war, which has rattled stock markets and raised fears of recession, is unlawful.

“President Trump's unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses and our economy, driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in a statement. “We're standing up for American families who can't afford to let the chaos continue.”

Relying on a statute known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), Trump has issued a series of declarations imposing, reversing, delaying, restarting and modifying tariffs on the US's trading partners.

The complaint argues that the law does not give the US president the authority to impose tariffs without the consent of Congress. It asks the court to declare Trump's tariff orders “unlawful and void” and to order the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection to stop enforcing them.

“The president's chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, it's illegal,” Bonta said in a statement. “Californians are bracing for fallout from the impact of the president's choices. From farmers in the Central Valley to small businesses in Sacramento and worried families at the kitchen table, this game the president is playing has very real consequences for Californians across our state.”

Trump has said tariffs are necessary to ensure “fair trade”, protect American workers and turn the US into an “industrial powerhouse”.

Earlier this month, on what he called “liberation day”, the president imposed a sweeping 10% tariff on nearly all imported goods and higher tariffs for a host of countries, most of which he later paused for 90 days.

A 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, the US's largest trading partners, remains in effect, while Trump's actions have provoked a trade war with China, its third-largest trading partner, subject to US tariffs of 145%.

California, the US's largest importer and second-largest exporter with an economy larger than most countries, relies heavily on trade with Mexico, Canada and China, the state's top trading partners. The complaint says the economic consequences of Trump's tariffs on the state will be “significant”.

Newsom and Bonta will hold a joint press conference later on Wednesday in the Central Valley, where farmers are bracing for the consequences of Trump's escalating trade war. California is the nation's top agricultural exporter, shipping nuts, tomatoes, wine and rice around the world. California agricultural exports totalled nearly $24bn in 2022.

After the announcement of across-the-board levies, Newsom said his administration would pursue new trade deals with international partners to exempt California from retaliatory tariffs.

Earlier this week, a legal advocacy group filed a similar lawsuit on behalf of US businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the levies, asking the US court of international trade to block Trump's tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Joshua Sullivan was abducted from his church by four gunmen, but is now recovering and in ‘excellent condition'

South African police have rescued an American pastor who was abducted last week while he was conducting a sermon, as kidnappings have soared over the last decade in the country.

Three unidentified suspects were killed during the “high-intensity shootout” on Tuesday in which Joshua Sullivan, a missionary from Tennessee, was rescued, the Hawks, the police unit that deals with serious crime in South Africa, said in a statement.

Kidnappings in the country have more than trebled in the past decade, according to police statistics, with 17,061 recorded in the year to March 2024. South Africa, one of the world's most unequal countries, also has one of the world's highest murder rates, with more than 27,000 that year, 50% higher than a decade earlier.

Sullivan was seized on Thursday night while he was preaching at the Fellowship Baptist church, where he had been a missionary since 2018 in the township of Motherwell outside the city of Gqeberha in Eastern Cape province.

Four gunmen stormed the church, stealing two mobile phones from congregation members before taking Sullivan. A few hours later, his truck was found abandoned.

The kidnappers were eventually tracked to a house in KwaMagxaki, about a 20-minute drive from the church, across the Swartkops River. Suspects inside a vehicle opened fire while attempting to flee, the police said.

The Hawks statement said: “The victim was found inside the same vehicle from which the suspects had launched their attack. Miraculously unharmed, he was immediately assessed by medical personnel and is currently in an excellent condition.”

Sullivan's mother, Tonya Morton Rinker, said in a Facebook post: “My Baby is free! Joshua was rescued earlier today!! He is home with Meagan and the kids … Thank you for your support and prayers.”

An earlier post by Rinker described Sullivan as a “big-hearted gentle giant”. It said the 34-year-old had first travelled to South Africa with his wife, Meagan, for six months in 2015, before returning as “church-planting” missionaries and becoming fluent in Xhosa, the most common language in the Eastern Cape. The couple have four children and have “taken in two Xhosa children”.

A report by the Institute of Security Studies, a local thinktank, found 44% of kidnappings were during vehicle hijackings to extort money quickly. Another 22% were tied to robberies, while only 5% were for ransom. It was not immediately clear what the motive for Sullivan's kidnapping was.

Dispensation means teachers not obliged to inform authorities about children's sexual activity in all instances

Teachers will not have to inform on sexually active teenagers under a new legal duty to report child abuse after a novel “Romeo and Juliet” exemption received cross-party support.

A new crime and policing bill obliges professionals in England, including teachers and healthworkers, to report suspicions of child sexual abuse to the police or local authority in an attempt by the government to prevent cover-ups.

There will be dispensation, however, when it comes to teenagers in consensual sexual relationships, including when it involves a 17-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl, after Harriet Cross, a Conservative whip, indicated that her party backed what she described as “a Romeo and Juliet exemption”.

The age of sexual consent in the UK is 16 and, unlike in other countries such as Australia, there is no exemption allowing sexual activity between under 18s, even when the two minors are in a consensual relationship.

The crime and policing bill introduces the concept of such a close-in-age exemption by asking professionals to use their judgment when it comes to whether they need to report cases involving teenagers found to be sexually active, inciting each other to engage in such activity or engaging in it in front of a child.

In order to be covered by the exemption from the duty to report, teachers and other professionals need to be confident that the individuals are both over the age of 13 and that there are no concerns about any abuse or coercion in the relationship.

The clause received support from the Conservatives at the committee stage of the bill's parliamentary journey towards becoming law.

Speaking before the crime and policing bill committee, Cross, who was elected for the first time to parliament in 2024, told MPs that the exemption “recognises that not all sexual activity involving under-18s is a cause for alarm or state intervention”.

She said: “Sexual activity for under-16s is, as we know, illegal in law but without this clause, a teacher who learns of two 15-year-olds in a consensual relationship would legally be bound to report that as a child sexual offence.

“The clause empowers the teacher to use their professional judgment, but the exemption applies only where the reporter is satisfied that the relationship really is consensual and not appropriate to report given the circumstances.

“The bar for not reporting should be high. As a safeguard, the clause explicitly says to consider the risk of harm. If there is any indication of harm or imbalance, the duty to report remains.

“For example, if a 14-year-old girl is sexually involved with a 17-year-old boy, even if she says she has consented, a teacher or adult might rightly feel uneasy about the power dynamic and the possible impact of grooming. The adult might decide that it is appropriate to report in that case.”

Cross said the exemption was “not about condoning underage sex; it is about proportionality”.

She added: “We do not want to criminalise young people unnecessarily or deter them from seeking healthcare or advice … It mirrors, for instance, the approach in some Australian states where similar laws exist. Those states carve out consensual peer activity from mandatory reporting to avoid inundating child protection with consensual cases.”

Speaking for the government, Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding, said she did not want to deter young people from being open about their relationships and accessing services.

“This avoids situations such as two kissing teenagers having to be reported to the authorities by a teacher who knows them both well,” she added. “That is not something I want to have to deal with: teenagers kissing in halls. I suppose it is better working here [in parliament]. Well done to the teachers of the world. For the record, I do not want to see anyone kissing in the corridors – teenagers or otherwise.”

Under the new law, those who fail to comply with the “duty to report” will be liable for sanctions from their professional regulator or the Disclosure and Barring Service.

It will only be if someone deliberately tries to stop a report of child sexual abuse that criminal sanctions will apply, which could lead to up to seven years in prison.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Order instructs health department to work with Congress on changing law that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices

Donald Trump directed his health department on Tuesday to work with Congress on revamping a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, seeking to introduce a change the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied for.

Drugmakers have been pushing to delay the timeline under which medications become eligible for price negotiations by four years for small molecule drugs, which are primarily pills and account for most medicines.

That would align with the 13-year wait until more complex biotech drugs become eligible for Medicare price negotiations.

The wide-ranging executive order signed by Trump aims to reduce healthcare costs. It comes one day after the Trump administration instituted a national security report into the pharmaceutical industry, a precursor to sector-specific tariffs.

The ability of Medicare for the first time to directly negotiate prices on selected medicines was part of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Medicare covers 66 million Americans, mostly aged 65 and older.

Drugmakers have complained about the terms of Medicare's negotiating powers, saying it would stifle innovation. In particular, the industry has opposed the time frame for negotiation eligibility for most drugs.

When drugs have no competition, the law now allows the government to negotiate prices for complex biologic, or biotech, drugs after 13 years on the market, but after nine years for drugs taken as pills and capsules.

Trump cannot implement the change through executive order because the negotiation process is outlined in legislation, but his order instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr to work with Congress on changing it.

Other proposed changes to the negotiation process would yield more savings than those achieved during the first round under the Biden administration, White House officials told reporters on a call before the signing without providing specifics.

Biden's administration had negotiated a price cut of as much as 79% for the first group of 10 drugs seen as among the most costly to the Medicare program.

The Trump administration will negotiate prices for the second group of 15 medications, which includes Novo Nordisk's blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy as well as Pfizer's cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi.

Trump's order also seeks to align Medicare payments for drugs with those of hospitals, which can be 35% lower, and calls for standardizing patient payment rates across locations so that people are not charged different rates depending on where they receive care, a policy known as site-neutral payments.

Trump directed the Food and Drug Administration to encourage more applications from states for drug importation programs, which were initiated during his first term.

So far only Florida has won FDA authorization to directly import drugs from Canada, even though several more states have applied. It also directs the FDA to streamline approval for less expensive generic and biosimilar versions of branded medicines.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Embassy criticises ‘slandering' of Chinese government and defends Jingye over furnaces dispute

China has accused UK politicians of “arrogance, ignorance and a twisted mindset” as it defended British Steel's owner, Jingye, after a barrage of criticism over the narrowly averted shutdown of its blast furnaces.

Beijing's embassy to the UK accused unspecified British public figures of slandering China's government and businesses, in comments published on Wednesday on its website.

It followed criticism of the actions of Jingye, British Steel's Chinese owner since 2020, by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. Reynolds accused Jingye of not acting in good faith after it threatened to shut down British Steel's furnaces at Scunthorpe within days, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.

The government stepped in on Saturday to avoid the shutdowns with emergency legislation to take control of British Steel.

In its first public comments since the government stepped in, Jingye said on Wednesday that it “request[s] that the UK government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jingye as a foreign investor throughout this process”.

In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Jingye said it would “seek a proper solution that ensures a bright future for British Steel”, and added that it had previously safeguarded jobs and made investments in the plant.

The dispute over the future of the Scunthorpe furnaces has threatened to worsen the UK's already troubled relationship with China, even as the Labour government seeks to boost inward investment.

China's embassy said politicians objecting to the country's involvement in the UK steel sector “took the opportunity to attack all Chinese companies and the Chinese government”, after a warning by the country's foreign ministry earlier on Monday against “politicising” the situation.

In an unusual question-and-answer format, the embassy wrote: “The anti-China rhetoric of some individual British politicians is extremely absurd, reflecting their arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset.”

Jingye was approached by the Conservative government in 2019 to take over British Steel after its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, walked away. British Steel has lost more than £350m since then. Jingye said last month it would close the blast furnaces, and it turned down an offer of £500m in UK government support to switch from the polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces.

Reynolds said the UK had “got it wrong in the past” about allowing Chinese investment in strategically important industries such as steel, and highlighted the influence of the Chinese government on private companies. “I wouldn't personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,” he said on Sunday.

However, the British government has been sending mixed messages on Chinese investment. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, visited China in January to try to drum up investment, and Reynolds is due to visit the country later this year, despite his criticisms.

The embassy credited Jingye with saving workers' jobs in 2020 and said it was “a normal decision” by the company to close the blast furnaces, adding that the dispute could hit Chinese investment in the UK. It contrasted the treatment of China with the alleged lack of criticism of Donald Trump's tariffs. The embassy wrote: “What on earth are they up to?”

“Any words or deeds that politicise or maliciously hype up business issues will undermine the confidence of Chinese business investors in the UK and damage China-UK economic and trade cooperation,” it added.

A UK government spokesperson said: “We will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK's relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.

“We will continue to support UK business to engage with the second largest economy in the world, while being clear-eyed to any risks and ensuring security and resilience.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Signatories from Board of Deputies say in open letter that ‘Israel's soul is being ripped out' and they ‘cannot turn a blind eye' to loss of life

Members of the Board of Deputies, the largest body representing British Jews, have said they can no longer “turn a blind eye or remain silent” over the war in Gaza.

In a significant break with the board's customary support for the Israeli government, the 36 signatories to an open letter published in the FT say “Israel's soul is being ripped out”.

Since the war began after the terrorist atrocities committed by Hamas against Israelis on 7 October 2023, statements by the Board of Deputies of British Jews have been broadly supportive of the Israeli government.

But the letter, signed by about one in eight of the board's members, is highly critical of recent actions by the Israeli government.

It says: “The inclination to avert our eyes is strong, as what is happening is unbearable, but our Jewish values compel us to stand up and to speak out.”

Last month, after a pause in fighting during which dozens of Israelis held hostage in Gaza were released, the Israeli government “chose to break the ceasefire and return to war in Gaza … Since then, no hostages have returned. Hundreds and hundreds more Palestinians have been killed; food, fuel and medical supplies have once again been blocked from entering Gaza; and we are back in a brutal war where the killing of 15 paramedics and their burial in a mass grave is again possible and risks being normal.

“Such incidents are too painful and shocking to take in, but we know in our hearts we cannot turn a blind eye or remain silent at this renewed loss of life and livelihoods, with hopes dwindling for a peaceful reconciliation and the return of the hostages.

“This most extremist of Israeli governments is openly encouraging violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, strangling the Palestinian economy and building more new settlements than ever … Israel's soul is being ripped out and we, members of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, fear for the future of the Israel we love and have such close ties to.”

The letter adds: “Silence is seen as support for policies and actions that run contrary to our Jewish values. Led by the families of the hostages, hundreds of thousands of Israelis are demonstrating on the streets against the return to war by an Israeli government that has not prioritised the return of the hostages. We stand with them. We stand against the war … It is our duty, as Jews, to speak out.”

One of the signatories, Philip Goldenberg, a lawyer, said the Israeli government had “absolutely adopted the Trump playbook”, including demonising those who disagreed with it. “That is not what Israel is about,” he told the BBC's The World at One.

There was a “whole range of views” among British Jews, “and there are those who think we should not have done this”, he said. There were others who shared the views expressed in the letter but “don't want to put their heads above the parapet”.

What was happening in Gaza was “a total breach of Jewish ethical values”, he added. “More damage is being done to the Zionist project by Netanyahu than Hamas could ever achieve.”

A spokesperson for the Board of Deputies said other members would “no doubt put more emphasis on the fundamental responsibility of Hamas for this ghastly situation and the need to ensure that they are prevented from ever repeating the heinous crimes of 7 October”.

Within the diversity of views among British Jews, “however, there is much unity”, the spokesperson added. The UK Jewish community wanted to see Hamas release the remaining hostages, aid flowing in to Gaza and “definitive progress towards lasting peace and security for Israelis, Palestinians and the wider Middle East”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Kilmar Ábrego García was deported, detained and flown to a notorious prison – before officials admitted they had made an error. Why is he still there? Maanvi Singh reports

Kilmar Ábrego García was 16 when he came to the US, after his family were targeted by criminal gangs in his home of El Salvador. He joined his brother in Maryland and started a new life.

In 2019, he was arrested by immigration officials and accused of being a gang member, but his lawyers argued there was no evidence for this, pointed out he had no criminal convictions and insisted he should not be sent back to a country where he was himself at risk from criminal gangs. A judge agreed and gave him protected status so he could not be deported.

For the next few years, Ábrego García's normal life continued. He worked as a metal worker, lived with his wife, two stepchildren and five-year-old son, and started studying again.

Then Donald Trump returned to power, on the promise he would begin deporting criminals en masse. Last month Ábrego García was arrested again, detained and then found himself on a plane to El Salvador.

The Guardian US immigration reporter Maanvi Singh tells Hannah Moore how Ábrego García found himself locked away in an infamous prison created for violent gang members. “Once your family member or loved one is inside,” Maanvi explains, “they're gone for ever.” Ábrego García's wife and family launched legal action in the US – only for immigration officials to admit his deportation had been a clerical error.

The Trump administration says there is nothing it can do to bring him back, while El Salvador's president says he will be kept in prison. Now the supreme court has intervened – but will either side listen?

China Daily, the  Communist party's English-language mouthpiece, says US ‘has been living beyond its means for decades'

The US needs to “stop whining” about being a victim after “taking a free ride on the globalisation train”, China's official state media said, as its government reported a spurt of economic growth ahead of an expected hit from Donald Trump's tariffs.

Last week's tit-for-tat tariff rises appear to have paused, but the conflict between the two biggest economies is showing no signs of letting up, with Beijing also reiterating its warning that it was “not afraid to fight”.

On Tuesday evening, China Daily, the ruling Chinese Communist party's (CCP) English-language mouthpiece, published an editorial saying Donald Trump's frequent claims of the US being “ripped off” were “hoodwinking the US public”.

“The US is not getting ripped off by anybody,” it said. “The problem is the US has been living beyond its means for decades. It consumes more than it produces. It has outsourced its manufacturing and borrowed money in order to have a higher standard of living than it's entitled to based on its productivity. Rather than being ‘cheated', the US has been taking a free ride on the globalisation train.”

It added: “The US should stop whining about itself being a victim in global trade and put an end to its capricious and destructive behaviour.”

The CCP has refused to capitulate to Trump's demands to come to the table and renegotiate their terms of trade. On Wednesday, Beijing announced the replacement of its international trade negotiator. Li Chenggang will take over the role – and that of vice commerce minister – held previously by the veteran trade tsar Wang Shouwen. No reason was given for the change, as a result of which Li will lead any talks with the US to resolve the trade war, but it came amid a reshuffle of roles across China's government.

In a statement delivered by the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, Trump said on Tuesday “the ball is in China's court”.

“China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them,” the statement said. “There's no difference between China and any other country except they are much larger.”

On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry hit back, saying the US started the trade war and Beijing had been clear that it did not want to fight, but also was not afraid to.

“If the US really wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop exerting extreme pressure, stop threatening and blackmailing, and talk to China on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said.

Analysts and officials expect the trade war to have a significant impact on both economies – China was already struggling to rebound since the pandemic with low consumer spending and high youth unemployment.

On Wednesday, Beijing announced better-than-expected economic figures, driven in large part by exporters rushing to move products to the US before the tariffs came into effect.

China's national bureau of statistics said the economy grew 5.4% in the first quarter, above analyst predictions. Sheng Laiyun, a senior official at the statistics bureau, warned, however, that the US tariffs “will put certain pressures on our country's foreign trade and economy”.

China's leader, Xi Jinping, is on a tour of Asian nations, on a trip that, although planned before the tariff war, has served to boost Beijing's public and private efforts to strengthen trading relationships with other countries.

“China would be willing to partner with Malaysia and other Asean countries, following the trend of peace and the development of history, fend off the undercurrent of geopolitics and tribalism, break the unilateralism and protectionism, and create high-level strategic alliance between China and Malaysia that leads to a close community of common destiny,” Xi said in an editorial published ahead of his arrival in Malaysia on Wednesday.

While tariff rises appear to have paused at 145% on Chinese imports to the US and 125% on US imports to China, the two governments are finding other ways to raise the stakes.

China has reportedly ordered its airlines to pause purchases of aircraft-related equipment and parts from American companies, including Boeing. It was also reportedly considering ways to support airlines that lease Boeing jets and are facing higher costs.

About 10 Boeing 737 Max jets are being prepared to join Chinese airlines, and if delivery paperwork and payment on some of them were completed before Chinese “reciprocal” tariffs came into effect the planes may be allowed to enter the country, sources told Bloomberg.

On Wednesday, the Hong Kong postal service announced it would stop accepting US-bound packages. When sending items to the US, people in Hong Kong “should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the US's unreasonable and bullying acts”, Hong Kong Post said in a statement. Other postal items containing documents only, without goods, would not be affected.

Hong Kong is subject to the same tariffs as mainland China, although has not imposed any retaliatory tariffs of its own.

Meanwhile, Trump has announced an inquiry into further tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors – which would affect many of the US's trading partners – and ordered an investigation that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare-earth metals and associated products such as smartphones.

China dominates global supply chains for rare metals and has imposed export controls on several rare earth elements since the trade war with the US erupted.

            Peak season in many US national parks has begun. Families heading outdoors during spring break are arriving by the carload to enjoy hiking, admire wildlife, learn about history and nature and enjoy all that the National Park system offers. When they arrive with their tents, hiking poles and sunscreen, they might also need to pack their patience and come extra-prepared.
    


            The Trump administration's January hiring freeze, February mass firings of 1,000 national park personnel and buy-out and early retirement package offers for National Park Service staffers have caused uncertainty for park workers and visitors alike. Though the hiring freeze was lifted, and a federal judge ruled the workers were unlawfully terminated and ordered they be offered their jobs back, the chaos has caused a ripple effect that means staffing issues continue and may affect park services across the country.
    


            Current and former park rangers are concerned that, in addition to congestion in the parks, uneven staffing could mean rushing through important visitor education related to safety, dangerous waits for emergency support when a visitor is injured and inadequate training in essential functions such as firefighting.
    


            “National parks in the Southwest are already busy,” says Cassidy Jones, senior visitation program manager for the National Parks Conservation Association, a century-old nonprofit formed to watch over the parks. “Seasonal hiring was extremely delayed and, therefore, many seasonal employees aren't even on the job yet. That means you have reduced staff all over these parks that are already busy.”
    


            After the government lifted the prohibition on hiring seasonal employees, US officials authorized hiring a higher number of seasonal employees than last year.
    


            “The thing that I don't think anyone knows yet is how that will play out,” says Dan Wenk, who worked for the National Park Service for decades before retiring in 2018.
    


            “A lot of offers had already been extended and then had to be revoked. Many of those people were very high-quality employees who had been returning year after year and were very good at their jobs,” said Wenk. “The question is, are they going to be available now? Did they take other opportunities when they thought they weren't going to have a job?”
    


            Rick Mossman, president of the board of the Association of National Park Rangers (ANPR), estimates that about a quarter of NPS personnel has been lost to recent buyout and early retirement offers.
    


            In a statement, the National Park Service said it is committed to providing “seamless” access to national park sites.
    


            “NPS is working closely with the Office of Personnel Management to ensure we are prioritizing fiscal responsibility for the American people. As always, NPS will continue to provide critical services and deliver excellent customer service,” the park service said.
    


                    Any reduction in [ranger staff] is going to mean that there are fewer rangers out there to make sure people are staying safe, whether in relation to resources or animals. Pick your peril.”
                


                    Dan Wenk, retired Nation Park Service employee.
                


            Wenk explains the risks that understaffing presents to both people and parks. “Every forest fire, every summer, takes people away from their duty station … but that's going to affect the level of service and protection that you have.”
    


            Some rangers are trained in fire management, working in conjunction with the US Forest Service and local governments to manage and extinguish fires when necessary.
    


            “If you don't have those long-term seasonals who are trained in firefighting, or those probationary employees who chose not to come back, or permanent employees who may have taken one of the buyouts, well, I think this is going to be kind of a hold-your-breath year,” Wenk said.
    


            Wenk began working with the National Park Service in 1973, serving in various roles, including as the deputy director for operations of the National Park Service and superintendent at both Mount Rushmore National Memorial and Yellowstone National Park.
    


            According to Wenk and NPS figures posted on the Yellowstone site, the park has slightly fewer rangers than in 2018 when Wenk retired, yet attendance has increased by over 600,000 people since then.
    


            Rangers protect both the resources and visitors. Even at full staffing, Wenk felt Yellowstone in 2018 was understaffed “to make sure people were staying on boardwalks in thermal areas and keeping the proper distance away from animals. Any reduction in [ranger staff] is going to mean that there are fewer rangers out there to make sure people are staying safe, whether in relation to resources or animals. Pick your peril.”
    


            Mossman has a more dire warning.
    


            “If they try to keep the parks fully opened with little staff this summer, visitors will die due to no or slow response to medical emergencies and incidents,” he said.

            Basic visitor services are also likely to be impacted.
    


            This year, fewer gates might be open, which means longer lines to enter, so visitors should plan to arrive early and be prepared to wait. To speed up those lines, some parks only accept credit cards for entrance fees.
    


            Rangers staffing the gates don't simply take the admission fees and send visitors on their way. They orient visitors to the park and share information about weather conditions, trail closures and park shuttles, among other things.
    


            “With current staffing, we will have days where we will process 300 vehicles in an hour, meaning our average time per group is less than a minute to greet, check or sell passes and orient,” according to one ranger in a high-traffic East Coast park, who requested anonymity out of concern for political targeting. Once inside the park, many visitors' first stop is the visitor center.
    


            “There's fewer folks to staff visitor centers so we see reduced hours at visitor centers and maybe full days that a visitor center is not open,” says Jones, of the National Parks Conservation Association.

            Yet on April 3, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order for parks to “remain open and accessible,” saying officials will ensure proper staffing to do so. How that staffing will be achieved is unclear.
    


            “The secretary did tell the NPS to make sure everything will be open,” said ANPR's Mossman. “This is impossible.” He said that 2024 staffing is lower than it was in 1980, when there were at least 100 fewer NPS sites and about a third of the number of total visitors.
    


            To make sure visitors are well-prepared, Rachel Pawlitz, public affairs chief for the National Park Service, recommends that they “research the park they're looking to visit, understand what passes or reservations are needed, create a backup plan in case things don't go as planned.”
    


            Pawlitz recommends downloading the NPS App to easily access park information and maps while in the park, and checking park websites in advance for the latest information related to changes in services, hours of operation, inclement weather or safety notices.
    


            Long-time seasonal and non-seasonal employees train newer staff, several sources said. Assuming some found other roles after they were fired, and others accepted early retirement, there will not only be shorter training periods, but that training will most likely be provided by those with less experience.
    


            In addition to their duties in education and information, law enforcement and fire management, some rangers work as park scientists.
    


            “I know of archaeologists and wildlife biologists who were fired in the probationary cuts on Valentine's Day,” Jones explains. “These are skilled, very qualified people who are behind the scenes all the time to make sure these park resources stay protected in perpetuity. So, there's a lot of long-standing projects — research, monitoring endangered species and understanding if invasive grasses are making their way into the park — that are just completely on pause.”
    


            During the 2019 government shutdown, parks were ordered to remain open. Without the staff to patrol them, many had issues with overflowing sewage from pit toilets, full trash bins and vandalism. Food waste was found around parks, which encourages wildlife to look to human sources for food.
    


            If a bear enters a campground or approaches humans more than once looking for food, they're known as a second offender, now trained that humans supply the food. In these cases, the bear faces euthanasia.

            Wenk recommends visitors bring a bag or two with them to carry out not only their own trash, but any trash they may see lying around.
    


            “One of the biggest things I worry about, because there's damage every year to resources with the national parks,” explains Wenk, “is not having the resource protection capability. Parks are about perpetuity, and taking care of them into perpetuity. And we just have to make sure that we're doing that to the highest level.”
    


            He explains that long entrance lines or some canceled ranger programs are short-term issues.
    


            “Making sure you protect the park is the long-term issue that every person who works for the Park Service is entrusted [with],” he said.
    


            The NPS manages 433 individual units, which include 63 National Parks and 87 National Monuments among other categories such as seashores, lakeshores, historic sites and more.
    


            This year, Wenk recommends, “Maybe look for those areas that are not the Yosemites, the Glaciers, the Yellowstones, the iconic national parks, but look for some of those lesser-appreciated and used ones. They're great parks. They're parks that tell America's story, whether it's our natural history or our cultural history.
    


            “If this is your one chance to go to that iconic park you've wanted to all your life, be sure you're as well informed before you get to that gate as you can be.”

            Depression is becoming more common among adults and adolescents in the United States, but most are not getting therapy to help, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            More than 1 in 8 people ages 12 and up in the US have been depressed in recent years, according to data published Wednesday by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Depression prevalence has nearly doubled, from 7.3% in 2015-16 to more than 13% in 2021-23.

These are the biggest concerns facing teen boys and girls



            The findings are based on results from a federal survey – most recently conducted between August 2021 and August 2023 – in which participants reported whether they had had certain symptoms associated with depression in the previous two weeks. Responses to these validated screening questions were scored to determine whether the individuals had depression.
    


            The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the administration of the survey, and modifications that were made once it resumed – including changes to the way it was administered – may have affected the ability to most accurately track changes over time.
    


            People are less likely to report conditions that could potentially be considered socially undesirable in face-to-face interviews than they are in phone or online interviews, and changes in that method could account for increases, Dr. Renee Goodwin, a psychiatric epidemiologist and clinical psychologist with Columbia University, told CNN.
    


            Still, experts have long said that the pandemic exacerbated mental health challenges for many in the US – 90% of adults have said that the country is facing a mental health crisis, according to a 2022 survey from CNN in partnership with KFF – but experts have also said that awareness around mental health has grown.
    


            Dr. Matt Mishkind, deputy director of the Johnson Depression Center at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, says that researchers have been trying to figure out why depression rates have been growing for the past decade or so – and at least part of it has to do with decreasing stigma around talking about mental health in some groups.

            “The question then is, has that truly increased, or have we just been able to identify it more? I definitely think it has increased, and I think that's because I think the world is a difficult place right now,” he said. “I think there's been stressor after stressor after stressor for a long time now, and I think that is starting to truly affect people.”
    


            According to the new CDC data, women are more likely than men to have depression, and prevalence tends to decrease with age and greater wealth.
    


            Overall, about 16% of women and 10% of men had depression during the 2021-23 survey period. But more than 1 in 4 adolescent girls between ages 12 and 19 had depression, the data shows, higher than any other demographic group.
    


            Data from the CDC's latest Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed that more than half of high school girls (53%) said they felt persistently sad or hopeless – nearly twice the rate of share of boys (28%) who said the same and 14 percentage points higher than a decade earlier.
    


            “Girls are more verbal and vocal about some of their challenges, traditionally; boys are not as much, although I think that is changing,” Dr. Jill Emanuele, vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute in New York City, told CNN in August. She was not involved in any of the CDC reports.
    


            The vast majority of adults and adolescents with depression in the latest survey – nearly 88% – said that symptoms had created difficulties for them in work, at home or with social activities, and about a third of those said it was “very to extremely difficult.”
    


            But only about 40% of adults and adolescents with depression received counseling or therapy, the new CDC report shows. Women were more likely than men to have received therapy: about 43%, compared with 33%.
    


            Adult women are also more than twice as likely as adult men to take medication for depression, according to another CDC report published Wednesday. In 2023, about 11.4% of US adults took a prescription medication for depression – but that breaks out to more than 15% of women and 7.4% of men.
    


            Despite higher rates of depression in younger age groups, the new CDC reports show that middle-age people were more likely than younger adults to take prescription medication for depression. More than 12% of adults between ages 45 and 74 did so in 2023, compared with less than 11% of adults ages 18 to 44.
    


            US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has specifically targeted a certain class of antidepressant drugs in recent comments. At his Senate confirmation this year, he falsely suggested that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, may be more addictive than heroin.

            And the Trump administration's strategy for the Make America Healthy Again commission – which Kennedy will lead – specifically plans to address an assessment of the “prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors” for children, along with other mental health medications.
    


            But in February, health care data and analytics company Truveta analyzed information from its database of millions of electronic health records to understand whether increased awareness around mental health has led to increases in people seeking medication or concerns around overprescribing or dependency on antidepressant medications.
    


            It found that trends in prescriptions for mental health have remained relatively stable since 2018. Rates ticked up in the early years of the Covid-19 pandemic but have since dropped to levels from 2018 or lower.
    


            Antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed mental health medication – with SSRIs accounting for nearly half – but Truveta found trends in prescribing rates to be much steadier than the CDC found in trends for depression prevalence. And the findings do not suggest that over-rescribing mental health medications should be a concern.
    


            “While increased mental health awareness and the heightened demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to shifts in prescribing rates, our findings suggest that overall trends in mental health prescriptions have remained relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in recent years,” Truveta researchers wrote in a blog post.
    


            “While there was a slight increase in the rate of mental health prescriptions during the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent stabilization and decrease suggests that the rise was likely a temporary response to heightened mental health needs rather than a long-term shift toward higher prescribing rates.”

            Hong Kong's postal service will stop handling packages coming from or going to the United States, in the latest retaliatory move amid an escalating trade war between Washington and Beijing.
    


            In a statement published Wednesday announcing the decision, the government of Hong Kong cited US President Donald Trump's decision last week to eliminate the so-called de minimis exception for items posted from the city to the US. The exemption applied to international shipments worth $800 or less entering the US.
    


            “The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively,” the government said in the statement. “The public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the US's unreasonable and bullying acts.”
    


            The government said the postal service, Hongkong Post, will stop accepting packages transported by sea with immediate effect and stop taking airborne packages starting from April 27. Other postal items containing only documents, for example letters, will not be affected.
    


            The retaliatory move means companies and individuals in Hong Kong will have to pay private couriers such as FedEx and DHL to deliver packages, further driving up costs for consumers on top of US levies.
    


            A DHL spokesman told CNN that it will continue to process shipments to the US, monitor the situation and work with customers to help them keep up with latest changes.
    


            CNN has reached out to FedEx and UPS for comment.
    


            Trump signed an executive order earlier this month raising tariffs on goods worth $800 or less sent from China, including Hong Kong, arguing it was being used by retailers to avoid import taxes and customs inspections.

            Initially, the exemption was set to expire and those goods were set to face tariffs of 30% on May 2. But Trump's latest executive order last week hiked the rates to 120% (or a “per postal item” cost of $100 starting May 2, which goes up to $200 on June 1).
    


            Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese city, has long been known as a free and open international trading port, which charges minimal import levies and no sales tax. It previously had a special trading status with the US, which allowed goods from the city to be subject to lower tariffs and a customs process separate to that for goods from mainland China.
    


            Trump revoked the special trade status in 2020 during his first administration, voicing concerns over the city's deteriorating freedom and autonomy as Beijing cracked down on protests and imposed a sweeping national security law on the financial hub.
    


            As tensions flare between Washington and Beijing, Hong Kong is increasingly caught in the crossfire. Exports from Hong Kong are now subject to the same 145% tariff the Trump administration has slapped on imports from China, even though the city has decided not to follow Beijing's lead in retaliating with a 125% levy on American imports.
    


            Hong Kong's leader John Lee, who was selected for the job by a largely government-appointed, pro-Beijing committee, joined Chinese officials on Tuesday to hit back at Washington with a stern rebuttal.

            “The United States' reckless crackdown on China and Hong Kong has become a frenzy,” he said in a televised address during a national security event.
    


            “They use trade as a weapon to impose a so-called reciprocal tariff of 145% on Hong Kong … This not only shows that the US is full of fallacies but also demonstrates the true face of the US' self-proclaimed hegemony,” he said.
    


            The Hong Kong chief executive said the city intends to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization against the US tariffs. China says it has already filed a complaint with the world trade body, saying the measures violate WTO rules.

Follow:


            In his first major action on health care costs this term, President Donald Trump issued a multi-part executive order on Tuesday aimed at lowering drug prices and reducing costs for Medicare. The move comes as his administration seeks to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports that many experts have said could lead to drug shortages and price hikes.
    


            The wide-ranging mandate is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the high cost of health care in the US. The White House acknowledged it will have to work with Congress to accomplish several of the provisions.
    


            Notably, one of the directives seeks to make changes to a historic Biden-era initiative that allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices for the first time.
    


            The order also calls on Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to explore ways to equalize Medicare payments for drug administrations like cancer treatments, regardless of where patients receive care. Efforts to pass such legislation languished last term.
    


            Some of the provisions resurrect several of Trump's goals from his first administration, including allowing states to more easily import drugs from Canada and requiring federally qualified health centers, which provide primary care services to underserved communities, to pass along discounts they receive on insulin and EpiPens to their patients. (The Biden administration nixed the latter rule, citing the excessive administrative costs and burdens it would have imposed on the centers.)
    


            While lowering drug prices was not a key promise of his most recent presidential campaign, Trump issued multiple executive orders and directives aiming to reduce costs during his first term. However, they largely did not result in making medications more affordable.
    


            One of the mandates seeks to “improve” the Medicare drug price negotiation program, which was created in 2022 by the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act.
    


            The Biden administration, which heralded the provision as one of its major achievements, said that Medicare's new power will lead to an estimated $6 billion in savings for the federal government and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices for the first round of 10 drugs take effect in 2026. Biden officials announced the next round of 15 drugs – including Ozempic and Wegovy, the blockbuster but costly GLP-1 drugs often used for weight loss – just days before they left office in January.
    


            Trump wants to do better than the 22% in savings that the Biden administration achieved in the first round, according to a fact sheet distributed by the White House.
    


            Trump's executive order directs Kennedy to propose and seek guidance on improving the transparency of the program, prioritizing the selection of high-cost medications and minimizing harmful impacts to drug innovation.

            Kennedy is also directed to work with Congress to equalize the time periods when different types of drugs become eligible for negotiation. The imbalance, the Trump administration says, provides incentives for drug companies to invest in large molecule drugs, known as biologics, which aren't subject to negotiation for 13 years after approval by the Food and Drug Administration. By contrast, small molecule drugs, which are generally cheaper and treat more people, become eligible after nine years.
    


            Trump also took aim at an IRA provision that threatened to hike Part D premiums, prompting the Biden administration to provide billions of dollars in subsidies to insurers. The president is directing Kennedy to provide recommendations on how to stabilize and reduce Part D premiums.
    


            The order also directs the FDA to streamline guidance and approvals for biosimilars, or versions of complex biologic medicine, to encourage more doctors to prescribe lower-cost competitors.
    


            Plus, the order instructs the FDA to work with states to make it easier to import drugs from other countries. The Biden administration granted Florida permission to import certain drugs from Canada last year.
    


            Under the order, HHS is instructed to work on a plan for standardizing Medicare payments for prescription medicines, so they cost the same between doctors' offices and hospitals.  The approach, a narrowed version of what policymakers have long called “site neutral” reform, could lower prices by as much as 60%, according to a White House statement.
    


            Lawmakers have long attempted a much broader version of this plan, to equalize Medicare payments for drugs and similar services across hospitals in the US. But several Republicans from largely rural states pushed back last year, saying that lowered federal payments could devastate local hospitals that see fewer patients than others, and therefore rely on high reimbursements.
    


            Two senators who led site-neutral legislation, Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy and New Hampshire Democrat Maggie Hassan, issued a plan last year aimed at resolving that dilemma by reinvesting savings from the program into rural hospitals.
    


            Site-neutral reform could offer some modest savings in Republicans' bid to slash federal spending in next year's budget. But using site-neutral as a cost cutter also means abandoning the plan to channel savings to rural providers.
    


            Trump also instructed regulators to make changes in a federal program that provides drugs at a steep discount to hospitals serving low-income and uninsured patients.
    


            The executive order also signals that larger changes could be afoot for the program. Drugmakers and Republican lawmakers argue that too many hospitals reap heavy discounts on medicines and do not transparently pass those savings on to patients. Hospital groups have said those savings are incorporated into their services for the community.
    


            Trump also instructed Medicare to carry out a survey on these kinds of costs and discounts across various providers, according to a White House official. This is so the agency can “then contemplate rulemaking” on the program, the official told reporters during a press briefing.
    


            The order also seeks to evaluate the role of pharmacy benefit managers, who serve as middlemen between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacies. Known as PBMs, these players have long been criticized for their opaque practices and accused of driving up drug prices.
    


            Trump wants to improve the disclosure of fees that PBMs pay brokers for pushing employers to use them, according to the fact sheet. The order also calls for improving transparency into the direct and indirect compensation that PBMs receive.
    


            Congress was on the verge of passing a slate of measures to increase transparency and change some practices in the PBM industry in December, but it was stripped from the massive bipartisan government funding package that was torpedoed by Trump, who was then president-elect, and billionaire Elon Musk.

            Britain's parliament is only recalled at times of national crisis. But when lawmakers were brought back from their Easter vacation last weekend, the cause was not a war, terror attack or the death of a monarch – but the potential closure of a steel plant in northern England.
    


            The government said the owner of the British Steel complex in Scunthorpe, the Chinese company  Jingye, was prepared to cancel orders for the raw materials needed to keep its blast furnaces burning, a step that would leave Britain unable to make virgin steel for the first time since the Industrial Revolution.
    


            Parliament voted to take emergency control of the plant – and even reportedly used the police to deny Jingye staff entry to the site. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, has said full nationalization of the plant is “likely,” meaning the government could soon have to run a complex and costly manufacturing operation – a task it has long outsourced to private, and often foreign, companies.
    


            Once a steel giant, Britain is now a minnow. It accounts for just 0.3% of global output and imports large quantities of the alloy to meet domestic demand. But the government's hasty decision to take back control of the Scunthorpe plant, owned by Jingye since 2020, offers a snapshot of how countries like Britain are navigating an economically uncertain world: on the one hand, remaining committed to the globalization that US President Donald Trump is challenging; on the other, protecting industries that are judged too strategically important to leave to market forces.
    


            British Steel has changed ownership many times since it was privatized in the 1980s, but Jingye's tenure has been particularly rocky. A glut of Chinese steel in the global market put pressure on the UK steel industry, where overheads, especially energy prices, are far higher than elsewhere. In March, Jingye said the Scunthorpe plant was losing £700,000 (around $926,000) a day, despite huge investment, making it “no longer financially sustainable.”
    


            Negotiations with the British government to keep British Steel afloat eventually failed. In an emergency debate in parliament on Saturday, Reynolds implied the company was prepared to sabotage the plant. “Its intention was to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders” of iron ore and coal needed to keep the two furnaces running, he said, which would “have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steelmaking at British Steel.”
    


            Because firing a cooled furnace back up is difficult and extremely expensive, Reynolds said the government could not “stand idly by while the heat seeps” from the United Kingdom's last blast furnaces.
    


            After the British government took emergency control of the furnaces, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, on Monday said that Beijing hoped that Chinese companies investing in the UK would be treated “in a fair and just manner.”
    


            The British government gave a range of reasons for its intervention, which speak to the contradictory demands it is juggling.
    


            “What we're seeing, I think, is incoherent reactions to events, in a context where the Labour government wants to appear to be more nationalistic,” David Edgerton, professor of modern British history at King's College London, told CNN.
    


            The nationalistic turn has been some years in the making. Inspired by the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, Rachel Reeves, then in opposition and now the UK finance minister, dubbed her economic strategy “securonomics.” To prevent Britain being “buffeted by a world that has become increasingly uncertain,” Reeves proposed in a 2023 speech “rebuilding the industrial foundations” lost over decades of globalization.
    


            But the takeover of British Steel comes in circumstances not of the government's choosing. Labour is due to publish its long-awaited industrial strategy later in the spring, setting out a plan for which industries it would protect, and how. The government will find it “irritating” that the steel crisis struck before it could outline its strategy, Sam Alvis, head of energy security at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told CNN.
    


            If Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to take control of the plant had a hint of nostalgia (he said steel is part of Britain's “pride and heritage”), it also reflects growing geopolitical concerns. As the US winds down its military footprint in Europe, steel – used in infrastructure and weapons – will be a key ingredient in the continent's attempts to rearm itself.
    


            Labour's decision may also have been prompted by shorter-term political concerns. The upstart hard-right Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, has called loudly for the plant to be fully nationalized. With local elections due in May, Labour was wary of the potential fallout over the 2,700 jobs that would have been lost if the plant shuttered.
    


            But critics have pointed out that concerns about job losses did not prompt the government to save Britain's other large steel mill, at Port Talbot in Wales, where the blast furnaces closed last year, costing some 2,800 jobs. The plant is now in the process of transitioning to “greener,” electrically powered steel production.
    


            Taking control of the Scunthorpe plant “will set a precedent – and this is why they've been so reluctant to do this, either in this case or in the Port Talbot case,” Edgerton said. With other privatized industries also in a state of disrepair – from water to electricity to the railways – other sectors could soon come knocking, he said.
    


            With full nationalization of British Steel “likely,” as Reynolds said, some in the country are asking whether Britain is turning its back on the economic orthodoxy that has persisted since Margaret Thatcher privatized key industries in the 1980s.

            Jeremy Corbyn, the ousted far-left former leader of the Labour Party, called during Saturday's debate for the government to bring “the whole steel industry into public ownership,” making it finally “free from market forces.”
    


            But Edgerton cautioned against seeing the decision as “the beginning of a new sort of policy.”
    


            “I don't think economic internationalism is being undermined in this case… because there aren't going to be any controls on (steel) imports. It'll just be a question of subsidizing production” at a single plant, he said.
    


            The decision also raises questions about Britain's muddled China strategy. Former Prime Minister David Cameron heralded a “golden era” of British-Chinese relations and famously took President Xi Jinping for a pint in a 16th-century pub during a 2015 visit.
    


            But later, under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, relations soured. Despite allowing the sale of British Steel to Jingye months earlier, Johnson's government in 2020 banned the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from Britain's 5G network, citing security concerns.
    


            In power since last summer, Starmer is once more attempting to court China, although without Cameron's enthusiasm. Having campaigned on a promise to restore economic growth, finance minister Reeves visited Beijing in January in a fresh push for Chinese investment. But the controversy over Jingye and British Steel risks putting Labour's overtures on ice.
    


            In his comments Monday, Lin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, warned Britain to “refrain from turning economic and trade cooperation into political and security issues, lest it should undermine the confidence of Chinese companies in their normal investment and operation in the UK.”

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — China appointed a new trade negotiator Wednesday in the midst of its tariff fight with the United States as the world's two largest economies steadily increase tariffs on each other's goods.

China's government said Li Chenggang replaces Wang Shouwen, who participated in negotiations for the countries' 2020 trade deal.

China faces 145% taxes on exports to the U.S., while the Trump administration gave dozens of other countries a 90-day reprieve for most duties. Beijing has hit back at the U.S. with 125% tariffs on American exports, while stressing its determination to keep its own markets open to trade and investment.

Earlier on Wednesday, China announced its economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, supported by strong exports. Analysts are forecasting that the world's second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs on U.S. imports from China take effect.

Exports were a strong factor in China's 5% annual growth rate in 2024. The official target for this year is also about 5%.

In the near term, the tariffs will put pressure on China's economy, but they won't derail long-run growth, Sheng Laiyun, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters earlier. 

It wasn't clear why China was changing trade negotiators.

The decision comes as Chinese officials say the country has multiple options to respond to U.S. actions, including relying more on its own vast market of 1.4 billion consumers and on Europe and countries in the global south.




But as China's domestic consumption continues to languish, it will be difficult to replace the U.S. consumer. 

China has also responded to the U.S. by imposing more export controls on rare earths, which include materials used in high-tech products, aerospace manufacturing and the defense sector.

Both sides are now running out of tariff options, leaving them in a “near-stalemate,” said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Beijing's Tsinghua University.

China will likely retain its focus on strengthening economic resilience against external shocks, including deepening trade ties with neighboring countries and promoting domestic consumption by shifting away from exports, Sun said.

A U.S. concession on fentanyl or ownership of TikTok could prompt a reciprocal move from Beijing, he added.

However, communication remains “far from being smooth,” Sun said, pointing out that Trump only recently appointed Jamieson Greer as top trade negotiator, and many other key positions remain empty.

Prior to his appointment as trade negotiator, Li spent about 4 1/2 years as China's ambassador to the World Trade Organization, the body that governs global commerce. Beijing has appealed to it in its tariff dispute with the U.S.

Li was also deputy permanent representative to the Chinese delegation to the U.N. office in Geneva and other international organizations in Switzerland.

Perhaps more so than his predecessor Wang, Li's experience at the Commerce Ministry and his participation in negotiating China's accession to the WTO more than 20 years ago stand him in good stead as China refuses to cave in to U.S. demands, said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics.

Still, higher-ranking leaders from President Xi Jinping on down are likely to chart the course, with Li representing their case in any talks with the U.S., Tu said. 

“There might be another style of negotiations. Li Chenggang is an open-minded person and supports free trade,” Tu added.

Asked about the possibility of talks with the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said the U.S. had begun the tariff spat and China was only taking “necessary countermeasures” to defend its rights and interests.

“If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, it should stop using maximum pressure and stop threats and blackmail. For any dialogue to happen, it must be based on equality, respect and mutual benefit,” Lin told a daily briefing.

Xi has been making the case for China as a source of “stability and certainty” in global free trade as he tours Southeast Asia this week — implying that China is a more reliable trade partner than the U.S. 

After visiting Vietnam, he arrived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital, later Tuesday, for a three-day visit and will end with a stop in Cambodia. In Malaysia, Xi is expected to discuss a free trade agreement between China and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nation, one of several funds and agreements China has led as a means of sidestepping organizations and mechanisms dominated by the U.S. and the West.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's post office will stop shipping small parcels to the United States after Washington announced plans to charge tariffs on small-value parcels from the southern Chinese city, the government said Wednesday. 

The U.S. government earlier announced that it would end a customs exception allowing small-value parcels from Hong Kong to enter the U.S. without tax, slapping a 120% tariff on them starting from May 2. The “de minimis” exemption currently allows shipments that are worth less than $800 to go tax-free. 

A government statement said Hongkong Post would not collect tariffs on behalf of Washington, and will suspend accepting non-airmail parcels containing goods destined for the U.S. on Wednesday, since items shipped by sea take more time. It will accept airmail parcels until Apr. 27. 

“For sending items to the US, the public in Hong Kong should be prepared to pay exorbitant and unreasonable fees due to the U.S.'s unreasonable and bullying acts,” the government wrote. 

It will continue accepting mail that contains only documents. 

Hong Kong, is caught in the middle of the trade disputes between the U.S. and China despite being a free port. 

The former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has trade and customs policies different from mainland China's, under the semi-autonomy granted by Beijing during the handover. But Washington began treating it as part of China after Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020, and has applied the 145% tariffs imposed on Chinese imports.

The national security law, which China says has brought back stability to the city, has virtually silenced all dissent.

CHICAGO (AP) — Former President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday that President Donald Trump has “taken a hatchet” to Social Security, weighing in on a critical issue for millions of Americans as the 82-year-old Democrat briefly returned to the national stage.

Biden, who has largely avoided speaking publicly since leaving the White House in January, gave an evening speech at the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled in Chicago. The former president was speaking as Democrats across the nation offered similar warnings for what they described as a Social Security Day of Action. 

“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking,” Biden charged during a speech that spanned just under a half-hour. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration.”

It was no coincidence that Tuesday's appearance, which marked Biden's first major event since leaving office, was focused on Social Security. Democrats have increasingly focused on Trump's turbulent leadership over the popular government agency that provides benefits to more than 70 million Americans. 

Both parties expect Social Security to emerge as a key issue in next year's midterm elections. 

Speaking before a crowd of roughly 200 people, Biden largely stuck to his prepared remarks but also rambled at times as he told stories about growing up with working-class people. 




He referred to the Republican president only as “this guy.” Trump, by contrast, continues to blame Biden for many of the nation's problems and often attacks his predecessor by name.

Conservatives immediately seized upon a Biden reference to the country's political divisions as an attack on Trump supporters.

“We can't go on like this as a divided nation, as divided as we are,” Biden said. “As I said, I've been doing this a long time. It's never been this divided. Granted, it's roughly 30%, but it's a 30% that has no heart.”

A Biden spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for clarification about whom Biden was referencing. 

Earlier in the day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took a shot at the former president's age and fitness when asked about Biden's appearance.

“I'm shocked that he is speaking at nighttime,” Leavitt said during Tuesday's White House press briefing. “I thought his bedtime was much earlier than his speech tonight.” 

She said that Trump, who is 78 years old, would sign a presidential memorandum Tuesday afternoon “aimed at stopping illegal aliens, and other ineligible people, from obtaining” Social Security benefits. The memorandum will expand the Social Security Administration's fraud prosecutor program to at least 50 U.S. attorney offices, and establish Medicare and Medicaid fraud prosecution programs in 15 U.S. attorney offices, Leavitt said. 

The Social Security Administration pushed back against Biden's remarks using its official X account.

“Former President Joe Biden is lying to Americans,” the agency wrote.

The Republican president almost immediately began slashing the government workforce upon his return to the White House, including thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration.

Along with a planned layoff of 7,000 workers and contentious plans to impose tighter identity-proofing measures for recipients, the SSA has been sued over a decision to allow Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to access individuals' Social Security numbers and other personally identifiable information.

Musk, the world's richest man and one of Trump's most influential advisers, has called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.” 

At the same time, Social Security recipients have complained about long call wait times as the agency's “my Social Security” benefits portal has seen an increase in outages. Individuals who receive Supplemental Security Income, including disabled seniors and low-income adults and children, also reported receiving a notice that said they were “not receiving benefits.” 

The agency said the notice was a mistake. And the White House has vowed that it would not cut Social Security benefits, saying any changes are intended to reduce waste and fraud. 

“They're shooting first and aiming later,” Biden alleged. “They want to wreck it so they can rob it. Why do they want to rob it? In order to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.”

Among the conference attendees was Michigan-based attorney Jason Turkish, who leads one of the country's largest disability law firms. He said Trump's presidency has caused anxiety for many of his 32,000 clients nationwide, who are worried about diminished benefits and uncertainty over agency changes.

“We go from Republican to Democrat, Democrat to Republican and there's always been a belief that Social Security is just something we do not touch,” he said.

Still, he said there are signs that Social Security Administration officials are open to change. He cited how the agency partly backtracked on plans to require beneficiaries to go to a field office to verify their identity. Turkish is also optimistic about agency modernization efforts.

Biden is not expected to make frequent public appearances as he transitions into his post-presidential career. He still maintains an office in Washington, but has returned to Delaware as his regular home base. Trump has revoked his security clearances. 

“This is an all hands on deck moment, which is why President Biden's voice in this moment is so important,” Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a call with reporters ahead of Biden's address. 

While Biden may be in a position to help his party with fundraising and messaging moving forward, he left the White House with weak approval ratings. 

Biden also faces blame from some progressives who argue he shouldn't have sought a second term. Biden ended his reelection bid after his disastrous debate performance against Trump and made way for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to Trump in the fall. 

Just 39% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden in January, according to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Trump's inauguration. 

Views of the Democratic former president were essentially unchanged from a Gallup poll taken shortly after the November election. They broadly track with the steadily low favorability ratings that Biden experienced throughout the second half of his presidential term.

Indeed, while some Democratic leaders welcomed Biden's return this week, others were not pleased to see him.

“The best role that Biden could play going forward would be to stay off the public stage,” said progressive activist Norman Solomon. “That might sound harsh, but frankly, his self-centered mentality has already done so much damage to the Democratic Party and the country that he certainly owes us some belated humility.”

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts break down the latest legal clashes over President Donald Trump's deportations of illegal immigrants.

A federal judge said Wednesday that he has found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in contempt for failing to return two planes deporting migrants to El Salvador last month, a major update that comes as tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary have reached a fever pitch.

In the 48-page opinion, Judge Boasberg said the court had ultimately determined that the Trump administration's actions on the March 15 deportation flights, which took place after he issued a bench ruling ordering their immediate return to U.S. soil, demonstrate a ""willful disregard"" for the court that is sufficient for the government to be found in criminal contempt.""

Should they fail to answer his questions by April 23, he said, he will refer the matter for potential prosecution.

That would involve identifying the individuals responsible for what he described as ""contumacious conduct,"" and by ""determining whose ‘specific act or omission' caused the noncompliance,"" Boasberg said. 

The Justice Department could then request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government and, should they decline to prosecute the matter, could ""appoint another attorney to prosecute the contempt.""

""The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions,"" the judge continued. ""None of their responses has been satisfactory…""

""As this Opinion will detail, the Court ultimately determines that the Government's actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,"" Boasberg said Wednesday.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday reiterated that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant who resided in Maryland and was removed to El Salvador, will remain in that country unless President Nayib Bukele sends him back.

Attorney General Pam Bondi doubled down on the Trump administration's claim that it's ""up to El Salvador"" whether Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, an illegal immigrant in Maryland who was wrongfully deported last month, can return to the U.S.

Speaking to reporters at a press briefing on Wednesday, Bondi reiterated her earlier claim that it is up to El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele whether his country opts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., even though officials acknowledged in court his deportation was an administrative error. 

""He is not coming back to our country,"" Bondi told Fox News on Wednesday, in response to a question about his legal status during the briefing.

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian national who had been living in Maryland before he was deported in March. Now, he is believed to be held in his home country's sprawling, maximum-security prison. Both a federal court and the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to ""facilitate"" his release and return to the U.S. for proper deportation proceedings.

Bondi made clear Wednesday that they continue to see the issue as squarely in the purview of Bukele.

""President Bukele said he was not sending him back. That's the end of the story,"" she said. ""If he wanted to send him back, we would give him a plane ride back. There was no situation, ever, where he was going to stay in this country. None.""

Her remarks come after the Supreme Court last week upheld a lower court's order that requires the government to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ""ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""

On Tuesday, a federal judge in Maryland ordered Trump lawyers and plaintiffs to conduct an ""intense,"" expedited two-week discovery process into efforts made to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return – including ordering top DHS and State Department officials to be deposed, under oath, in efforts to secure his return as the court weighs whether the Trump administration has been acting in good faith.

""Cancel vacations, cancel other appointments,"" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis told both parties Tuesday, clearing the way for what she said would be an extremely fast-paced timeframe.  

""There will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding,"" she said of the process. 

Bondi also emphasized that Abrego Garcia is not a U.S. citizen and had been living ""illegally in our country from El Salvador.""

That is not in dispute. A U.S. court granted Abrego Garcia temporary protected status in 2019, finding he faced a ""clear probability of future persecution"" if returned, and that ""El Salvadoran authorities were and would be unable or unwilling to protect him.""

Neither the Supreme Court ruling nor the lower court orders require Abrego Garcia to remain in the U.S. Rather, the courts have stressed that individuals slated for deportation must be granted certain due process protections under the U.S. Constitution, including habeas protections that allow them to challenge their removal in court.

It was not the first time this week that Trump officials have suggested that El Salvador should have the final say on Abrego Garcia's status.

They also made this claim on Monday, when President Donald Trump hosted Bukele at the White House for a bilateral summit.

When asked by reporters about Abrego Garcia, Bondi and other Cabinet officials said the matter was up to Bukele's administration.

""That's up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us,"" Bondi said then. ""The Supreme Court ruled precedent that if El Salvador wanted to return him,"" she continued. ""This is international matters, foreign affairs.""

Bondi added that ""if they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it – meaning to provide a plane."" 

El Salvador has received hundreds of migrants from the U.S., including more than 200 Venezuelan nationals abruptly removed in March under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, and alleged members of the Salvadorian gang MS-13, under a $6 million deal struck with the U.S. earlier this year.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller doubled down on Bondi's assertion, noting that Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian national. 

""It's very arrogant, even for American media, to suggest that we would even tell El Salvador how to handle their own citizens as a starting point,"" Miller told reporters, claiming that ""two courts"" had found Abrego Garcia to be a member of the MS-13 gang.

Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.

Healthcare data breaches are common for two main reasons. Healthcare organizations are easy targets due to poor cybersecurity practices, and the data they store is extremely valuable. Bad actors can often demand and receive whatever ransom they want for the stolen information. 

In 2025 alone, there have already been half a dozen data breaches affecting healthcare institutions. 

The latest addition to this list involves a U.S.-based lab testing provider. Laboratory Services Cooperative (LSC) has released a statement confirming it suffered a data breach in which hackers stole sensitive information belonging to approximately 1.6 million individuals from its systems.

In October 2024, LSC, a nonprofit providing lab testing services to reproductive health clinics like Planned Parenthood across 31 U.S. states, was hit with a significant data breach. On Oct. 27, a threat actor gained unauthorized access to LSC's network, stealing sensitive personal and medical information belonging to approximately 1.6 million individuals, including patients and workers. 

The breach was discovered the same day, but LSC notified affected individuals starting April 10, 2025, after completing a data review by February 2025, according to a notice shared by the nonprofit. 

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

The stolen data varies by individual but may include a wide range of sensitive information. This includes personal details such as names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, Social Security numbers, driver's license or state ID numbers, passport numbers and dates of birth. 

Medical information may also have been compromised, including dates of service, diagnoses, treatments, lab results, medical records, patient numbers, provider names and treatment facility details. Plus, financial information such as billing details, bank account numbers, routing numbers, payment card details and claim numbers may have been exposed. The breach could also involve insurance-related data, including health insurance plan types, insurer details and member or group ID numbers.

200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH

The LSC data breach affected individuals across multiple states, including more than 1,800 Mainers, and involved select Planned Parenthood centers in regions like Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Washington and possibly Texas, Massachusetts and California. The breach raises significant risks of identity theft, financial fraud and misuse of medical information, such as opening fraudulent accounts or accessing healthcare services under stolen identities.

LSC is offering free credit monitoring and medical identity protection services for 12 or 24 months, depending on state requirements, with an enrollment deadline of July 14, 2025. A separate service is available for affected minors.

The nonprofit said on its website, ""The security of information maintained by LSC remains a top priority. Following this incident, LSC implemented several measures to further enhance the security of its environment. These measures include conducting a new and updated risk analysis to stay vigilant against ongoing threats, performing additional vulnerability testing and penetration testing, and providing additional security training for employees.""

LSC has established a dedicated toll-free call center for individuals to call with additional questions or concerns relating to this incident. The call center can be reached at 1-855-549-2662, available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET.

MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT

If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are 11 steps you can take right now to stay safe from the LSC data breach.

1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service: The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection: Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they'll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.

5. Keep tabs on your medical records: The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately. 

6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn't mean it's trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.

7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under ""security"" or ""login options"" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they'll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.

8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.

9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.

10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.

11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don't recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.

By following these steps, you'll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach. 

HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET

The LSC breach isn't just another headline. It's a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks. If your information may have been affected, act now. Review your records, freeze your credit and be vigilant.

If hospitals and labs can't protect patient data, should they be allowed to collect so much of it? Let us know by writing us at Cyberguy.com/Contact.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram covers how Republicans are using Tax Day to muster support for President Donald Trump's tax cuts on 'Special Report.'

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is urging his Republican colleagues to double down on tax cuts for the working-class Americans who make up President Donald Trump's base.

Hawley told Fox News Digital in an interview that tax cuts are ""what Republicans are good at,"" calling specifically for changes to the payroll tax. He says Americans should be able to apply income tax credits like the child tax credit, the mortgage deduction and charitable deduction, to their payroll taxes.

Hawley, who first made the push in a Tuesday op-ed for the Washington Post, says he has spoken with Trump about the potential tax breaks and the president is ""very supportive.""

""These are the people who put Trump in the White House,"" Hawley told Fox, referring to Americans who earn less than $80,000 per year.

Debate over tax policy is raging in Washington as Republicans weigh what to put in Trump's ""big, beautiful"" budget bill. Many Republicans support re-upping the 2017 tax cuts, but there are calls for more changes.

Some Republicans, including the White House, have even flirted with raising taxes on the uppermost brackets in order to offset costs.

""We've got this incredible national debt, and so at some point you've got to address the elephant in the room,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told the New York Times on Tuesday. ""Can't tell you if it's going to happen or not.""

Hawley has also said he would support raising some taxes to offset cuts in lower tax brackets if the president makes a push for it.

He proposed to Fox that one path toward raising more revenue would be to start taxing the endowments of America's largest universities.

Regardless of offsets, however, Hawley says the top priority should be securing tax breaks for the people who voted Trump into office.

Hawley emphasized this focus in his op-ed for the Post, quoting Reagan-era columnist Robert Novak.

""God put the Republican Party on Earth to cut taxes.""

Attorney General Pam Bondi discusses the Justice Department's lawsuit against Maine over women's sports, the battle over the deportation of a migrant with alleged MS-13 gang ties and new allegations against NY AG Letitia James.

The U.S. Justice Department announced a lawsuit against the state of Maine for its continued defiance of President Donald Trump's executive order to keep biological males out of girls' and women's sports and violations of Title IX.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit at a press conference on Wednesday morning. It is the latest chapter in the battle between the state and the Trump administration after a federal judge paused a funding freeze that was initiated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Bondi was joined at the press conference by Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon, conservative activist Riley Gaines, Maine GOP state representative Laurel Libby, Maine high school girl Cassidy and fencer Stephanie Turner, who recently drew viral attention to the issue of trans inclusion in women's fencing with a clip of her kneeling in protest of a trans opponent.

""The Department of Justice will not sit by when women are discriminated against in sports,"" Bondi said at the press conference. ""… What they have been through is horrific.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Maine Gov. Janet Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey's offices for comment.

""We want to get states to comply with us,"" Bondi added.

Bondi said they were seeking an injunction and have titles returned to the girls who ""rightfully"" won competitions in which trans athletes participated in.

The Justice Department accused the state of ""is openly and defiantly flouting federal anti-discrimination law by enforcing policies that require girls to compete against boys in athletic competitions designated exclusively for girls,"" according to a complaint obtained by Fox News.

""By prioritizing gender identity over biological reality, Maine's policies deprive girl athletes of fair competition, deny them equal athletic opportunities, and expose them to heightened risks of physical injury and psychological harm,"" the complaint added.

(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo)

The differences between males and females is why ""Title IX and its implementing regulations … permit and encourage sex-separated sports to ensure girls have an equal opportunity to participate, excel, and reap the educational benefits of athletics. Yet, Maine's policies flout this core Title IX principle by allowing boys to compete in girls' sports without regard for these biological realities,"" the complained read.

The complaint said the U.S. will seek ""judgment granting declaratory injunctive, and damages relief for Defendant's violations of Title IX and the federal funding contracts it signed promising to comply with Title IX and its implementing regulations.""

McMahon's department recently concluded its investigation into the state over its refused compliance and referred the issue to the DOJ on Friday.  

""Unfortunately, our investigation has found that Maine continues to willfully violate Title IX and continues to strip the civil rights of female athletes in the state,"" McMahon said. ""It's not just about their civil rights, it's about their safety. And after our investigation, we found we really had no other choice. We thought the infractions warranted turning them over to the Justice Department."" 

Turner spoke about the Justice Department's lawsuit against the state to Fox News Digital.

""It's sad that this has to be a political issue, and I think this was a missed opportunity by the Democrats to garner support among the vast majority of the United States."" Turner said ahead of the press conference. 

""I'm so grateful that we have an administration that is taking this issue seriously.""

STEPHANIE TURNER STEPS AWAY FROM USA FENCING CAREER AS SHE'S PUT ON PROBATION AFTER PROTESTING TRANS ATHLETE

The announcement of the lawsuit comes nearly two months after an infamous hostile exchange between Trump and Mills at a White House bi-partisan meeting of governors on Feb. 21. The exchange ended with both Trump and Mills uttering the phrase ""see you in court"" after Mills insisted her state would refuse to comply with his order.

Now, Trump's administration has made good on his vow to take the issue to court.

The administration has hammered the state with federal pressure to comply with the issue over the last seven weeks, launching multiple investigations into its educational institutions and even cutting funding from the USDA. 

In response, the state has launched its own lawsuit against the administration over the recent USDA cuts and a federal judge has also ordered that the funding can not be frozen. 

Republican opposition within the state has fought aggressively against Mills, the Democrat majority in the legislature and educational bodies that have firmly stood in support of trans inclusion. Libby has been a central figure in this opposition, having drawn attention to the issue initially with a social media post identifying a trans athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition in February. 

Now, Libby is gratified to see the DOJ intervene and take legal action against the state. 

""Despite repeated warnings from President Trump, Governor Janet Mills and Maine Democrats have continued to discriminate against Maine women and girls, prioritizing their woke ideology over biological reality. As a result, the Department of Justice has no choice but to take action against the erasure of women and girls in sports,"" Libby told Fox News Digital.

""Maine Democrats have doubled down on their far-left agenda and now our students and families stand poised to lose hundreds of millions in federal funding. Their radical gender ideology is endangering the continued existence of women's sports and penalizing Maine students, against the will of Maine citizens.""

Libby is joined by her Republican colleagues in opposing the Democrat authority in the state that defies Trump, alongside several passionate civilians who have spoken out on the issue in recent months.

A school district in Maine is moving to comply with Trump instead of the state over the issue. The MSAD #70 School Board voted unanimously on Monday night to comply with Title IX, and Superintendent Tyler Putnam told Fox News Digital that he will amend the district's policies to prevent trans athletes from competing in girls' sports. 

USA FENCING TRANSGENDER CONTROVERSY GETS DOGE HEARING AFTER STEPHANIE TURNER IS PUNISHED FOR PROTEST KNEEL

A Maine parent named Nick Blanchard recently garnered national attention after he was cut off at a school board meeting in Maine's capital city of Augusta while he discussed the controversial issue and a petition he launched to have a school administrator removed from her position for supporting trans inclusion. 

Carlisle spoke at a rally in Augusta opposing Mills on the issue and made a trip to the White House to discuss the issue in her state on Feb. 27. Carlisle was driven to take action on the issue after losing to a trans athlete in cross-country and Nordic skiing competitions. Before that, she had to share a locker room with a trans athlete six years ago during a middle school gym class. 

As the conflict in Maine has become a national issue, the conservative opposition has also garnered support from prominent national activists. 

Nicole Neily, Defending Education founder and president, celebrated the ruling in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

""The Department of Justice's lawsuit shows that this administration is serious about prioritizing student safety – which is a welcome change for parents across the country. Maine has made a conscious decision to violate the original intent of Title IX by allowing male participation in female sports, and that action has consequences,"" Neily said. 

American Parents Coalition Executive Director Alleigh Marré told Fox News Digital she believes the Trump administration is sending a strong message with this lawsuit.

""This action by the Administration sends a clear message to parents who have been fighting for their daughters' private spaces to be protected and for fair athletic competition. Our daughters' rights and privacy should not be subject to ideological whims. The next generation of girls deserve a world where they are protected and respected,"" Marré said.

It's like giving patients back their actual voices.

Researchers in California have achieved a significant breakthrough with an AI-powered system that restores natural speech to paralyzed individuals in real time, using their own voices, specifically demonstrated in a clinical trial participant who is severely paralyzed and cannot speak. 

This innovative technology, developed by teams at UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, combines brain-computer interfaces (BCI) with advanced artificial intelligence to decode neural activity into audible speech. 

Compared to other recent attempts to create speech from brain signals, this new system is a major advancement.

AI-powered system (Kaylo Littlejohn, Cheol Jun Cho, et al. Nature Neuroscience 2025)

The system uses devices such as high-density electrode arrays that record neural activity directly from the brain's surface. It also works with microelectrodes that penetrate the brain's surface and non-invasive surface electromyography sensors placed on the face to measure muscle activity. These devices tap into the brain to measure neural activity, which the AI then learns to transform into the sounds of the patient's voice. 

The neuroprosthesis samples neural data from the brain's motor cortex, the area controlling speech production, and AI decodes that data into speech. According to study co-lead author Cheol Jun Cho, the neuroprosthesis intercepts signals where the thought is translated into articulation and, in the middle of that, motor control.

One of the key challenges was mapping neural data to speech output when the patient had no residual vocalization. The researchers overcame this by using a pre-trained text-to-speech model and the patient's pre-injury voice to fill in the missing details.

HOW ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS

This technology has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for people with paralysis and conditions like ALS. It allows them to communicate their needs, express complex thoughts and connect with loved ones more naturally.

""It is exciting that the latest AI advances are greatly accelerating BCIs for practical real-world use in the near future,"" UCSF neurosurgeon Edward Chang said.

The next steps include speeding up the AI's processing, making the output voice more expressive and exploring ways to incorporate tone, pitch and loudness variations into the synthesized speech. Researchers also aim to decode paralinguistic features from brain activity to reflect changes in tone, pitch and loudness.

What's truly amazing about this AI is that it doesn't just translate brain signals into any kind of speech. It's aiming for natural speech, using the patient's own voice. It's like giving them their voice back, which is a game changer. It gives new hope for effective communication and renewed connections for many individuals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Nvidia stock slides premarket after warning of $5.5 billion hit from Trump's China chip restrictions","https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-h20-export-license-trump-administration-sec-filing-2025-4","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:19:00 GMT","

Nvidia stock fell in premarket trading and the Nasdaq was set to open lower on Wednesday after the chip giant warned of a multibillion-dollar hit from Trump Administration restrictions on exporting H20 chips to China.

The government informed Nvidia that special licenses would be needed to sell to Chinese customers for the ""indefinite future,"" the chip giant said in an SEC filing on Tuesday night.

Nvidia said it would take a charge of up to $5.5 billion in its first-quarter earnings, which ends on April 27.

The stock was down 5.8% at 7:00 a.m. ET, and the Nasdaq futures were 1.3% lower. Shares in Jensen Huang's company had fallen almost 19% this year at Tuesday's close.

Nvidia's H20 chips were specifically made to comply with Biden-era export controls on chips sent to China as the world's superpowers remain in an AI arms race.

The Trump administration sees the license requirements as a means to address the risk of China developing its own supercomputer, Nvidia said in the filing. 

Jefferies analysts said the licensing measure was essentially a ban on H20 chips.

""It should be noted that no licenses for GPU shipments into China have ever been granted and that the stated reason is concern over potential use or diversion of these chips for supercomputers in China,"" analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote in a Tuesday note.

Bernstein analysts said banning the H20 chip made ""little sense.""

""H20 performance is low, well below already-available Chinese alternatives. A ban essentially simply hands the Chinese AI market over to Huawei,"" they wrote in a Wednesday note.

Nvidia declined to comment and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Nvidia said in the filing the charges could relate to H20 chips that have already been manufactured and now may be more difficult to sell. It would also account for costs related to producing the chip and additional funds that may be needed to cover potential future losses.

The Trump administration has taken steps to pave a way for tariffs on chips, including probes led by the Commerce Department into semiconductor imports. The investigations seek to determine what impacts those imports have on national security, which could give President Donald Trump a reason to implement tariffs on key tech goods.

In general, Trump has said that his tariff strategy is part of a broader effort to encourage domestic manufacturing of key goods. The president is also hoping to use the levies to push China to negotiate a better trade deal with the US, although the specifics around his demands are not clear.

On Monday, Nvidia reiterated its commitment to invest $500 billion over the next four years in the US, promising AI supercomputers and data centers.

The White House promoted the announcement as a win, calling it ""the Trump Effect in action.""

In Asia, where Nvidia's supply chain is concentrated, stocks of  its suppliers declined on Wednesday.

Japanese testing equipment maker Advantest dropped 6.5% in Tokyo. Shares of semiconductor wafer producers Samsung Electronics and TSMC ended 3.3% and 2.5% lower in Seoul and Taipei, respectively.

Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, fell more than 5% in Amsterdam after missing expectations and warning that tariff uncertainty could hit demand for its products.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Realtors and Zillow are going to war. Homebuyers will pay the price.","https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-new-real-estate-agent-listings-rules-homebuyers-search-homes-2025-4","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:04:00 GMT","

Real estate listings have descended into chaos. Homebuyers will pay the price.

Thousands of real estate agents across the US opened their email Saturday night to find an unexpected message from Andy Florance, the CEO of CoStar Group and Homes.com. As the top executive for one of real estate's largest search websites, Florance had a lot on his mind. For months, the industry has been embroiled in a fight over ""exclusive inventory"" — homes marketed for sale by real estate agents but purposely kept off public search portals like Homes.com or Realtor.com. Florance wasn't writing to complain about this practice, though. He'd set his sights on another target: his company's chief rival, Zillow.

Two days earlier, Zillow had unveiled a new rule threatening to blacklist scores of homes from its well-trafficked website. The surprise announcement took direct aim at exclusive inventory, also known as secret or hidden home listings. A growing number of agents at large brokerages, most notably the national power player Compass, had been hoarding listings and testing the waters by advertising them on their own websites before sharing the homes widely across the internet. Zillow said it would permanently ban from its site any listing that had gone through this preview period. If you're going to market a home somewhere, the company argued, you have to market it everywhere.

Zillow, by far the most popular destination for online home shoppers, framed the move as a defense of consumers: ""Fragmented listing access — in which a home is available on one platform but not another, or shared with some agents but not others — creates frustration and distrust,"" the company said in its announcement. But Florance wasn't having it. He lambasted Zillow's new rule as ""an incredible move of audacity and a pure power play of epic proportions."" Homes.com, Florance told the agents, would happily welcome any listings scorned by Zillow.

This is the messy state of play in real estate: With sales stuck in a protracted malaise, agent commissions under pressure, and the rules of the game in flux, everyone is scrambling to protect their share of the homebuying pie. Zillow's declaration adds yet another twist, marking an explosive turning point in the long-simmering dispute over exclusive inventory and hidden home listings. The company is flexing its considerable muscle, presenting agents with a daunting choice: Either share your listing with Zillow and everyone else as soon as you so much as stake a sign in the front yard, or explain to your client why their home will never appear on the website that's become synonymous with real estate.

""That's the spark,"" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""And now everybody, whether they like it or not, they have to have a position. They have to make some decisions, and they need to act.""

As usual, regular consumers will bear the brunt of these changes. Sellers need to understand exactly how — and where — their agents will advertise their homes, while buyers may have to canvass a range of websites for inventory. Finding that dream home could soon become a game of hide and seek. 

Many agents don't bother with exclusive inventory. As soon as they agree to market a home on behalf of a seller, they add it to the multiple listing service, or MLS, a local database that shares the information with other agents, brokerages, and big search portals like Zillow. Once a listing is live in the MLS, it's pretty much everywhere.

But agents have other options that are growing more popular. They can quietly shop a home around to other agents within their brokerage, a practice known as ""office exclusives."" These are shared via email, word of mouth, or internal listing platforms, so the homes don't actually pop up on the internet for casual browsers to see. Another option is to add the listing to the MLS and advertise the home publicly on the brokerage's website but opt out of the data feeds that share listings with other websites that display homes, including other brokerages and search portals like Zillow. In both instances, a brokerage like Compass, the largest in the country by sales volume, can lure agents and clients with early access to homes they can't find anywhere else. There's been a lot of debate over whether this is actually good for the seller, but the financial upside for the brokerage is enormous.

It's easy to get bogged down in the details of how this all works, and it remains to be seen how Zillow will actually implement these changes. But the spirit of Zillow's new rule, spelled out in last week's announcement, is pretty simple: ""If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere."" Redfin, another leading search portal, has taken a similar stance, saying it will also ban listings that are not shared everywhere. Both sites notably make exceptions for homes that were originally office exclusives — if a seller wants to remain truly private, they can do so within the walls of their brokerage and turn to Zillow or Redfin later. But as soon as the general public can lay eyes on a home, the broker has a day to share it with everyone through the MLS — or else. (Zillow has said that listings can be unbanned if the seller breaks up with their broker.)

Zillow's hardline stance has already mobilized support. At least two big brokerages — eXp Realty, the third-largest brokerage by sales volume, according to the consulting firm T3 Sixty, and NextHome, which has 6,000 agents nationwide — have made public commitments to abide by Zillow's policy. The Consumer Policy Center, a new nonpartisan think tank, has also come out in support of the new rule.

""We encourage all brokers to support Zillow's efforts to maintain the transparency of real estate markets and prevent their balkanization,"" Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at CPC and a former senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement.

But there are problems with Zillow and Redfin's position. Ironically, they could push more home listings into the shadows by encouraging brokerages like Compass to pursue ""office exclusives"" rather than sharing homes publicly on the Compass website. They also risk appearing power-hungry and desperate to preserve their web traffic (and bottom lines) at all costs.

""It's not the flex they think it is,"" says Amanda Orson, the founder and CEO of Galleon, an alternative marketplace that connects homebuyers and sellers directly. ""It's a tell. Zillow realized that not having all of the inventory available is their Achilles' heel, and they just telegraphed it.""

Glenn Kelman, Redfin's CEO, doesn't see it that way. The search portals, like the MLS, track how long a house has been on the market and whether the seller has dropped the price — data points that end up harming sellers, in Compass CEO Robert Reffkin's telling. If that's the issue, Kelman says he's fine with dropping that info entirely. Redfin has called on MLSes to create an option that would allow agents to share listings while preventing websites from showing price drops and days on market, which Kelman describes as a middle ground. The most important thing, he says, is for consumers to be able to see all the homes no matter which website they visit.

""You shouldn't have to go to 10 different websites to see 10 different sets of inventory,"" Kelman tells me. ""That will be a challenge for consumers.""

Here's one thing I'm sure of: This is a mess. There are more than 500 MLSes around the country, each with its own policies and enforcement mechanisms. Compass appears unlikely to back down from exclusive inventory, setting up more battles down the line. In an email to Compass agents the day after Zillow's announcement, Reffkin advised agents to ""keep doing what you're doing.""

""This moment goes beyond a policy — it's about control versus choice,"" Reffkin wrote.

For the average American trying to hop into the housing market, the new battle will likely only cause confusion and frustration. Sellers may not know what they're agreeing to when they opt for a limited advertising campaign, or they may turn litigious when they realize their homes have been blacklisted from Zillow. Buyers may be forced to scour a range of websites to get an idea of what's out there, and even then, they could risk overlooking their dream home. Even real estate executives are confused about some of this stuff — now imagine the reaction of a typical buyer or seller, who goes through this kind of transaction only a handful of times in their lives.

When confusion runs rampant among regular consumers — when the very rules of the game are unclear — that's usually a sign that government intervention could be on the way.

""As much as many of us wouldn't like that to happen, it's kind of getting set up to where it could happen,"" Saul Klein, a longtime real estate executive and the CEO of the San Diego MLS, tells me. ""And so I think we've got to be real careful and work not to keep confusing the marketplace.""

Indeed, Andy Florance's email to agents over the weekend included a postscript with a link to contact the Department of Justice. But government action is hardly guaranteed, and it could be years before anything happens. In the interim, expect the fight to get uglier.

""There is something larger at stake than just who gets control of the inventory,"" Kelman tells me. ""It's the US housing market, and we're supposed to all be at an age where we actually care about that. And I think everybody does, but emotions are just running high right now.""

Hong Kong's postal service is temporarily stopping the delivery of postal items from the US in retaliation to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.

""The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively,"" the service said in a press release on Tuesday.

The service added that it took issue with the US government's decision to ""eliminate the duty-free de minimis treatment for postal items despatched from Hong Kong to the US and increase the tariffs for postal items containing goods to the US starting from May 2.""

""Hongkong Post will definitely not collect any so-called tariffs on behalf of the US and will suspend the acceptance of postal items containing goods destined to the US,"" the press release read.

Hongkong Post also said that from Tuesday, it would be suspending the delivery of surface mail — which is sent by land or sea — to the US.

It would also stop accepting airmail destined for the US from April 27.

Postal items only containing documents will not be affected, the release said.

The US is one of Hong Kong's biggest trading partners. According to data from the Office of the US Trade Representative's website, the total value of trade between Hong Kong and the US was about $34 billion in 2024.

Nearly $28 billion worth of goods were exported from the US into Hong Kong in 2024.

Hongkong Post's announcement comes as trade tensions between China and the US continue to escalate. The two countries have exchanged retaliatory tariffs since Trump first imposed a 10% tariff on goods from China in February.

The US now imposes a 145% tariff on goods from China, and Beijing has responded with a 125% tariff on US-made products.

Trump has also cracked down on the de minimis loophole, which allowed small packages under $800, like those from Chinese retailers Shein and Temu, to be brought into the country tax-free.

On April 9, Trump issued an executive order imposing a 120% tax on small parcels under $800 from China, Hong Kong, and Macau.

The order added that per-item postal fees for these parcels would increase to $100 between May 2 and June 1 and to $200 after June 1.

Representatives for Hongkong Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

China needs to revise its industrial policies if it wants to avoid further backlash and build economic ties internationally as Donald Trump's tariffs upend the global trade system, according to a European business group.

“We are today in a situation where China needs to really rethink the way that it engages with the rest of the world,” said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “Industrial policy needs to be changed.” ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The San Francisco skyline near Jackson Square.

Designer Jony Ive, Google's Sergey Brin and NBA star Stephen Curry are among the deep-pocketed believers in the city's revival. 

In San Francisco's financial district, the One Montgomery building evokes the opulence of America's turn of the 20th century gilded age. With its Tuscan columns, marble staircases and bronze doors, the Renaissance Revival landmark once housed Crocker Bank, named after one of the tycoons who built the western portion of America's first transcontinental railroad.

These days, the property exemplifies the city's shifting fortunes: Ghazi Shami, chief executive officer of the record label Empire, bought it in January for $22.5 million, more than 70% below its selling price only six years before.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Gold hit another record high this morning.

In late 2023, Cobi Blumenfeld-Gantz testified at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about how health insurance brokers target elderly Americans. “The Medicare enrollment and navigation process is broken,” Blumenfeld-Gantz told the committee. He described a thicket of marketers and lead generators who sought to persuade patients to choose private Medicare Advantage plans, often in lieu of the standard federal program known to most people as just Medicare.

Those private plans, which make up the most profitable category of the health insurance industry, provide additional benefits beyond what Medicare offers, such as dental and vision insurance, but they come with trade-offs. Whereas most doctors accept Medicare, the typical Medicare Advantage option has a much more limited network of doctors, requires prior authorization for more medical procedures and sometimes leaves patients with unexpectedly large out-of-pocket costs. According to Blumenfeld-Gantz, the people pitching those private plans don't always make these trade-offs clear. Instead, he told the Finance Committee, they “traffic in scare tactics, imitate government agencies like the federal Medicare program and inaccurately advertise plan benefits.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The World Trade Organization slashed its forecast for merchandise trade this year as soaring US tariffs and broader uncertainty hammer international commerce.

The Geneva-based WTO expects the volume of world merchandise trade to decline by 0.2% in 2025 — almost three percentage points lower than it would have been without the US-led trade war, marking a dramatic reversal from expectations at the start of the year.

OpenAI has released its latest artificial intelligence model, which it said is capable of ""thinking with images,"" meaning it can understand and analyze a user's sketches and diagrams, even if they're low quality.

The main new reasoning model from OpenAI is called o3, and the company simultaneously released a smaller model dubbed o4-mini. The rollout follows the September debut of OpenAI's first reasoning model, o1, which focused on solving complex problems and deliberating over its answers in multiple steps.

With o3, users can upload whiteboards, sketches and other images and have the AI analyze and discuss them. The models can also rotate, zoom and use other image-editing tools.

Since introducing its viral ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, OpenAI has been rapidly upgrading its models to go well beyond text into images, voice and videos. The company is racing to stay ahead in generative AI, where it faces heated competition from rivals including Google, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI.

""For the first time, our reasoning models can independently use all ChatGPT tools — web browsing, Python, image understanding, and image generation,"" OpenAI wrote. ""This helps them solve complex, multi-step problems more effectively and take real steps toward acting independently.""

The company, valued at $300 billion in a funding round last month, said that o3 and o4-mini are its first AI models that can ""think with images."" That means ""they don't just see an image, they can integrate visual information directly into the reasoning chain,"" according to OpenAI.

Last month, OpenAI released a native image-generation feature that went viral online for its ability to produce Studio Ghibli-style anime images.

OpenAI said its o3 model is especially tuned for math, coding, science and understanding images, while o4-mini operates faster and at a lower cost. Both models were available starting Wednesday to ChatGPT Plus, Pro and Team customers.

OpenAI's user community has long joked about its strange or confusing AI model names. CEO Sam Altman joined the banter this week, writing in a post on X, ""how about we fix our model naming by this summer and everyone gets a few more months to make fun of us (which we very much deserve) until then?""

The company also said that both models had been ""stress-tested under our most rigorous safety program to date"" and linked to its ""Preparedness framework"" updated earlier this week.

OpenAI has come under fire recently for changes to its safety precautions and processes. It said this week that it reserved the right to ""change its safety requirements if 'another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.'""

In changing its policies this week, OpenAI wrote it would no longer require safety tests for certain fine-tuned models. The company also avoided releasing a ""model card"" — or a report containing information about safety tests done before a model is released — for its GPT-4.1 model. In February, OpenAI launched AI agent tool Deep Research weeks before publishing its system card.

OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

California on Wednesday sued President Donald Trump to halt his sweeping tariff regime, arguing that he is implementing his protectionist trade agenda illegally.

The federal lawsuit makes California the first state to challenge the Trump administration over its wide-ranging tariff plans, which have whipped up historic market volatility and frayed America's relationships with its allies and trading partners.

""Donald Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally impose the largest tax hike of our lifetime with his destructive tariffs,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X. ""We're taking him to court.""

The lawsuit argues that Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act — which he recently invoked to impose his so-called reciprocal tariff plan — is ""unlawful and unprecedented,"" Newsom's office told NBC News.

The situation creates ""immediate and irreparable harm to California, the largest economy, manufacturing, and agriculture state in the nation,"" the office said.

The suit filed in U.S. District Court in northern California seeks to have Trump's tariffs declared void.

Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta are set to hold a press conference at 1:30 p.m. ET announcing the legal action.

""The President's chaotic and haphazard implementation of tariffs is not only deeply troubling, it's illegal,"" Bonta said in a statement to NBC.

""As the fifth largest economy in the world, California understands global trade policy is not just a game,"" Bonta said.

""Californians are bracing for fallout from the impact of the President's choices — from farmers in the Central Valley, to small businesses in Sacramento, and worried families at the kitchen table.""

The White House lashed out at Newsom over the lawsuit.

""Instead of focusing on California's rampant crime, homelessness, and unaffordability, Gavin Newsom is spending his time trying to block President Trump's historic efforts to finally address the national emergency of our country's persistent goods trade deficits,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement.

""The entire Trump administration remains committed to addressing this national emergency that's decimating America's industries and leaving our workers behind with every tool at our disposal, from tariffs to negotiations,"" Desai said.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices slid more than 5% on Wednesday after the company said it could incur charges of up to $800 million for exporting its MI308 products to China and other countries.

""The Company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted,"" AMD said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The new U.S. license requirement, which applies to exports of certain semiconductor products, would hit inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves, AMD said in the filing.

AMD is one of the companies that builds the hardware behind the artificial intelligence boom. The company claims its AMD Instinct MI300 Series accelerators are ""uniquely well-suited to power even the most demanding AI and HPC workloads,"" according to its website.

It generated ""record"" revenue of $25.8 billion in 2024, according to its February earnings release, but the new export restrictions could slow growth.

Nvidia, an AMD competitor, released a similar disclosure on Tuesday. The company said it will take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion for exporting H20 graphics processing units.

China is Nvidia's fourth-largest region by sales, after the U.S., Singapore and Taiwan, according to the company's annual report. More than half of its sales went to U.S. companies in its fiscal year that ended in January.

-- CNBC's Kif Leswing and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Correction: AMD generated revenue of $25.8 billion in 2024. An earlier version misstated the year.

Technology stocks declined Wednesday, led by a 8% drop in Nvidia, as the chipmaking sector signaled that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plans could hamper demand and growth.

Nvidia revealed in a filing Tuesday that it will take a $5.5 billion charge tied to exporting its H20 graphics processing units to China and other countries and said the government will require a license to ship the chips there and other destinations.

The chip was designed specifically for China use during former President Joe Biden's administration to meet U.S. export restrictions barring the sale of advanced artificial intelligence processors, which totaled an estimated $12 billion to $15 billion in revenue in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices said in a filing Wednesday that the latest export controls on its MI308 products could lead to an $800 million hit.

The disclosures from Nvidia and AMD are the first major signs that Trump's fierce battle with China could significantly hamper chip growth. The administration has made some exemptions for electronics, including semiconductors, but has warned that separate tariffs could come down the road.

Adding to the sector worries was a disappointing print from Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. The company missed order expectations and said tariff restrictions create demand uncertainty. Shares fell nearly 6%.

The VanEck Semiconductor ETF fell more than 4%, with AMD plunging more than 7%. Micron Technology, Marvell Technology and Broadcom slipped more than 2% each. Equipment makers Applied Materials and Lam Research fell about 4% each.

The declines spilled over into the broader market and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which dropped 2%. Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla lost about 2% each. Amazon, Microsoft and Apple were last down about 1% each.

Technology stocks have whipsawed in the wake of Trump's tariff announcements, which sparked global trade war fears and recession concerns.

The market slumped in the initial aftermath of the sweeping policy plans, pushing megacap technology stocks dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven"" to shave off more than $1.8 trillion in market value over two trading days. Markets saw more wild turbulence as Trump later announced a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs, sending the Nasdaq Composite to its second-best session ever last week.

Many technology stocks have bounced from their low, but Apple and Meta Platforms are down more than 10% each so far this month, while Amazon has slumped about 7%. Nvidia and Tesla are down more than 3% each.

The European Union is preparing for more tariffs from the United States, despite conversations with the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration earlier this week.

It's been an intense back-and-forth over the past few months, with Trump accusing the EU of being among the worst culprits in its trade treatment of the U.S.

Tensions have been heating in recent weeks. With its steel and aluminum subject to Washington's broader tariffs, the EU retaliated with duties worth more than 20 billion euros on U.S. goods. These countermeasures were then put on hold for 90 days, after Trump also paused a second round of tariffs on EU goods for the same period.

""As advocated from day one, we prefer negotiations to tariffs, which are damaging to our respective economies, business operators and consumers,"" Olof Gill, trade spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said in a document shared with CNBC after the meeting between White House and EU officials.

The EU's top trade official Maros Sefcovic met U.S. Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on April 14, but their conversations seemed to have resulted in little progress.

""It is clear that significant joint efforts will be needed to achieve a successful outcome within the 90-day window,"" Gill said. ""The EU is doing its part. Now, it is necessary for the US to define its position. As with every negotiation, this must be a two-way street.""

President Trump this week reiterated his view that he is not satisfied with the EU on trade.

""The European Union has taken terrible advantage, they don't take our food products, they don't take our cars,"" he said.

The United States has further dialed up pressure on the EU this week by announcing investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, which, Trump says, could lead to new levies against these sectors.

""This had been expected,"" the EU's Gill said, adding that Europeans have made ""a strong case"" against tariffs in these areas.

""The Commission also continues with our preparatory work on additional countermeasures, should the negotiations fail to result in a successful outcome. And everything remains on the table.""

The EU's top exporting products into the US are medicinal and pharmaceutical goods, road vehicles, and machinery.

The EU had a trade surplus with the U.S. totaling 48 billion euros in 2023, according to data from the European Union. This can be broken into a surplus of 157 billion euros in goods and a deficit of 109 billion euros in services.

All eyes are meanwhile on Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Meloni, who is meeting President Trump on Thursday. She's the first European head of state to meet with the U.S. leader since some tariffs were paused earlier this month.

""This represents a key opportunity for her to demonstrate both her closeness to President Donald Trump and her potential role as a credible interlocutor capable of revitalizing transatlantic dialogue,"" Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of consultancy firm Teneo, said in a note to clients last week.

He added that Meloni ""is under pressure to protect Italy's exports, which recorded a trade surplus of 40 billion euros with the U.S. in 2024, the third highest in the EU, following Germany and Ireland.""

Trump has previously called Meloni ""a wonderful woman"" and said that Rome has a ""very strong leadership with Georgia.""

Meloni and Trump share conservative political ideas and also similar views over China. The talks could still take a turn, however, as Trump might push Meloni on the question of Rome's defense spending as part of its commitments to the NATO alliance. Rome is not yet complying with the coalition's target of investing 2% of its GDP on security.

JPMorgan Chase this week began suing more customers it has accused of stealing funds from the nation's largest bank in last year's so-called infinite money glitch.

The bank is now going after customers who allegedly stole amounts below $75,000, which means it is filing complaints in state courts, instead of the federal venues it chose last year, according to a person with knowledge of the company's deliberations.

The glitch, which went viral in late August in videos posted to social media, allowed customers to withdraw the entire value of a fraudulent check before it bounced.

""On August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant's Chase bank account in the amount of $73,000.00,"" the bank said in a suit filed Tuesday afternoon in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

By the time the check bounced six days later, a series of cash withdrawals at two Chase branches in the state totaling $82,500 had been made, according to the bank.

The accused, whose name is being withheld by CNBC until she can respond, owes the bank $57,847.69, and hasn't complied with requests to return the funds, according to the lawsuit.

Besides the Georgia case, the bank is filing lawsuits in state venues in Miami; the Bronx, New York; and two Texas counties, said the person, who declined to be identified speaking about the bank's plans.

The episode highlights the lengths JPMorgan will go to to claw back funds it is owed and to deter future crimes. The bank looked at thousands of potential cases, choosing to litigate the largest amounts with the clearest pattern of theft, said the person familiar.

The bank has also sent letters to more than 1,000 customers demanding they repay funds since October, this person said. Some people returned money on their own after CNBC reported in October that the bank was going after potential fraudsters who had drawn down the largest amounts, said the person.

The lawsuits are separate from potential criminal cases that both federal and state law enforcement may be pursuing, according to the bank.

""We're still investigating cases of fraud and cooperating with law enforcement — and we'll do that for as long as it takes to hold fraudsters accountable,"" Drew Pusateri, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in a statement.

JPMorgan is also considering pushing back against the bankruptcy filings of alleged ""infinite money"" fraudsters.

In one of the bank's motions made this week in bankruptcy court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the company asked a judge for more time to object to the customer's attempt to discharge his or her debts.

The bank is the ""holder of an unsecured claim"" that resulted from ""actions taken by the Debtor to deposit a fraudulent check in the amount of $44,779.46 to which the Debtors immediately made numerous cash withdrawals on August 30, 2024 as well as various Cash App transactions to himself,"" the bank alleged.

""There are genuine and important reasons people use bankruptcy protections,"" JPMorgan's Pusateri said. ""Getting rid of debts you accumulated through fraud isn't one of them.""

U.S. ride-hailing firm Lyft on Wednesday announced that it's buying European taxi app Free Now in a 175 million euro ($199 million) deal.

The company said that the acquisition — Lyft's first in Europe — is expected to close in the second half of 2025, and that, once combined, the two companies will serve over 50 million combined annual users.

Founded in 2009 as myTaxi, Free Now is a ride-hailing platform headquartered in Hamburg, Germany. The company has been jointly owned by German automotive giants BMW and Mercedes-Benz since 2019.

The app is available in over 150 cities across nine countries, including Ireland, the U.K., Germany and France. Beyond traditional taxi and ride-hailing services, Free Now also offers other mobility options including e-scooters, e-mopeds and e-bikes.

The startup is earnings-positive on the basis of Earnings Before Interest, Debt and Amortization, generating gross bookings over 1 billion euros in 2024, according to a company fact sheet.

Acquiring Free Now will give Lyft a route to expand into the highly competitive European ride-hailing market, where it will come up against the likes of Uber, Estonia's Bolt and Israel's Gett.

Lyft CEO David Risher told CNBC that the company is only now entering Europe because it saw an opportunity to expand after steadily improving the service in North America.

Noting that Thursday will mark his two-year anniversary as Lyft CEO, Risher said: ""When I started, unfortunately, we were losing share, we were losing money. We weren't doing so great for riders or drivers.""

""Now, we pick you up about a minute faster, driver cancelation is down to less than 5%, drivers are making billions of dollars on the platform. And our Canada operation has doubled this year over last year.""

He added: ""So, looking at the strong service levels, looking at the fact that internationally, within Canada, we're doing quite well. Now we said, 'You know what, now is the time?""

Lyft's closest domestic rival, Uber, has a lengthy head start on the firm, having first launched in the U.K. back in 2012. It has since been beset by a series of regulatory issues.

London's transport regulators tried to ban Uber two times over safety concerns. The company was eventually awarded a fresh license to continue operating in the city in 2022.

Mortgage rates jumped to the highest level since February last week, dampening overall demand and sending homebuyers in search of riskier loans with lower rates.

Total mortgage application volume fell 8.5% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.81% from 6.61%, with points decreasing to 0.62 from 0.63, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.

Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 13% higher than the same week one year ago. Demand from buyers may be higher than a year ago, but there is 30% more active inventory on the market than there was last year at this time, according to Realtor.com. That suggests the annual comparison should be much larger, as low inventory was blamed for weak sales last year.

""Economic uncertainty and the volatility in rates is likely to make at least some prospective buyers more hesitant to move forward with a purchase,"" said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA.

Home prices are also higher than they were a year ago, and that has more borrowers looking to lower their potential monthly payments. Adjustable-rate mortgages offer lower interest rates but are considered riskier because they have a shorter fixed term and then can adjust higher.

""Given the jump in rates, more borrowers are opting for the lower initial rates that come with an ARM, with initial fixed rates closer to 6 percent in our survey last week,"" said Fratantoni, noting a full percentage point jump in the ARM share in just a week.

""The ARM share at 9.6 percent was the highest since November 2023, and this reflects the share of units. On a dollar basis, almost a quarter of the application volume last week was for ARMs, as borrowers with larger loans are even more likely to opt for an ARM,"" he added.

Applications to refinance a home loan dropped 12% for the week but were 68% higher than the same week one year ago. Rates at this time last year were 32 basis points higher.

Mortgage rates moved lower to start this week, as markets were far calmer than they were last week. But experts warn there is likely more volatility to come.

""Despite the friendly move and the relative calm, this still isn't an environment where it makes sense to take anything for granted in terms of today's rates being available beyond the present day,"" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.

LONDON — Google is being sued for £5 billion ($6.6 billion) in potential damages in the U.K. over allegations that the U.S. tech giant abused its ""near-total dominance"" in the online search market to drive up prices.

A class action lawsuit filed Wednesday in the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal claims that Google abused its position to restrict competing search engines and, in turn, bolster its dominant position in the market and make itself the only viable destination for online search advertising.

It is being brought by competition law academic Or Brook on behalf of hundreds of thousands of U.K.-based organizations that used Google's search advertising services from Jan. 1, 2011, up until when the claim was filed. She is being represented by law firm Geradin Partners.

""Today, UK businesses and organisations, big or small, have almost no choice but to use Google ads to advertise their products and services,"" Brook said in a statement Tuesday. ""Regulators around the world have described Google as a monopoly and securing a spot on Google's top pages is essential for visibility.

""Google has been leveraging its dominance in the general search and search advertising market to overcharge advertisers,"" she added. ""This class action is about holding Google accountable for its unlawful practices and seeking compensation on behalf of UK advertisers who have been overcharged.""

Google called the case ""yet another speculative and opportunistic case"" and said that it plans to ""argue against it vigorously.""

""Consumers and advertisers use Google because it helpful, not because there are no alternatives,"" a spokesperson told CNBC.

A 2020 market study from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) — the U.K.'s competition regulator — found that 90% of all revenue in the search advertising market was earned by Google.

The lawsuit claims that Google has taken a number of steps to restrict competition in search, including entering into deals with smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search and Chrome on Android devices and paying Apple billions to ensure Google is the default search engine on its Safari browser.

It also alleges Google ensures its search management tool Search Ads 360 offers better functionality and more features with its own advertising products than that of competitors.

It is the latest legal challenge for the American technology giant. U.S. Big Tech firms ranging from Google to Meta have been hit with a multitude of lawsuits, regulatory investigations and fines over concerns surrounding their sheer power and influence.

In 2018, Google was fined 4.3 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by the European Union for abusing the dominance of its Android mobile operating system by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install Chrome and Search in a bundle with its Play app store. Seven years on, Google is still appealing the antitrust penalty.

This week, an antitrust lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission against Meta officially entered the courtroom in a landmark trial that could ultimately force the social media giant to sell its Instagram and WhatsApp platforms.

In January, the U.K.'s CMA raised concerns over competition issues in the cloud computing market, recommending an investigation into Amazon and Microsoft under a landmark competition law known as the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.

That came after a class action lawsuit filed in December 2024 accused Microsoft of unfairly overcharging customers of rival cloud companies. The claimant in the case, competition lawyer Maria Luisa Stasi, is seeking more than £1 billion in compensation for firms affected.

Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML on Wednesday missed order expectations and said that uncertainty from new U.S. trade restrictions may affect demand for its critical chipmaking machines.

Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the first quarter:

ASML said net bookings — a key indicator of order demand — came in at 3.94 billion euros ($4.47 billion) for the first three months of 2025. That was lower than a forecast of 4.89 billion euros from analysts. Shares of ASML were down 5% Wednesday morning.

In comments accompanying the results, ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet said that the demand outlook ""remains strong"" with artificial intelligence staying as a key driver. However, he added that ""uncertainty with some of our customers"" could take the company into the lower end of its full-year revenue guidance.

ASML is estimating 2025 revenue of between of 30 billion euros to 35 billion euros.

Fouquet said that tariffs are ""creating a new uncertainty"" both on a macroeconomic level and with respect to ""our potential market demands.""

""So this is a dynamic I think we have to watch very carefully,"" Fouquet said. ""Now this being said, where we are today, we still see basically our revenue range for 2025 being between basically €30 and €35 billion.""

Ben Barringer, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said impacts from U.S. tariffs on ASML could be ""widespread"" but added that, at this stage, it's too early to tell what effect they'll have.

""I think it's too early to really comment on whether ASML chooses sides,"" Barringer told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday. ""A little bit like their biggest customer, TSMC, ASML will just want to support customers globally. They're everybody's production equipment.""

Global chip stocks have been fragile over the last two weeks amid worries about how U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans will affect the semiconductor supply chain.

Last week, the U.S. administration announced smartphones, computers and semiconductors would be temporarily exempted from his so-called ""reciprocal"" duties on counterparties. But on Sunday, Trump and his top trade officials created confusion with comments that there would be no tariff ""exception"" for the electronics industry, and that these goods were instead moving to a different ""bucket.""

On Tuesday, a federal government notice announced that the U.S. Commerce Department was conducting a national security investigation into imports of semiconductor technology and related downstream products. The probe will examine whether additional trade measures, including tariffs, are ""necessary to protect national security.""

Overnight, chip giant Nvidia disclosed in a filing that it expects to take a $5.5 billion quarterly charge due to U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 graphics processing unit to China and a handful of other countries.

This report is from this week's edition of CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

The last time Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke was just before the January 20 U.S. presidential inauguration.

Less than two weeks after becoming president for a second time, Trump added 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, and said he would talk to Xi in the next 24 hours.

""We called the White House. 'How did the call go?'"" a senior U.S. business executive who wished to remain unnamed told me last week. The White House said, ""'The Chinese didn't call.'""

""What's just been patently clear from the beginning, the administration dramatically overestimates how much leverage tariffs give them on China,"" the executive said

The U.S. jacked up new tariffs on Chinese goods last week, effectively taking them to 145%.

After retaliating with a 125% increase in tariffs on U.S. goods, Beijing went into the weekend by calling the tariffs a ""numbers game"" that they planned to ignore. That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese text.

So far, both sides have publicly indicated little intent to take any tangible first step to resolve the impasse and limit the global economic fallout from tit-for-tat measures.

Xi, who is now in an unprecedented third term as China's president, has also shown he is committed to defying any perception that he is giving up leverage to the U.S. — even if it means short-term pain for the economy. On the 70th anniversary of China's Communist Party rule, Xi proclaimed that ""no force can stop the Chinese people and the Chinese nation.""

Trump, on the other hand, has backtracked on even some of the latest tariff plans, while stating his end goal is to build up the U.S.

A confluence of economic and cultural differences have led to the standoff, with China's global positioning changing significantly in the last several years.

""I think people in the U.S., both investors and policymakers, their mindset [on China] is still something similar to 10 years back,"" Bruce Liu, CEO of asset manager Esoterica Capital, said Monday. He splits his time between New York and China.

China's economic situation in 2018 meant the country had to make a deal with Trump after bilateral tensions escalated during his first term, but Beijing has less reason to this time around, Liu said. ""They are not in a rush to have a conversation, or initiate a conversation with the U.S. side at this moment.""

Beijing's official stance has reinforced that thinking, with spokespeople stressing that any talks must be conducted on the basis of ""mutual respect."" DeepSeek's AI breakthrough in late January has also fueled a belief in China that the country can withstand U.S. restrictions.

Per capita disposable income in China has climbed by 38% since 2018. When I moved to the country that summer, Starbucks was by far the best option for coffee and most cars were gasoline-powered. Nearly seven years later, artisanal coffee shops are the norm and even smartphone company Xiaomi has electric cars on the streets.

That's not to say everything has been rosy.

Unfinished apartment buildings stand scattered on the outskirts of large cities. It's been tough for businesses trying to navigate the Covid-19 restrictions and the subsequent economic slowdown. The frenetic growth I witnessed before the pandemic is largely gone.

Major Wall Street investment firms have reacted to the escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions by cutting their forecasts for Chinese economic expansion this year, with UBS slashing expectations to just 3.4% growth this year. For now, Beijing has maintained its target of around 5% growth for the year, and indicated it could ramp up stimulus to support the economy.

But in pockets of the economy, a persistence remains, to keep trying despite the circumstances.

China's global connections have also changed.

The country's exports to the U.S. climbed by 10% between 2018 and 2024, but China's exports to the European Union rose by 26% during that time while those to Southeast Asia surged by 84%, according to CNBC analysis of official data. Southeast Asia is now China's largest trading partner, followed by the EU and then the U.S.

Part of that is the re-routing of trade to the U.S., but part of it also reflects a growing overseas market for Chinese goods, albeit with the risk of hurting local businesses and jobs.

Instead of talking to Trump, Xi this week is making his first overseas state visit of 2025 to Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Malaysia and then Cambodia. Chinese state media described the travels as ""at the invitation"" of the local government, echoing the stately language used when Xi last visited the U.S. in November 2023 to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden.

Xi also met with U.S., European, and Middle East business executives in Beijing in late March. He called on them to ""uphold"" the global order, just as he told Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam in a meeting Monday that the two countries should safeguard global supply chain stability and oppose ""unilateral bullying."" That's according to a CNBC translation of the Chinese readout, which did not name the U.S.

Trump this week called China's meeting with Vietnam an effort to ""screw"" the U.S. He declined to share an update on any planned talks with Xi.

Vietnam this month was slapped with one of the highest U.S. ""reciprocal"" tariffs — even more than China initially — in response to which the Southeast Asian country's prime minister, Pham Minh Chinh, offered to buy more U.S. defense products while asking for a 45-day delay in the tariffs as the two countries negotiated.

Trump then temporarily lowered the tariffs on Vietnam and other countries with a 90-day negotiation period. China was not included.

""If you are kind to me I'm going to be twice kind to you. That's [being] Chinese,"" Liu said.

""But if you want to bully me, we're not going to take that. We know this might cause hardship in our economy or our daily life, but we are ready for that,"" he said, speaking of the typical Chinese mentality.

U.S. tariffs: Rebuilding global supply chains won't be easy, says Milken Institute

Perry Wong, managing director of research at the Milken Institute, talked to CNBC's ""The China Connection"" about e-commerce platform Shein's plans to shift production outside of China in the face of U.S. tariffs.

JD.com VP: China's domestic market is big enough to absorb some tariff impact

Jianguang Shen, Vice President and Chief Economist at JD.com, said on CNBC's ""The China Connection"" that stimulating the domestic Chinese market is ""the way to go"" in response to U.S. tariffs, whereas currency depreciation could be disruptive to the financial market.

China's 5% GDP growth target unlikely to change despite U.S. tariffs, professor says

David Li, an economics professor at Tsinghua University, said on CNBC's ""The China Connection"" that boosting domestic consumption remains at the top of Beijing's agenda.

China reported first-quarter GDP of 5.4%. That figure beats analysts' expectations of a 5.1% increase. Retail sales and industrial production figures for March also came in well above forecasts. The country's latest loan data for March came in better than expected, mainly due to short-term corporate loan growth, according to Goldman Sachs.

Kling, an AI-powered video generator from Kuaishou, has gotten an upgrade. The Chinese short-video company announced the news in Beijing on Tuesday, and claims that the new version offers better control over visualizations of people, emotions and scenes to mimic real-world scenarios.

The U.S. is exempting China-made electronics from the highest tariffs. However, it's unclear how long the reprieve will last. China and Vietnam signed agreements on railroad cooperation and protocols to expedite bilateral trade, according to the Southeast Asian country. China has also swapped out its commerce ministry trade negotiator from the last several years with a new face.

Chinese and Hong Kong stocks were trading in the red on Wednesday even as China released better-than-expected GDP data. This comes as a growing number of investment banks cut the country's annual growth outlook.

Mainland China's CSI 300 was down 0.74% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which encompasses several major Chinese companies — fell over 2% as of 10:42 a.m. local time.

The benchmark 10-year Chinese government bond yield was last at 1.639%.

The offshore-traded Chinese yuan is trading at 7.3276 against the greenback.

Where's the bottom for bitcoin (BTC)?

While acknowledging it's possible that level has already been hit, on-chain analyst James Check suggested a true bottom may not be in place until after bitcoin suffers a true capitulation event.

That would likely require a decline to the $65,000 area, said Check, calling it the ""true market mean,"" i.e., the average cost basis for active investors.

At that point according to Check, who spoke on the TFTC podcast, the average investor may begin to feel the pressure of unrealized losses. Even long-term holders, including those who have held bitcoin for five years, could find themselves underwater. Interestingly, this price level aligns closely with Michael Saylor's Strategy, which has a similar cost basis of around $67,500.

While Check expects sizable declines from the $65,000 area, he sees strong support in the $49,000-$50,000 range, those prices representing the launch of the ETFs in 2024 as well as a $1 trillion market cap for bitcoin. A drop to as low as $40,000 seems unlikely, he said, barring a global recession.

Check also took note of the extended period of ""chopsolidation"" in 2024 — where bitcoin traded for months in a wide range between $50K and $70K — as establishing a strong foundation of support.

Following an avalanche of concerns from current and retired state workers, as well as some state legislators, Republican leaders in the state House of Representatives have agreed to a number of changes in their proposal to invest the state pension into cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.The crypto industry has contributed heavily to Republican politicians in recent years, and GOP leaders at the state and national levels have responded with new efforts to embrace the industry. In the state legislature, House Bill 92 would allow North Carolina Treasurer Brad Briner to invest billions of dollars from the State Pension Plan into cryptocurrencies.On Wednesday a House committee on pensions approved a newly rewritten version of the bill, as well as another bill, House Bill 506, thay would put new safeguards on the Treasurer's office and its investments strategies. In combination, the two bills would reduce the amount the state could put into crypto — lowering the maximum amount from 10% of the pension to 5% — as well as creating a new advisory board that would oversee state invements, taking away the state treasurer's ability to unilaterally make investment decisions.Supporters of the crypto investment plan, including Briner, a Republican won won election in November, point to the large gains Bitcoin and other digital coins have returned to investors over the past decade. Opponents say it's too speculative and could lead to large losses for retired state workers just a easily as it could lead to large gains.Unlike many bills at the legislature that divide lawmakers along party lines, this one has revealed generational divides. Older lawmakers have tended to be more skeptical, while it's the younger politicians — including new Speaker of the House Destin Hall — who have been the bill's most enthusiastic supporters.But most politicians are from the older generations. There's been susbstantial pushback against the bill even within the GOP caucus, a rarity for any bill that enjoys public support from the House speaker. Wednesday's changes show that the bill will continue to move forward, but that skeptics have also been able to make it less aggressive than originally proposed.Briner attended Wednesday's hearing over both bills, saying he approves the measure to take away some of his power. He said 47 other states already have a similar system in place and North Carolina needs to join the rest. Allowing the treasurer to make solo investment decisions, he added, has not gone well: North Carolina ranks either 49th or 50th in pension investment returns, depending on how you look at the numbers.The investment strategies of the past, Briner said, have led to North Carolina receiving about 1.5% less on its investments than the average state. And since the state has more than $100 billion in investments, that means the state would be getting around $2 billion a year more every year if it had just been average.In addition to the efforts to make the office more professional and subject to more oversight, Briner said, making crypto investments should also help the state make more money.If the state had been making that extra $2 billion a year recently, he added, it would've given lawmakers much more flexibility in the annual budget — which is approximately $32 billion this year, projected to grow to $32.6 billion in the new fiscal year starting in July.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin could hit $1M if US buys 1M BTC — Bitcoin Policy Institute","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-1-million-dollars-united-states-purchase-tariffs","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:32:35 GMT","

 Bitcoin Policy Institute executive director Matthew Pines said that tariff earnings are “budget-neutral” and can be used by the US government to buy Bitcoin. 

A Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) executive floated a $1 million Bitcoin price scenario if the United States were to buy 1 million BTC. 

In a Bitcoin Magazine podcast, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, said that a 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by the US would have a massive impact on the price of the asset. 

“If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that's just a global seismic shock. [...] I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof,” Shapiro said. “I think we'd probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.”   

The discussion followed US President Donald Trump's March 7 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile.

BPI executive director Matthew Pines said that other nations are watching how the US positions itself with Bitcoin before formulating their own strategies.

The executive added that holding more Bitcoin aligns with Trump's promise to make the US a Bitcoin superpower. 

“If Donald Trump wants to make good on his promise to be a Bitcoin superpower, that ultimately comes down to how much Bitcoin you have. This is a measure of how much the United States is making good on that rhetorical objective,” Pines said. 

Trump's executive order also directs the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral” strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin to expand the reserve without additional taxpayer burden.

On March 12, Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act to push US holdings above 1 million BTC.

Pines also suggested ways to acquire Bitcoin in a budget-neutral fashion. He floated the idea of using tariff revenues to buy Bitcoin and other potential ways for the US government to purchase more BTC. 

“Revenues that the government can use to acquire more Bitcoin would be things like tariff revenue or other fees that the government collects that are not tax-based fees,” Pines said. This could include royalties from oil and gas leases, sales of federal land, physical gold and other digital assets.

On April 2, Trump imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries through an executive order. The president's order also included reciprocal tariffs for countries that charge tariffs on US imports. However, the administration's evolving tariff policy has created ongoing market uncertainty.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing around $83,500 on Wednesday after it faced multiple rejections around its 200-day EMA at $85,000; a breakout indicates a bullish trend. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) extended their losses after facing resistance around their key levels.

Bitcoin has faced multiple rejections around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 since Sunday. On Tuesday, BTC tried breaking above this level but was rejected again and declined by 1.12%. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $83,500.

If BTC closes above $85,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart flattens around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the bullish momentum to be sustained.

However, if BTC continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price found support around its daily level of $1,449 last week and recovered slightly, but it faced resistance of around $1,700. On Monday, ETH was again rejected around this level and declined by 2.15% the next day. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $1,590.

If ETH continues its correction, it could extend the losses to retest its daily support level at $1,449. A successful close below this level could extend an additional decline to retest its important psychological level of $1,300.

The RSI on the daily chart hovers at 40 below its neutral level of 50, indicating bearish momentum.

ETH/USDT daily chart

However, if ETH continues its recovery and closes above $1,700, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $1,861.

XRP price broke above the 200-day EMA at $1.95 last week and recovered 11% until Saturday. However, the next day, it faced rejection around the daily level of $2.23 and declined 3.49% until Tuesday. On Wednesday, it hovered around $2.08.

If XRP continues its decline and closes below its 200-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.77.

The RSI on the daily chart had slipped below its neutral level of 50, indicating a rise in bearish momentum.

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP breaks and closes above $2.23 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally and retest its March 24 high of $2.50.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The cryptocurrency aggregate market capitalization stabilized around $2.7 trillion on Wednesday, with Bitcoin's $84,000 support momentarily anchoring the market against external bearish discourses.

Chainlink active addresses slide dramatically to 3,200 from February's peak of 9,400. The downtrend in network activity coincides with increasing selling activity among whales with between 10 million and 100 million LINK.

Bitcoin is stabilizing around $83,500 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing multiple rejections around the 200-day EMA at $85,000 since Saturday. A breakout of this strong level would indicate a bullish trend ahead.

Binance Chain has finalized its programmed 31st quarterly BNB token burn, potentially setting the stage for the world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $81.45 billion, to rally in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends recovery to around $82,500 on Friday after dumping to a new year-to-date low of $74,508 to start the week. Market uncertainty remains high, leading to a massive shakeout, with total liquidations hitting $2.18 billion across crypto markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum (ETH) derivative markets post peak inflows, signaling another big price move","https://www.mitrade.com/au/insights/news/live-news/article-3-764698-20250417","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 16:32:34 GMT","

Ethereum (ETH) derivative markets are going through another big accumulation. Historically, derivative market inflows are linked to big price moves. 

Ethereum (ETH) derivative markets are having another day of peak inflows. Data by CryptoQuant analysts show over 77,000 ETH flowed into derivative exchanges. Similar inflows were observed on March 26 and April 3, followed by an ETH crash to a lower range. 

The inflows signal arrives at a time when ETH sentiment is bearish, and the market price has broken below the growth trend since the 2022 bear market. For some analysts, the current low sentiment may be a sign of a market bottom, while for others, another drawdown is possible.

The current inflows to derivative exchanges surpass the previous inflows of around 65K ETH. The token is closely watched for signs of a bigger price move, especially with the current price pressures. 

ETH is at a crossroads, with traders waiting for either a breakout or a new crash to a lower range. After the recent inflow to exchanges, ETH open interest is slightly up to $8.28M, with around 35% in short positions. 

The current price action follows a period of accumulation and signs of whales buying. The overall ETH balance in accumulation addresses has also surged in Q1 and retained the trend in April. Whales also try to re-buy ETH at a lower range, after selling at local peaks. 

The price move for ETH is not guaranteed to be on the downside. Based on the Ethereum positions heat-map, the market is accruing liquidity both around the $1,500 level, and as high as $1,700 for short positions. 

From the current price level, it remains uncertain which positions would be attacked first. ETH traded around $1,590.22, showing some weakness after retaining the $1,600 level for a day. The asset still traded near its lows of 0.019 BTC. 

While ETH expects a breakout, a new slump to a lower range is also seen as a possibility. ETH currently trades on renewed risks based on the US tariff policy against China. 

Ethereum also reflects the health of the overall DeFi sector, as the chain carries over 49% of all value. The chain remains indispensable for DeFi apps, but the value of ETH reflects the general confidence in the crypto ecosystem. 

After a period of liquidations, DeFi protocols are rebuilding their liquidity positions, showing the new risk profile for ETH. 

Currently, DeFi lending protocols carry $937M in positions that can be liquidated if ETH falls to a lower range. The biggest accumulation of liquidity is at $917.99, where most whales decided to secure their loans. 

Some of the borrowers have taken out loans with a liquidation price of $1,123,390, mostly on MakerDAO. However, borrowers remain extremely cautious in rebuilding their positions. There are almost no loans with a liquidation price in the $1,500 and $1,400 range. 

ETH still holds over $47B in total value locked, led by Aave and liquid staking protocols.

 Ethereum's commitment to L2 scalability may be a “double-edged sword” for the ETH price, potentially leading to liquidity dispersion among blockchains. 

Ethereum's push toward layer-2 (L2) blockchain scalability may be a double-edged sword for Ether, potentially weakening the value accrual of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, according to a new report from Binance Research.

The report suggests that Ethereum's L2 blockchain networks — built to improve mainnet scalability and lower transaction costs — may be cannibalistic of the Ethereum base layer, negatively impacting the price of Ether (ETH).

Ethereum's dominance in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) volume and fees generated is “under threat” by Solana and BNB Smart Chain, Binance Research wrote.

The main factors include slow and expensive transactions, fragmented “developer mindshare and liquidity, and reduced value accrual to the L1 due to the rise of L2s,” the report said. 

Ethereum's roadmap already includes future upgrades aimed at creating cheaper transactions, additional security, and more future-proof incentives for the mainnet.

Still, Ether's value accrual may continue to suffer in the near term since the next two major upgrades don't immediately address these issues, but are aimed at creating more scalability around data availability and incorporating more L2 networks.

Concerns have been reignited around the Ethereum mainnet's economic incentives since Ether's price fell to $1,410 on April 7, marking its lowest level since March 2023.

Ether's price fell over 61% during a four-month downtrend, which started on Dec. 16, 2024, when ETH briefly peaked above $4,100, Cointelegraph Markets Pro data shows.

After initial delays, Ethereum's highly anticipated Pectra upgrade is set to go live on the mainnet on May 7.

The Pectra upgrade aims to improve Ether staking and L2 network scalability, increase blob capacity to enable more data handling on the mainnet and improve overall network capacity.

The Fusaka upgrade, expected in late 2025, will focus on scaling the Ethereum mainnet as a data availability layer by introducing EIP-7594. Fusaka may also bring an update to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), resulting in a “more structured approach” to smart-contract creation, reducing runtime overhead and improving developer experience.

Ethereum's commitment to L2 scaling may be a “double-edged sword” due to concerns around the mainnet's “competitiveness as a data availability layer” and “the sustainability of value accrual to Ethereum the asset,” the report said.

“One promising path for stronger ETH value accrual is the development of based rollups,” which “contribute significantly more in fees” to Ethereum compared with L2s like Base, Arbitrum and Optimism, according to a Binance Research spokesperson.

“Another avenue is Ethereum's evolving role as a data availability layer,” the spokesperson told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Aligning incentive structures between Ethereum and L2s, whether through fee sharing, MEV capture, or protocol-level integrations, will be essential to ensure sustainable value flow back to ETH as an asset should Ethereum continue to commit to scaling with L2s,” he added.

Ethereum's pressure continues to deepen as three major investment firms move over $40 million worth of ETH to exchanges within 24 hours. 

According to data shared by on-chain analyst The Data Nerd on Apr. 16, within the last 24 hours, Polychain Capital deposited 5,700 Ethereum (ETH), worth around $9.2 million, to centralized exchanges. Galaxy Digital sent another 12,500 ETH, approximately $20.3 million, while B2C2 added 6,540 ETH worth about $10.7 million.

Within last 24 hours, there were multiple $ETH deposits into exchanges:– #Polychain_Capital deposited 5.7k $ETH (~$9.19M)– #Galaxy_Digital deposited 12.5k $ETH (~$20.29M)– #B2C2 deposited 6.54k $ETH (~$10.67M) pic.twitter.com/SnQ8gGZIep

The timing is critical. ETH has broken below the $1,600 mark, a major support zone that has now flipped into resistance. Most moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, are flashing sell signals. The relative strength index is at 38.9, indicating weak momentum but not yet in oversold territory. The moving average convergence/divergence is pointing toward a possible short-term rebound, but overall, the market remains cautious.

If ETH fails to reclaim the $1,600–$1,620 zone soon, further downside toward $1,500 or even $1,450 is possible. However, a bounce from current levels could trigger a quick relief rally to $1,700, where heavier resistance awaits.On-chain data only deepens the bearish sentiment. According to DeFiLlama data, Ethereum's total value locked has dropped from around $70 billion at the start of the year to $46 billion. Monthly revenue also fell from $109 million in January to just $7.2 million in March.

The network has been losing ground to rivals like Solana (SOL), Base, and Tron (TRX), which are now drawing more users and revenue. Even decentralized apps like Uniswap (UNI) are performing better on competing chains. 

U.S. spot ETF outflows add to the concern. ETH ETFs saw $14 million in outflows on Apr. 15, bringing total net losses to $158 million over the past month, according to SoSoValue data.ETH lost 45% in Q1 2025, its third-worst quarter since 2016. With major players selling and fundamentals weakening, Ethereum's road to recovery looks increasingly steep.

Bitcoin was born as a response to institutional failure, a decentralized escape hatch from corruptible centralized finance and a north star of self sovereignty. Bitcoin's true vision was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That phrase is right there in the Bitcoin white paper's title from Satoshi himself.

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Today, Bitcoin is many things:

But Bitcoin is not electronic cash. It is too volatile for daily use, too slow to scale and too rigid to adapt as a cash equivalent. Somewhere along the way, Bitcoin gave up on being the system, and instead became the signal.

Ethereum, by contrast, might be the one actually delivering on Bitcoin's original promise.

Thanks to Ethereum's programmability, we now have stablecoins, arguably the most successful crypto use case to date. Dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT settle trillions in peer-to-peer value across borders 24/7 with no bank intermediaries. Stablecoins are Bitcoin's white paper come to life, minus the volatility.

Ethereum's scale can be shown through on-chain data.

Stablecoins on Ethereum and its Layer 2s now rival the transaction volume of major credit and debit card networks. In markets where local currencies are unstable or financial access is limited, stablecoins have become lifelines. They are used for remittances, payroll, savings and even commerce.

The irony is that Bitcoin wanted to replace fiat, but it's Ethereum that has quietly made fiat better. It gave the dollar superpowers like composability, programmability and global mobility. And it's doing it without centralized permission.

Here's the kicker: Ethereum's evolution doesn't stop at payments. Once you understand the technology, you realize ETH does everything BTC can do, and so much more.

Where Bitcoin remains focused on scarcity, Ethereum is building infrastructure. The rise of real-world asset tokenization (RWAs) is a perfect example. Treasury bills, private credit and fund shares are now being issued on Ethereum, bringing regulated assets into composable finance. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other legacy giants aren't launching on Bitcoin; they're building on Ethereum.

Additionally, unlike Bitcoin's inert capital, Ethereum enables native yield through staking, allowing participants to secure the network while earning predictable returns — an increasingly attractive feature for institutions seeking on-chain cash flow.

This isn't to say Bitcoin has failed. It serves a different role: a monetary anchor in the digital world. But its utility is limited. Ethereum, on the other hand, is becoming the global settlement layer for on-chain assets.

While Bitcoin adoption has captured mainstream headlines, Ethereum's fundamentals quietly continue to grow as the platform gains institutional market share. Some metrics to back up Ethereum's growing influence and usage include:

Ethereum isn't replacing Bitcoin. But it's fulfilling what Bitcoin started: a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust — in short, digital cash. Bitcoin sparked the movement. But Ethereum is scaling it.

Novel decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Neutrl aims to bring a hedge fund trade — once limited to sophisticated investors — to the masses in the form of a crypto token.



The protocol is launching its NUSD ""synthetic dollar"" token, designed to generate returns by arbitraging discounted altcoin deals in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, the team told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.



Neutrl also raised $5 million in seed funding led by digital asset private marketplace STIX and venture firm Accomplice. They were joined by Amber Group, SCB Limited, Figment Capital and Nascent alongside a range of crypto angel investors including Ethena founder Guy Young and derivatives trader Joshua Lim of Arbelos Markets, recently acquired by FalconX.



Neutrl is the latest entrant to the rapidly growing roster of protocols that offer hedge fund-like investment strategies wrapped into a token with a stable price, often called ""synthetic dollar."" $6 billion DeFi protocol Ethena spearheaded the trend, offering yield to token holders via holding spot cryptos and shorting perpetual futures, farming the funding rate.

Neutrl's structure is built around buying locked altcoins at discounts in private markets, then hedging exposure with perpetual futures. For example, a trader might acquire Solana's SOL or Avalanche's AVAX at a 20% discount from a foundation and simultaneously open a short position for the token. The return comes from the price gap, not market movement.



This is a popular hedge fund investment strategy producing high double-digit yields to sophisticated investors who don't want to take directional bets on crypto prices, Neutrl co-founder Behrin Naidoo explained in an interview.



But, instead of managing these trades manually, users can hold a single token—NUSD—that encapsulates the strategy, opening access to a broader set of investors, he said.



With a flood of altcoin unlocks over the next few years, Neutrl estimates that there's a $10 billion market for locked up tokens. This offers an attractive yield opportunity for investors, especially now when crypto yields in decentralized finance compressed to multi-year lows, Naidoo said.



The protocol is targeting to grow to $2 billion in assets in the two years, he added.

The best crypto projects solve key problems that Bitcoin can't. The best of the best solve real-world problems as well.

If it can, $ETH and ERC-20 tokens could lead the best altcoins to new heights, while also pushing real-world AI development into the next phase of growth.

Centralized data, secretive algorithms, and Big Tech dominance have created what many call the ‘black box' problem, where users can't understand or verify how AI systems make decisions.

It's actually two related trust issues.

Diving deeper leads to another question: Do you trust the AI itself with the decision-making process?

The basic AI development process is that you feed in data, and the AI gives you an output. But the logic in between can be a mystery. This is especially dangerous when those models are used in finance, healthcare, hiring, or law enforcement.

The black box problem, and the trust issues behind it, pose a huge challenge for the continued development and adoption of AI.

According to former Ethereum core developer Eric Conner, the blockchain could become AI's most important infrastructure layer.

In recent comments on X, Conner said Ethereum is on the verge of its ‘biggest mainstream moment,' not through DeFi or NFTs, but by bringing transparency and decentralization to artificial intelligence.



With Ethereum, smart contracts can log how AI models are trained, where their data comes from, and how decisions are made. And because it's the blockchain, those decisions are on-chain for everyone to audit.

With token-based incentives and open governance, Conner believes that Ethereum offers an alternative to the closed ecosystems of tech giants.

If Conner is right, Ethereum could be on the verge of a major leap forward.

Any paradigm-shifting token requires a top-flight web3 wallet. Get the most out of a leading crypto wallet with Best Wallet Token ($BEST).

$BEST is the utility token for a full-suite Web3 wallet that aims for mass adoption. It boasts user-friendly features like built-in swapping, portfolio tracking, and exclusive presale discovery.



Best Wallet's ultimate goal is to become the go-to tool for both new and seasoned investors, allowing them to get the most out of their crypto. The app supports all ERC-20 tokens, and the $BEST token itself runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

Wallet apps are rapidly becoming gateways to the entire crypto economy, and Best Wallet app is no exception. Within the app itself, investors will have all the tools they need to capitalize on any AI developments.

Learn how to buy Best Wallet Token in our guide. The token, currently priced at $0.0247, has big potential – our own analysis indicates it could reach $0.072 by the end of 2025.

Speaking of AI and the Ethereum blockchain, Mind of Pepe ($MIND) isn't just riding the meme wave. Instead, MIND of Pepe is out to build an interactive AI ecosystem around a beloved cultural icon.

The roadmap involves building a fully autonomous AI agent and deploying it on X. By interacting with the MIND agent, users will be able to guide, shape, and even train the AI itself.



That's just the beginning of MIND's plan. Holders of the $MIND token also gain:

As the MIND of Pepe learns, the ecosystem grows. The AI agent can interact directly with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing it to manage its own allocation of $MIND tokens (25% of the total token supply) and also launch more tokens.

Our own analysis indicates that, under the right conditions, the $MIND token could reach $0.00535 by the end of 2025.

The token price currently sits at $0.0037165. Learn how to buy MIND of Pepe with our guide, and don't delay – the project just passed the $8M funding mark.

How much of Ethereum's next chapter will come from AI? As Eric Conner highlighted, Ethereum offers everything AI platforms need but don't yet have: transparency, decentralization, open access to data, and built-in payments.

Projects like MIND of Pepe are already building AI agents on Ethereum. And while $ETH itself isn't on presale, there's certainly still room for growth.

In fact, the Ethereum organization itself recognizes the growing importance of AI. The tokens and tools launching on top of the Ethereum blockchain could alter the course of AI development. And that infrastructure-level potential could fuel another massive wave of growth.



Ethereum's smart contracts solve the black box issue by making everything visible on-chain, from how models are funded and what data they use, to who gets paid for it. It's a crucial step toward decentralized, trustworthy AI.

These three projects – whether wallet-based, meme-powered, or ecosystem-defining – are poised to grow under what could be the next trillion-dollar use case for Web3.

As always, do your own research. This isn't financial advice, just a heads-up on where the best new cryptos could be going.

With crypto recovering from its earlier blues, don't overlook the potential of these three altcoins.

The cryptocurrency market, once a beacon of hope for financial innovation and transparency, is now facing a crisis of confidence that threatens its very foundation. As we move through 2025, it has become obvious that the altcoin sector is plagued by a toxic mix of collusion, price manipulation, and a glaring lack of transparency—especially on centralized exchanges (CEXs). The result is a market that feels increasingly rigged, where genuine price discovery is rare and retail investors are left holding the bag. I watched this industry evolve from its idealistic beginnings to its current state, I believe the time for self-reflection and reform is now, before the damage becomes irreversible.

The most insidious problem in today's altcoin market is the collusion between project teams and market makers. In theory, market makers are supposed to provide liquidity and stability, but in practice, many have become partners in manipulation. The process is disturbingly simple: project teams allocate large amounts of tokens to market makers at deep discounts before a token generation event (TGE). These market makers then orchestrate artificial price pumps at launch, creating the illusion of demand. Retail investors, seeing the price action, rush in—only to see the token's value collapse as insiders dump their holdings.

The numbers in 2025 are staggering. In my own observation, most of the newly launch altcoin have lost 95% of their market cap. This is not a fluke or a reflection of poor project quality; it is a direct result of coordinated manipulation. The median altcoin launched in 2024-2025 is down by at around 70% from its TGE price. This pattern is so consistent that it has become a running joke among traders: “Buy the rumor, sell the TGE, and pray you're not the last one out.”

Centralized exchanges, which still control roughly more than half of the global crypto market cap, are at the heart of this crisis. Despite their dominance, most CEXs have done little to address the manipulation happening on their platforms. The incentives are clear: listing fees and trading volumes are lucrative, and exchanges benefit from the volatility and hype that manipulated launches generate.

Transparency is sorely lacking. While some exchanges have made token efforts to publish proof-of-reserves or improve listing standards, these measures are often superficial. The reality is that order books can be spoofed, wash trading is rampant, and the true nature of liquidity is hidden behind closed doors

This lack of transparency is fundamentally at odds with the ethos that drew so many to crypto in the first place. Bitcoin's original promise was a system where trust was replaced by cryptographic proof and open ledgers. In 2025, the altcoin market feels more like a casino run by insiders than a transparent, decentralized financial system.

This is also reflected in the poll that I have conducted, 82.4% of the respondents think that CEX should held to a higher standard and they should lead by example to help the crypto industry.



The impact of this dysfunction is not just financial—it is deeply personal. I have spoken with countless retail investors who entered the market in good faith, only to be burned by the same cycle of hype, manipulation, and collapse. Many have lost significant savings, not because they made reckless bets, but because the system was stacked against them from the start.

This erosion of trust is now quantifiable. According to a poll on X conducted by me, 63% of respondents believe that most altcoin prices are manipulated, and 37% have reduced or stopped investing in new token launches altogether.



Perhaps the most glaring symptom of the current malaise is the absurdity of TGE pricing. In a rational market, the price of a new token should reflect its utility, adoption prospects, and the fundamentals of the project. Instead, TGE prices are set at levels designed to maximize returns for insiders and early backers, with little regard for long-term sustainability.

The result is a predictable crash. New tokens losing more than half its value within the first two weeks of trading become a norm. This is not just a problem for speculators; it undermines the entire process of capital formation and innovation in the crypto space. When every new launch seems like a trap for retail investors, genuine projects struggle to attract long-term supporters.

For years, the crypto industry has argued that self-regulation is preferable to government intervention. But the events of 2024 and 2025 have shown that self-regulation is, at best, a myth. The industry's inability—or unwillingness—to police itself has created a Wild West environment where bad actors thrive and honest participants are left disillusioned.

Just this morning, I warned my community that “the industry is eating itself alive,” and that unless meaningful reforms are enacted, both retail and institutional investors will continue to flee. My warning is echoed by community members who acknowledge that the status quo is unsustainable.

So, what can be done to restore trust and legitimacy to the altcoin market? In my view, the answer lies in a renewed commitment to transparency, decentralization, and investor protection.

First, centralized exchanges must be held to higher standards. This means real-time publication of order flows, full disclosure of market maker relationships, and transparent token allocation data. Exchanges should be required to implement robust surveillance systems to detect and prevent manipulation, and to cooperate with independent audits. Some progress is being made—several exchanges have begun publishing more detailed transparency reports —but these efforts are still the exception rather than the rule.

Second, the industry must accelerate the shift toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and on-chain trading. While DEXs currently account for about 25% of trading volume, they offer a level of transparency and auditability that CEXs simply cannot match.

Every trade is recorded on a public blockchain, making it much harder to conceal manipulation. Uniswap v4 and dYdX have shown that it is possible to build liquid, efficient markets without relying on centralized intermediaries.

Based on a poll that I have done, 74.3% of the respondents think the industry must shift to DEX. I believe more and more people understand the importance of decentralization.



Third, token launches need to be fundamentally reformed. This could include longer vesting periods for insiders, transparent allocation disclosures, and mechanisms to ensure fair price discovery—such as open auctions or liquidity bootstrapping pools. Some projects are experimenting with “fair launches,” where tokens are distributed via community-driven mechanisms rather than private sales. While not a cure-all, these approaches represent a step in the right direction.

Despite the current malaise, I remain cautiously optimistic about the future of crypto. The technology that underpins digital assets—blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized finance—still has the potential to revolutionize the global financial system. But for that potential to be realized, the industry must confront its demons.

As an observer and participant in the crypto space, I have seen both the best and worst of what this market has to offer. I have witnessed the excitement of genuine innovation, the thrill of new possibilities, and the power of community-driven projects. But I have also seen the damage wrought by greed, collusion, and a lack of accountability.

The choice facing the industry is stark. It can continue down the current path, sacrificing trust and legitimacy for short-term gains. Or it can embrace reform, transparency, and a renewed commitment to the values that made crypto compelling in the first place.

The crisis of trust in the altcoin market is not an abstract problem; it is a clear and present danger to the future of digital assets. Collusion between project teams and market makers, abetted by the opacity of centralized exchanges, has created a market where manipulation is the norm and genuine price discovery is the exception. The result is a loss of confidence, a flight of capital, and a growing sense of disillusionment among investors.

But it does not have to be this way. By demanding greater transparency, embracing decentralization, and supporting thoughtful regulation, the industry can chart a new course. The road ahead will not be easy, and there will be resistance from those who benefit from the status quo. But the alternative—a market defined by manipulation and mistrust—is unacceptable.

I urge industry leaders, regulators, and investors to seize this moment. The future of digital assets depends on our willingness to confront hard truths, to demand better, and to build a market worthy of the ideals that inspired its creation. Only then can we restore trust, unlock innovation, and realize the promise of a truly decentralized financial system.

The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant downturn, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge by falling nearly 3% in just one day. This decline has sent ripples through the altcoin market, with Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL) facing even steeper losses. As of now, investors are left wondering whether this trend is a temporary setback or the start of a more severe decline.

Bitcoin initially seemed to maintain its positive momentum from the previous week, reaching a peak of $86,456 around 4 PM on April 15, 2025. However, just half an hour later, it plummeted by $1,500, marking the beginning of a downward spiral that saw it reach a low of $83,100 later that night. This volatility has raised concerns among investors, especially given the recent geopolitical tensions affecting market sentiment.



The downturn was exacerbated by stalled trade talks between the European Union and the United States, which heightened fears of economic instability. Additionally, Nvidia, a major American chip manufacturer, announced it would face new export restrictions to China, projecting a staggering $5.5 billion loss in revenue for the first quarter. This news has further pressured the market, leading to widespread sell-offs.

As of the latest updates, Bitcoin is trading at $83,455 on the crypto exchange OKX, and €73,406 on the Dutch exchange Bitvavo, reflecting a 2.56% decrease over the past 24 hours. The price action has left many investors anxious, as they hope this decline is not the onset of a more prolonged bearish trend.

In the altcoin market, Ethereum has suffered a significant setback, with a 4.27% drop in value over the same 24-hour period. Ripple (XRP), Solana, and Dogecoin (DOGE) have also seen their values decline by approximately 4%. Among the top ten cryptocurrencies, Cardano has emerged as the biggest loser, plummeting by nearly 6%. Meanwhile, Pi Network (PI) has faced an alarming 18% decline, signaling broader issues within the altcoin sector.

In light of these developments, investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming events that could influence market sentiment. Key economic indicators, such as retail sales and crude oil inventories, are scheduled to be released on April 16, 2025, at 2:30 PM. Additionally, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak at 7:15 PM, and his comments will be closely monitored for hints of potential shifts in monetary policy.



With inflation rates in the U.S. showing signs of significant decline, many investors are hopeful that Powell might signal a shift towards a more accommodative policy. This anticipation could create a volatile trading environment as investors react to any indications of policy changes.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with these challenges, some see this as an opportunity to invest at lower prices. For instance, Bitvavo, the largest crypto exchange in the Netherlands, is currently offering a promotion where new users can receive €10 in free crypto of their choice upon registration.

Despite the current turmoil, the crypto market remains dynamic, and many analysts caution against making hasty investment decisions. The volatility of cryptocurrencies can lead to rapid price changes, and patience may be key to navigating these turbulent waters.

Meanwhile, the analysis of Ripple (XRP) suggests that the coin is at a critical juncture. After a remarkable 275% increase since October 2024, XRP is now facing pressure as it struggles to maintain its position above the $1.80 support level. In recent weeks, the coin has shown signs of a downward trend, making lower highs and threatening to dip below the crucial support zone.



During the week of April 7-13, 2025, XRP nearly fell below this support level, but a surge in buying activity helped push the price back up. However, without a sustained effort to break above the red dotted line at $2.23, the likelihood of XRP dropping below $1.80 remains high.

Traders and investors are advised to monitor the market closely, as the situation remains fluid. With geopolitical tensions and market sentiment shifting rapidly, waiting for a more favorable moment to invest might be wise. Setting price alerts through trading apps can help investors stay informed of significant price movements.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, staying updated on industry news and trends is crucial for making informed decisions. The BLOX app, for example, offers real-time updates on important developments in the crypto space, from institutional adoption to technological advancements.

In summary, the current state of the cryptocurrency market is marked by volatility and uncertainty. With Bitcoin and altcoins facing significant declines, investors must navigate these challenges carefully. Upcoming economic data and statements from key figures like Jerome Powell could play a crucial role in determining the market's direction in the coming days.

Conclusion and References

A. Discrepancy Detection Security Parameters

The main contribution of this paper is that transaction order finality should be viewed as the key for determining system state. Computing an efficient representation is just an optimization, since state can be reconstituted from a checkpoint state and those transactions that follows it. We identify the following shades of finality: log finality, transaction order finality, state finality, and checkpoint finality. These notions are useful for reasoning about blockchain design and the design space for error/fault handling, from independent faults due to Byzantine actors to common-mode faults due to zero-day software defects.

  

Based on considering how and when these finality properties should be achieved, we developed a preliminary design sketch for an “ideal” layer 2 system, and discussed some of the trade-offs.

Raleigh, United States, April 16th, 2025, Chainwire



Film Finance Group International (FFGI), a North Carolina-based film finance innovator, has officially unveiled its upcoming ERC-20 utility token: FFG Token ($FFG). Built to power a transparent, milestone-based film funding ecosystem, FFG Token is an asset-backed token that bridges real-world production workflows with secure, blockchain-based infrastructure.

FFG Token is scheduled to go live in the coming weeks, with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens and integrated governance mechanics to allow token holders to vote on curated film projects. Backed by real-world film budgets and anchored by a proprietary on-chain accounting system, the token represents a new approach to financing indie cinema — one that aims to replace vague promises with verifiable payouts and investor control.

“We've designed FFG Token from the ground up to solve the trust and transparency issues that have long plagued independent film finance,” said G. David Keaton, Co-Founder and Managing Member of FFGI and a licensed CPA. “Our platform doesn't just tokenize investment — it offers visibility, accountability, and participation. This is infrastructure, not hype.”

Backed by Infrastructure, Governed by Community

Unlike speculative tokens with no underlying benchmarks, FFG Token is tied to real production milestones. Funds are allocated in phases based on verified deliverables, promoting greater accountability and reducing risk for participants.

FFGI has also structured the ecosystem with robust legal compliance in mind, including KYC-gated quarterly reporting and IP ownership through tokenized NFTs. A significant innovation is the formation of SPV #2, which houses a separately licensable blockchain accounting system developed in-house.

“We've built what we believe is the most advanced blockchain-native accounting system for film finance,” said Michael Dallas, Development Manager at FFGI and a veteran systems architect. “It's real-time, rules-based, and ready to be licensed to other studios or industries. The token and the technology work together — but they also stand strong independently.”

What Makes the FFG Token Different

Multiple Layers of Value

At the heart of the FFG ecosystem is a clear separation between token utility, IP ownership, and licensing potential. The token funds productions. NFT tokens represent IP ownership. And the accounting software — held by a separate Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) — opens new revenue streams.

“Our model is modular, but deeply interconnected,” added Keaton. “It's designed to support creators, protect contributors, and expand the use of blockchain in real, investable ways.”

Launch Timeline & Community

The official token launch is slated for late Q2 2025. Leading up to the public offering, FFGI will conduct community activations through its Telegram & Discord servers and begin releasing technical documentation and project previews.

“We're building not just a token, but a culture of accountability and empowerment,” said Dallas. “We want our early community to understand how this works under the hood.”

More information, including tokenomics, governance design, and licensing options, will be revealed through upcoming AMAs, dev diaries, and a full launch countdown.

About FFGI

FFGI is a blockchain-first film finance company based in North Carolina. Founded by a team of fintech veterans and production experts, FFGI leverages tokenization, on-chain accounting, and community governance to fund independent film projects with precision and transparency.

United States (US) President Donald Trump is making headlines again for his love of Monopoly, a real-estate-themed board game. Back in 1989, Trump released his version of the game, “Trump: The Game” and worked on a real estate show on the same theme, which never took off. 

Sources close to the matter told Fortune that President Trump could soon launch a crypto video game with a real estate theme. The game is expected to have a real estate feel per Fortune's latest report.

There is no official confirmation from President Trump or the White House. 

Fortune reported that sources close to the US President say a crypto video game project is underway. It has a “monopoly-like” feel and would add to the list of crypto ventures backed by the Trump family. 

Previously, Trump launched his NFT collection, Digital Trading Cards, and his official meme coin. Crypto-focused ventures backed by the family include World Liberty Financial, a stablecoin and a Bitcoin mining firm where Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. hold a stake. 

Fortune released details of the game based on comments from sources familiar with the project, who said the game is most likely a twist on Monopoly Go!. Players can earn in-game cash and erect buildings in a digital city. Kevin Mercuri, a spokesperson for Bill Zanker, the executive behind President Trump's meme coin and NFTs, confirmed that Zanker is behind Trump's latest venture. 

President Trump has pursued a pro-crypto agenda since his first day in the Oval Office. Experts have weighed the pros and cons of a crypto President and raised concerns over a conflict of interest with the rising number of Trump-backed crypto ventures. 

Trump's appointment of an AI & Crypto Czar and the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) shifting stance on crypto enforcement have created a conducive environment for innovation and crypto adoption in the US. While Trump's stance on the Bitcoin Reserve and the Strategic Crypto asset reserve is not clear, with no significant update to the executive orders, traders remain hopeful of a boost in crypto adoption in the long term. 

Bitcoin consolidates under the $84,000 level on Wednesday, gaining slightly on the day.

The cryptocurrency aggregate market capitalization stabilized around $2.7 trillion on Wednesday, with Bitcoin's $84,000 support momentarily anchoring the market against external bearish discourses.

Chainlink active addresses slide dramatically to 3,200 from February's peak of 9,400. The downtrend in network activity coincides with increasing selling activity among whales with between 10 million and 100 million LINK.

Bitcoin is stabilizing around $83,500 at the time of writing on Wednesday after facing multiple rejections around the 200-day EMA at $85,000 since Saturday. A breakout of this strong level would indicate a bullish trend ahead.

Binance Chain has finalized its programmed 31st quarterly BNB token burn, potentially setting the stage for the world's fifth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $81.45 billion, to rally in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) price extends recovery to around $82,500 on Friday after dumping to a new year-to-date low of $74,508 to start the week. Market uncertainty remains high, leading to a massive shakeout, with total liquidations hitting $2.18 billion across crypto markets.

The chase for Alexander Ovechkin collectibles remains hot after his record-setting 895th goal Sunday, which moved him ahead of Wayne Gretzky as the NHL's all-time leading goal-scorer.

But it isn't all sticks, jerseys and pucks.

NHL Breakaway, the official digital collectible (NFT) platform of the NHL (much in the same vein as NBA TopShot), has created a 1/1 NFT in honor of Ovechkin's landmark goal and is selling it via auction at Heritage.

The pre-sale estimate for the NFT is $25,000, and bidding has topped $7,500 with two weeks remaining.

The platform launched in 2023 and is also selling digital packs dubbed “The Gr8 Chase” for $8.95.

As of early Wednesday, the platform had sold 3,000 of the 8,888 total packs created.

The U.S. SEC has officially closed its investigation into NFT gaming project CyberKongz, four months after the project was hit with a Wells notice over its ERC-20 token integration.

In a recent post, the CyberKongz announced that the financial agency has pulled the plug on its initial investigation into the project's operations. Calling it a “win for our industry,” the web3 gaming and NFT project plans to do a complete rebrand following the landmark decision.

“After years of litigation, unjust allegations, crippling legal fees, and the biggest hurdle we could possibly encounter – we are free. This is an extremely proud moment for CyberKongz,” said the account in its post.

Following the decision, the NFT project expressed optimism for the future of Web3, as it believes that the result will serve to provide clarity for other projects in the Web3 space that are exploring blockchain technology, NFT and gaming. 

“We are certain this result will provide clarity to many projects innovating with blockchain technology, pushing the boundaries of Web3 gaming, and ultimately showcasing the beauty of NFTs,” continued the project.

Last December, the U.S. SEC issued a Wells notice to the NFT gaming project. The formal warning contained concerns the agency had about CyberKongz's ERC-20 integration into one of its blockchain-based games. It claimed the tokens fall under securities and had to be registered first, similar to many other crypto lawsuits that plagued firms like Ripple (XRP) and Helium (HNT).

The CyberKongz team said they were “extremely disappointed at the approach the SEC has taken” and vowed to fight back. The team argued the results of such a case could have major consequences towards the web3 gaming and NFT sectors.

Previously, the agency also took issue with the project's Genesis Kongz contract migration in 2021, which is viewed as a primary sale. CyberKongz argued that the SEC had misinterpreted the user of smart contracts and accused the regulator of failing to make a distinction between technical processes and actual token sales.

Under the new Trump administration, the federal agency has dropped multiple lawsuits against crypto and Web3 firms, most notably Kraken, Coinbase, Consensys, Robinhood, XRP among others.

Key Takeaways:

Donald Trump's back in the spotlight — again, not only in politics but also in cryptocurrency — with something new and unapologetically ambitious: a blockchain-blockchain real-estate game grounded in Monopoly but infused with Web3.

The as-yet-unnamed game will allow users to build, trade, and create virtual real estate empires, reminiscent of Monopoly's basic gameplay but with added aspects of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. All assets or properties will be tokenized in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with actual ownership and resale value:



With monetized income streams, real-life branding, and NFT support, the Trump blockchain game has plans to be a crypto-born Monopoly with a cultural twist.

Trump isn't taking this venture alone. He's joining forces again with Bill Zanker, the businessperson who originated the Trump University idea and co-author of Think Big. Zanker has set up the game as one part of a larger ecosystem that mixes entertainment, learning, and financial potential.

Zanker described this project as doing more than simply entertain — it's a means of getting mainstream users into Web3 via familiar branding and easy-to-play gameplay.

Trump's previous success with NFTs, particularly the Trump Digital Trading Cards launched in 2022 and 2023, laid a strong foundation for his new blockchain game. Despite early ridicule, both NFT collections sold out and remain actively traded, featuring Trump in meme-worthy roles like astronaut, superhero, and cowboy. This not only tapped into his loyal fanbase but also positioned him as one of the few public figures with sustained engagement in Web3. Existing NFT holders are likely to receive benefits in the upcoming game, such as in-game assets or token rewards, giving the project a built-in, crypto-savvy audience and an edge in user traction.

Central to the game's ecosystem will be a Trump-branded memecoin, informally known as $TRUMP, which is expected to serve as the in-game currency for property purchases, upgrades, and NFT trading. While detailed tokenomics remain under wraps, the coin is anticipated to follow an ERC-20 model with governance features and exchangeability on both centralized and decentralized platforms. Given the ongoing memecoin mania and Trump's branding power, $TRUMP could see significant speculative interest beyond gaming circles, echoing the rise of tokens like DOGE and PEPE during politically charged moments.

Trump's entry into blockchain gaming is not just a business move — it's a cultural phenomenon, with politics and finance mixing with memes. The game arrives when:

Trump — who was once a crypto skeptic — now appears to be embracing blockchain as a means of brand growth and political mobilization. With a world where meme coins and games are propagating around the world faster than traditional campaigns, the potential strength of a Trump crypto game cannot be ignored.

 For many years after its inception bitcoin was seen as an investment that traded unlike traditional assets, but as its tumble in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement shows, these days it's trading much like any other risky investment.Bitcoin fell sharply in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement on April 2, collapsing from $84,600 to $75,000 within a week. That plunge extended declines that began in February. On Jan. 30, bitcoin was worth over $106,000 after a blistering postelection rally.This drop coincided with a selloff in US stocks, especially technology stocks. During the week following Trump's announcement on tariffs, bitcoin shed 10.5%, very close to the 11.6% lost by the S&P 500 and 12% by the Nasdaq 100.“Bitcoin's heightened correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reflects its evolving role as a macro-sensitive asset, driven by institutional behavior and policy shifts,” says Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, a specialized provider of crypto ETPs.“Institutional investors now treat bitcoin similarly to tech stocks, creating synchronized trading patterns during macroeconomic events. This alignment intensified under Trump's pro-crypto agenda,” he adds.“Bitcoin might be decentralized, but it does not trade in a vacuum—when macro fear spikes, it gets hit like everything else,” says WisdomTree's digital assets research director Dovile Silenskyte.Trump's Tariffs and BitcoinTrump's promises to make the United States the new “bitcoin hub” attracted institutional capital, but they also bound bitcoin to political risks impacting traditional markets. Fritz says that over the past quarter, this evolving relationship solidified bitcoin's status as a risk-on asset. Thus, when the tariffs sparked a global flight to safety, investors rapidly exited both equities and bitcoin, triggering parallel 15% declines in BTC, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 as capital mainly rotated into the much relatively safer haven, like gold.At the same time, when news broke of a 90-day suspension of the tariffs and suddenly the risk-on sentiment came roaring back, bitcoin surged in line with a rally across equities.

For many years after its inception bitcoin was seen as an investment that traded unlike traditional assets, but as its tumble in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement shows, these days it's trading much like any other risky investment.

Bitcoin fell sharply in the wake of Trump's tariff announcement on April 2, collapsing from $84,600 to $75,000 within a week. That plunge extended declines that began in February. On Jan. 30, bitcoin was worth over $106,000 after a blistering postelection rally.

This drop coincided with a selloff in US stocks, especially technology stocks. During the week following Trump's announcement on tariffs, bitcoin shed 10.5%, very close to the 11.6% lost by the S&P 500 and 12% by the Nasdaq 100.



“Bitcoin's heightened correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reflects its evolving role as a macro-sensitive asset, driven by institutional behavior and policy shifts,” says Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, a specialized provider of crypto ETPs.

“Institutional investors now treat bitcoin similarly to tech stocks, creating synchronized trading patterns during macroeconomic events. This alignment intensified under Trump's pro-crypto agenda,” he adds.

“Bitcoin might be decentralized, but it does not trade in a vacuum—when macro fear spikes, it gets hit like everything else,” says WisdomTree's digital assets research director Dovile Silenskyte.



Trump's promises to make the United States the new “bitcoin hub” attracted institutional capital, but they also bound bitcoin to political risks impacting traditional markets. Fritz says that over the past quarter, this evolving relationship solidified bitcoin's status as a risk-on asset. 

Thus, when the tariffs sparked a global flight to safety, investors rapidly exited both equities and bitcoin, triggering parallel 15% declines in BTC, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 as capital mainly rotated into the much relatively safer haven, like gold.

At the same time, when news broke of a 90-day suspension of the tariffs and suddenly the risk-on sentiment came roaring back, bitcoin surged in line with a rally across equities. On April 9, BTC gained 8.2%, while the S&P 500 rallied 9.5%. “This rebound was not about crypto fundamentals, it was a classic macro-driven relief rally, showing just how plugged-in bitcoin is to the broader market narrative,” says WisdomTree's Silenskyte. 

For Ferdinando Ametrano, managing director of CheckSig and a professor of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology at Milan-Bicocca University, “bitcoin is a thermometer of globalization, sensitive to international scenarios.” 

“One part of the market likens it to North American tech stocks; another part sees it as digital gold, a safe haven asset.” 

Who is right will become clearer in the future, he says, but as of today in the tensest moments the association with equities typical of the most active market participants prevails, because the other component has instead a buy-and-hold approach.

Despite the swings seen in bitcoin recently, some point to data suggesting that the cryptocurrency has become less volatile.

“Over the past five years, bitcoin's 90-day annualized volatility has been cut nearly in half—from 95% in March 2021 to 52% in March 2025,” says Silenskyte.

What's driving this shift?

“Bitcoin has undergone a structural shift toward institutionalization,” says Silenskyte.

“Bitcoin has entered a phase of accelerated institutionalization, marked by growing participation from professional asset managers and corporate treasuries,” says 21Shares' Fritz. 

“This shift is driven by the development of regulated financial instruments such as spot bitcoin ETFs, options contracts, and volatility-linked derivatives, which enable sophisticated strategies like basis trading and risk-hedged exposure.”

Major financial institutions now allocate portions of their portfolios to digital assets. Such institutional footprint has gradually displaced retail-driven speculation, fostering a “market structure with tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced gap risks compared with previous cycles” and concurrently “reduced bitcoin's historical volatility.”

Max Shannon, research analyst at CoinShares, also says that “bitcoin's status as a 24/7 traded asset means it consistently attracts liquidity, contributing to deeper market structures.” 

As institutional participation grows and market infrastructure matures, “this increased depth is gradually helping to reduce the asset's historical volatility.”



Trump is the first openly pro-crypto US president, and his second term is expected to usher in a friendlier policy environment for crypto markets, but that doesn't mean it will all be plain sailing from here.

“Investors should expect both volatility and opportunity,” says Silenskyte, who adds that “macro liquidity remains the single most powerful force in markets and bitcoin is no exception.” 

Beyond the introduction of favorable regulations for crypto assets in the US, the opening of the European market, made possible by the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation bill, “will facilitate the entry of new institutional investors” such as when BlackRock and Fidelity launched ETFs, says CheckSig's Ametrano.

Ametrano thinks that bitcoin can reach new records in the next 12 to 18 months, and that “it will consolidate its role in diversified wallets.” But he adds that “price fluctuations will be inevitable.”

The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst's estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm's economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock's fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here

Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar's estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company's equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar's equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here

The Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar's forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar's conviction in those products' investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they're assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst's qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here

The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

People Power Party presidential primary candidate Hong Joon Pyo announced a bold five-year investment plan worth at least 50 trillion won to spur development in cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence, crypto, quantum science, super gap technology-led growth, and atmospheric superconductivity. However, Hong's main focus is to follow U.S. President Donald Trump's lead to push for blockchain and cryptocurrency as part of the country's economy.As per the report, the announcement was made during a policy briefing focused on the economy, labor, science, and technology held at his campaign headquarters in the Daeha Building in Yeouida. Hong listed 27 major commitments, focusing on a growth plan driven by the business sector and supported by the government.“In order to foster blockchain and virtual assets as a single industry, I will eliminate regulations as much as the Trump administration in the United States did,” and “I will introduce blockchain technology to the public sector and administrative services, and foster virtual assets as a single industry,” said Hong.Additionally, Hong also proposed a ‘New Industry gate Free' system that would allow entry into new technologies and new businesses without government approval.

Here's what he emphasized as direction for the economy policy: Revitalizing the economy through public-private collaboration, driving growth with super gap technologies, ensuring fair distribution based on productivity, creating jobs, and strengthening welfare for the working class.Hong identified the necessity of creating a “Public-Private Economic Revival 5-Year Plan” that will establish long-term economic growth. The initiative would propel the private sector as leader while the government supported its efforts.Hong proposed several transformative national initiatives that extended beyond economic and labor reforms, namely the sovereign wealth fund project initiated through oil development and the lunar landing mission goal by 2030, as well as extensive changes to the tax system.

The tax reforms presented by Hong contain two substantial elements consisting of the elimination of the comprehensive real estate tax and major tax breaks for inheritance, which boost economic activity and real estate movement.

Hong's policy package functions as a national strategic plan to establish South Korea as an innovative free-market economy with responsive leadership.

South Korea's financial regulator has asked Apple to block 14 cryptocurrency exchange apps and stop domestic access to them, citing the companies' unreported status. 

The move comes after Google asked to block 17 apps by Korea's Financial Services Commission in a similar move last month.

Per a translation of the official notice, the regulator said that on its request, Apple blocked domestic access to overseas unreported virtual asset operators through Apple apps.

KuCoin and MEXC are two well-known cryptocurrency exchanges included as part of the regulator's block request. This means installing the apps will no longer be possible, and existing users may not receive key updates.

While South Korea has an active crypto trading culture, its regulations require exchanges to report themselves as virtual asset operators and comply with local laws. Many crypto investors also use exchanges operating in South Korea to maximise their profits through the currency-related price differences observed on these platforms.

“In the future, in order to prevent money laundering risks and user damage, FIU will continue to block domestic access through mobile applications (apps) and internet sites of overseas unreported virtual asset operators through consultation with relevant organisations,” noted the regulator in its statement, highlighting dangers such as users being hacked.

South Korea's Financial Services Commission noted there were 28 virtual asset operators that were legally reported, and that users should check the status of their own crypto exchanges through the www.kofiu.go.kr website.

Apple has urgently removed 14 dangerous cryptocurrency trading applications from its App Store following concerns raised by the South Korean government regarding potential fraud and financial instability. This action mirrors a recent move by Google, which also delisted 17 similar apps from its Play Store. iPhone users who may have installed these applications are now at risk of having their personal information compromised and facing financial losses due to fraudulent investment schemes.


The removal of these apps was prompted by instructions from the South Korean Financial Service Commission (FSC), which has taken legal action against a total of 22 crypto platforms, including 17 foreign exchanges. The FSC stated that these applications were available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store without the necessary legal licenses to operate within South Korea. This lack of regulatory oversight posed a significant threat to investors.

Notably, many of the removed applications were already banned in India before this action. The list of prohibited apps includes prominent names such as Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, Bittrex, and Bitfinex. These platforms have been unavailable on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store in India due to regulatory concerns.

The South Korean FSC had issued a stark warning about the potential dangers associated with these unlicensed crypto platforms. The regulatory body highlighted the significant risk of investors' personal information being leaked. Furthermore, there were serious concerns about the security of investments made through these apps, with the possibility of funds being lost due to the lack of government protection and oversight. The FSC also pointed out the absence of adequate anti-money laundering management and supervision, raising fears of illicit financial activities.

Following the regulatory instructions from South Korea, Apple has now removed 14 foreign crypto exchange apps from its App Store. These include:

And others (total of 14)


iPhone users who have installed any of these applications are strongly advised to remove them immediately to mitigate the risk of fraud, data breaches, and potential financial losses. 

The removal from the App Store signifies the inherent dangers associated with these unlicensed platforms.

The first quarter of 2025 was a reality check for digital assets. While the year began with optimism fueled by the election of a pro-crypto U.S. president and expectations of a friendlier regulatory environment, macroeconomic challenges quickly came to dominate the narrative. Bitcoin briefly reached a new all-time high of $109,356 before ending the quarter down 11.6%, its second-largest quarterly decline since Q2 2022. Altcoins fared worse, with indices more heavily weighted toward smaller-cap tokens such as the CoinDesk Memecoin Index (CDMEME) and the CoinDesk 80 (CD80) declining by 55.2% and 46.4%, respectively.

Beneath the surface, a more fundamental shift is playing out. The gap between bitcoin and the rest of the market continues to widen, driven in large part by institutional behavior. As outlined in our latest Digital Assets Quarterly Report, institutions are playing an increasingly decisive role in shaping capital flows, preferring liquid and regulated large-cap assets. This shift is pushing the digital asset market toward more structured, benchmark-driven strategies.

One of the clearest signs of this realignment comes from bitcoin dominance, which expresses bitcoin's total market capitalization as a percentage of the market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies combined. This figure rose to 62.2% in Q1, its highest level since February 2021. Notably, this increase occurred despite a 26.9% drop in bitcoin's total market capitalization from its January peak. Our latest chart of the week highlights this trend, showing how capital rotated out of speculative assets and into bitcoin as macro volatility and geopolitical uncertainty mounted.

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has emerged as a useful lens for tracking this institutional shift. While the index fell 23.2% in Q1, it significantly outperformed most major digital assets. XRP was the only CD20 constituent to post a positive return, rising 0.4% in the quarter, driven by the dismissal of the SEC's case against Ripple, as well as strong growth in its RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD's market cap surged 323% in Q1 to reach $245 million, while cumulative trading volumes exceeded $10 billion in just over three months.

By contrast, ether fell 45.3% — underperforming most major assets amid continued migration of user activity to Layer 2s and a lack of positive catalysts. U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw net outflows of $228 million in Q1, compared to net inflows of over $1 billion for bitcoin ETFs. The ETH/BTC ratio declined to 0.022, its lowest level since May 2020, reinforcing the shift in relative dominance this cycle.

Bitcoin's broader role as a macro asset also continued to gain traction. In addition to strong ETF flows, public companies added nearly 100,000 BTC to their holdings in Q1, representing a 34.7% increase. This brought the total held by such companies to 689,059 BTC — equivalent to more than $56.4 billion at current prices. The launch of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, along with the introduction of a broader Digital Asset Stockpile by the Treasury, further underscored bitcoin's growing legitimacy within U.S. policy.

Looking to Q2, the tone in markets has improved following the recent pause in new tariff measures. Risk assets responded favorably, and altcoin ETF optimism remains high. Nearly 40 spot ETF applications for altcoins were submitted in Q1 alone, led by those for Solana and XRP, which each had eight filings. Other assets applying for spot ETFs included Litecoin, Dogecoin and Polkadot. With Solana futures now live on the CME, the precedent for institutional-grade altcoin exposure continues to build.

The first quarter offered a reminder that digital assets are no longer moving in isolation. As macro conditions evolve and policy shifts begin to reshape the regulatory environment, capital is consolidating into assets with deeper liquidity, stronger narratives and institutional relevance. Bitcoin's rising dominance, shifting ETF flows and the fragmentation of altcoin performance all point to a market recalibrating around structural factors rather than sentiment alone.

Resolv Labs, the firm behind the $450 million decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Resolv, has closed a $10 million seed round to expand its crypto-native yield platform and USR stablecoin, the team told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.

The investment round was led by Cyber.Fund and Maven11, with additional backing from Coinbase Ventures, SCB Limited, Arrington Capital, Gumi Cryptos, NoLimit Holdings, Robot Ventures, Animoca Ventures and others.

Stablecoins, a $230 billion and rapidly expanding class of cryptocurrencies with pegged prices to an external asset, are capturing attention well beyond their traditional use in payments and trading. A growing cadre of crypto protocols offer yield-bearing stablecoins or ""synthetic dollars,"" wrapping diverse investment strategies into a digital token with a stable price and passing on part of the earnings to holders.

""I view stablecoins as the perfect rails for yield distribution,"" Ivan Kozlov, founder and CEO of Resolv, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""This may actually become larger than transaction stablecoins like [Tether's] USDT in the future.""

The most notable example of the trend is Ethena's $5 billion USDe token, which primarily pursues a delta-neutral position by holding cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH and SOL and simultaneously shorting equal size of perpetual futures, scooping up yield from funding rates.

Resolv also pursues a similar strategy: its USR token, anchored to $1, is a delta-neutral stablecoin designed to deliver stable yields from crypto markets, while shielding holders from sharp price swings.

The protocol achieves this by splitting risk between two layers, inspired by Kozlov's background in structured products in traditional finance. USR stablecoin holders sit in the less risky senior tranche earning stable but lower yields, with risk-tolerant investors in the protocol's insurance layer represented by the RLP token with floating price. This model, borrowed from structured finance, aims to make crypto yields more predictable without sacrificing decentralization, Kozlov explained.

Following its launch in September 2024, the protocol quickly ballooned to over $600 million in assets driven by attractive yields during the crypto rally after Donald Trump's election victory, DefiLlama data shows. However, as markets turned bearish and yields compressed, Resolv's total value locked (TVL) also slid around $450 million this month.

With the new capital raise, Resolv plans to expand its yield sources to include bitcoin (BTC)-based strategies and deepening its integrations with institutional digital asset managers, Kozlov said. The protocol also aims to expand to new blockchains, widening its reach beyond early crypto adopters.

Novel decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Neutrl aims to bring a hedge fund trade — once limited to sophisticated investors — to the masses in the form of a crypto token.



The protocol is launching its NUSD ""synthetic dollar"" token, designed to generate returns by arbitraging discounted altcoin deals in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, the team told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.



Neutrl also raised $5 million in seed funding led by digital asset private marketplace STIX and venture firm Accomplice. They were joined by Amber Group, SCB Limited, Figment Capital and Nascent alongside a range of crypto angel investors including Ethena founder Guy Young and derivatives trader Joshua Lim of Arbelos Markets, recently acquired by FalconX.



Neutrl is the latest entrant to the rapidly growing roster of protocols that offer hedge fund-like investment strategies wrapped into a token with a stable price, often called ""synthetic dollar."" $6 billion DeFi protocol Ethena spearheaded the trend, offering yield to token holders via holding spot cryptos and shorting perpetual futures, farming the funding rate.

Neutrl's structure is built around buying locked altcoins at discounts in private markets, then hedging exposure with perpetual futures. For example, a trader might acquire Solana's SOL or Avalanche's AVAX at a 20% discount from a foundation and simultaneously open a short position for the token. The return comes from the price gap, not market movement.



This is a popular hedge fund investment strategy producing high double-digit yields to sophisticated investors who don't want to take directional bets on crypto prices, Neutrl co-founder Behrin Naidoo explained in an interview.



But, instead of managing these trades manually, users can hold a single token—NUSD—that encapsulates the strategy, opening access to a broader set of investors, he said.



With a flood of altcoin unlocks over the next few years, Neutrl estimates that there's a $10 billion market for locked up tokens. This offers an attractive yield opportunity for investors, especially now when crypto yields in decentralized finance compressed to multi-year lows, Naidoo said.



The protocol is targeting to grow to $2 billion in assets in the two years, he added.

Eric Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump's second son, is set to appear at this year's Consensus conference to discuss his vision to reshape bitcoin mining in the United States.

Trump will talk about American Bitcoin, a new venture formed with Hut 8 where he serves as Chief Strategy Officer. 

""The launch of American Bitcoin represents a transformative moment for Bitcoin mining in North America,"" said Trump in a statement. “I am so proud to finally unveil our bold vision for this initiative, which we believe will become the world's largest and most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner.""

Launched on March 31, American Bitcoin said it aims to become the world's largest pure-play Bitcoin miner, targeting over 50 EH/s of mining capacity.Eric Trump is scheduled to speak on May 15 at Consensus 2025, which takes place in Toronto May 14-16.

Consensus, which is organized by CoinDesk, is known as the longest-running conference in the digital assets industry, with attendance regularly topping 15,000 people. This year's event will be at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in downtown Toronto.

American Bitcoin is one of several crypto ventures launched by the Trump family. Eric Trump also backs World Liberty Financial, a DeFi protocol and planned blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and trade stablecoins. In March, WLFI announced that it plans to launch its own stablecoin, USD1, with BitGo providing custody services.

In addition, Eric Trump is also an advisor to Metaplanet, the largest holder of bitcoin in Japan, which is following a Michael Saylor/Strategy-type bitcoin treasury model. He's also an advisor to Dominari Holdings, a wealth management firm, which in March disclosed that it had bought $2 million of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) shares.

Eric Trump told CNBC this month that the Trump Organization was drawn to crypto after being “debanked” by several financial groups during the Biden Administration. “It actually is what drove us toward cryptocurrency,” he said. 

“You realize that cryptocurrency was a lot faster, it was a lot more pragmatic, it was a lot more transparent, it was exponentially cheaper.”“At this point, I know almost everybody in the industry in some way, shape or form,” he told CNBC. “I fell in love with the industry, you know, a few years ago, and really dove head in.”

Eric Trump's crypto interventions haven't all been successful. In February, Trump tweeted it was a ""good time to add"" ether (ETH), which was trading around $2,700 at the time. At press time it is trading around $1,500.

Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion. Previously, he was editor-in-chief at BREAKER Magazine and a staff writer at Fast Company. He holds some ETH, BTC and LINK.

 “BitBonds” would allow the US to save money to refinance $14 trillion of debt even in a scenario where Bitcoin “goes to zero,” VanEck's Matthew Sigel said. 

VanEck's head of research has pitched a new type of US Treasury bond partially backed by Bitcoin to help refinance $14 trillion in US debt.

Matthew Sigel pitched the concept of “BitBonds” — US Treasury bonds with exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) — at the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Summit 2025 on April 15.

The new 10-year bonds would be composed of 90% traditional debt and 10% BTC exposure, Sigel said, appealing to both the Treasury and global investors.

Even in a scenario where Bitcoin “goes to zero,” BitBonds would allow the US to save money to refinance an estimated $14 trillion of debt that will mature in the next three years, he said.

“Interest rates are relatively high versus history. The Treasury must maintain continued investor demand for bonds, so they have to entice buyers,” Sigel said during the virtual event.

Meanwhile, bond investors want protection from US dollar inflation and asset inflation, which makes Bitcoin a good fit as a component of the bond, as the cryptocurrency has emerged as an inflation hedge.

With the proposed structure and a 10-year term, a BitBond would return a “$90 premium, along with whatever value that Bitcoin contains,” Sigel said, adding that investors would receive all the Bitcoin gains up to a maximum annualized yield to maturity of 4.5%.

“If Bitcoin gains are big enough to provide that above a 4.5% annualized yield, the government and the bond buyer split the remaining gains 50 over 50,” he said.

Compared to standard bonds, the proposed 10-year BitBonds would offer the investor substantial gains in a scenario where Bitcoin gains exceed the break-even rates, Sigel said.

A downside, however, is that Bitcoin must attain a “relatively high compound annual growth rate” on lower coupon rates in order for the investor to break even, he added.

From the government's perspective, if they were able to sell the bond at a coupon of 1%, the government would save money “even if Bitcoin goes to zero,” Sigel estimated, adding:

While the idea of crypto-backed government bonds is not new, Sigel's BitBond pitch follows a similar proposal by the Bitcoin Policy Institute in March.

The BPI estimated the program could generate potential interest savings of $70 billion annually and $700 billion over a 10-year term.

Treasury bonds are debt securities issued by the government to investors who loan money to the government in exchange for future payouts at a fixed interest rate.

 Bitcoin Policy Institute executive director Matthew Pines said that tariff earnings are “budget-neutral” and can be used by the US government to buy Bitcoin. 

A Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) executive floated a $1 million Bitcoin price scenario if the United States were to buy 1 million BTC. 

In a Bitcoin Magazine podcast, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, said that a 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by the US would have a massive impact on the price of the asset. 

“If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that's just a global seismic shock. [...] I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof,” Shapiro said. “I think we'd probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.”   

The discussion followed US President Donald Trump's March 7 executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile.

BPI executive director Matthew Pines said that other nations are watching how the US positions itself with Bitcoin before formulating their own strategies.

The executive added that holding more Bitcoin aligns with Trump's promise to make the US a Bitcoin superpower. 

“If Donald Trump wants to make good on his promise to be a Bitcoin superpower, that ultimately comes down to how much Bitcoin you have. This is a measure of how much the United States is making good on that rhetorical objective,” Pines said. 

Trump's executive order also directs the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral” strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin to expand the reserve without additional taxpayer burden.

On March 12, Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act to push US holdings above 1 million BTC.

Pines also suggested ways to acquire Bitcoin in a budget-neutral fashion. He floated the idea of using tariff revenues to buy Bitcoin and other potential ways for the US government to purchase more BTC. 

“Revenues that the government can use to acquire more Bitcoin would be things like tariff revenue or other fees that the government collects that are not tax-based fees,” Pines said. This could include royalties from oil and gas leases, sales of federal land, physical gold and other digital assets.

On April 2, Trump imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries through an executive order. The president's order also included reciprocal tariffs for countries that charge tariffs on US imports. However, the administration's evolving tariff policy has created ongoing market uncertainty.

 Italy's Minister of Economy and Finance Giancarlo Giorgetti said US stablecoins' appeal to Europeans should not be underestimated. 

Italy's minister of economy and finance warned that US stablecoin policies are more concerning than President Donald Trump's tariffs, citing the potential for these crypto assets to undermine the euro's dominance in cross-border payments.

Speaking at an event in Milan, Giancarlo Giorgetti said that while trade tariffs dominate headlines, new US policies on dollar-backed stablecoins present an “even more dangerous” threat to European financial stability, according to a Reuters report.

US stablecoins allow users to invest in a widely accepted method for cross-border payments without opening a US bank account, Giorgetti said. He warned that the growing appeal of US stablecoins to Europeans should not be underestimated. 

Giorgetti urged European Union lawmakers to take more steps to boost the euro's position as an international currency. He added that the digital euro under development by the European Central Bank (ECB) will be essential to minimize the need for Europeans to resort to foreign solutions. 

Presently, stablecoin regulation in the US remains fragmented. Instead of a unified framework, multiple agencies apply existing laws to regulate stablecoins. However, lawmakers are working to implement changes, with several pieces of stablecoin legislation progressing. 

On April 2, the US House Financial Services Committee passed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. The bill is now headed to the House floor for a full vote. 

The bill was introduced on Feb. 6 by Committee Chair French Hill and the Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil. It would ensure that stablecoin issuers provide information on their businesses, including how their tokens are backed. 

In addition, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes rules that require issuers to maintain reserves backed one-to-one, comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws, protect consumers and boost dollar dominance in the global economy. 

The GENIUS Act still requires approval by both chambers of Congress and a presidential signature before becoming law.

Apart from Giorgetti, ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone also urged European lawmakers to intensify their efforts to combat dollar-backed stablecoin dominance in Europe. On April 8, Cipollone wrote an article expressing concerns about the growing popularity of US stablecoins. 

The official suggested launching a central bank digital currency to combat this threat to the euro. He said this would aid in preserving the monetary sovereignty of the eurozone.

 Reuters reports local governments in China are using private companies to sell seized crypto, going against the country's trading ban. 

Local governments in China are reportedly seeking ways to offload seized crypto while facing challenges due to the country's ban on crypto trading and exchanges.

The absence of clear rules on how authorities should manage seized cryptocurrency has led to “inconsistent and opaque approaches,” which some lawyers fear could open the door to corruption, according to an April 16 report by Reuters.

Chinese local governments are using private companies to sell seized cryptocurrencies in offshore markets in exchange for cash to replenish public coffers, Reuters reported, citing transaction and court documents. 

The local governments reportedly held approximately 15,000 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $1.4 billion at the end of 2023, and the sales have been a significant source of income.

China holds an estimated 194,000 BTC worth approximately $16 billion and is the second largest nation Bitcoin holder behind the US, according to Bitbo. 

Zhongnan University of Economics and Law professor Chen Shi told Reuters that these sales are a “makeshift solution that, strictly speaking, is not fully in line with China's current ban on crypto trading.”

The issue has been exacerbated by a rise in crypto-related crime in China, ranging from online fraud to money laundering to illegal gambling. Additionally, the state sued more than 3,000 people involved in crypto-related money laundering in 2024. 

Shenzhen-based lawyer Guo Zhihao opined that the central bank is better positioned to deal with seized digital assets and should either sell them overseas or build a crypto reserve.

Ru Haiyang, co-CEO at Hong Kong crypto exchange HashKey, echoed the suggestion saying that China may want to keep forfeited Bitcoin as a strategic reserve as US President Donald Trump is doing.

Creating a crypto sovereign fund in Hong Kong, where crypto trading is legal, has also been proposed.

This issue has gained attention amid rising US-China trade tensions and Trump's plans to regulate stablecoins and foster growth and innovation in the crypto industry.

Several industry observers have suggested that China's tariff response could result in a devaluation of the local currency, which may result in a flight to crypto.

 Bitcoin “bullish sentiment” is starting to gain momentum as data shows buyers are starting to dominate volumes on Binance. 

Bullish sentiment could be returning to Bitcoin as a key metric from Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, shows that buyers are starting to dominate the platform's volumes.

The Binance Taker Buy Sell Ratio, which calculates the ratio of buyers to sellers of Bitcoin (BTC) in Binance, “has returned to neutral territory,” CryptoQuant contributor DarkFost said in an April 15 note.

The ratio currently stands at 1.008. When the ratio is higher than 1, buyers — usually a bullish sentiment indicator — dominate volumes, conversely, a ratio below 1 indicates that sellers, or bearish sentiment, are dominating.

Bitcoin is trading at $83,810 at the time of publication, down 1.47% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“Over the past few days, the ratio has been mostly positive, suggesting that bullish sentiment is picking up again on Binance's derivatives market,” Darkfost said. On April 14, when Bitcoin was above $86,000, the ratio was above 1.1. 

CoinGlass data shows that if Bitcoin reclaims $85,000, almost $637 million in short positions will be at risk of liquidation. Several key market indicators suggest that investors continue to favor Bitcoin over altcoins.

CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index is currently at 15 out of 100, signalling it is still very much “Bitcoin Season.” TradingView's Bitcoin Dominance Chart shows the asset's market share is sitting at 63.81%, up 9.82% so far this year.

Overall, crypto market participants are still appearing to feel hesitant. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows the overall market sentiment on April 16 is in “Fear” with a score of 29 out of 100.

Some analysts, including DeFiDaniel, commented that Bitcoin's recent price action is “so boring.” 

However, Cointelegraph earlier reported that Bitcoin apparent demand is on a recovery path, but it is not net positive yet. Historically, 30-day apparent demand can move sideways for a prolonged period after Bitcoin reaches a local bottom, leading to its price chopping sideways.

Analysts have differing views over where Bitcoin is going to go next.

Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts told Cointelegraph in late March that “the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge — potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.” 

AnchorWatch CEO Rob Hamilton said in an April 15 X post that Bitcoin's price “is flat for the day because we are in an epic tug of war between people who are selling Bitcoin to pay their taxes and people using their refunds to buy Bitcoin.” The tax deadline in the US was April 15.

Alan Turing's Lost Work Could Reveal How Tigers Got Their Stripes

The world-famous mathematician Alan Turing found a possible mechanism for iconic animal patterns thanks to differential equations

Today mathematician Alan Turing is world-famous because he helped the Allies achieve victory against the Axis powers by deciphering an encryption that was considered unbreakable. That story inspired the 2014film The Imitation Game. Turing's cryptographic work remained under wraps until the 1970s, however, so his incredible achievements only became known after his death.

During his lifetime, Turing was known among certain experts. He developed the mathematical model of a computer and explained which mathematical quantities it could calculate—and which tasks would exceed even the most sophisticated algorithms. He is also well known for a test that he developed, later named after him, that assesses how “human” artificial intelligence appears to be. For instance, if people cannot tell whether they are chatting to a real person or an AI, then the machine has passed the Turing test.

The list of Turing's scientific contributions is long. But one area of his research is rarely mentioned: his work on mathematical biology that dealt with the formation of patterns. He was interested in the question of how animals develop their impressive stripes and spots, and he was convinced that there must be a mechanism by which pigments in skin cells arrange themselves into these patterns.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

When I first heard about this, I was puzzled. One of my physics professors mentioned a link between abstract mathematical operators and a tiger's stripes in a first-semester lecture, a connection that made me and my fellow students laugh rather than think. After all, what could the pattern of a tiger's skin have to do with abstract mathematics? Until then, I had assumed that some complex biochemical processes led to the tiger's impressive patterns of dots and stripes—not something that could be represented by a tensor (a kind of high-dimensional table).

I now realize that I lacked Turing's imagination. According to his mother, even as a child, he was a dreamer who marveled at the natural world around him. He wanted to understand his surroundings. Mathematics lent itself as a language to reduce even the most complex relationships to the essentials. And so Turing found a very simple mechanism that could explain nature's patterns.

To understand Turing's ideas, you first need a little biological background. A tiger's coat pattern is already determined before it is born. In the embryo, pigment-producing cells emerge at the point where the spinal column will later develop. From there, they migrate through the entire body. Although research into these cells was lacking in Turing's time, he recognized that there was a developmental process that formed skin patterns, and he wanted to find out how this occurred.

It was impossible to model all the interacting molecules of an animal embryo. Moreover, Turing was not an expert in biochemistry. Therefore, as is usual for mathematicians, he started with a very simple model. He investigated how two different pigment-producing molecules, which he generally called morphogens, spread from cell to cell.

Let's assume that one morphogen is responsible for the color black and another for orange. The more black or orange morphogens there are, the more of these molecules are generally produced. In addition, these two substances influence each other: the orange morphogens can inhibit the production of the black ones.

Such an interplay is often found in ecology. For example, the black morphogens can be thought of as hares, which reproduce rapidly and thus attract foxes (the orange morphogens). The foxes, however, eat the hares and thus limit their population.

This complex interaction can lead to a variety of situations. Sometimes small colonies of hares are kept in check by different foxes in the area. Translating that example to morphogens, one can imagine how a dotlike pattern similar to a cheetah's fur could reflect that one morphogen has limited the spread of another.

Turing did not use the fox-and-hare visualization when he described how morphogens could move through an embryo's cells, but he did take into account the phenomenon of diffusion. If a cell harbors many black morphogens, for example, and a neighboring cell harbors few of them, then the molecules strive to move such that they are distributed as evenly as possible.

All of these processes can be described by so-called differential equations. These equations contain one or more derivatives and can indicate how the number of morphogens per cell changes. Turing used the equations to investigate how two morphogens spread in the cells and what distribution occurs in the end. In doing so, he was able to adjust several parameters. To put this in terms of our animal analogy: How many foxes and hares are there at the beginning? How quickly do the hares reproduce, and how many foxes do they attract? How quickly do they spread? How are the cells arranged through which the molecules migrate? All these factors influence the pattern that emerges at the end.

When Turing investigated this problem, he did not have a powerful computer at his disposal and had to carry out many of the calculations by hand. He solved the differential equations, and he recorded how the two morphogens were ultimately distributed in the cells and observed how patterns emerged. In some cases, there were stripes; in others, he found dots or sometimes spots similar to those on cows. (If you would also like to experiment with the Turing mechanism but don't feel like doing lengthy calculations, here is a simulator.)

As Turing discovered, the type of pattern depends on the arrangement of cells. Stripes tend to form in smaller, elongated structures, while dots form on large surfaces. Many years later British mathematical biologist James Murray applied Turing's idea to big cats. A grown tiger is not a small animal. But, per Turing's theory, the cat's patterning indicates that the distribution of morphogens takes place at a time when the tiger embryo is still very small. The situation is different in leopards. And both effects can be seen in cheetahs: their body is spotted, but their tail is striped.

Unfortunately, this work by Turing attracted little attention during his lifetime. Shortly after he published his research in 1952, the discovery of the DNA's double-helix structure overshadowed everything else. It took about 20 years for biologists to rediscover Turing's work, inspiring a new generation to test whether the Turing mechanism really does occur in nature. But the technologies required have only been available since the 2000s.

To prove Turing's hypothesis, the corresponding morphogens must be identified in animals. Although this is not easy, a few cases are now known. For example, scientists identified two proteins in mice that produce the striped structure of their palate, and the arrangement of the animals' hair follicles appears to be influenced by two other proteins. In the same way, the coloration of zebra fish is probably caused by the Turing mechanism, but it involves a complex interaction of three rather than two morphogens. These examples show that Turing's ideas are not limited to color patterns but also apply to other structures.

And what about the tiger and its stripes? To date, morphogens have been most clearly detected in mice, which are much easier to study in the lab. But hopefully a future scientific strategy can be found to prove Turing's mechanism beyond a doubt in big cats as well.

Metrics details

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with a considerable health and economic burden1. It is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a diminished response to symptomatic medical or surgical therapy as the disease progresses2. Cell therapy aims to replenish lost dopaminergic neurons and their striatal projections by intrastriatal grafting. Here, we report the results of an open-label phase I clinical trial (NCT04802733) of an investigational cryopreserved, off-the-shelf dopaminergic neuron progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and grafted bilaterally into the putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease. Twelve patients were enrolled sequentially in two cohorts—a low-dose (0.9 million cells, n = 5) and a high-dose (2.7 million cells, n = 7) cohort—and all of the participants received one year of immunosuppression. The trial achieved its primary objectives of safety and tolerability one year after transplantation, with no adverse events related to the cell product. At 18 months after grafting, putaminal 18Fluoro-DOPA positron emission tomography uptake increased, indicating graft survival. Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes showed improvement or stability, including improvement in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III OFF scores by an average of 23 points in the high-dose cohort. There were no graft-induced dyskinesias. These data demonstrate safety and support future definitive clinical studies.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a marked, progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and their striatal projections. Motor features include bradykinesia with rigidity and/or resting tremor2,3,4; non-motor manifestations are wide-ranging and include autonomic, psychiatric, sleep and other symptoms that contribute to a decline in quality of life4,5. The global burden of PD is projected to exceed 14 million people by 20401. Medical therapies for PD focus on augmenting striatal dopamine receptor stimulation or acting on other transmitter pathways, such as acetylcholine6,7 or adenosine8. Surgical therapies include deep brain stimulation, which can improve motor symptoms9, and magnetic-resonance-guided focused ultrasound ablation, which can be effective for tremor and other motor features10,11. Experimental approaches under investigation include the use of anti-synuclein antibodies12,13, GLP1 receptor agonists14,15 and gene therapies16,17 aimed at neuroprotection, enhancing dopamine function or potential disease modification. Levodopa remains the cornerstone therapy but is associated with the gradual development of complications such as dyskinesias, a narrowing therapeutic window, off-target effects and exacerbation of non-motor symptoms2,18. While these therapies have an important role in symptom alleviation in the early stages, their efficacy inevitably wanes due to ongoing attrition of dopaminergic neurons, often accompanied by unwanted side effects such as dyskinesias. By delivering new midbrain neurons to the striatum, cell therapy aims to replace the degenerated dopaminergic projections and to achieve a sustained clinical improvement in motor symptoms.

Open-label studies of fetal ventral midbrain tissue grafts in the striatum showed some promising results19,20,21,22,23,24 but were not replicated in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials25,26. The latter trials faced multiple challenges in tissue access, and used variable clinical design, surgical strategies and immunosuppression approaches. They also reported relatively high rates of graft-induced dyskinesia, possibly mediated by serotonergic neuron contaminants27. In other long-term follow-up studies, a subgroup of patients experienced sustained clinical benefit after grafting, including independence of dopaminergic (DA) medical therapy28, with reports demonstrating long-term graft survival and striatal DA innervation after brain autopsy at 14 years29 and 24 years after surgery30. The lessons learned from these studies suggest a potentially substantial clinical benefit for cell therapy in PD; however, these studies also highlighted the need for a scalable cell source of midbrain DA neurons, compatible with stringent quality-control assessments and lacking unwanted cellular contaminants. Over the following two decades, an intense effort ensued across the globe to identify a renewable source of human midbrain DA neurons from pluripotent stem cells (such as hES cells or human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) that is suitable for clinical use.

We have previously established a protocol for the derivation of midbrain DA neurons from hES cells31. PS cells are exposed to a carefully determined sequence and combination of patterning factors to undergo directed differentiation into midbrain DA neurons through a floor-plate intermediate stage. The resulting floor-plate-derived DA neurons show transcriptional, biochemical and physiological features of authentic midbrain DA neurons, and exhibit robust cell survival and function when grafted in mouse, rat and rhesus monkey models of Parkinson's disease31. Optogenetic studies in grafted rodents demonstrated that functional improvement is dependent on graft neuronal activity and dopamine release and that the transplanted DA neurons functionally integrate with host striatal neurons32. The protocol was subsequently adapted to GMP-compatible conditions and large-scale cell manufacturing33. Stringent release criteria confirmed midbrain DA neuron identity and the absence of remaining pluripotent stem cells as well as other concerning contaminants such as serotonergic neurons and choroid plexus cells. Cryopreservation was also developed, and four lots comprising around 10 billion cells in total were produced. Investigational New Device (IND)-enabling studies, including tumorigenicity, toxicity and biodistribution confirmed safety, as well as efficacy in reversing rotational behaviour in murine models of PD. Detailed preclinical data were published in 202133,34. The same cryopreserved cell product tested here, named bemdaneprocel (formerly MSK-DA01), was then used in the clinical trial.

We conducted a first-in-human, multisite, open-label phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerability of bemdaneprocel in people with PD (NCT04802733). The full eligibility and exclusion criteria are listed in Supplementary Table 1; patients with cognitive impairment (defined by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of <26) or with dyskinesia (AIMS rating scale > 2) were excluded. The study included two cohorts: low-dose cohort A (0.9 million cells per putamen) and high-dose cohort B (2.7 million cells per putamen) (Fig. 1). Enrolment occurred sequentially, first into the low-dose cohort, then into the high-dose cohort after a 30-day pause for evaluation by the data safety monitoring committee. There were two surgical sites (New York, n = 9) and Toronto (n = 3) and three screening and follow-up sites (New York, Irvine and Toronto), depending on patient location of residence. The cell doses for injection were selected on the basis of the desired number of surviving DA neurons, and the measured survival rate of DA neurons in our IND-enabling studies, which were performed with the same lot of cells nominated for clinical use. The high dose targets the estimated number of healthy DA neurons in the intact substantia nigra35 (300,000 DA neurons), and the lower dose targets the estimated minimal number of surviving grafted DA neurons required for clinical benefit36 (100,000 DA neurons). The patients underwent a series of clinical assessments and rating scales, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18Fluoro-DOPA (18F-DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging at the baseline and at regular intervals after grafting (Fig. 1).

Summary of the study design. Patients were enrolled sequentially into a low-dose then a high-dose cohort. The diagram indicates the timeline of immunosuppression, monthly laboratory and clinical assessments, and imaging studies throughout the study. Ongoing follow-up is anticipated for a minimum of 5 years.

The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability at 1 year after transplantation. Secondary objectives included the feasibility of stereotactic transplantation; survival of transplanted cells by 18F-DOPA uptake on PET imaging; motor effects measured using MDS-UPDRS Part III OFF scores37 and good ON times (without dyskinesia and with non-troublesome dyskinesia) based on adjusted PD diaries8; and continued safety and tolerability on the basis of the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (Supplementary Table 2). Exploratory outcomes included OFF time, ON times with troublesome dyskinesias, the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS), use of antiparkinsonian medications, the Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS) and the patient-reported outcome on the basis of the PDQ-39 questionnaire. All safety data from all of the participants were used to conduct the formal analysis of the primary end point at 1 year after transplantation. Secondary and exploratory end points were also assessed at 1 year and 18 months after transplantation. No tests of statistical significance were performed due to the small number of participants.

Vials containing cryopreserved cells were thawed under aseptic conditions and suspended in transplantation medium, and the live-cell concentration was adjusted to 100,000 ± 10,000 cells per µl (ref. 34). Cells were loaded into a modified cannula (Smart Flow, Clearpoint Neuro), and administered stereotactically during a single surgical session under general anaesthesia. Cells were delivered into the post-commissural putamen bilaterally through a single burr hole on each side. In total, nine cell deposits were made in each putamen (three passes of the cannula; three deposits per pass). Surgery was performed using a frameless MRI-guided approach with intraoperative imaging at one site (New York) and a frame-based stereotactic approach at the other site (Toronto).

To prevent graft rejection, a short-term immunosuppressive regimen similar to that used for solid organ transplantation38,39 was initiated perioperatively and continued for 1 year. The participants received basiliximab 20 mg intravenously intraoperatively and postoperatively on day 4; methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously immediately before surgery then tapered to oral prednisone 5 mg daily and continued for 1 year; and tacrolimus taken orally beginning on the day after surgery (day 1) and then adjusted to a target trough blood level of 4 to 7 ng ml−1 for a period of 1 year.

In total, 12 participants were sequentially enrolled into the low-dose (n = 5) or high-dose (n = 7) cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1). The participants had a median age of 67.0 and 75% were male, with a median time since diagnosis of 9 years (Supplementary Table 3). All of the participants remain engaged in the clinical follow-up.

Predefined safety criteria for the primary outcome were satisfied at 12 months of follow-up after transplantation (Table 1). There were two SAEs reported: one participant in the low-dose cohort was hospitalized overnight with COVID-19 approximately 2 months after the surgery and one participant in the high-dose cohort experienced a single seizure attributed to the surgical procedure within 24 h of surgery that prolonged hospitalization by 1 day. The participant received levetiracetam for 2 months with no recurrence of seizure during or after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant. There were no deaths, no SAEs related to transplanted cells or immunosuppression, and there were no tumours, abnormal tissue overgrowth or intracerebral haemorrhages detected with MRI, which showed the expected postoperative changes (Extended Data Fig. 2).

In addition to the two SAEs reported in the 12-month post-transplantation analysis, an SAE of gastrointestinal haemorrhage requiring hospitalization was reported approximately 15 months after surgery, 3 months after discontinuation of prednisone. This was assessed as unrelated to the study procedures and was subsequently resolved.

Through 18 months after transplantation, there were 78 cumulative treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), described in Extended Data Tables 1–5. Most were mild or moderate in severity except for one fall that was deemed to be unrelated to treatment. No TEAEs were related to bemdaneprocel. MRI imaging by 18 months did not show evidence of tumours or changes in the putaminal volume. Notably, there were no reports of adverse events or clinical indications of graft-induced dyskinesias (GIDs) to date. Transplant feasibility was achieved, with intraoperative delivery of the total number of all intended cell deposits in all of the participants.

The two main secondary clinical readouts were MDS-UPDRS Part III OFF and changes in the number of waking hours in the ON state. A brief description of rating scales is provided in Supplementary Note 1. At 18 months after transplantation, the MDS-UPDRS Part III showed improvement in the OFF state with a decrease in mean (s.d.) of 8.6 points (29.2) from the baseline to 34.6 (9.2) in the low-dose cohort, and a mean decrease of 23.0 points (7.9) from the baseline to 25.2 (8.7) in the high-dose cohort (Fig. 2a,b). The mean good ON times, based on adjusted PD diaries, increased by 0.2 h (3.8 h) from the baseline to 12.3 h (3.2 h) in the low-dose cohort and by 2.7 h (1.6 h) from the baseline to 13.6 h (1.9 h) in the high-dose cohort (Fig. 2c,d). Among the exploratory end points (Fig. 2e–h), MDS-UPDRS Part III ON scores also improved with a decrease in the mean (s.d.) of 7.6 points (15.3) from the baseline to 13.4 (7.3) in the low-dose cohort and of 8.4 points (5.6) from the baseline to 15.9 (8.9) in the high-dose cohort (Fig. 2e). The mean (s.d.) OFF times, based on adjusted PD diaries, decreased by 0.8 h (3.3 h) from the baseline to 2.5 h (3.1 h) in the low-dose cohort and decreased by 2.7 h (1.8 h) from the baseline to 2.3 h (1.9 h) in the high-dose cohort (Fig. 2f). MDS-UPDRS Part II scores increased by a mean (s.d.) of 2.4 points (2.6) from the baseline to 13.2 (3.6) in the low-dose cohort and decreased by 2.7 points (5.2) from the baseline to 10.0 (4.6) in the high-dose cohort (Fig. 2g). The mean (s.d.) PDQ-39 summary index scores increased (worsened) by 0.4 points (7.4) from the baseline to 25.4 (6.8) in the low-dose cohort and decreased (improved) by 4.2 points (8.2) from the baseline to 10.9 (8.7) in the high-dose cohort (Extended Data Table 6). Across the total study population, ON times with troublesome dyskinesias (Extended Data Table 7) and use of antiparkinsonian medications were similar to the baseline (Extended Data Table 8). UDysRS scores were similar to the baseline in both cohorts (Fig. 2h). The NMSS scores varied across domains, with total scores trending towards stability in the high-dose cohort (Extended Data Table 9).

Bold lines are mean ± s.d.; exact values are given as mean (s.d.) beneath each data point. e–h, Exploratory end points: individual scores on MDS-UPDRS Part III ON (e), Adjusted PD diary OFF time (f), MDS-UPDRS Part II (g) and UDysRS objective subscore (h) at the baseline and at different timepoints after transplantation in the low- and high-dose cohorts. Bold lines are mean ± s.d. The baseline value (0 months) is defined as the last recorded value before surgery. The double dagger symbol (‡) indicates the exception that, for MDS-UPDRS Part III OFF at 18 months after transplantation, n = 6. The total possible score for the MDS-UPDRS Part III scale is 132, for the MDS-UPDRS Part II scale is 52 and for the UDysRS objective scale is 44. Good ON time is the sum of ON time without dyskinesia and ON time with non-troublesome dyskinesia.

Source data

We performed serial 18F-DOPA PET imaging studies to obtain evidence of DA graft survival, a key secondary imaging-based end point. Quantitative analysis using the volume of interest (VOI) method revealed an increase in the mean uptake across the low- and high-dose cohorts bilaterally in the putamen, and stable to decreased uptake in the caudate. Uptake datapoints are shown for each individual patient in both cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 3). An image of the mean 18F-DOPA uptake signal is shown for the entire group (Fig. 3) and for the low- and high-dose cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 4) across multiple slices through the striatum. Individual patient data are also provided as source data. These data support DA neuron survival through the 18-month post-transplantation timepoint, 6 months after discontinuation of immunosuppression.

Images of the 18F-DOPA PET uptake signal at multiple sections through the striatum, presented as the mean uptake of all patients (n = 12 at all timepoints except at 18 months, for which n = 11). Images of 18F-DOPA uptake were produced by dividing each original PET image by the occipital count and then subtracting 1. Formula: image of 18F-DOPA uptake = (PET image/occipital count − 1).

In this first-in-human phase I trial, bilateral putaminal transplantation of bemdaneprocel, a hES cell-derived DA neuron progenitor cell product, was generally well tolerated and achieved predefined safety criteria at 12 months as a primary end point. Safety data through 18  months continued to indicate a favourable safety profile. The treatment process, including surgery and immunosuppression, was generally well tolerated. A high incidence of GID was reported in two randomized controlled trials25,26 of fetal ventral mesencephalic transplants (56% (n = 13 out of 23) and 15% (n = 5 out of 33) of grafted participants). This was a serious complication and was considered one of the major drawbacks of cell therapy at the time. The absence of GID in our study through 18 months is therefore particularly notable. This may relate to the lack of serotonergic neuron contaminants in bemdaneprocel, as preclinical studies confirmed the absence of serotonergic neurons in vitro and in vivo at 9 months after grafting34. Longer-term clinical and imaging follow-up is ongoing to monitor for the possibility of delayed onset GIDs or other adverse events.

Although this phase I study is not designed nor powered for determining efficacy, there is nonetheless a possibility of improvement in the key secondary outcomes, including the MDS-UPDRS OFF motor scores, reflecting improved motor function without the benefit of anti-Parkinsonian medication. This scale was selected as an outcome measure as it is the most widely used PD scale; it is well validated with high inter-rater reliability, and is sensitive to clinical changes40. Our data show a mean change of 8.6 points in the low-dose cohort and 23 points in the high-dose cohort, consistent with a moderate and large ‘clinically important difference' in motor scores41, respectively. Coupled with the stabilization or possible improvement in other secondary and exploratory motor, non-motor and quality-of-life outcomes, the data suggest a promise for potential clinical benefit. However, these data need to be interpreted cautiously in view of the open-label study design, the small patient cohort, the relatively short observation period, the expected fluctuations in PD symptoms and the possibility of placebo effects, which can be substantial in studies of PD. Longer-term and larger studies are required to more rigorously evaluate the safety and efficacy of this cell therapy for PD. The clinical data also show a greater amplitude of changes in UPDRS motor scores and reduction in OFF times, and an earlier onset of improvement, in the high-dose group.

Establishing an optimal cell dose involves multiple considerations. While the grafted DA neuron progenitors are expected to become post-mitotic and mature without obvious in vivo expansion, as confirmed in preclinical studies, the rates of progressive graft maturation and functional integration within the host tissue are unknown42. Another unknown factor is the impact of the ongoing disease on the graft itself. Fetal grafting studies showed evidence of Lewy body formation within the graft; however, such disease transmission occurred only in later stages (more than a decade) after transplantation and affected only a minority of grafted DA neurons43,44. Nevertheless, the precise kinetics of hES cell-derived midbrain DA neuron maturation in grafts and their relative disease vulnerability remains unclear, which complicates the dose-finding process.

An encouraging finding in our study was the evidence of likely graft survival on the basis of 18F-DOPA PET, 6 months after cessation of immunosuppression. However, PET data should be interpreted cautiously owing to limitations in the resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and variability across and within patients as well as between the low- and high-dose cohorts. Furthermore, the correlation between 18F-DOPA PET uptake and clinical performance can be variable, and graft survival alone is not sufficient to predict long-term patient benefit. In past fetal allograft studies, the dosing, duration and type of immunosuppression was inconsistent.25,26,45. Data from one of the two randomized clinical trials suggested a potential decline in clinical function after discontinuation of immunosuppression25, yet autopsy reports in other studies demonstrated graft survival many years after surgery and discontinuation of immunosuppression. Our results suggest that the dosing and duration of immunosuppression were sufficient, well-tolerated and protected cell survival and function; longer-term follow-up data will be critical to confirm these findings. An alternative strategy to overcome graft rejection could lie in the use of an autologous iPS-cell-based DA-neuron-grafting approach. An initial single case report has been described to demonstrate feasibility46. However, consistently manufacturing and releasing an autologous product poses new challenges, and the possibility exists that the autologous nature of the cells may entail an increased risk of genetic susceptibility to develop disease. Thus, the feasibility of allografting without long-term immunosuppression, coupled with cryopreservation, offers an off-the-shelf approach33,47 that could facilitate the broader application of this therapy in the future.

Finally, our findings should be interpreted carefully within the context of a small and unblinded safety and tolerability study that achieved its primary outcome and was not designed to evaluate efficacy based on clinical outcomes. Despite this, the possible improvement in PD symptoms at 18 months after transplantation may translate in future trials to an important finding. There are currently several ES-cell- or iPS-cell-based grafting studies that are ongoing or close to initiation in the US, Asia and Europe, highlighting considerable enthusiasm for cell therapy for PD. These studies will probably differ in many aspects, including autologous versus allografts, cell dosing, patient selection, immunosuppression, surgical strategies and other criteria; they will therefore provide valuable insights into future study design and the value of cell grafting in PD. Taken together, our data support moving towards larger definitive clinical studies.

In brief, master banks of undifferentiated WA09 (H9) cells (passage 28) were obtained from the WiCell Research Institute. The cells were manufactured under cGMP conditions to establish working cell banks that were further certified by Waisman Biomanufacturing. The cells passed a battery of tests including cell authentication by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, karyotype and marker expression, as well as testing for adventitious viruses and mycoplasma. The full protocol is described in a previous publication34. cGMP manufacturing of MSK-DA01 cells, which were differentiated from hES cells (WA09 at passage 33), was performed at the Cell Therapy and Cell Engineering Facility (CTCEF) at MSKCC. WA09 cells were thawed and expanded on Geltrex coated flasks/dishes in Essential 8 basal medium with supplement for 10–14 days. Cells were split by Dispase (Stem cell Technologies) every 3–5 days at a ratio usually between 1:4 and 1:6. For MSK-DA01 differentiation, single cells WA09 were washed and plated on Geltrex at 400,000 cells per cm2 in Neurobasal medium with N2 and B27 (without vitamin A) containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 10 µM SB431542, 250 nM LDN193189 (LDN), 0.7 µM CHIR99021 and 500 ng ml−1 SHH with 10 µM Y-27632. The medium was replaced daily thereafter without adding Y-27632. On day 4, 7.5 µM CHIR99021 was added. The same medium was replaced on day 6. On day 7 SB, LDN and SHH were withdrawn from the medium. The same medium was changed on day 9. On day 10, Neurobasal medium (with B27) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 20 ng ml−1 BDNF, 20 ng ml−1 GDNF, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 500 µM dibutyryl-cAMP, 1 ng ml−1 TGFβ3 and 3 µM CHIR99021 was added. On day 11, cells were dissociated to single cells with Accutase for 30–40 min and replated on plates coated with poly-ornithine (15 µg ml−1, Sigma Aldrich), fibronectin (1 µg ml−1, Akron Biotech) and laminin (2 µg ml−1, Trevigen) at 800,000 cells per cm2 using the same medium as on day 10. On day 12, the medium was switched to include 10 µM DAPT and CHIR99021 was withdrawn. Complete medium changes were performed daily until collection at day 16. At day 16 of differentiation, MSK-DA01 cells were dissociated with Accutase for 30–40 min and filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer. The cell pellets were resuspended at a cell density of 8 million cells per ml of STEM-CELLBANKER and placed in a controlled-rate freezer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for cryopreservation. Cryopreserved vials were stored in the secured GMP Facility freezer and monitored 24/7 by a Datatron system.

This trial included two cohorts: a low-dose (cohort A; 0.9 million cells per putamen) and a high-dose (cohort B; 2.7 million cells per putamen) cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1). Enrolment occurred sequentially, first into the low-dose cohort, then into the high-dose cohort after a 30-day pause for evaluation by the data safety monitoring committee. The eligible participants (Supplementary Table 1) were aged at least 50 to 78 years (Canada) or at least 60 to 78 years (United States) with a confirmed diagnosis of PD for 3 to 20 years before screening and Hoehn–Yahr ON score of 0 to 3 (Canada) or ON score of 0 to 2 and OFF score of 3 to 4 (United States). The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the protocol, which is provided in the Supplementary Information.

The participants attended screening, baseline and preoperative visits before surgery. After transplantation, the participants underwent a postoperative evaluation on day 10. A battery of questionnaires and clinical rating scales were administered during site visits throughout the study, with a total follow-up of 5 years after transplantation; the participants completed PD diaries at home before each visit, and adverse events were assessed throughout the trial.

According to the protocol, the primary end point was the incidence of SAEs. Safety success criteria were defined as: two or fewer participants in either cohort developing two or more SAEs related to surgery, the presence of transplanted cells or immunosuppression; two or fewer participants in either cohort developing a tumour or abnormal tissue overgrowth related to the presence of transplanted cells; two or fewer participants in either cohort developing an intracerebral haemorrhage that was deemed to be life threatening; and one or zero deaths in either cohort. Secondary objectives (Supplementary Table 2) included the feasibility of stereotactic transplantation; survival of transplanted cells by 18F-DOPA uptake on PET imaging; motor effects measured by Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III OFF scores and adjusted PD diary good ON times (the sum of ON time without dyskinesia and ON time with non-troublesome dyskinesia); and safety and tolerability by the incidence of SAEs and adverse events.

18F-DOPA PET studies and analysis were performed at a single imaging site by investigators blinded to clinical and dose information.

The participants underwent three-dimensional PET imaging at the baseline, and at 12 and 18 months after transplantation. Images were acquired on a high-resolution, high-sensitivity PET tomograph (GE Discovery IQ-5 ring PET/CT Scanner, General Electric Medical Systems; parameters: full-width-at-half-maximum = 5 mm, axial field of view = 26 cm, slice thickness = 3.3 mm, 79 slices). Acquisition began approximately 80 to 100 min after a 5.0 mCi intravenous injection of 18F-DOPA. The participants paused antiparkinsonian medication 12 h before scanning and were given 150 mg of carbidopa orally within 120 min before 18F-DOPA injection in accordance with FDA prescribing information. 18F-FDOPA PET image reconstruction used the VUEPointHD ViP (VPHD) method, a 3D iterative OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization) algorithm with 4 iterations and 12 subsets after corrections for attenuation and scatter. The image resolution was approximately 5 mm in all directions.

We created a priori group mean of striatal to occipital ratio (SOR-1) images computed for each timepoint, as well as a priori VOI-based analyses. The SOR-1 images (Fig. 3) were derived to provide an anatomical visualization of potential change in group mean18F-DOPA uptake signal over the striatum across the timepoints. The VOI-based analyses were performed to provide group × time quantification of 18F-DOPA uptake signal within prespecified regions within the striatum (that is, posterior putamen, surgical target region of implanted cells; caudate, control region, no implanted cells).

18F-DOPA PET images for each participant were realigned across individual time frames and then registered together to the high-resolution T1 structural MRI scan (see below) using SPM12 software (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The registered PET images were converted into volumetric maps of specific 18F-DOPA uptake defined by (image/occipital counts − 1; SOR-1), with the occipital cortex used as a reference. The SOR-1 images of 18F-DOPA uptake before and after treatment were spatially normalized into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute anatomic space (https://mcin.ca/research/neuroimaging-methods/atlases). The group mean for the entire cohort was then produced from these images at each timepoint and displayed using the SOR-1 scale reported in the main text (Fig. 3).

18F-DOPA PET images for each participant were realigned across individual time frames and then registered together to the high-resolution T1 structural MRI scan (see below) in native space using SPM12. 18F-DOPA PET images were maintained in the native space without performing spatial normalization. Anatomical structures of the caudate nucleus and putamen were segmented in the MRI scan using an automated processing routine implemented with FSL software48 (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/install/index). The regions of the anterior and posterior putamen were then separated using a semi-automated procedure involving realignment of the anterior commissure–posterior commissure planes on the MRI scan. 18F-DOPA counts were computed automatically in each striatal VOI, including the caudate nucleus, anterior and posterior putamen and occipital cortex (16 mm diameter sphere in each hemisphere). The 18F-DOPA uptake was then calculated (regional 18F-DOPA counts/occipital counts − 1) using FSL with the occipital cortex used as a reference. Individual datapoints for the anterior putamen, posterior putamen and caudate are shown for both the low- and high-dose cohorts (Extended Data Fig. 3). This method had been previously validated49,50 and used successfully in the PET imaging studies of fetal cell transplantation25,42,51,52.

MRI studies of the brain (1.5 Tesla and 3 Tesla) were performed using standardized acquisition protocols at screening, preoperatively for surgical planning, intraoperatively, postoperatively, and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months after transplantation.

Between 3 May 2021 and 30 March 2022, 17 participants were assessed for eligibility; five were excluded due to screening failure. The remaining 12 participants were sequentially enrolled into the low-dose (n = 5) or high-dose (n = 7) cohort (Extended Data Fig. 1). At the time of the last participant completing the 18-month visit, the median (min, max) follow-up time was 21.2 months (18.5, 24.7) and all of the participants were still engaged in clinical follow-up. The participants had a median age of 67.0 years (quartile 1 (Q1), Q3: 64.5, 70.0); 67% were white and 75% were male (Supplementary Table 3). The median (Q1, Q3) time since diagnosis was 9.0 (5.9, 11.5) years. At the baseline, all of the participants had a Hoehn–Yahr ON score of 2; 11 participants had a Hoehn–Yahr OFF score of 3 and one participant (low-dose cohort; Canada) had a score of 2.

TEAEs most frequently experienced by participants (Extended Data Table 6) were in the nervous system disorders (11 TEAEs in eight participants; Extended Data Table 7) and infections and infestations (10 TEAEs in seven participants; Extended Data Table 8) system/organ classes. Of the infections, one TEAE each of oral herpes and urinary tract infection was considered to be related to immunosuppression. No TEAEs were related to bemdaneprocel. Aside from two severe TEAEs (one fall deemed unrelated to treatment and the aforementioned SAE of gastrointestinal haemorrhage), all others were mild or moderate in severity (Extended Data Table 4).

All safety data from all of the participants were used to conduct the formal analysis of the primary end point at 1 year after transplantation. Secondary and exploratory end points were also assessed at 1 year and 18 months after transplantation. Inferential statistical testing was not performed due to the small number of participants. Descriptive statistics (mean (standard deviation (s.d.)) or percentage (counts)) were tabulated by cohort.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol and all applicable local government laws, regulations and guidance, including policies with foundations in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. An institutional review board at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medicine reviewed and approved the clinical protocol (submitted with the Article) and the patient consent form. All of the participants signed the informed consent. (MSKCC: IRB no. 18-518 on 6/8/2021; WCM IRB no: 1810019690 on 14 January 2019). A data safety monitoring committee and the institutional review boards monitored trial progression and data handling. The Tri-institutional Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight committee (ESCRO) at MSKCC and WCM approved the study and the consent on 11 October 2019.

Metrics details

Despite the widespread use of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about the metabolism of therapeutic RNAs. Here we use nanopore sequencing1,2,3 to analyse individual therapeutic mRNA molecules, focusing on their poly(A) tails. We show that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine4 has a poly(A) tail of around 100 nucleotides, followed by an mΨCmΨAG sequence. In cell lines, mRNA-1273 undergoes rapid degradation initiated by mΨCmΨAG removal, followed by CCR4–NOT-mediated deadenylation. However, in medically relevant preclinical models, particularly in macrophages, mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails are extended to up to 200 nucleotides by the TENT5A poly(A) polymerase5,6,7, which is induced by the vaccine. Re-adenylation, which stabilizes target mRNAs, is consistently observed in synthetic mRNAs that encode proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ovalbumin or antigens from Zika virus8 or the malaria parasite9. The extent of re-adenylation varies: the BioNTech–Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine10 shows less potent re-adenylation than mRNA-1273, which correlates with a smaller proportion of membrane-associated BNT162b2. This highlights the crucial role of spatial accessibility to ER-resident TENT5A in determining re-adenylation efficiency. In vivo, TENT5A is expressed in immune cells that take up mRNA vaccine, and TENT5A deficiency reduces specific immunoglobulin production for mRNA vaccines after immunization in mice. Overall, our findings reveal a principle for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic mRNAs, paving the way for improvement.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines were deployed on a global scale with unprecedented speed. Despite the need for immediate action, the mRNA vaccine field is still in its early stages, because this method of vaccine design was entirely new. The two anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that were first approved—BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) and mRNA-1273 (Spikevax)—are in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNAs4,10 that encode the coronaviral spike protein. These therapeutic mRNAs have all of their uridines replaced by N1-methyl-pseudouridines (mΨ), and are overall very similar. However, they differ in their cap structures, untranslated region (UTR) sequences and 3′ tails11. The BNT162b2 vaccine is capped cotranscriptionally with a trinucleotide Cap1 analogue (CleanCap AG, with 3′-O-methylation on m7G) and a composite poly(A) tail of 30 adenosines followed by 10 other nucleotides and then 70 extra adenosines (ref. 12). The mRNA-1273 vaccine is capped post-transcriptionally, creating natural Cap1 through vaccinia virus capping enzyme (VCE) and mRNA Cap 2′-O-methyltransferase (MTA), and has a poly(A) tail of undisclosed length. Both vaccines are encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) of slightly different compositions and enter the cells through endocytic pathways13,14.

Intramuscularly administered mRNA vaccines can locally transfect resident and infiltrating immune cells, such as antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These cells become activated and can migrate to neighbouring lymph nodes15,16,17,18. LNPs, as well as secreted antigens produced in muscle, are transported to local lymph nodes, where they are taken up by macrophages and resident DCs18,19. DCs, which have a central role in adaptive immunity, endocytose antigens produced by other cells and are thought to translate vaccine mRNAs19. Peptide antigens are presented by class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to induce an immune response18. Studies on mRNA vaccines have focused on DCs20,21; macrophages and monocytes—despite being the main cell types that take up LNP-encapsulated RNA—have received less attention15,18,22. Moreover, the distribution of mRNA vaccines has been studied in local lymph nodes, rather than in muscles, where it is administered. Thus, the role of macrophages and local antigen production in mRNA vaccine efficacy is not well defined. Researchers' knowledge of the in vivo and intracellular metabolism of mRNA vaccines is also limited. Notably, almost nothing is known about the metabolism of vaccine poly(A) tails, but the paradigm extrapolated from data on endogenous transcripts (or reporters) asserts that the stability of therapeutic mRNAs is determined by the rate of poly(A) tail shortening (deadenylation).

Here we use nanopore RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyse mRNA therapeutics, revealing the complexity of their metabolism. Specifically, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated TENT5A poly(A) polymerase stabilizes IVT mRNAs encoding secreted proteins. In vivo, TENT5A enhances the immunogenicity of the anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccines mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, but not that of Nuvaxovid, which contains purified spike protein as an antigen. To our knowledge, the effect of endogenous polyadenylation machinery on mRNA therapeutics has not been previously reported or even considered.

Owing to methodological challenges, the in vivo metabolism of therapeutic mRNAs is poorly understood. Commonly used sequencing-by-synthesis methods rely on the analysis of PCR-amplified cDNA, but these approaches are indirect and error-prone, particularly when studying poly(A) tails, because of polymerase slippages on homopolymers1. Quality control of mRNA therapeutics, especially their poly(A) tails, presents similar difficulties. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS), developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)2, is a promising solution to these challenges. DRS records electric currents during the passage of individual single-stranded RNA molecules through a protein pore, providing reliable information about RNA composition with single-molecule resolution (Fig. 1a).

a, Overview of the eDRS approach for studying mRNA therapeutics. RNA molecules passing through the pores from the 3′ end cause perturbations in the electric current readout, which are further translated into the sequence (basecalled), and then used to calculate the poly(A) length or to detect the presence of a terminal mΨCmΨAG pentamer. b, Representative raw signals from eDRS showing mRNA-1273 with (bottom) and without (top) a 3′ terminal mΨCmΨAG pentamer.

Analysis of intact mRNA-1273 using a standard DRS pipeline (Fig. 1a) revealed that a substantial proportion of aligned reads covered the full-length vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 1a, blue), indicating the potential for comprehensive analysis of mRNA therapeutics. However, uridine-to-mΨ substitution in mRNA therapeutics affects the current signal recorded, resulting in imprecise translation into the sequence (basecalling) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Therefore, we developed a subsequence dynamic time warping (sDTW) approach (Supplementary Note 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1c), which enables the identification of twice as many sequences compared with the standard DRS pipeline (Extended Data Fig. 1a,d–g).

Next, we focused on analysing vaccine poly(A) tails, which are crucial for mRNA stability and translation, using nanopolish polya23 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We confirmed that BNT162b2 exhibits a composite poly(A) tail12 (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). By contrast, mRNA-1273 contains a 100-adenosine poly(A) tract (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). However, when we visually inspected individual mRNA-1273 nanopore signals, we observed an unexpected perturbation between the poly(A) tail and the adaptor used for library preparation (Fig. 1b, bottom, blue). This signal suggests the presence of terminal non-adenosine residues in the mRNA-1273 vaccine. To determine the specificity of the signature for the 3′ end of mRNA-1273, we used vaccine RNA with an enzymatically extended 3′ end with inosine nucleotides (I-tailing), followed by DRS using a custom protocol. This confirmed the current perturbation at the 3′ end of the vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Finally, the presence of a TCTAG (mΨCmΨAG in the vaccine mRNA) was revealed through rapid amplification of cDNA 3′ end (3′-RACE) Illumina sequencing. The mΨCmΨAG pentamer is likely to represent the residue of restriction enzyme cleavage of the DNA template. Notably, such pentamer-ending RNAs were efficiently incorporated into the sequencing library, despite the fact that the protocol relies on poly(T)-splint ligation of a sequencing adaptor to the poly(A) tail.

To study mRNA vaccines quantitatively, we developed an enhanced DRS (eDRS) pipeline that includes sDTW and a modified algorithm for detecting poly(A) tails with mΨCmΨAG (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1a) or BNT162b2 poly(A) linker sequence (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1c). Our analysis of mRNA-1273 revealed that most vaccine RNA molecules had an intact 3′ end, with approximately 20% of reads lacking the mΨCmΨAG sequence (Extended Data Fig. 2d, bottom, green). These also showed a wider poly(A) length distribution (Extended Data Fig. 2d, top, green). Of note, the mΨCmΨAG pentamer enables easy discrimination between intact vaccine mRNA, defined as possessing a 3′-terminal mΨCmΨAG sequence, and processed RNA, which ends with a pure poly(A) sequence; this facilitates detailed analysis of poly(A) metabolism (Supplementary Note 2). A time-efficient computational pipeline that allows the analysis of poly(A) lengths from nanopore cDNA libraries has recently been released by ONT, enabling us to obtain similar poly(A) lengths and to confirm the presence of the pentamer with the orthogonal method (Extended Data Fig. 2g). In summary, both eDRS and cDNA nanopore sequencing are well-suited for analysing mRNA vaccines.

Next, we used nanopore sequencing to monitor mRNA-1273 stability and poly(A) tail status in cells that are commonly used in preclinical analyses. The optimal amount of vaccine RNA was determined to be non-toxic to cells (Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2), allowing efficient protein production and detection by eDRS (Extended Data Fig. 2h,i). We then examined mRNA-1273 metabolism in HEK293T and A549 cells in a time course (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2j). A clear decrease in mean poly(A) length over time was observed, accompanied by a reduction in the number of vaccine reads. This deadenylation occurred exclusively in reads lacking mΨCmΨAG.

Notably, BNT162b2 exhibited slower antigen production kinetics than mRNA-1273 (Fig. 1d), even when the vaccine mRNA was delivered into cells using lipofectamine reagent (Extended Data Fig. 2k). This was accompanied by a slower rate of deadenylation and greater stability in HEK293T cells, as determined by nanopore cDNA sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 2l).

Finally, to investigate the role of deadenylation in mRNA-1273 decay, we generated a HEK293T cell line with tetracycline-inducible depletion of the scaffold subunit (CNOT1) of the primary deadenylase complex CCR4–NOT. Depletion of CNOT1 resulted in increased global poly(A) lengths of endogenous mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 2m) and reduced poly(A) tail shortening in mRNA-1273, compared with the uninduced state (Fig. 1e). Significant changes in poly(A) length were observed only in reads that lacked the terminal mΨCmΨAG pentamer. The ratio of transcripts lacking the pentamer remained constant under both conditions, indicating that CCR4–NOT does not participate in mΨCmΨAG removal. These observations suggest that deadenylation restricts the lifespan of therapeutic mRNAs in model cell lines.

The fate of mRNA therapeutics depends on various factors that are difficult to replicate in model cell lines. The stability of the mRNA and the therapeutic outcome might be influenced by the microenvironment at the RNA delivery site and by specific gene-expression patterns in target cells. To study vaccine mRNA metabolism, we delivered mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in a mouse model. The RNA was isolated directly from the tissues at the injection sites and from the draining lymph nodes at 2 h, 8 h and 24 h after immunization (Fig. 2a). Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) revealed that the abundance of vaccine mRNA is orders of magnitude higher at the injection sites than in the draining lymph nodes (Extended Data Fig. 3a), in which the levels of mRNA-1273 were insufficient for effective eDRS analysis. eDRS on samples from the injection sites revealed that most mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails were unprocessed and contained a terminal mΨCmΨAG sequence even 24 h after injection, although mild deadenylation of processed tails was noticeable at all time points analysed (Fig. 2a). Of note, we found that at the 24-h time point, the median poly(A) tail length of mRNA-1273 increased from 100 to 114 nucleotides, and that 49% of the reads lacking mΨCmΨAG pentamer had lengths greater than 115 nucleotides. We confirmed mRNA-1273 poly(A) tail extension with eDRS on RNA isolated from immune cells infiltrating vaccine injection sites (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

To gain further insight into infiltrating immune cells, which presumably take up mRNA-1273, we performed a flow-cytometry analysis in the time course after immunization (Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Figs. 3–6). We observed that 24 h and 48 h after immunization, the muscles were populated almost exclusively by macrophage-type cells (F4/80+CD64+) also expressing CD11c+ (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6). At the same time, cells with markers attributed to tissue-resident DCs (CD45+, I-A/I-E (MHCII)high, CD11c+, F4/80− and CD64−) represented a minor population (around 20 times smaller than the macrophage population), the abundance of which remained stable over time. We then collected these two populations in a post-injection time course. Notably, cDNA nanopore sequencing indicated that mRNA poly(A) tails can be extended in vivo at 24 h when compared with 12 h for both macrophages and DCs (Extended Data Fig. 3d). However, deadenylation dominates in DCs, leading to a sharp decrease in mRNA stability.

In parallel with cDNA sequencing, we assessed the absolute abundance of mRNA-1273 using qRT–PCR. Both DCs and macrophages efficiently take up the vaccine, with an average of 82 and 152 molecules per cell, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3e). However, macrophages exhibited a greater stability of mRNA-1273 than DCs (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e), which correlates with the more potent re-adenylation. Given the abundance, macrophages represent the main cell population responsible for the local metabolism of vaccine mRNA, and we therefore shifted to in vitro cultures of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) as experimental models. Both were efficiently transfected with mRNA-1273 LNPs without visible toxic effects (Supplementary Note 4), allowing antigen detection for up to 96 h (Extended Data Fig. 3f,g). The stability of the vaccine mRNA was observed for at least 72 h, with approximately 25% of the molecules retaining unprocessed 3′ ends after 24 h (Fig. 2b,c). In mBMDMs, we observed a median elongation of around 24 adenosines in the poly(A) tails of vaccine mRNAs 24 h after transfection, with a fraction of tails reaching up to 200 adenosines. The vast majority of the elongated tails lacked the pentamer signature in the raw nanopore currents (Extended Data Fig. 3h). The median poly(A) length returned to the original 100 adenosines 72 h after transfection. In hMDMs, re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 was observed 48 h after vaccine delivery, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 2c). All of this indicates that re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 vaccine observed in vivo can be recapitulated with cultured macrophages as models.

We speculated that a similar phenomenon would be observed for BNT162b2, but in fact we observed only a minor extension of poly(A) tails throughout the time course after administration to mBMDMs (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3i). This could be related in part to an inability to distinguish between processed and intact tails, which is not the case for mRNA-1273 (Supplementary Note 2). However, translation efficiency is also diminished in mBMDMs treated with BNT162b2, compared with those treated with mRNA-1273 (Extended Data Fig. 3j). In addition, dose-dependent assays using mBMDMs showed that mRNA-1273 was more effectively translated at all dose ranges—compared with BNT162b2, which produced less antigen (Extended Data Fig. 3k). These slower kinetics of protein production seem to be directly related to the translation efficiency, because the effect is also seen in an vitro translation system based on reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2e).

In summary, our data show that therapeutic mRNA can undergo poly(A) tail elongation in target cells, as shown for mRNA-1273 in vivo and in cultured macrophages.

Whole-transcriptome analysis of mBMDMs treated with mRNA-1273 revealed significant changes in poly(A) length not only for mRNA-1273 but also for 124 endogenous transcripts (Kruskall–Wallis test, P < 0.001). The transcripts associated with immune response showed the most pronounced tail extension, with an average of 20 adenosines at 24 h (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). These included MHC components (H2-K1, H2-D1, H2-T23 and B2m), serum complement components (C1qb and C1qc), lysosomal proteins (Lamp1 and Laptm5) and innate immune response genes (Ctsb, Ctsd, ApoE, Lyz2, Cst3 and Ctss). Out of the 92 transcripts with a significant change in poly(A) tail length in hMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 3), 38 were orthologues of those identified in mBMDMs, encoding mainly proteins that are involved in antigen presentation.

See also Extended Data Fig. 4.

Because poly(A) extension of mRNA-1273 and endogenous transcripts occurred simultaneously in both cell types (after 24 h and 48 h in mBMDMs and hMDMs, respectively), we hypothesized that a common factor—probably transcriptionally induced after vaccine delivery—mediates this process.

Indeed, the changes in poly(A) tails were accompanied by complex transcriptomic responses. At the injection sites, upregulated genes (Extended Data Fig. 4b, clusters 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table 4) were enriched in functions related to the immune response and cell activation (Supplementary Table 5), suggesting the infiltration of immune cells, which is consistent with previous reports19. Administration of mRNA-1273 resulted in changes in the expression of 327 and 87 genes in mBMDMs and hMDMs, respectively, of which 37 were orthologous. Differentially expressed genes were observed starting at 24 h after mRNA-1273 administration in mBMDMs (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 6) and after 72 h in hMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 7), and continued until the end of the experiment. Of note, the observed responses resembled those previously reported for the BNT162b2 vaccine15, with increased expression of immune response genes (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 4e,f and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9), including several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs, such as Stat1, Stat2, Mx1 and components of the OAS pathway) and genes involved in antigen presentation.

Among the genes upregulated after mRNA-1273 administration in mBMDMs, we observed Tent5a, the only non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase exhibiting such a pattern (Fig. 3d). Previously, we showed that Tent5a and Tent5c were induced in mBMDMs after activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)7, and we observed an elongation of poly(A) tails in a group of mRNAs; this elongation was very similar to that seen after mRNA-1273 delivery. It suggests that TENT5A is indeed a factor responsible for vaccine re-adenylation. Moreover, Tent5a is the only cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that is significantly induced at vaccine injection sites (Extended Data Fig. 4g), probably in infiltrating macrophages. Tent5c is also expressed in all analysed cells but at a much lower level (Fig. 3d). At the same time, no change in the expression of subunits of the deadenylase complexes was observed (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Finally, the induction of TENT5A after mRNA-1273 administration is also visible at the protein level, as revealed by an analysis of mBMDMs derived from a knock-in mouse line (FKBP12F36V-HA-Tent5a) expressing TENT5A fused with a dTAG degrader (FKBP12(F36V)–HA tag) (Fig. 3e). Accordingly, we observed increased expression of Tent5a in cells sorted from the injection sites 12 h after immunization (Fig. 3f). One day after immunization with BNT162b2, some induction of Tent5a was also observed in single-cell RNA-seq data from a previous study15, which we reanalysed focusing on the expression of TENT genes (Fig. 3g). In this analysis, Tent5a expression was detected in macrophages (but not in DCs) taking up the vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 4i).

Overall, these experiments suggest a possible role for TENT5A and, to a lesser extent, TENT5C, in the re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 observed in macrophages, in both mouse and human models.

To evaluate the role of TENT5 proteins in vaccine mRNA re-adenylation, we studied mRNA-1273 metabolism in mBMDMs lacking TENT5A and TENT5C (double-knockout Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/−). Cells were treated with mRNA-1273 for up to 72 h and RNA was isolated and subjected to eDRS. In comparison with wild-type mBMDMs, we observed relatively fast mRNA-1273 decay and deadenylation in the absence of TENT5A and TENT5C (Fig. 4a), with median poly(A) tails shortened to around 83 As after 24 h, despite the high ratio of RNAs lacking the 3′ pentamer. Rapid depletion of TENT5A protein in mBMDMs using the degron-inducible FKBP12F36V-HA-Tent5a model (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 5a) led to the same effect, with mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails shortened 24 h after vaccine administration, when compared with controls. The presence of the FKBP12(F36V) tag itself caused only a minor reduction in the activity of TENT5A, which was evident at both 24 h and 72 h after mRNA administration. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of TENT5A in hMDMs also caused mRNA-1273 poly(A) shortening and decreased antigen production, when compared with mock-siRNA-transfected cells, and this effect was observed for three independent siRNAs (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5b). All of these data indicate that TENT5 proteins have a crucial role in the regulation of mRNA-1273, with TENT5A being particularly key. In line with this, in Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− mBMDMs, the stability of mRNA-1273 is markedly reduced (Fig. 4d).

Average distributions from three different siRNAs in two independent biological replicates. For a–c,e, eDRS-measured poly(A) tail lengths are shown with reads containing (blue) or lacking (green) an mΨCmΨAG sequence, with median values and fractions of elongated or shortened tails shown. Bottom panels show the relative abundance of each group, with group sizes indicated. P values calculated with two-sided Wilcoxon test (on reads lacking mΨCmΨAG) with Benjamini–Hochberg correction. Data in a,b represent two independent experiments. See also Extended Data Fig. 5.

Notably, dysfunction of TENT5-mediated cytoplasmic polyadenylation had no effect on the transcriptional response, which was similar in both wild-type and Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− mBMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 10). A negative effect of the knockout was observed only for poly(A) tails (Extended Data Fig. 5d), as in the case of LPS-activated macrophages24. Furthermore, TENT5A dysfunction does not affect the global translation efficiency, as revealed by high-content microscopy fluorescence quantifications of EGFP-encoding reporter mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 5e).

Finally, to look at the potential effect of other non-canonical poly(A)/poly(U) polymerases on mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails, we depleted Tent2, Tent4a, Tent4b, Tent3a and Tent3b in mBMDMs and subsequently administered mRNA-1273. In all cases, we observed efficient re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 5f), which was lost only in Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− cells (Fig. 4a). We conclude that TENT5A is responsible for mRNA-1273 re-adenylation in macrophages.

As a next step, we focused on factors determining TENT5A substrate specificity. Most of the mRNAs with poly(A) tails that were extended after mRNA-1273 vaccination in wild-type but not in Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− mBMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 5d) encode proteins that are translated at the ER. Notably, mRNA-1273 also encodes an ER-targeted protein, which, as we show, hijacks TENT5 proteins to extend its poly(A) tails. Massive translation of spike (and other proteins) at the ER, after mRNA-1273 administration, led to increased ER stress in hMDMs (Extended Data Fig. 6a). However, siRNA depletion of TENT5A resulted in decreased spike protein translation (Extended Data Fig. 5b) and reduced the levels of unfolded protein response markers (Extended Data Fig. 6b), consistent with the role of TENT5A in promoting vaccine antigen translation. TENT5C has previously been shown to localize to the ER through interaction with ER-associated transmembrane FNDC3A and FNDC3B proteins25. Depleting Fndc3a and Fndc3b in mBMDMs led to the abrogation of mRNA-1273 re-adenylation (Fig. 5a), indicating that, in the case of TENT5A, its cooperation with FNDC3A and FNDC3B is essential for the re-adenylation and stabilization of mRNA-1273.

Because our previous studies in different cell types revealed that the specificity of TENT5 proteins is not determined by sequence motifs5,6,7,24, and that the presence of an ER targeting signal is sufficient to drive TENT5-mediated regulation6, the efficient re-adenylation of mRNA-1273 but not BNT162b2 was puzzling. Given that coronavirus spike proteins are co-translationally translocated to the ER26, we sought to further investigate the spatial determinants of vaccine mRNA metabolism. Because in mBMDMs, Tent5a is more strongly induced by mRNA-1273 than by BNT162b2 (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6c), we co-transfected mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 to mBMDMs with lipofectamine-based transfection reagent, to exclude the differential effects of each vaccine on transcriptomic response. Next, we fractionated cells after vaccine administration in a time-course manner and performed nanopore cDNA sequencing of isolated RNA. This analysis revealed robust re-adenylation of not only mRNA-1273 but also BNT162b2, specifically in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 6d), confirming that ER association is a prerequisite for efficient re-adenylation. The lower load of BNT162b2 on ER (Extended Data Fig. 6e) and the inability to distinguish between intact and processed vaccines—unlike mRNA-1273, for which reads ending in mΨCmΨAG can be excluded—are likely to explain why re-adenylation of BNT162b2 is less pronounced in the total fraction (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Next, we administered both vaccines to mBMDMs separately and analysed the dynamics of antigen production. The spike protein was present in the membrane fraction, with a trend towards lower levels of BNT162b2-encoded than mRNA-1273-encoded spike protein on the ER, mainly at early time points (Extended Data Fig. 6g). This aligns with the results from our analysis of whole-cell lysates and culture medium, and with the in vitro translation assay presented before (Figs. 1d and 2e and Extended Data Fig. 3j,k). It could be caused by a combination of effects of differences in the cap structure (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b), the codon optimality of the coding sequence (CDS) (Supplementary Note 7, Extended Data Fig. 7c–g) and the UTRs. Nevertheless, despite relatively inefficient re-adenylation, Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− mBMDMs produce less spike protein, compared with wild-type mBMDMs, after BNT162b2 administration over a time course (Extended Data Fig. 6h), indicating that TENT5A also has a beneficial effect on antigen production for this vaccine.

Next, to systematically evaluate the influence of the capping strategy, UTRs and poly(A) tail composition (including the presence of mΨCmΨAG) on mRNA re-adenylation in mBMDMs, we generated a series of mΨ-containing reporter mRNAs (Supplementary Note 6 and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b). First, 16 variants of ER-targeted codon-optimized ovalbumin (OVA)-coding mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d) were used to evaluate protein production using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Notably, we observed that mBMDMs transfected with the enzymatically VCE + MTA-capped mRNA (Cap 1) produced several folds more OVA than did mBMDMs that were transfected with mRNA cotranscriptionally equipped with CleanCap (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Besides the capping method, mRNA-1273 UTRs had a beneficial effect on OVA production, compared with those derived from BNT162b2 (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Poly(A) tail and mΨCmΨAG sequence seemed to have a minor role despite being synthesized from different DNA templates.

For the analysis of poly(A) lengths, we focused on mRNAs ending with mΨCmΨAG, which, as shown before, does not affect expression and is usually removed before re-adenylation (Extended Data Fig. 3h), thus allowing us to analyse the processed mRNAs without fractionation, unlike the original BNT162b2. Consistent with the correlation of protein expression and translation efficiency, re-adenylation was completely absent in OVA mRNAs equipped with CleanCap, as revealed by nanopore cDNA sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). At the same time, a certain degree of re-adenylation was observed in all variants of enzymatically capped RNAs (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 9d), despite CDS optimization being significantly different from that of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f and Supplementary Note 7). Re-adenylation was slightly more pronounced in reporters with mRNA-1273 UTRs and BNT162b2 poly(A) tails.

Finally, to check the re-adenylation potency of other CDSs, we designed reporters encoding an ER-targeted circumsporozoite protein from Plasmodium falciparum (PfCSP; Extended Data Fig. 7h) and the Zika virus envelope structural protein (ZikVE), considered antigens in the mRNA vaccines against malaria9 and Zika virus8, respectively. Again, cDNA sequencing of RNA isolated from mBMDMs 24 h after transfection revealed that all enzymatically capped variants were re-adenylated, with no clear trend with regard to the superiority of particular UTRs or poly(A) tail sequences (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9e–g). Notably, reanalysis of the PfCSP reporter with BNT162b2 UTRs and BNT162b2 tail using eDRS, which is more accurate than cDNA sequencing on long poly(A) tails, revealed massive re-adenylation in mBMDMs (Fig. 5e).

Overall, we show that TENT5A-mediated re-adenylation stabilizes a broad range of enzymatically capped ER-targeted IVT mRNAs, including therapeutic ones (Extended Data Fig. 9h). This further indicates that the potency of re-adenylation is affected by several factors, such as the capping method and the coding and UTR sequences, whereas poly(A) tail composition has a relatively minor role.

DCs are major antigen-presenting cells and are expected to have a key role in the development of immunity after vaccination. However, DCs express low levels of TENT5A (Fig. 3f,g), raising the question of whether TENT5-mediated stabilization of vaccine mRNA in macrophages affects immune response. Tent5a-knockout mice, despite having substantially lower body mass and serious skeletal malformations5, do not exhibit major immune defects, which might have an effect on immune response, as revealed by data from the International Mouse Phenotypic Consortium27 (www.mousephenotype.org). Specifically, they show no phenotypes related to T cells, B cells or DCs, only slightly elevated monocyte, neutrophil and granulocyte counts in females. Thus, we immunized wild-type and Tent5a−/− mice with mRNA-1273, BNT162b2 or a Nuvaxovid (Novavax) protein-based COVID-19 vaccine, and measured antibody production (14 days after vaccination). The level of serum anti-spike IgG 14 days after immunization with mRNA-1273 was significantly lower in Tent5a−/− than in wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 10a), with no significant change in the total level of IgGs in the sera (Extended Data Fig. 10e). Despite the differences in re-adenylation efficiency in the in vitro system, slightly lower serum anti-spike IgG levels were observed in Tent5a−/− mice after BNT162b2 vaccination (Extended Data Fig. 10b,f). Of note, no negative effect of Tent5a−/− on serum anti-spike IgG levels was observed for protein-based Nuvaxovid vaccine (Extended Data Fig. 10c,d,g). To more specifically address the role of vaccine uptake by macrophages in muscle, we immunized conditional knockout mice with Cre-induced ablation of Tent5a in CD11c+ cells. Similar to what was seen in Tent5a−/− mice, the level of anti-spike IgG was lower at 14 days after immunization in Tent5aflox/flox mice than in controls (Extended Data Fig. 10h). Next, we measured the levels of spike protein in the serum at 48 h and 96 h after immunization (Extended Data Fig. 10i), and found that the levels were significantly lower in Tent5aflox/flox mice than in control mice (Extended Data Fig. 10j,k). Such an effect confirms the major role of CDC11c+ cells expressing Tent5a in antigen production. Thus, TENT5A-mediated re-adenylation, which occurs mainly in macrophages, has a direct effect on antigen production and vaccine efficacy.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the development of vaccine technology, and the timely introduction of mRNA vaccines was key to slowing the spread of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. This report provides evidence that therapeutic mRNAs can be modified in cells, such that their poly(A) tails are extended by the cellular machinery. Re-adenylation leads to increased stability of targeted mRNAs and increased production of coded antigens, providing a possible explanation for the efficacy of existing mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 and their further generations). Our findings could have profound implications for the development of next-generation mRNA therapeutics, including some that are already in preclinical studies (for instance, mRNA-1325 and mRNA-1895 for Zika, encoding the premembrane and envelope proteins8). Moreover, our work highlights and reinforces the physiological role of the ER in cellular RNA metabolism, showing that the ER acts as a central hub not only for cellular mRNA translation but also for its post-transcriptional regulation. Mechanistically, the cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase TENT5A, acting in concert with ER-associated FNDC3A and FNDC3B, is responsible for the re-adenylation of ER-targeted mRNA therapeutics. The exact mechanism of substrate selection by TENT5A has yet to be established, but the re-adenylation efficiency is affected by several factors. Notably, the capping strategy considerably influences re-adenylation. In primary macrophages, among OVA-coding mRNAs, only those with enzymatically incorporated Cap 1 underwent efficient poly(A) tail extension, whereas those cotranscriptionally capped with CleanCap did not. This correlated with significantly higher production of the encoded protein. Although the precise mechanism has yet to be elucidated, enzymatically capped mRNA-1273 was expressed at a higher level and underwent more robust adenylation than BNT162b2, which used CleanCap. However, the observed effect was less pronounced than it was for OVA mRNAs, suggesting that factors beyond the chemical cap structure are involved. Furthermore, UTR sequences can affect re-adenylation efficiency, although they do not have a dominant role. This observation aligns with the fact that TENT5A substrates lack distinct sequence motifs identifiable within the non-protein-coding regions of mRNAs5,6,7. Further research is needed to uncover all the details of TENT5-mediated re-adenylation.

Once administered, mRNA vaccines generate complex immune responses. Before COVID-19, research on mRNA vaccines focused mainly on the development of anti-cancer agents21,28. Although mRNA design has typically been optimized in cell lines, the aim has been to target DCs, which were thought to produce and present the antigen to generate both humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Here we show that macrophages are responsible for antigen production and thus have a crucial role in the development of immunity. Macrophages are not only the major cell population that takes up the vaccine mRNA15,19, but they also express TENT5A, which is induced after immunization and re-adenylates them, increasing stability and protein output. Accordingly, in mice that lack TENT5A in CD11C+ cells, a substantial reduction in antigen production is observed, associated with the impaired development of an antigen-specific humoral response.

The development of therapeutic mRNAs extends beyond vaccines, and intensive efforts are being made to use mRNA to treat Mendelian diseases or to induce the production of therapeutic proteins. In these cases, the main target is the liver, because transfecting hepatocytes after intravenous administration of LNP-encapsulated mRNAs is very efficient. There are also attempts to target other organs and cell types. Here we show that different cell types metabolize mRNA vaccines differently. We expect that only cells that express high levels of TENT5s stabilize the mRNA by re-adenylation and are thus desirable targets for therapeutic mRNAs that encode secreted proteins. In addition, a better understanding of substrate recognition will enable the rational design of mRNAs that are more efficiently polyadenylated by TENT5 and are, therefore, more stable.

In the future, other tissue-specific mechanisms of mRNA stabilization might be uncovered. All of these observations emphasize the point that the design of therapeutic mRNAs must be tailored to the target cells and the target site of the protein product.

All mouse lines were generated by CRISPR–Cas9 at the Genome Engineering Unit (https://crisprmice.eu/) as described previously3,5,7. A conditional Tent5aflox/flox and double-knockout Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/− have been described previously7. The Cd11c-Cre (B6N.Cg-Tg(Itgax-cre)1-1Reiz/J) mouse strain was purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and crossed with Tent5aflox/flox. The FKBP12F36V-HA-Tent5a mouse line was generated by inserting the sequence of the dTag degron and the 2×HA tag at the N terminus of the endogenous Tent5a. B6CBAF1 zygotes were microinjected with a mixture containing Cas9 mRNA, gRNA targeting Tent5a (AAAAGTATCTCTGATGCATC) and double-stranded repair template (TAGAAGGGGCGGCCGCCTCCAGGTGACACAGACGGGACTCTCGCTTGTGCTTTCCAGATGGGAGTGCAGGTGGAAACCATCTCCCCAGGAGACGGGCGCACCTTCCCCAAGCGCGGCCAGACCTGCGTGGTGCACTACACCGGGATGCTTGAAGATGGAAAGAAAGTTGATTCCTCCCGGGACAGAAACAAGCCCTTTAAGTTTATGCTAGGCAAGCAGGAGGTGATCCGAGGCTGGGAAGAAGGGGTTGCCCAGATGAGTGTGGGTCAGAGAGCCAAACTGACTATATCTCCAGATTATGCCTATGGTGCCACTGGGCACCCAGGCATCATCCCACCACATGCCACTCTCGTCTTCGATGTGGAGCTTCTAAAACTGGAAGGCGGCTACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCGGCTATCCGTATGATGTCCCGGACTATGCAGGCGGACATCAGAGATACTTTTGGTGCGGGGCTGCTCTGCGGGGCGCGGCGCGCGGCTGGGCATTG). Zygotes were transferred to surrogate mothers and pups were screened for the presence of insertion using a 3-primer approach (Fw: GCAGCTCCTGCGAAGTGTG, Rv1: TGCCATGGCAAAGTACCCTTC, Rv2: CCCACACTCATCTGGGCAAC). Potential founders were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Mice were bred in the animal facility of the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw, and maintained under conventional conditions3,5,7 in open polypropylene cages filled with woodchip bedding enriched with nesting material and paper tubes. Mice were fed ad libitum with a standard laboratory diet (Labofeed B, Morawski). Room humidity was maintained at 55 ± 10%, the temperature was kept at 22 °C  ± 2 °C, the air was changed at least 15 times per hour and a 12-h–12-h light regime was used (lights on from 06:00 to 18:00). Regular health monitoring was performed at the IDEXX laboratory. Mice of different genotypes were assigned with individual numerical tags in the database and they were used for tissue collection and throughout the subsequent processing as the only identifiers.

Discarded residual vaccine material: mRNA-1273 (Moderna, monovalent or bivalent original/Omicron BA.4-5 spike), BNT162b2 (Pfizer monovalent or bivalent original/Omicron BA.4-5), Nuvaxovid (Novavax, recombinant spike protein, adjuvanted) were used within the manufacturer's stability guidelines. Because this was not available for purchase at the time and because only residual (otherwise discarded) material could be used, we obtained approval from the Polish Ministry of Health (MMI.454.1.2021.TM).

All animal experiments were approved by the II Local Ethical Committee in Warsaw (approval numbers: WAW2/71/2021, WAW2/129/2021, WAW2/95/2022, WAW2/127/2022 and WAW2/007/2023) and were performed according to Polish law (act number 653 266/15.01.2015) and in agreement with the corresponding European Union directive.

Six-to-fourteen-week-old mice were immunized by intramuscular (Vastus lateralis region) injection with 0.9% NaCl (controls), 1 µg mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer) or 50 µl Nuvaxovid vaccine (Novavax) at 40 ng µl−1 protein concentration. Tissues were collected at set time points for subsequent analyses. Mice of both sexes were used, with equal or similar ratios of both sexes in directly compared groups. The sex of the mice was not considered in the immunization experiments, only the genotype.

No formal sample-size calculations were performed a priori. Sample sizes were determined on the basis of established practices in similar published studies and the 3Rs principles (replacement, reduction and refinement) for ethical animal research. We used the minimum numbers necessary to achieve statistical significance while maintaining scientific rigour, on the basis of our previous experience and comparable studies. Details on sample sizes are provided for each experiment. Mice with different genotypes could not be distinguished by the experimenter (except for Tent5a−/− mice, which have a distinguishable phenotype). However, vaccination is a routine procedure and therefore knowledge about the genotype of mice at the time of vaccination was highly unlikely to affect the results of immunization.

Concentrations of spike protein receptor-binding domain, anti-spike IgG and total IgG in mice serum were measured according to the manufacturer's recommendations with commercially available ELISA kits: Invitrogen (EH492RB; 1222062723, 1222110123 and 1222110723), Krishgen Biosystems (KBVH015-14; MACOVSPQ1023, MACOVSPQ0223 and MCOV2SS0822) and Eagle Biosciences (OGG11-K01; 25Q1 and 26), respectively. The level of OVA was measured using an ELISA kit from MyBioSource (MBS2000240; L240916286). Sample dilution was determined experimentally to fit within the standard curve of each ELISA. Owing to intervals between immunizations, different versions and lots of both vaccines and ELISA kits were used, depending on availability. Therefore, ELISA results should be interpreted as semi-quantitative between experiments. A single experiment was always performed simultaneously for all conditions studied, and can therefore be interpreted as quantitative, allowing direct comparisons between experimental conditions.

Muscles from anterior thigh were isolated 6 h, 12 h, 24 h or 48 h after vaccine injection, finely minced using surgical scissors and resuspended in 2 ml of serum-free RPMI supplemented with 1,000 U ml−1 collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma-Aldrich, C9407), 250 µg ml−1 DNAse I (Sigma-Aldrich, 10104159001) and 8 µg ml−1 dispase I (Sigma-Aldrich, D4693). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 140-rpm agitation. Digested muscle suspensions were put on ice and processed at 4 °C from then on. Ten millilitres of ice-cold FACS buffer (0.2% BSA in PBS) was added to muscle suspensions, followed by straining with a 70-µm nylon strainer (Greiner, 542070). With the strainer on, the suspension was centrifuged at 300g for 7 min. The crude pellet was treated twice with ACK (150 mM ammonium chloride, 1 mM potassium bicarbonate and 0.1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.2) for 2 min on ice, followed by washing with 10 ml FACS buffer; each time, centrifugation was performed at 300g for 7 min. The crude pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml FACS buffer and strained through the 30-μm cap strainer of a FACS tube. With caps on, the samples were centrifuged at 800g for 3 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded, followed by resuspension in 2 ml FACS buffer. Equal volumes of samples were mixed thoroughly with 33% Percoll (GE17-0891-01) in PBS and spun at 800g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was subjected to staining.

Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and incubated with Fc block anti-CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2) (BD Biosciences, 553142) for 5 min on ice, washed with FACS buffer and incubated with anti-CD45–PerCP–Cy5.5, anti-CD11b–BV786, anti-F4/80–PE–Cy7, anti-I-A/I-E–BV605, anti-CD11c–PE and anti-CD64–APC–Fire750 for 40 min in 4 °C, protected from light (detailed information on antibodies and dilutions is provided in Supplementary Table 11). After staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer and then stained with the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L34964) for 15 min at 4 °C, protected from light. Cell sorting was performed in a CytoFlex SRT cell sorter (Beckman Coulter) operated by CytExpert SRT v.1.1 software. A restrictive gating strategy was used to sort M0 macrophages and DCs (Supplementary Fig. 5). The gating strategy was based on gating live singlets, next cells identified as CD45+, CD11c+ and I-A/I-E (MHCII)+, with the exclusion of cells that were double positive for CD64 and F4/80, were sorted as DCs. Live singlets identified as CD45+, CD11c+, I-A/I-E (MHCII)low/−, F4/80+ and CD64+ were sorted as M0 macrophages. For post-sort analysis, cells were sorted to 100 µl of PBS. Post-sort analysis was performed on the first sample, to verify the purity of sorted populations. For RNA isolation, cells were sorted directly into 100 μl or 250 µl of extraction buffer (Applied Biosystems, KIT0204), depending on the cell amount, followed by centrifugation at 14,000g for 5 min and freezing until further processing.

A549 and HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cell lines and their derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until 80% confluency. To produce the HEK293 Flp-In T-REx (R78007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) cell line with conditional knockdown of CNOT1, we used a strategy previously described by us29. A tri-miRNA construct (listed below; stem–loop sequences ATGGAAGAGCTTGGATTTGAT, CTCCCTCAATTCGCCAACTTA and AGGACTTGAAGGCCTTGTCAA) was designed, and cloned at the BspTI (AflII) + NotI restriction sites in a pKK-RNAi vector (pKK-BI16 nucCherry EGFP-TEV). A total of 1 × 106 HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cells, grown in DMEM high-glucose medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS on six-well plates, were transfected with 300 ng of the CNOT1-bearing construct mixed with 1 μg of pOG44 plasmid and 250 μl of Opti-MEM medium, supplemented with 2 µl TransIT-2020 transfection reagent (Mirus, MIR5400). The cells were seeded in a 60-mm plate and cultured in DMEM high-glucose medium supplemented with 40 µg ml−1 hygromycin and 8 µg ml−1 blasticidin for the first six to seven days. Cells were grown until single colonies appeared four weeks later. A control of cells that were not transfected with the pKK-BI16 plasmid was included to ensure the specific selection of the cell line. Expression of exogenous miRNA genes was induced by the addition of doxycycline (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a final concentration of 100 ng ml−1. Cell enumeration was performed by crystal violet (Sigma, C3886) staining described by the laboratory of X. Chen (UCSF). In brief, cell medium was aspirated (or collected for subsequent ELISAs if necessary) and cells were washed with 1 ml PBS. Staining solution (0.25% crystal violet in 20% methanol) was then added to each well and cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The staining solution was then removed, and the cells were rinsed 6 times with 2 ml PBS, after which the remaining solution was evaporated, and the plates were scanned.

The primary mBMDM cultures were established from the bone-marrow monocytes isolated from Tent5aflox/floxTent5c−/−, FKBP12F36V-HA-Tent5a and wild-type mice. Young adult mice (12–25 weeks) of both sexes were euthanized by cervical dislocation. The femurs and tibias were isolated and bone marrow was collected using a centrifugation-based protocol24,30. Material was mixed from several individual mice (siblings of the same sex) to obtain sufficient cells for subsequent analyses. The sex of the mice used as a source of bone marrow cells was not considered in further analyses. Bone-marrow cells were plated in IMDM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 21980065) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 0.1 mg ml−1 streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 ng ml−1 macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; PeproTech, 315-02), and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For conditional Tent5a gene targeting, mBMDMs were transduced on the eighth day after isolation with lentivirus carrying Cre recombinase (pCAG-Cre-IRES2-GFP). Lentivirus production, cell transduction and genotyping were performed as described previously3,7. Cells were used for experiments on the fourteenth day after isolation.

To induce depletion of TENT5A, 0.7 × 106 mBMDMs obtained from wild-type and FKBP12F36V-HA-Tent5a mice were seeded in six-well plates and 24 h later, degron was induced by the addition of 1 µM dTAGv-1 or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control31. The vaccine was added to cells at the same time and cells were collected in time courses at set time points.

mBMDMs were reversely transfected with IVT mRNA (with uridines or mΨ) encoding high-RSCU EGFP (ref. 32) using MessengerMAX (Invitrogen, LMRNA001) according to the manufacturer's instructions in five technical replicates. In brief, the mRNA used for transfection was diluted in Opti-MEM (Gibco, 31985047) to obtain 40 ng of mRNA in 10 µl of Opti-MEM, and MessengerMAX (Invitrogen, LMRNA001) was diluted in Opti-MEM equivalent to 0.1 µl of reagent in 10 µl of Opti-MEM per well. Diluted mRNA was mixed with diluted transfection reagent on 96-well plates, left for 40 min and then transferred to 384-well plates (Perkin Elmer, 6057300). mBMDMs were counted in a Countess 3L counter (Invitrogen, AMQAF2000) using dedicated chamber slides (Invitrogen, C10283). Finally, cells were diluted to 5,000 cells per well and supplemented with dTAG-V1 (Bio-Techne, 7374/5) to a final concentration of 2 µM. Control cells were seeded without degron inductor. Cells were then seeded at a volume of 100 µl onto prepared plates with transfection mixes using the Multipette E3x (Eppendorf, 4987000029) and Combitip 5 ml Biopur (Eppendorf, 0030089669). The imaging was started 4 h after transfection in Opera Phenix from Perkin Elmer using three channels: 488 nm (time: 50 ms, power: 20%, height: −8.0 µm); bright-field (time: 20 ms, power: 20%, height: −0.0 µm); digital phase contrast (time: 20 ms, power: 20 %, height: −1.0 µm); water objective 20× non-confocal; binning 2 × 2. Live images were taken every 2 h for 72 h.

Buffy coats were obtained commercially from the Regional Blood Centre in Warsaw. All donors were 18–45-year-old healthy men. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated within 1–2 h after donation by density-gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies). Next, CD14+ PBMCs (monocytes) were isolated immunomagnetically with anti-human CD14 antibody-coated microbeads using LS columns (all from Miltenyi Biotec), strictly following the manufacturer's protocol. CD14+ cells were counted, and viability was checked in 0.1% trypan blue solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and used for subsequent hMDM differentiation. Each isolation resulted in a viability of over 95%.

CD14+ PBMCs were seeded in a 10-cm tissue-culture-treated Petri dish at a density of 1 × 106–2 × 106 cells per ml in 10 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich) 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (both Sigma-Aldrich), 1% (v/v) MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 of recombinant human M-CSF (for macrophage differentiation). Adherent cells collected from the M-CSF-supplemented culture were checked for markers of macrophages. hMDMs were stained with Zombie UV or Zombie Aqua Fixable Viability Kit (BioLegend) and antibodies detecting membrane markers CD14, CD83, CD86, CD163, CD206 and HLA-DR (listed in Supplementary Table 11). The antibody panel was optimized using isotype and fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls and a built-in compensation algorithm. Flow cytometry was performed using a Fortessa X-20 Analyzer (BD Biosciences) operated by FACSDiva 8.3 software. FlowJo v.10.6.1 software (BD Biosciences) was used for data analysis.

The 0.5 × 106–1 × 106 cells were seeded the day before on a six-well plate in medium as described above. The required amount of vaccine mRNA in original LNP formulation was diluted in 150 µl of Opti-MEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature, and after 10 min was added to the cells in a drop-wise manner and gently mixed. Cells were collected at time points specified for the individual experiments.

In the dose-dependent experiment, cells were transfected with varying volumes of original LNPs, with the quantity of RNA required (0.2 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 5 µg or 10 µg) diluted in OPTI-MEM medium. For the control cells (those not treated with the specified agent), an appropriate volume of OPTI-MEM was added. All transfections of purified vaccine mRNAs were performed with Lipofectamine MessengerMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected at time points specified for the individual experiments for subsequent analyses.

Macrophages were fractionated using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78840), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All buffers used were supplemented with RiboLock (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EO0382) to a final concentration of 1 U µl−1. The collected fractions for RNA isolation were immediately combined with TRIzol LS, incubated for five minutes at room temperature and subsequently frozen at –80 °C. For western blot analyses, samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen.

siRNA-mediated knockdowns in hMDMs were performed using validated stealth siRNAs: HSS124645, HSS124646 and HSS183139 (all for TENT5A). Knockdowns in mBMDMs were performed using validated stealth siRNAs: MSS279478 (Tent3a; also known as Tut4 and Zcchc11), MSS279479 (Tent3a), MSS210722 (Tent3b; also known as Tut7 and Zcchc6), MSS210723 (Tent3b), MSS200078 (Tent2; also known as Papd4), MSS200079 (Tent2), MSS209990 (Tent4a; also known as Papd7), MSS209991 (Tent4a), MSS277931 (Tent4b; also known as Papd5), MSS277932 (Tent4b), MSS220103 (Fndc3a) and MSS291871 (Fndc3b).

Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, as previously described24,33. Recommended negative controls (Invitrogen, 12935100) were used.

An equal number of cells were lysed in PBS supplemented with 0.1% NP40, protease inhibitors and viscolase (final concentration 0.1 U ml−1; A&A Biotechnology, 1010-100) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking at 1,200 rpm. Then 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 6% SDS, 150 mM DTT, 0.02% bromophenol blue, 30% glycerol and 3% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added and samples were boiled for 10 min. Samples were resolved on 12–15% SDS–PAGE gels and then proteins were wet-transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) at 400 mA at 4 °C for 1.5 h in 1× transfer buffer (25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol (v/v). Next, the proteins were visualized by staining with 0.3% w/v Ponceau S in 3% v/v acetic acid and digitalized. Membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% milk in TBST buffer for 1 h followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies (listed in Supplementary Table 11) diluted 1:2,500 (spike protein, CD80, GRP94, HA, SSR1, PERK, calreticulin and PDI) or 1:5,000 (α-tubulin, β-actin, actinin, eIF2a and GAPDH). Membranes were washed three times in TBST buffer for 10 min each and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse (Millipore, 401215) diluted 1:5,000 and anti-rabbit (Millipore, 401393) diluted 1:5,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times in TBST buffer and proteins were visualized using X-ray films or ChemiDoc (BioRad) or iBright (Thermo Fisher Scientific) imaging systems. Blots were quantified using Multi Gauge v.3.0 (Fujifilm Life Sciences). Unprocessed scans are shown as source data.

Total RNA was isolated from cells or vaccine samples with TRIzol reagent or TRIzol LS reagent (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions, dissolved in nuclease-free water and stored at −20 °C (short term) or −80 °C (long term). RNA from frozen muscles and lymph nodes was isolated by tissue homogenization in TRI reagent (Sigma, T9424) pre-heated to 60 °C, using Omni Tissue Homogenizer equipped with a 7 × 115-mm Saw Tooth (Fine) Generator Probe. Homogenous mixtures were further processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For qRT–PCR, RNA-seq and DRS library preparation, the RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1907; or Invitrogen, AM2238). To assess the integrity of isolates, each RNA sample after DNAse treatment was analysed with the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system, using Agilent High Senitivity RNA ScreenTape (Agilent, 5067-5579).

RNA from cells acquired by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was isolated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, KIT0204) following guidelines for RNA isolation from cell pellets with on-column DNAse treatment (Qiagen, 79256), with some modifications. For qRT–PCR analyses, we sorted 1,000 cells of each type, from separate mice, directly to 100 µl extraction buffer. In the case of cDNA sequencing, we sorted 20,000 cells of each type, pooled from three mice, directly to 250 µl extraction buffer. During the precipitation step, we used a 1:1 (v:v) 70% ethanol:extraction buffer ratio. RNA was eluted in 15 µl elution buffer in every case.

cDNA was synthesized using 500 ng of DNAsed total RNA as a template with SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18080093) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final cDNA concentration was kept at 2.5 ng µl−1 (converted from total RNA). In the case of RNA from FACS-sorted cells, 11 µl of the entire eluate was used for cDNA synthesis.

To determine the concentration of Moderna's mRNA-1273 in mouse tissues or FACS-sorted cells, a custom-made TaqMan probe together with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, 4369016) was used and normalized with a pre-designed gene-expression assay for β-actin (Applied Biosystems, Mm01205647_g1). The reaction mix was contained in a total volume of 10 µl with 1× concentration of master mix and gene-expression assay; 5 ng cDNA was used per reaction (converted from total RNA). In the case of FACS-sorted cells, 2 µl of 1.5× diluted cDNA was used, which roughly translates to 60 cells per 384-well plate, assuming 100% recovery of material during RNA isolation and 100% efficiency of cDNA synthesis. A thermal cycling program for TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix was used as instructed by the manufacturer.

To estimate the relative expression of Tent5a and Tent5c at injection sites or in FACS-sorted cells, and the levels of mRNA-1273 in HEK293T and A549 cells with varying amounts of vaccine, we used Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, 11733046) following the general protocol for ABI instruments recommended by the manufacturer.

For all qRT–PCR analyses, the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System, 384-well (Applied Biosystems, A28140) was used.

The primer blast algorithm was used to find a unique amplicon for mRNA-1273 in the mouse transcriptome (Refseq mRNA). Within the amplified region, a 15-mer of optimal GC content (53.3%) was selected as the target site for probe hybridization. We selected FAM dye and MGB-NFQ quencher as 5′ and 3′ modifications for the probe. The probe was synthesized by the Thermo Fisher Scientific Custom TaqMan probes service. To test the specificity and sensitivity of the designed assay, we performed a serial dilution experiment in which we spiked 500 ng of DNAsed mouse total RNA with 50 ng of DNAsed mRNA-1273 and performed cDNA synthesis. Then we performed 10× serial dilutions of that mix with unspiked mouse cDNA of the same concentration. qRT–PCR analysis showed that the designed assay is specific and can detect up to 10 ag of mRNA-1273 per ng of total RNA, which is equivalent to roughly 25 molecules. Similarly, we prepared a standard curve with 10× serial dilutions of mRNA-1273 to estimate the absolute concentration of vaccine in FACS-acquired cells. The concentration of vaccine before cDNA synthesis was determined with the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system using Agilent High Sensitivity RNA tape. Five nanograms of vaccine was added to 500 ng yeast total RNA and cDNA was synthesized; the final sample volume was 200 µl. Next, we performed eight serial dilutions (10×) using yeast cDNA of 2.5 ng µl−1 concentration. Recorded Ct values for each concentration served as data points for plotting an exponential curve, and we used this equation to convert Ct values to molecules of mRNA-1273, assuming its molecular mass is 1321.81 kDa. Next, the calculated number of molecules was normalized to the number of cells in a 384-well plate (translated from the % of eluate used for cDNA synthesis, assuming 100% recovery of cells during sorting and RNA isolation as well as cDNA synthesis efficiency).

The relative expression of genes associated with ER stress, we assessed CHOP (also known as DDIT3), GRP94 (HSP90B1), PERK (EIF2AK3) and XBP1 mRNA splicing in mRNA-1273-transfected hMDMs (wild-type and TENT5A knockdown) using the Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen, 11733046), following the general protocol for ABI instruments recommended by the manufacturer. Gene expression for each sample was normalized to ACTB.

Primers and probe sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 12.

To examine the 3′-UTR and terminal sequence of the mRNA-1273, RNA was freshly isolated from the vaccine sample vial. Then, 1 µg of vaccine mRNA was ligated to 20 pmol RA3_7N adaptor: 5rApp/CTGACNNNNNNNTGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG/3ddC with 10 U of T4 KQ227 RNA ligase 1 (NEB, M0204S) in the presence of 20 U RNase OUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10777019), 1× T4 RNA Ligase Reaction Buffer (NEB, M0204S), 1 mM ATP and 20% PEG8000 in a total reaction volume of 20 µl at 25 °C for 4 h. Ligase was inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min. The ligation product was purified with a 0.8× ratio of KAPA Pure Beads and eluted with 15 µl RNase-free water, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cleaned ligation product was subjected to reverse transcription with 40 pmol of Illumina index adapter: 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATATCAGTGTGACTGGAGTTCCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCA-3′ with SuperScript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 18080093), 1× First Strand Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 18080093), 0.25 mM dNTP mix, 5 mM DTT and 20 U RNAse OUT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10777019). The reaction mix was incubated at 45 °C for 1 h and 70 °C for 20 min in a thermocycler. The reverse transcription product was cleaned with a 1× ratio of KAPA Pure Beads and eluted with 19 µl RNase-free water. Prepared cDNA was diluted in a 1:3 proportion. In the library amplification step, 0.5 µl of cDNA was mixed with 0.4 pmol of gene-specific starter 5′-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATCAGAAGGAGATCGATCGGCTG-3′, 0.2 pmol of RP universal starter 5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-3′, 0.25 mM dNTP, Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, F530S), 1× Phusion HF Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, F530S) and 3% DMSO. For amplification, a standard Phusion program was used at 65 °C for annealing and 25 cycles. The 50 µl of PCR product was separated in 2.5% agarose gel. A band of 450 bp was cut out from the gel and purified with Gel-OUT (A&A Biotechnology, 023-50) according to the kit protocol. The library was cleaned twice with a 1.0× ratio of KAPA Pure Beads. TapeStation analysis of the sample was performed as a quality control. The library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.

RA37_N adapter sequence was trimmed from the R2 read (containing poly(A) tail) with cutadapt34 (options -g CCTTGGCACCCGAGAATTCCANNNNNNNGTCAG –discard-untrimmed). Then only reads containing poly(A) tail were identified with cutadapt (options -a TTTTTT --discard-untrimmed --fasta). Obtained sequences were reverse complemented using fastx_reverse_complement from the fastx toolkit (0.0.13) and loaded into R with the BioStrings package. To get rid of unwanted trimming artefacts, sequences with length between 0 and 10 were chosen, four A letters (representing the poly(A) tail) were pasted before each sequence for visualization purposes and a sequence logo representing the nucleotide composition of the 3′ end of mRNA-1273 was produced with the ggseqlogo package35.

For in vitro translation, the Retic Lysate IVT Kit (Invitrogen, AM1200M) was used. Reactions were assembled using the default buffer suggested by the producer. The translation mix (–met) was supplemented with unlabelled methionine to a final concentration of 50 μM. Either 1 μg or 3 μg of purified capped RNA was used as template in each reaction. The reaction was run for 180 min. Spike protein was detected in the reaction mixture using ELISA.

Spike-in RNAs were IVT from a set of double-stranded DNA fragments. Templates for transcription were prepared in two consecutive PCR reactions. First, a desired fragment of Renilla luciferase from pRL5Box plasmid was amplified using RLuc_F1/R1-specific primers containing an overhang common for all primers used in the second round of PCR (Supplementary Table 12). PCR products were verified through gel electrophoresis. Correct amplicons were used as templates in the second PCR reaction with RLuc_T7_F2 primer, hybridizing to the overhang sequence from RLuc_F1 and containing the T7 promoter, and backward primer RLuc_Ax_R2, hybridizing to the overhang sequence from RLuc_R1 oligo and introducing a poly(A) tail of a defined length (from 10 to 120 A). The resulting PCR products were assessed and purified by gel electrophoresis. The in vitro transcription reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h in a 50-µl reaction volume containing 600 pmol T7 template, 10 µl of 5× transcription buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, 30 mM MgCl2, 10 mM spermidine and 50 mM NaCl), 5 µl of rNTP mix (20 mM each), 5 µl of 100 mM DTT, 0.5 µl of 1% Triton X-100, 80 U ribonuclease inhibitor and 100 U T7 RNA polymerase. Then, DNA template was removed with TURBO DNase (Ambion) for the next 15 min. Spike-in RNAs were phenol–chloroform extracted, precipitated, visually assessed by denaturing electrophoresis, purified on RNA purification beads and used as controls in DRS runs. In each DRS run, a mixture of spike-ins representing RNAs with poly(A) tail of defined lengths (10 A, 15 A, 30 A, 45 A, 60 A, 90 A and 120 A) was included.

The EGFP and reporter mRNAs were IVT from plasmid template and double-stranded DNA fragments, respectively. Template for transcription of EGFP mRNA was prepared as follows: the high-RSCU EGFP32 CDS was purchased from Invitrogen and cloned into the plasmid vector pJAZZ (Lucigen) using BigEasy-TSA competent bacteria (Lucigen), providing it with the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of the mRNA-1273, a poly(A) tail of 90 A and the T7 promoter Φ6.5 (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG). The plasmid was digested at the poly(A) tail terminus (PaqCI, NEB) and was verified to be completely digested through agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA template was purified by buffered phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Templates for transcription of reporter mRNAs were prepared in a PCR reaction (Supplementary Note 6 and Extended Data Fig. 8a,b) as follows: full-length CDSs of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein (PfCSP_3D7; NCBI reference sequence: XP_001351122.1; Extended Data Fig. 7h), OVA (sequence available at https://www.trilinkbiotech.com/) and Zika virus protein E (ZIKVE; NCBI reference sequence: YP_002790881.1) with UTRs from either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were synthesized using the GeneArt service (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For OVA and ZIKVE constructs, an N-terminal ER signal peptide sequence was added (MFVFLVLLPLVSSQCV). All CDSs were optimized for expression in mouse cells using software from Benchling (https://www.benchling.com/). DNAs were PCR-amplified using primers complementary to UTRs with overhangs introducing the RNA T7 promoter Φ6.5 (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail from either mRNA-1273 or Pfizer BNT162b2 and either with or without a TCTAG pentamer at the 3′ end (Supplementary Table 12). In the case of OVA DNAs, an additional set was PCR-amplified as described above, but with primers with a point mutation in the T7 promoter sequence, allowing for efficient cotranscriptional RNA capping (TAATACGACTCACTATAAGG). PCR products were verified through agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with KAPA Pure Beads (KAPA Biosystems).

The composition of the in vitro transcription reaction was: 40–80 ng µl−1 of DNA template, transcription buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, 26 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM spermidine and 10 mM DTT), T7 RNA polymerase36 (0.04 µg µl−1, in-house prepared), 5 mM ATP/CTP (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5 mM N1meΨTP (Advent Bio) or UTP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4 mM GTP (in the case of EGFP and OVA reporter mRNAs intended for cotranscriptional capping; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 5 mM GTP (in the case of all other reporter mRNAs; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The reaction mixtures were supplemented with 1 U µl−1 RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.002 U µl−1 inorganic pyrophosphatase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and, in the case of EGFP and OVA reporter mRNAs intended for cotranscriptional capping, 10 mM of the trinucleotide Cap1 analogue m7GpppAmpG37 (in-house prepared). The reactions were performed for 120 min at 37 °C. In vitro transcription products were verified through denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and FPLC-purified using a 0.2 ml GoPure column with POROS Oligo (dT)25 Affinity Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The concentration of purified mRNAs was determined using UV absorbance measurements. The purity and integrity of the RNA preparations were determined by the automated electrophoresis system (TapeStation 2200, Agilent Technologies; Extended Data Fig. 8c). The reporter RNAs (except EGFP and cotranscriptionally capped OVA) were then provided with Cap1 using the Vaccinia Capping System (NEB) and Cap 2′-O-methyltransferase (NEB) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the replacement of the manufacturer's VCE with the in-house prepared one38. Capped mRNAs were purified with KAPA Pure Beads (KAPA Biosystems). The purity and integrity of the mRNA preparations were determined by automated electrophoresis (TapeStation 2200, Agilent Technologies; Extended Data Fig. 7d).

Two micrograms of RNA isolated from a sample of mRNA-1273 vaccine was denatured in the presence of 20 U RNAse OUT (10777019, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 65 °C for 3 min, and immediately placed on ice. An inosine (I)-tailing reaction was performed with 0.5 mM ITP (inosine triphosphate), 1× NEB 2.0 buffer (B7002, NEB) and 2 U poly(U) polymerase (M0337S, NEB) at 37 °C for 45 min, and was terminated by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. I-tailed RNA was cleaned twice on KAPA Pure Beads (7983298001, Roche) in a 1× ratio and used for DRS library preparation. I-tailed samples require ligation of a special adaptor RTA_C10, which contains 10 cytosines at the 3′ end: 5′-GAGGCGAGCGGTCAATTTTCCTA AGAGCAAGAAGAAGCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′. To make the I-tailing-specific RTA adaptor, we followed the ONT Direct RNA Sequencing—Sequence-Specific protocol; 0.5 µg of I-tailed mRNA-1273 was taken to the first ligation step of DRS library preparation. Library preparation was performed as described in the Direct RNA Sequencing (ONT, SQK-RNA002) protocol.

DRS was performed as described previously3. For raw vaccine isolate, up to 0.5 µg of RNA was used for library preparation. For RNA isolates obtained from cell cultures or mouse tissues, 3.5–5 µg of total mRNA was mixed with 50–200 ng oligo-(dT)25-enriched mRNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and standards with predefined poly(A) lengths, and was processed with a Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA002, ONT) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For cDNA sequencing, 400 ng of total RNA was used for library preparation using the cDNA-PCR Sequencing Kit (SQK-PCS111) or PCR-cDNA Barcoding Kit (SQK-PCB111.24 or SQK-PCB114.24) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Libraries were amplified with 14 cycles of PCR reaction, and the DNA concentration was measured using the Qubit 1× dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit (Invitrogen, Q33231). Then, if multiplexed, they were diluted and mixed equally to reach a final concentration of 60–100 fmol.

cDNA libraries for sequencing with an additional amplification step of mRNA-1273 (applicable for samples with an expected low prevalence of vaccine mRNA, such as cells sorted from vaccine injection sites) were prepared using the standard SQK-PCS111 protocol with the following modification. After synthesis of the first cDNA strand, samples from the reverse transcription reaction were pre-amplified in a 12-cycle PCR reaction with RTP and SSPII_Mod_2 (specific for mRNA-1273, with UMI sequence TTTCTGTTGGTGCTGATATTGCTTTVVVVTTVVVVTTVVVVTTVVVVTTTCCACCGACAACACCTTCGTGAGCGG) primers using the LongAmp Hot Start Taq Master Mix. The reaction products were then purified on Kappa beads, washed with SFB buffer, eluted with H2O and used for the subsequent PCR reaction with barcoded primers, performed according to the SQK-PCB111-24 protocol (14 cycles, 5 min amplification). Finally, cDNA concentrations were measured with Qubit and 12 libraries containing a total of around 60 ng cDNA were used for ligation with the RAPT adapter and sequenced.

Sequencing was performed using R9.4 (for DRS and v.11 DNA chemistry) or R10.4 (for v.14 DNA chemistry) flow cells on a MinION device (ONT) and with the Flow Cell Priming Kit (EXP-FLP002). Raw data were basecalled using Guppy (ONT) in the case of DRS, or dorado (ONT) in the case of cDNA sequencing. Raw sequencing data (fast5 or pod5 files) were deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, project PRJEB53190; Supplementary Table 13).

Basecalled nanopore reads were mapped to the respective transcriptome references (Gencode 26 or Gencode 38 for mouse and human samples, respectively) using Minimap2 2.17 with options -k 14 -ax map-ont –secondary=no, and processed with Samtools 1.9 to filter out supplementary alignments and read mapping to reverse strand (Samtools view -b -F 2320). The poly(A) tail lengths for each read were estimated using the nanopolish 0.13.2 polya function23.

For the analysis of mRNA-1273-originating reads, the nanopolish polya algorithm was modified (Supplementary Note 2) to (1) include unmapped reads enabling the analysis of poly(A) lengths for sDTW-identified reads (Supplementary Note 1) and (2) detect mΨCmΨAG at the 3′ end of the poly(A) tail and report its presence in the output.

For the analysis of BNT162b2-originating reads, the nanopolish polya algorithm was modified analogously (Supplementary Note 3) to (1) include unmapped reads enabling the analysis of poly(A) lengths for sDTW-identified reads and (2) detect two poly(A) segments interleaved with a 10-nt linker and report their lengths in the output.

For cDNA barcoded libraries (SQK-PCB111-24), raw sequencing data were basecalled with either dorado 0.5.3 or dorado 0.7.0 with parallel mapping to relevant reference (with option –secondary=no to exclude secondary alignments) and poly(A) detection turned on with the option –estimate-poly-a. Basecalled bam files were demultiplexed with dorado demux and sorted with samtools sort. Poly(A) lengths for each sequencing read were extracted from the pt:i tag (in the basecalled bam file) with a Python script. In the case of mRNA-1273 samples, the read sequence was also used for identifying the terminal pentamer from the basecalled sequence using regular expressions.

P values for each transcript were estimated using the Kruskal–Wallis test and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Transcripts were considered as having a significant change in poly(A) tail length if the adjusted P value was less than 0.05 and if there were at least 20 supporting reads for each condition.

Illumina RNA-seq reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38, ENSEMBL, release 94) using the STAR aligner (v.2.7.6a)39. Read counts were assigned to genes using featureCounts from the Subread package (v.2.0.1) with options -Q 10 -p -B -C -s 2 -g gene_id -t exon and the respective annotation file (Gencode v.M25). Multimappers and reads overlapping multiple features were not counted. Nanopore read counts were derived from the nanopolish polya output files, used for the analyses of poly(A) tail lengths. Reads assigned for each gene were summarized and obtained counts were used for subsequent analyses.

Differential expression analysis was performed with the DESeq2 (v.1.22) Bioconductor package40, using a likelihood ratio test for data from time-course experiments. Pair-wise comparisons of each time point were calculated with the Wald test, with log fold change values shrunk using the apeglm method. Genes with similar expression patterns were clustered with hierarchical clustering using the ward.D method and z-scored expression values for each gene. Heat maps were drawn with the ComplexHeatmap package41. g:Profiler42 or ClusterProfiler were used for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Genes were assigned as immune response genes (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7) if they were annotated to GO (Biological Process) terms GO:0140374, GO:0090714, GO:0034340, GO:0034341, GO:0034342, GO:0045087 or GO:0035455.

Codon usage indices were analysed using the coRdon (https://github.com/BioinfoHR/coRdon) and cubar (https://github.com/mt1022/cubar) R packages. To compute the codon adaptation index, a reference set of 500 highly expressed genes in mBMDMs, based on a previous study7, was provided. For calculating the effective number of codons, codon bias or preference within the vertebrate context was used. The frequency of optimal codons was determined on the basis of the occurrence frequency of each amino acid in reference sequences. The mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were compared against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein reference sequence from GenBank (accession: NC_045512.2:21563-25384), mouse endogenous transcripts (protein-coding), transcript groups selected by GO terms (for example, associated with the membrane or endoplasmic reticulum) and potential substrates of TENT5A and TENT5C, selected as per a previous study7, as well as IVT reporter sequences for OVA, PfCSP and ZikVE. GC content and other sequence features were assessed using functions available from Bioconductor and the GenRCA Rare Codon Analysis Tool (https://www.genscript.com/tools/rare-codon-analysis), providing mouse as the host organism and the Kazusa database as the codon usage reference. The results of the analyses were visualized with ggplot2.

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Statistical analysis was performed on data from two or more biologically independent experimental replicates using the R environment or Prism 6 software unless otherwise stated. The statistical tests used in each instance are provided in the figure legends.

Data from the analyses of poly(A) tail length are presented as scatter dot plots, as indicated in the figure legends, and individual data points are shown. The median of poly(A) length is shown on the plots (as a horizontal bar and a numeric value) for mRNA populations with processed poly(A) tails (that is, without the terminal pentamer in the case of mRNA-1273, OVA, PfCSP and ZikVE reporters, or for all the reads in the case of BNT162b2); the mean value would be biased because poly(A) lengths do not follow a normal distribution. Plots indicate fractions of reads with elongated (blue-shaded) or shortened (red-shaded) tails. Classification thresholds (deadenylation and re-adenylation) were estimated as values close to the 0.2 and 0.8 quantiles (respectively) from crude vaccine RNA (with pentamer in the case of mRNA-1273). In the case of DRS data, the thresholds were set at 85 and 115 for mRNA-1273 and 95 and 125 for BNT162b2. For cDNA sequencing analysis with dorado, which usually gives shorter estimates of poly(A) tail length, the thresholds were set at 80 and 110 for mRNA-1273 tails and 50 and 80 for BNT162b2 tails (analysis was performed without additional segmentation, so the length of the last poly(A) segment was reported).

Most of the experiments were repeated at least twice, leading to comparable results, with the exception of the mRNA-1273 treatment of A549 cells and the viability assays, which were repeated once. Samples with clear technical failures during tissue collection, cell isolation, processing or data collection were excluded from the analyses.

For the first time — and despite fears that it might never happen — nations have agreed a series of measures to prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics. The terms of the first global pandemic accord were still being hashed out at the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, up until the early hours of 16 April.

“This is a definitive moment in the history of global health,” says Lawrence Gostin, a specialist in health law and policy at Georgetown University in Washington DC, who followed the negotiations closely. The accord “sets out some very important norms to keep the world safe”, he says.

What the WHO's new treaty could mean for the next pandemic

The accord was agreed without the United States, which withdrew from the pandemic treaty the day that President Trump was inaugurated. This reduces its power, says Gostin, but is also a source of strength. “Instead of collapsing in the face of President Trump's assault on global health, the world came together.”

The treaty is not perfect but represents a major achievement, says Michelle Childs, policy advocacy director at the non-profit organization Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative in Geneva. “People didn't think that they'd get to this stage of agreeing at all.”

“I even have goosebumps because I can't believe we finally finished,” says Precious Matsoso, co-chair of the WHO intergovernmental negotiating body created to draft the treaty in 2021. “It's been a long journey.”

The treaty lays out the broad outline of a ‘pathogen access and benefit sharing' system, which grants pharmaceutical companies access to scientific data such as pathogen samples and genomic sequences in return for more equitable sharing of drugs, vaccines and diagnostics during a pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines were much slower to be distributed in developing countries compared with richer ones, and some countries accused others of hoarding vaccines.

A sticking point for the treaty — which has taken more than three years to negotiate — was satisfying poorer countries “that the inequities that we saw in COVID will be addressed”, says Childs. Countries with strong pharmaceutical industries, meanwhile, were concerned about agreeing to share their technology. “It started with some member states saying ‘no'”, says Matsoso. “But eventually over time I think there was what I would call the voice of reason.”

Negotiating a pandemic treaty is just the first step — how will countries comply?

Negotiating a pandemic treaty is just the first step — how will countries comply?

The details of how exactly the system will work have yet to be hashed out. But the accord states that there must be provisions for “rapid and timely” sharing of information and that manufacturers participating in the agreement must make at least 20% of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics that they produce available to the WHO during a pandemic.

A spokesperson for the Geneva-based International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations says it's important that the agreement is translated into a “practical plan” that incentivizes companies of all sizes to invest in research on pathogens. “Innovation is not guaranteed. It requires the right environment to thrive.”

The draft agreement will be presented at the World Health Assembly in May and will need to be ratified by member states if adopted, a process that could take months or years. 

As well as promoting equitable access to health products, the treaty states that countries should “promote and otherwise facilitate or incentivize” the exchange of technology and know-how to enable manufacturers in developing nations to produce their own drugs and vaccines. “That should help poorer regions like Africa to become more self-sufficient in the face of a pandemic,” says Gostin.

Metrics details

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and accurately predicting individual risk is critical for prevention. Here we aimed to integrate unmodifiable risk factors, such as age and genetics, with modifiable risk factors, such as clinical and biometric measurements, into a meta-prediction framework that produces actionable and personalized risk estimates. In the initial development of the model, ~2,000 predictive features were considered, including demographic data, lifestyle factors, physical measurements, laboratory tests, medication usage, diagnoses and genetics. To power our meta-prediction approach, we stratified the UK Biobank into two primary cohorts: first, a prevalent CAD cohort used to train predictive models for cross-sectional prediction at baseline and prospective estimation of contributing risk factor levels and diagnoses (baseline models) and, second, an incident CAD cohort using, in part, these baseline models as meta-features to train a final CAD incident risk prediction model. The resultant 10-year incident CAD risk model, composed of 15 derived meta-features with multiple embedded polygenic risk scores, achieves an area under the curve of 0.84. In an independent test cohort from the All of Us research program, this model achieved an area under the curve of 0.81 for predicting 10-year incident CAD risk, outperforming standard clinical scores and previously developed integrative models. Moreover, this framework enables the generation of individualized risk reduction profiles by quantifying the potential impact of standard clinical interventions. Notably, genetic risk influences the extent to which these interventions reduce overall CAD risk, allowing for tailored prevention strategies.

This composite figure provides two views of the importance of the final 50 features used in prospective 10-year CAD meta-prediction for the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419). The left panel displays a bar plot ranking the features in order of importance as quantified by the mean absolute SHAP value. The length of each bar represents the magnitude of a feature's importance. The right panel presents a SHAP summary plot with each point representing the feature's SHAP value at an individual level. Color coding represents the feature value (red for high, blue for low). Positive values correspond to the prediction contribution to the positive class, and negative values correspond to the prediction contribution to the negative class. Abbreviations: Dx: Diagnosis; MUF: modifiable and unmodifiable factors; UF: unmodifiable factors.

This figure evaluates the performance of the meta-prediction model compared to existing clinical risk scores within the test set of the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419), highlighting both the model's calibration and the predictive contribution of distinct feature categories. a. Calibration plot showing the predicted vs. observed 10-year CAD risk by decile. Brier's scores are provided as a summary calibration measure. Conventional risk scores were re-calibrated using the same approach within the UK Biobank training cohort. b. Predictive performance of individual feature categories and their combinations in the meta-prediction model. The left panel illustrates the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) for various models. The right panel shows the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). The models compared include the full meta-prediction model, partial models restricted to a single feature class and feature class combination, including 15 meta-features; 22 polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and 13 modifiable risk factors (MFs); 13 MFs; sex and age with 12 PRSs; 12 PRSs; and sex and age alone. Abbreviation: MF: Modifiable factors.

This figure compares the predictive performance of our final perspective 10-year CAD meta-prediction model to established clinical risk scores, including PCE, QRISK3, PREVENT, and previous polygenic score benchmarks including GPSCAD, metaGRSCAD, Aragam2022, Tcheandjieu2022, and GPSMult, as well as ML models including ML4HEN-COX and UKBCRP using the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419). For each model, the left panel depicts a scatter plot illustrating the incidence of CAD events across percentile bins of predicted risk, showcasing the predictive density of each model at 10-years of follow-up, while the right panel displays the 10-year cumulative risk trajectories for each risk prediction model, highlighting the ability of each model to stratify risk across time. Shaded regions in the right panel represent 95% confidence intervals (CI). In all cases, meta-prediction significantly outperforms prior approaches.

This figure presents a comprehensive collection of SHAP summary plots for each of the 35 meta-features integrated into the meta-prediction for the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419). Each subplot provides insight into the contribution of individual baseline features towards the prediction of each meta-feature. The color coding indicates each feature value (red = high, blue = low), with the SHAP value on the y-axis reflecting the impact on the model's output (positive = contribution to the positive class, negative = contribution to the negative class). Abbreviations: Dx: Diagnosis; MUF: modifiable and unmodifiable factors; UF: unmodifiable factors.

Comparative test accuracy for the streamlined meta-prediction model in UKBB (AUROC = 0.81) versus AoU external validation with bootstrapping 95% confidence interval (CI) as the shaded part. a. Tested on the larger AoU validation cohort (AUROC = 0.81), further stratified by self-reported European (EUR), Africna (AFR) and Hispanic (HIS) groups; AoU-EHR (AUROC = 0.81), AoU-AFR (AUROC = 0.79), and AoU-HIS (AUROC = 0.84) respectively. b. And tested in the AoU sub-cohort with complete phenotypes (AUROC = 0.78). Additional conditions tested in AoU include PCE (AUC = 0.72), QRISK3 (AUC = 0.73), and PREVENT (AUC = 0.73). Abbreviations: AoU: All of Us research program; AUC: area under curve; UKBB: UK Biobank.

Both panels display the total 50 features contributing to the streamlined meta-prediction. The vertical axis orders each feature by its overall importance to risk prediction. Each point represents a participant and is color-coded according to the feature's direction of contribution to the individuals' risk prediction (red increased risk, blue decreased risk). The value associated with each point on the x-axis represents the magnitude of its contribution to the individuals' risk prediction. The left panel presents the results from the test set of UK Biobank (n = 33,419). The right panel presents the results from the external validation set of All of Us research program (n = 198,424). Abbreviations: Dx: Diagnosis; MUF: modifiable and unmodifiable factors; UF: unmodifiable factors.

Using the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419), we demonstrated a. Calibration plot of generalizable genetic meta-prediction model for predicted vs observed risk by decile within the test set of the incident CAD cohort (Brier's score of generalizable genetic meta-prediction: 0.073). b. Cumulative risk curve of CAD (%) development over the 10-year follow-up period stratified by percentile of predicted risk. c. Incidence rates of CAD observed across the test cohort, stratified by percentile of predicted risk. Data are presented as mean values ± SD. d. and e. Comparative test accuracy (n = 33,419) for the generalizable genetic meta-prediction model (AUROC = 0.80; AUPRC = 0.28) versus other standard clinical and research risk scores, including PCE (AUROC = 0.73; AUPRC = 0.20), QRISK3 (AUROC = 0.74; AUPRC = 0.22), PREVENT (AUROC = 0.72; AUPRC = 0.19) and GPSCAD (AUROC = 0.73; AUPRC = 0.20). Abbreviations: AUC: Area under curve; CAD: coronary artery disease; EHR: electric health records; PCE: pool cohort equations.

This composite figure provides two views of the importance of the final 50 features used in prospective 10-year CAD meta-prediction of generalizable genetic model for the incident CAD cohort (n = 33,419). The left panel displays a bar plot ranking the features in order of importance as quantified by the mean absolute SHAP value. The length of each bar represents the magnitude of a feature's importance. The right panel presents a SHAP summary plot with each point representing the feature's SHAP value at an individual level. Color coding represents the feature value (red for high, blue for low). Positive values correspond to the prediction contribution to the positive class, and negative values correspond to the prediction contribution to the negative class. Abbreviations: Dx: Diagnosis; MUF: modifiable and unmodifiable factors; UF: unmodifiable factors.

This figure demonstrates the preservation of variable distributions pre- and post- imputation, stratified by sex. For numeric features, density plots are presented, with bolded edges representing the distribution pre-imputation and light edges post-imputation. For categorical features, two sets of stacked histograms are presented side by side for comparison: on the left are the original distributions pre-imputation, and on the right are the distributions post-imputation of missing data.

Pluripotent stem cells have special properties: they can proliferate almost indefinitely and have the capacity to differentiate into any cell that makes up an individual. These cells are found naturally in embryos, but can also be artificially induced from certain adult cells. Under the right conditions, both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be driven to differentiate into various types of cell, and efforts to produce differentiated cells from human pluripotent stem cells for clinical use have gathered pace over the past few decades. Writing in Nature, Sawamoto et al.1 and Tabar et al.2 report on clinical trials that harness pluripotent stem cells for the possible treatment of Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide.

Metrics details

Short-read RNA-seq studies of grafted plants have led to the proposal that thousands of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) move over long distances between plant tissues1,2,3,4,5,6,7, potentially acting as signals8,9,10,11,12. Transport of mRNAs between cells and tissues has been shown to play a role in several physiological and developmental processes in plants, such as tuberization13, leaf development14 and meristem maintenance15; yet for most mobile mRNAs, the biological relevance of transport remains to be determined16,17,18,19. Here we perform a meta-analysis of existing mobile mRNA datasets and examine the associated bioinformatic pipelines. Taking technological noise, biological variation, potential contamination and incomplete genome assemblies into account, we find that a high percentage of currently annotated graft-mobile transcripts are left without statistical support from available RNA-seq data. This meta-analysis challenges the findings of previous studies and current views on mRNA communication.

A key step in mobile mRNA studies is the assignment of RNA-seq reads to different genotypes. One way of identifying the genotype is based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Fig. 1). Typically, a requirement is made for a defined number of RNA-seq reads to have a SNP that corresponds to the alternative allele for a transcript to be assigned to a foreign genotype. Published criteria are: ≥1 RNA-seq read covering at least two SNPs3, ≥2 reads3, ≥3 reads20 or >3 reads2 covering a single SNP. When these criteria are met, the corresponding transcript is defined as mobile.

Grafting-based strategy for identification of mRNAs that move from shoot (scion) to root (stock), from genotype 2 to genotype 1, using a scion:stock = genotype 2:genotype 1 heterograft. The same strategy can be used to identify transcripts that move from shoot to root from genotype 1 to genotype 2 using a genotype 1:genotype 2 graft. Transcripts that move root to shoot can be identified by analysing mRNAs in shoot tissue. Natural grafts, such as those established between the parasitic dodder plant and its host plants, can be used in place of artificial grafts. A key challenge in all such approaches is how to assign transcripts to each genotype; methods for doing so are based on (1) SNP identification or on (2) the alignment to different reference genomes. For grafts from the same species, or similar genotypes, SNPs can be used to distinguish between genotypes and thus identify the source genotype of each transcript (1). For grafts between different species, mapping (2) each RNA-seq read to the genome assemblies can be an effective method for determining which transcripts are specific to one species.

As previously reported21, criteria based on absolute numbers of reads, such as those above, exhibit a read-depth dependency (Extended Data Fig. 1). This is a consequence of sequencing noise.

Illumina sequencing machines produce base-calling errors at a rate of ~0.1–1% per base22,23. Sequencing providers often provide a quality assurance, for instance, that 85% of the reads have a Phred quality score of at least Q30 (that is, a base-calling error of less than 10−3 = 0.1%). However, base-calling inaccuracies are not the only source of error. Before sequencing, reverse transcriptases can introduce base changes with an error rate of ~0.001–0.01%; the reverse transcription reaction error may exhibit a nucleotide bias, for instance, ‘G' to ‘A'24,25, and a range of other artefacts26. On average, 6.4 ± 1.24% of sequences are mutated22. The average error rate of next-generation sequencing technologies has been estimated as 0.24 ± 0.06% per base22,27, with RNA-seq errors tending to be higher27.

We therefore investigated whether noise in RNA-seq may influence the identification of mobile mRNAs. Figure 2a lists how many reported mobile mRNAs have numbers of reads with SNP occurrences that are consistent with an assumed error rate21,28. As an example, for an accuracy of SNP calling of 99.97% (that is, 0.03% sequencing noise, Phred score Q35, and an error probability for the alternative allele of ~0.01%), the evidence for 1,086 out of 2,006 (54%) and 384 out of 1,130 (34%) previously identified mobile mRNAs2,3 is in line with what would be expected from sequencing noise (Fig. 2a).

a, Total numbers of reported mobile mRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana2 and Vitis girdiana3 that can be explained by expected sequencing noise. Two values for the probability of the sequenced nucleotide at a SNP position being assigned to an alternative allele are given: 0.01% and 0.1%. b,c, The distributions of nucleotides at SNP and other positions (‘non-SNP') can be informative for evaluating the evidence for the alternative allele. b, Histograms of the ratio of the number reads that match the alternative allele, n, over the number of reads of local and foreign reads, N, for each SNP position in the mobile population on examples from Arabidopsis2. Several SNPs have reads that match the alternative allele (n/N > 0). c, Histograms of the ratio of the number reads that match the second most frequent nucleotide, m, over the sum of the number of reads over the most frequent and second most frequent nucleotide, M, for neighbouring positions to SNPs. An exact two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test does not find significant differences in the distributions over SNPs and other positions (D = 0.089302, P = 0.3575). A Welch two-sample t-test (P = 0.6421), Wilcox rank sum test (P = 0.6388) or an exact two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (P = 0.4065) does not support the values for SNPs being higher than other positions. d,e, Of the 2,006 previously identified mobile mRNAs2, 953 unique mobile mRNAs were found in only 1 replicate in different organs of an adult Ped-0:Col-0 (root:shoot) graft. Such high numbers are not consistent with our hypothesis of sequencing noise and biological variation. Investigating the reciprocal relationship between root alleles that were detected in the rosette (d) and vice versa (e), in the root (1,373 mRNAs/867 unique) and rosette (577 mRNAs/151 unique) samples, identifies a strong linear correlation (P = 2 × 10−16) between expression in the source tissue and potential mobility. Interestingly, those SNPs that lie towards the lower read depth in each plot deviate the most from the linear relationship. However, these transcripts have low read numbers only in the ‘source' tissue, whereas they have high read numbers in the sampled tissue and reads over SNPs that are consistent with sequencing errors. These plots thus show two effects: sequencing noise + either non-selective transport across the whole transcriptome or contamination.

One way to increase the accuracy of detecting foreign transcripts is to consider multiple SNPs per read. If SNPs are located closely together, then a single RNA-seq read may cover more than one SNP. Accounting for co-occurring SNPs on the same read leads to the multiplication of their probabilities, resulting in higher accuracy (less likely to occur by chance), less pronounced read-depth dependence than single SNP criteria (Extended Data Fig. 1) and greater confidence in these reads being from a foreign genotype. We therefore examined reads over co-occurring SNPs (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). In the Arabidopsis homograft datasets2, we found a total of 1,753,179 reads covering more than 1 SNP in the root and 1,977,539 in the shoot of Col-0; of these 1,675 (0.10%) and 1,797 (0.091%), respectively, had reads supporting the alternative allele for at least 1 but not all SNPs. These inconsistent calls are in line with the notion that sequencing noise may confound the identification of mobile mRNAs. We found 29 reads (1.6 × 10−3%) in the root and 2 reads (1.0 × 10−4%) in the shoot for which all SNPs supported the alternative allele. Interestingly in Ped-0 homograft data, the proportion of reads with full support for the alternative allele was significantly higher (0.038% in the root, 0.12% in the shoot). Investigating these co-occurring SNPs revealed another confounding factor in the identification of mobile mRNA; several loci showed apparent heterozygosity in the Ped-0 ecotype (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Such apparent heterozygosity could be caused by a lack of introgression or gene copy-number variation; it has been estimated that 10% of the annotated genes in Arabidopsis have copy-number variation29,30. Differences in gene copy numbers can lead to reads not mapping correctly, which gives rise to pseudo-SNPs and pseudo-heterozygosity29,30. Of the 2,570 genes assigned as pseudo-heterozygous30, we found 188 mobile transcripts2 (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 4). We identified 19 transcripts in the Ped-0 samples that are likely caused by mismapping; interestingly, these include transcripts that frequently fulfill the criteria for being classified as mobile (Supplementary Table 3). Thus, in addition to technological noise, there are also biological causes that could be falsely interpreted as SNPs of an alternative allele. As a consequence, it becomes important to not rely solely on Phred scores for estimating errors in SNP assignments. We next sought to estimate this background noise level, that is, the frequency for finding the alternative allele when the alternative allele is not actually present. This value can be estimated from available Arabidopsis homograft data2. We counted the number of RNA-seq reads in the homograft with a SNP that matched the foreign genotype. For Arabidopsis homograft datasets (ecotypes Col-0 and Ped-0), these background noise levels were 0.084% (Col-0:Col-0 root), 0.082% (Col-0:Col-0 shoot), 0.68% (Ped-0:Ped-0 root) and 0.51% (Ped-0:Ped-0 shoot). The higher background error rate in Ped-0 is consistent with more Col-0 transcripts being identified as mobile in sampled Ped-0 tissue2. For an average background error rate of 0.34%, we find that over 1,455 out of 2,006 (>73%) and over 945 out of 1,130 (>84%) of annotated mobile mRNAs would not be distinguishable from expected errors (Fig. 2a). Consistent with this, poor overlap between experiments has been noted18,31, orthologues in closely related species exhibit conflicting mobility, and reported low ratios of mobile to endogenous mRNAs3,5,7 are in line with the level of noise.

Another way to distinguish noise from potential evidence for the alternative allele is to investigate the differences in nucleotide distributions at SNP positions compared to other positions in the sequence (non-SNP positions). If a second genotype were present, we would expect the distribution of nucleotides at any SNP position to be enriched in the nucleotide that supports the alternative allele. Furthermore, mRNAs that are transported to cells with low endogenous level (potential signals) would have a value of n/N close to 1, where n is the number of reads that match the alternative allele and N the total number of reads (endogenous + foreign). We investigated the distribution of n/N for each SNP in the mobile population of Arabidopsis2. While we do not find evidence for n/N values close to 1, there are non-zero values of n/N that seem to support the presence of the alternative allele (Fig. 2b). However, looking at all neighbouring positions of SNPs and computing the number of reads with the second most frequent nucleotide, m, over the sum of the most frequent and second most frequent nucleotides, M, we find no support for the SNP positions being different (P = 0.3575) (Fig. 2c). Thus, the expected shift in the distribution towards higher n/N values, that is n/N > m/M, is not observed. Given the low prevalence, it is important to note that this analysis does not exclude there being instances, potentially even thousands, of reads with SNPs associated with mobile mRNAs in the data, but if so we cannot distinguish them from noise.

Interestingly, two samples from Arabidopsis2 do contain numbers of foreign reads that exceed expected noise levels. Investigating further, we find that these samples exhibit a strong linear correlation between the read counts of the grafted tissues (Fig. 2d,e). Similarly, Arabidopsis transcripts found in Cuscuta pentagona correlate with the expression levels in the host genotype1. Finding constant proportions of a whole transcriptome is indicative of contamination. Another explanation is that the whole transcriptome is transported, with detection being proportional to read depth. Given the available data, we cannot distinguish between these possibilities.

Approaches that do not rely on SNPs, such as for cross-species studies, might avoid some of the above issues. A typical pipeline for analysing between-species grafts first maps reads to the reference genome of the sampled tissue (genotype 1 in Fig. 1). Unmapped reads are then compared to the reference genome of the potential source tissue (genotype 2 in Fig. 1). The success of this approach depends on the quality of the genome assembly. Supplementary Table 2 lists some genome completeness estimates for assemblies that were used in previous mobile mRNA studies. For instance, at the time of the study that investigated the movement of transcripts from a Nicotiana benthamiana scion to a Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) rootstock6, ~15% of the genome was not yet assembled (Extended Data Fig. 6). The authors therefore collected RNA-seq data and applied stringent mapping criteria to mitigate effects of using an incomplete assembly. However, repeating their procedure, we found that many reads that did not map to the tomato genome all aligned to small regions of the N. benthamiana genome, and that coverage was highly uneven over exons (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, blasting the reads identified as being from N. benthamiana against the whole NCBI nucleotide database resulted in 100% matches to highly conserved sequences contained within many genomes, including N. benthamiana and other Solanaceae species, in particular to 18S ribosomal RNA genes, which accounted for 97.7% of the blast hits to N. benthamiana (Extended Data Fig. 8). To test for false negatives, we mapped the heterograft reads directly to the N. benthamiana genome and found 16 short transcripts that could not be distinguished between genomes (Supplementary Table 4).

In addition to genome assembly quality, read depth can also bias the interpretation of RNA-seq data from grafts between different species (Extended Data Fig. 7). For instance, ~30% of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome was reported to move into Cuscuta pentagona, while only 9% of the tomato transcriptome moves to Cuscuta1. However, there is a large discrepancy in the amount of RNA-seq data between tomato (6 Mb) and Arabidopsis experiments (2 Gb). Greater coverage would be expected to lead to more transcripts being detected32,33,34, thus explaining the reported bias in mobility between species.

Overall, our study raises questions about published numbers of mobile mRNAs. The experimental evidence for movement of a small number of mRNAs over long distances in plants is compelling5,6,11,15,17,35,36. However, on the basis of RNA-seq studies, several thousand mobile transcripts have been reported1,2,3,4,6,7. Here we question this extrapolation from tens of validated cases to the published vast numbers of potential long-distance signalling agents.

We described several challenges in identifying mobile mRNAs from short-read RNA-seq data (Fig. 3). While we do not present solutions, we suggest checks that can be performed to reduce the risk of false positives. We thus end with a list of recommendations. We assume that experimental issues have been taken care of, such as checking the samples for cross-contamination, verifying that graft junctions form functional vascular connections, and every effort has been made to use high-quality genome assemblies.

(1) Technological noise can lead to challenges in the assignment of RNA-seq reads. In SNP-based methods of mobile mRNA detection, it is important to be able to differentiate between sequencing-associated errors and genuine SNPs. In the above case, an RNA-seq read with a ‘T' at the SNP position would be indicative of the read having come from the alternative allele, genotype 2. However, every position has an error rate and the higher the read depth, the more incorrect base calls are to be expected. Base changes could arise for reverse transcriptase or amplification steps, although their error rate is typically orders of magnitude lower than sequencing errors. Conserved regions in gene families can give rise to similar challenges in distinguishing mapping ambiguities from genuine SNPs. Defining an mRNA as being mobile based on thresholds of RNA-seq reads that contain a SNP can result in base-calling errors and mapping ambiguities biasing the interpretation. To reduce the risk of such events occurring, further stringent filters can be applied (for instance, using only SNPs that are bi-allelic2) or applying rigorous statistical comparisons (for instance, estimating the allele calling frequencies and comparing them between homograft and heterograft21). (2) Genome complexity and genome quality can lead to mapping challenges. Orthologous sequences (light green) can result in some RNA-seq reads aligning to a different gene and different genotype. Genome assemblies that are not complete (telomere to telomere) from exactly the same genotype as used for grafting can result in potential mismappings. The shaded blue gene in genotype 1 is missing in the reference genome assembly, resulting in RNA-seq reads from this transcript being mapped to genotype 2.

SNP reliability. A genome mapping visualization tool such as IGV37 can be used to check for pseudo-heterozygosity and contamination in the samples. Observing the distribution of nucleotides at potential SNP positions and comparing to other positions can provide confidence in the SNPs and the alternative allele calls. These distributions should be compared to those from homograft data.

Co-occurring SNPs. RNA-seq reads that cover multiple SNPs can be used to check whether the SNPs that are associated with a certain genotype co-occur in such reads. Long-read and direct RNA sequencing have higher error rates but would allow the full transcript with all SNPs to be assessed. Sequencing protocols that barcode individual molecules by using adapters with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can be used to determine the error rates and check whether all reads from the same molecule are consistent in terms of their genotype assignment.

Accuracy of experimental and computational procedures for identifying foreign RNA-seq reads. Calculating the ratio of the number of RNA-seq reads assigned to an alternative allele (foreign reads) over the total number of mapped RNA-seq reads for an experiment (foreign + endogenous reads) is a useful metric. This value should be computed for homografts and compared to the value calculated from heterograft data.

Reproducibility and consistency of putative mobile transcripts. Independent biological replicates should be used to characterize the inherent variability in the identification of candidate mobile transcripts. Reciprocal grafting is recommended to evaluate whether mobile mRNA and their orthologues are consistently mobile (if mobility motifs are inherent to transcripts, then near-identical sequences would be expected to also be mobile) and, if not, potentially pinpoint determinants of mobility.

Alternative hypotheses. Definitions for mobile mRNAs using non-validated criteria are best avoided. It is important to test different hypotheses (for example, SNP vs sequencing noise; read from a foreign genotype vs mapping error; transport vs contamination; signalling molecules vs leftovers from differentiating cells) to explain the data. The plausibility of associated mechanisms can lend weight to different hypotheses.

blastn -db nt -query unmapped.fasta -max_target_seqs 10 -max_hsps 1-evalue 1e-25

-outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident evalue staxids sscinames scomnames sskingdoms stitle'

If we are only interested in the number of reads that contain a SNP that corresponds to the alternative allele, we can use a binomial distribution (q is the probability the SNP matches the alternative allele, 1 − q is the probability that it does not) to evaluate the probability of this event occurring by chance21. The probabilities of errors occurring by chance were calculated from a standard cumulative binomial distribution, P(k ≥ m|N) = 1 − P(k < m∣N), which accounts for the requirement of having k reads, where k is at least m, out of N. Considering replicates can be handled in the same way (the probability of each SNP is computed from the cumulative binomial function and the requirement for a defined number of replicates can likewise be computed from a cumulative binomial function). Multiple SNPs per read results in a multiplication of probabilities. Cumulative binomial function values were computed using standard available functions in Python and R.

Rather than ‘defining' a transcript as mobile, we evaluated the probability of the data being consistent with expected noise against the probability of the data being best explained by the presence of two genotypes (and therefore potential candidates for mobile transcripts)21. Essentially, this means that if we find 10 out of 100 reads that match the alternative allele, we compute how likely this would occur by chance for a defined error rate. The implicit but rarely checked assumption in all SNP-based mobile mRNA detection pipelines is that the occurrence of reads that support the alternative allele in the heterograft data is larger than in homograft data. The uncertainty in the inferred error rate depends on the amount of data. We capture this uncertainty through probability distributions to inform inferences drawn from the data21. This ratio of the statistical evidence of one hypothesis over another is known as the Bayes factor43. The classifications in Fig. 2a are based on the commonly used value of log Bayes factor greater than 1 (refs. 21,43). The statistical comparison of error rates was performed using baymobil28.

To compare the full distributions of n/N and m/M values for different positions of RNA-seq reads, we used an exact two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, ks.test, available in R44. To evaluate whether the data supported the SNP distributions having higher values of n/N than other positions (m/M), we used an asymptotic two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. These tests were carried out for histograms with 100 bins.

We downloaded the pseudo-heterozygous data from https://zenodo.org/records/6025134 (ref. 30). From the vcf-file we extracted all heterozygous calls for accession 9947 (Ped-0) and obtained 6,303 heterozygous SNPs. We compared these SNPs against the MATRIX_GWAS_raw_position.txt (from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5702395). We intersected these potential duplicate genes with the list of mobile genes2 and found 19 duplicate genes. These are given in Supplementary Table 3.

We downloaded all the assemblies mentioned in the original papers and estimated their completeness with Abyss (v.1.9.0) using the command ‘abyss-fac'.

We analysed the samples of the root (1,373 mRNAs/867 unique) and rosette (577 mRNAs/151 unique), and reciprocally inspected the relationship between root alleles that were detected in the rosette and vice versa. We took the raw sequencing depth for 48,934 previously identified SNPs. For each SNP, we plotted the number of reads with a rosette allele (Col-0) found in the root sample (Ped-0) against the number of reads with the same SNP in the rosette sample. Similarly, we plotted the number of reads with the root allele (Ped-0) found in the rosette sample (Col) against the number of reads with the endogenous SNP (Ped-0) in the root sample. The linear fit was performed within gnuplot45.

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

We used the following published datasets and the archived reads from NCBI: Cuscuta pentagona1 (PRJNA257158; this dataset was incomplete and partly corrupt); Vitis vinifera3 (SRP058158 and SRP058157); Solanum lycopersicum, Nicotiana benthamiana6 (SRP111187); Arabidopsis thaliana2 (PRJNA271927). We used deposited supplementary datasets of the associated publications to obtain the numbers of identified mRNAs. For each of the graft studies, we downloaded the reference genome sequence that matched the one that was used in the original paper with the same annotations; most are publicly available in Ensembl plants46.

We used largely available software packages as stated in the Methods. All code and scripts are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/mtomtom/reanalysis-mobile-mrna/tree/main (ref. 38).

These plots show the probabilities of transcripts being defined as mobile by chance. Three different mobile mRNA definitions (a, b, c) and their dependence on read-depth (N) and on the rate of a SNP matching to the alternate allele (q) are depicted. The number of read counts over one SNP that correspond to the alternate allele is denoted by n1SNP, over two SNPs by n2SNPs. The probabilities were calculated using a cumulative binomial distribution, that is we account only for the nucleotides that correspond to the two alleles of interest. Note that both axes are on a log-scale. The requirement for co-occurring SNPs on one read (c) is more stringent and less likely to occur by chance at higher read-depths. For low values of q, these criteria are robust up to moderately high (several hundred) read-depths and would be unlikely to occur by chance.

a, SNPs can be in close proximity, and therefore it can happen that several SNPs are recorded in the same RNA-Seq read. In this example, genotype 1 has three SNPs very close to each other: A, G and A (yellow bar). In genotype 2, we find G, T, A (magenta bar) in those positions. In this schematic example, reads from the shoot of Genotype 1 are mapped to Genotype 2. If all covered loci carry the allele of Genotype 2, we are observing evidence for the read being from Genotype 2 and the associated transcript being potentially mobile. On the other hand, if only one loci carries the allele of Genotype 2, the outcome is inconclusive, as it may indicate sequencing errors. b, A. thaliana is a selfing species, so we expect homozygocity at all positions for all reads mapping to the genome at all positions. However, for duplicated genes (magenta) in Genotype 1, which may be single copy genes in Genotype 2 (yellow), short read sequencing and mapping to Genotype 2, can give rise to what appears to be heterozygocity. When there are two alleles present in the homograft data (magenta and yellow), we may be observing pseudo-heterozygocity. See also Extended Data Figure 3.

a, There are two SNPs, G and C in Genotype 1 (Col) and A and T in Genotype 2 (Ped). These are likely two sequencing errors in the root sample, a C at a non-SNP position and an A at a SNP position (both highlighted in blue circles). In the shoot sample we see potential evidence for mobility at the SNP level but in one case the second SNP is not present and in the other case another sequencing error has occurred (G). Three further sequencing errors (two As on the top left, one A on the right) are also present in the shoot. b, This example shows two positions, A and T in Genotype 1 (Col) and G and G in Genotype 2 (Ped), for which some reads support the alternate allele (green tick), whereas others are likely sequencing errors (red cross). In the latter case, one G is in the correct position but the other G is not present and a further mismatch (T) has occurred. See Figure 2 for further explanations. The images are annotated screenshots taken in IGV37. Data taken from2.

At the highlighted positions there are distinct populations of alleles (depicted as red/blue and red/green bars). This is possibly due to the gene being duplicated in Ped, resulting in pseudoheterozygocity.

a, Sequenced transcripts would ideally have RNA-Seq reads covering most of the sequence, that is that all exons of the mRNA are approximately equally covered by sequenc- ing reads (top left). Reads covering all exons in the sample from Genotype 2 provide support for the whole transcript having moved from Genotype 1 to Genotype 2 across the graft junction. Transcripts with coverage only for a subsequence (bottom left) do not support full-length presence of the for- eign transcript. b, Neighbouring positions to SNPs can be used as a negative control to evaluate the strength of the signal at SNP positions. Shown here are neighbouring positions of the identified SNPs at the next nucleotide (SNP position +1). If the neighbouring position shows similar levels of alter- native nucleotides as the SNP position, the these are likely sequencing errors, rather than evidence for the alternate allele. If the SNP positions have a different frequency of Genotype 2 allele than the neighbouring position has errors, then there is evidence for the alternate allele. Analysing the fre- quencies of nucleotides at known SNP positions and their neighbours can aid data interpretation.

In the Nico- tiana benthamiana annotation of the depicted gene (Niben101Scf11383g00015.1) we find 5 annotated exons of which all are populated with reads at different levels (grey histograms). In the samples from tomato, non-grafted or grafted we see that not all annotated exons are populated with reads and that the exons with coverage are populated in both grafted and non-grafted samples. Coverage over the full length of the mRNA may help reduce the risk of reads mapping to isolated regions being potentially misinterpreted, Extended Data Figure 5. This is a screenshot taken in IGV37.

Metrics details

Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century1,2. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world3. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then4,5,6,7. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank') using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.

Cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum subspecies (ssp.) tuberosum) is the most important non-cereal food crop, feeding over a billion people worldwide8. But despite this importance, potato improvement has not been as successful compared with other species. The main reason for this is its autotetraploid genome, which makes conventional, cross-based breeding difficult and poses challenges for any type of genome assembly and analysis. So far, only three complete and haplotype-resolved genome assemblies of tetraploid cultivars have been generated5,6,7. Although long DNA sequencing reads were sufficient to separate and assemble the sequences of different haplotypes (that is, individual chromosome molecules), regions that were shared between the haplotypes (partly homozygous regions) could not be resolved with long reads alone4. To achieve this, all three assemblies required tedious generation of recombinant offspring populations in addition to sequencing the genomes. Afterwards, the three assemblies revealed exceptionally high genetic diversity (about 1 difference in 50 base pairs (bp)), which is around 20 times higher than in humans and four times higher than in wild Arabidopsis thaliana plants9,10, highlighting the complexity of tetraploid potato genomes.

Many different potato species have been domesticated in the Andean highlands in South America for about 10,000 years and were first shipped to Europe around 1560 (refs. 1,2,11) (Fig. 1a). But only a single species successfully adapted to Europe's seasonal temperatures and day lengths3,12. By the end of the eighteenth century, this species (the European potato) had become the main staple crop in many parts of the continent. However, in the middle of nineteenth century, susceptibility to Phytophthora infestans (a fungus-like microorganism that causes the potato late blight disease in which infected tubers rot in the ground) led to devastating famines in Ireland and other countries13, and marked the onset of modern potato breeding in Europe. The first breeding programmes used locally grown varieties, relying primarily on crossing existing cultivars. Later efforts in the twentieth century saw further introgressions of foreign haplotypes, mainly to introduce new resistance alleles6,7,14,15. The history of European potatoes—domestication in South America, introduction to Europe, adaptation to new environments, germplasm loss during epidemics and inbreeding during the past approximately 150 years—suggests a series of severe genetic bottlenecks that reduced genomic diversity, similar to other crops16. Although the severe bottlenecks and extremely high genetic diversity observed in European potato are not necessarily a contradiction, this raised questions about the actual impact of these bottlenecks14.

a, Potatoes were domesticated around 10,000 years ago in South America, and were introduced to Europe for the first time around 1570. After potato became a major crop across Europe, in the middle of the nineteenth century, lack of resistance against P. infestans led to the Irish Famine and the loss of susceptible genotypes. Modern potato breeding started in Europe around 1880. Since then, potato breeding has been mostly based on inter-crossing European potatoes with the exception of a few wild introgressions. b, Selection of ten cultivars for pan-genome construction, after principal component analysis of the genetic variation among nineteen cultivars. The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) capture the major axes of genetic variation. ‘Papa bonita' was identified as an outlier that probably belongs to a different subspecies, S. tuberosum ssp. andigena20, and it was not included in the subsequent breeding programmes in Europe3. c, Genome assembly workflow.

To accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research in potato, we assembled a haplotype-resolved pan-genome of European potato. Using a specialized assembly pipeline for autotetraploid genomes, we assembled the genomes of ten historical cultivars. Despite high sequence diversity, haplotype diversity was strikingly limited, with an average of only nine out of 40 potentially different haplotypes per genomic region. This combination of a highly diverse, but restricted, haplotype space can be explained by the series of strong genetic bottlenecks combined with admixture with wild potato species that led to extensive sequence diversity. Pan-genome analysis suggested that the assembly already captures around 85% of the total diversity in European potato. By converting the pan-genome into a genome graph and using it as a reference for short-read alignments, we could reconstruct megabase-scale haplotype blocks of modern cultivars using short-read sequencing only, demonstrating the utility of this pan-genome for genomics-assisted breeding and research in European potatoes.

To characterize the genetic diversity present at the onset of European potato breeding, we searched the Wageningen University Potato Pedigree Database (including pedigree data from over 9,500 potato samples as of July 2021) for cultivars grown in the nineteenth century or those foundational to modern breeding efforts17,18 (Supplementary Table 1). Of 164 cultivars that fitted our criteria, 19 were available in the Gross Lüsewitz Potato Collections (GLKS) of the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research Gene Bank, where such material is being preserved long term19 (Supplementary Table 2). Whole-genome short-read sequencing of the 19 samples revealed that one sample was from a different subspecies, S. tuberosum ssp. andigena20, leaving 18 cultivars, from which we selected the ten most diverse to generate the pan-genome of European potato (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Methods).

We sequenced the ten tetraploid genomes with 86.3 to 112.9 gigabases (Gb) of HiFi reads (26× to 36× coverage per haplotype) and generated initial contig assemblies of 2.3 to 2.7 Gb with contig N50 values of 2.3 to 3.6 megabases (Mb) using hifiasm21 (Methods, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 2). To address the assembly challenges of the tetraploid genomes5,6,7, we developed a new pipeline integrating Hi-C reads into the assembly (Fig. 1c, Methods and Supplementary Methods). After validating the pipeline by reconstructing a previously assembled genome6, we generated improved assemblies with 2.8 to 3.0 Gb in length and contig N50 values of 4.0 to 6.2 Mb. We scaffolded over 98.5% of the contigs of each assembly into four separate chromosome-level scaffolds for each of the 12 chromosomes (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). We annotated between 36,622 and 46,026 genes and 381 and 446 Mb of transposable elements (54.1% to 59.0% of the genome) in the 40 haploid genomes (Supplementary Table 4). The high variation in gene number was comparable to recent reports6,7,22. Assembly quality assessment23 showed base quality values of approximately 45, greater than 97% completeness scores and greater than 95% BUSCO24 completeness at both full assembly and gene levels (Extended Data Fig. 1, Methods and Supplementary Methods).

On average, only 82% of each haplotype pair can be aligned against each other, even when high-resolution parameters were used (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Fig. 2, Methods and Supplementary Methods). The 18% unaligned regions were located primarily in pericentromeric regions measuring several Mb in size (Supplementary Figs. 3–14). Approximately 32% of the aligned regions were rearranged, such that on average only 56% of the genome was in synteny between any two haplotypes (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). The longest structural variations were inversions up to 37 Mb in size and were located primarily in pericentromeric regions (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16). Some of the inversions were in the chromosome arms, such as an approximately 6-Mb inversion on chromosome 3, recently identified by a local depletion of recombination and linked to yellow tuber flesh25. Within the aligned regions, we found one variant site per 16 bp across all 40 haplotypes (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18) and a pairwise nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.018, which corresponds to an average of one variant site per 56 bp between each pair of haplotypes (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 19). This exceptional sequence diversity is one of the highest reported in any domesticated crop so far14,26, even though it varied considerably along the genome. Some regions showed significantly lower diversity than the genome-wide average (Extended Data Fig. 2). These low-diversity regions were located primarily in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 3, 6, 10 and 12 (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 5).

For 95% of the genome the number of unique haplotypes was below 18. f, Example of shared haplotypes across the 40 haplotypes for chromosome 12 (Supplementary Fig. 21). Colours indicate shared haplotypes. Haplotypes were clustered by sequence similarity. Long (tens of Mb) shared regions become apparent in the middle of the chromosome. Common haplotypes are highlighted with red dashed lines.

Source Data

By contrast, when analysing local haplotype diversity (that is, haplotype blocks measured in 10-kb windows along the chromosomes), we found only nine different haplotypes out of 40 potentially different haplotypes per haplotype block (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 20). Even in much larger windows, haplotype sharing remained high, and in some regions we even found shared haplotype blocks spanning multiple tens of Mb (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 21 and Extended Data Fig. 4). On average, 18% of each haplotype pair was shared, with some haplotype pairs sharing up to 92% (Extended Data Fig. 5). In agreement with this extensive haplotype sharing, we also observed strong genome-wide linkage disequilibrium over long genomic distances (ρ between 3.8 × 10−7 and 1.8 × 10−6; half-decay between 1.1 and 5.3 Mb), with r2 > 0.1 extending between 5.7 and 27.4 Mb (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Notably, linkage disequilibrium was particularly high in regions with low genetic diversity and reduced haplotype numbers, consistent with reduced recombination in these regions (Extended Data Fig. 2). Taken together, despite an incredibly high sequence diversity, the genomes of European potatoes consist of only a few different haplotypes.

The reduced haplotype diversity is probably reflecting recent population bottlenecks in potato history. However, the bottlenecks cannot account for the high sequence divergence between non-shared haplotypes. Recent reports suggested that high levels of admixture between wild and domesticated potato species may have caused the high diversity in potato4,14,22. To investigate this, we analysed the recently released genome sequences of 20 wild potato species22 to identify introgression within each of the 40 European haplotypes (Fig. 3, Methods and Supplementary Methods).

Source Data

We first constructed a phylogeny of wild potato species that revealed the three major clades of wild potato species22: Clade 1 + 2 (C1 + 2), Clade 3 (C3) and Clade 4 (C4), with C4 divided into predominantly southern South American (C4S) and northern South America (C4N) species (Fig. 3a). Regardless of the chromosomes used for the phylogeny, the wild potato species were consistently placed in the same phylogenetic positions, whereas the European haplotypes had different positions (Supplementary Fig. 24). Likewise, admixture analyses also revealed mixed ancestry of the European cultivars with shared components from multiple ancestral lineages, particularly with the C4S clade (at K ≥ 3, where K is the number of assumed ancestral populations; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 25). Together, this suggested substantial chromosome-specific introgressions in the cultivars.

We performed introgression tests (D-statistics and f4 statistics) to identify introgressions of the C4S clade into the European cultivars (Fig. 3c–e, Supplementary Figs. 3–14 and 26–28 and Supplementary Methods). We did not test for introgressions between the species of clades C3 and C1 + 2 and the European haplotypes because of the low sequence similarity between them, which suggested that there are no introgressed regions. Likewise, we also did not test introgressions from clade C4N as the European cultivars were derived from this clade, making introgression tests unreliable.

The introgression tests showed strong support for numerous and long introgressions from the C4S clade across most haplotypes and chromosomes, which covered on average around 40% of the genome of a European haplotype (Fig. 3c–e and Supplementary Figs. 3–14 and 26–28). Species of C4S are usually found in southern South America, far from the Andean regions, which is the domestication centre of potato and the origin of the European haplotypes. Because our sampling of the European pan-genome is based on samples selected from the times of the onset of European breeding, these introgressions cannot be the product of modern potato breeding15. Instead, this suggests that these introgressions required human migration and transportation of plants during the times of domestication in South America.

The introgressed regions substantially overlapped regions with high sequence diversity (analysis of variance F(1, 725) = 69.09, P = 4.6 × 10−16; adjusted R2 = 0.31), whereas regions with reduced diversity showed reduced amounts of introgressions (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 2). This proves that these introgressions introduced the high sequence diversity in the potato genome.

The low number of distinct haplotypes in our sampling suggested that the overall haplotype space of European potato is also limited. To estimate the actual size of the pan-genome, we generated several pan-genome graphs with increasing numbers of haploid genomes (from 1 to 40)27 (Fig. 4a, Methods and Supplementary Methods). With each extra haplotype, the additional sequence contribution decreased. Curve fitting revealed that the full pan-genome size converges at 1.75 Gb. In turn, this implied that the 40 haplotypes (about 1.5 Gb in size) represent around 85% of the total variation of the European potato gene pool and that it would take only 24 further genomes to capture 95% of the entire variation, nearly completing the European potato pan-genome (Fig. 4a).

a, Estimating the total amount of sequence variation in the European potato. Pan-genome graphs with different amounts of haplotype genomes (that is, x from 1 to 40) were used to fit a curve (that is, f(x)) that revealed the estimated size of the complete potato pan-genome. The unit of f(x) in the given model is Mb; for example, f(1) = 729.3 Mb. The sequenced genomes cover 85% of this estimated variation. b, Pan- and core-genomes of the European potatoes (labelled as Tetraploid) compared with the pan- and core-genomes of diploid potato samples from recent studies22 (labelled as Diploid). The number of genes shared by all haplotype genomes (core-genome: 5,602; 11.63%) in tetraploid potatoes was less than half of what was found in diploids (13,123; 25.5%) and did not converge. By contrast, the pan-genome reached a plateau indicating that the gene family space of European potatoes was greatly covered by the ten genomes analysed here, whereas the diploids had larger pan-genome size22. Data are presented as mean ± s.d., where mean values of gene families and error bars representing standard variations result from n = 2,000 random samplings during pan-genome construction (Supplementary Methods). c, The number of gene families in simulated and actual tetraploid genomes. The random background distribution was generated by repeatedly selecting four random, haploid genomes (of the 40) and calculating the number of gene families in them. Six of the ten genomes had significantly fewer gene families.

Source Data

A pan-genome with such a small size is expected to affect the gene space as well. To investigate this, we clustered the genes of all haplotypes using OrthoFinder28 and defined 48,175 distinct gene families (Extended Data Fig. 6, Methods and Supplementary Methods). We repeated the pan-genome analysis using these gene families and found that the gene-based pan-genome was already saturated, implying that the 40 haplotypes include at least one representative of each gene family in the European gene pool (Fig. 4b) and again evidencing the small overall size of the European pan-genome.

By contrast, the core-genome size (that is, the gene families shared by all genomes) had not yet converged and continued to decrease even after inclusion of all 40 haplotypes. In fact, the core-genome size was much smaller than what is usually shared between plant genomes, implying that the gene space of individual haplotypes is reduced. On average, individual haplotypes contained only 90.9% of the BUSCO genes. The reason for this is not clear from our analysis, but it is likely that the high load of deleterious mutations in tetraploid potato might have affected the gene space of individual haplotypes29,30,31 (Supplementary Table 4). In turn, the tetraploid genome might compensate for the incomplete gene space of the individual haplotypes.

To test this, we performed random sampling of four haplotypes from the 40 haploid genomes to simulate random tetraploid genomes, for which we would expect that the real genomes have more genes than a random selection to compensate for the genes that are missing in individual haplotypes. Counterintuitively, however, six of the ten potato genomes showed significantly fewer gene families than random (Fig. 4c). This unexpected result might be simply explained by partial inbreeding, although this does outline how strongly the potato genome is affected by deleterious alleles.

Phasing tetraploid potato genomes remains a challenging and time-intensive task. By contrast, resequencing genomes on the basis of the alignment of short reads against a single reference sequence is a well-established and straightforward alternative for many species. But as only a single reference sequence is used, resequencing is usually not powerful enough to reconstruct the highly divergent haplotypes of tetraploid potato genomes32. However, using multiple divergent haplotypes as a composite reference could facilitate the separation of the short reads during the alignments and in consequence this would allow the analysis of individual haplotypes of a tetraploid genome33,34,35.

Modern elite potato cultivars are particularly well-suited for this approach. Because potato breeding is a slow process and only 5 to 15 sexual generations have been generated since the onset of modern breeding in Europe36,37,38,39, their genomes probably retain very long haplotype blocks inherited from the original breeding founders, such as the ones we analysed here16,40,41. Therefore, using the founder genomes as a reference could enable the reconstruction of highly contiguous, phased genome sequences of modern elite cultivars using short reads alone.

To explore this, we converted the pan-genome into a genome graph, which we call a haplotype graph (Methods and Supplementary Methods). The nodes of the graph represent unique haplotype-specific sequences of 100 kb in size. Nodes were connected by edges if the respective haplotypes were linked in one of the assembled genomes. This approach preserves haplotype contiguity while simplifying the graph structure as all nearly identical 100-kb blocks are combined in individual nodes (Fig. 5a).

The nodes of the graph are highlighted in green, yellow or red if the unique k-mers of the nodes are supported by the k-mers in a read dataset of the sequenced ‘Kenva' genome.

Source Data

To use the haplotype graph for genome reconstruction, short reads of the genome of interest (that is, the query genome) need to be mapped to the graph. For this, all k-mers in the short reads are matched to the set of node-specific k-mers. After all k-mers in the reads are assigned to nodes, we can use the frequency of the k-mers assigned to individual nodes to estimate their copy number within the query genome. Connecting linked nodes with k-mer support enables the inference of continuous haplotype sequences within the query genome (Fig. 5b, Methods and Supplementary Methods). We refer to these inferred sequences as pseudo-contigs, which are similar to contigs of a conventional genome assembly, even though the sequences of the pseudo-contigs are taken from the connected nodes and not from the sequenced reads directly. We tested the haplotype graph with three different scenarios.

To evaluate the performance of the haplotype graph, we generated a pseudo-genome assembly of ‘White Rose', which is one of the cultivars that we used to create the haplotype graph. We used 85 Gb of short reads of ‘White Rose' and matched their k-mers to the graph. Of 21,928 ‘White Rose' nodes in the haplotype graph, we found 17,331 nodes (recall = 79.0%) with the k-mers of the reads (or even 84.0% when ignoring the repetitive pericentromeres) (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 7). The recall of ‘White Rose' haplotypes was unexpectedly high considering that this reconstruction used short reads alone. The predicted nodes had a precision of 83.5% (or 89.0% in the chromosome arms), where errors mostly occurred in regions where the actual ‘White Rose' genome was not correctly represented in the graph (for example, owing to incomplete de novo assembly of ‘White Rose') (Fig. 5d). In contrast to these types of errors, we did not observe more than 16 haplotype switch errors in the assembly, which is a common problem in the de novo assembly of tetraploid genomes. After connecting the supported nodes, we retrieved 2,883 pseudo-contigs which accounted for 71.7% of the tetraploid genome with a pseudo-contig N50 of 0.7 Mb (Fig. 5e,f). For the chromosome arms, the pseudo-contigs accounted for 84.9% of the genome with an N50 of 1.0 Mb.

We further sequenced the genome of ‘Kenva' (Supplementary Methods), a cultivar that was derived from three of the genomes that were included in the graph (resulting from a cross between ‘Flava' and ‘Calrose' (a hybrid of ‘Ackersegen' and ‘Katahdin')), whereas the genome of ‘Kenva' itself was not included in the graph. This allowed simulating the (idealized) scenario of a complete haplotype graph that includes all haplotypes segregating in the European potatoes.

Using 100 Gb of short reads of ‘Kenva', we generated 3,114 pseudo-contigs covering 70.9% of the genome with an average N50 of 0.6 Mb (in chromosome arms: genome coverage = 81.1%; N50 = 0.8 Mb) (Fig. 5e,f). The N50 values were lower than what we achieved with ‘White Rose', probably owing to a combination of reasons, including recombinant haplotypes in the genome of ‘Kenva'. Overall, however, the contiguity of the pseudo-contigs was still very high, considering that the assembly was built from short reads only (Supplementary Table 7).

Finally, we used the haplotype graph to generate a pseudo-genome assembly of ‘Russet Burbank', a commercial elite variety used for the production of French fries, for which a genome assembly has not yet been publicly released.

Using 67 Gb of short-read data of ‘Russet Burbank' mapped to the haplotype graph, we generated a pseudo-genome assembly that included 2,769 pseudo-contigs of 2.03 Gb. The pseudo-assembly covered 68% of the estimated genome (79.3% of the chromosome arms), with an N50 of 0.6 Mb (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Tables 2 and 7).

To evaluate the pseudo-genome assembly of ‘Russet Burbank', we additionally generated a phased de novo assembly of ‘Russet Burbank', following the same procedure as for the ten other cultivars (Methods and Supplementary Methods).

Comparing the pseudo-contigs with the de novo assembly showed that approximately 87% (1.75 Gb) of the pseudo-contigs (almost) completely aligned (more than 95% of the pseudo-contig length) to a single haplotype of the de novo assembly, including a very long pseudo-contig measuring 9.9 Mb (Supplementary Fig. 29). The remaining approximately 13% aligned to more than one haplotype, indicating that these were probably chimeras of different haplotypes. In addition, some of the pseudo-contigs included dense clusters of sequence differences from the de novo assembly, which probably results from haplotypes in the ‘Russet Burbank' genome that were not yet represented in the graph. Although this might be a limitation of the haplotype graph (as long as the underlying pan-genome is not completed), pseudo-contigs can be polished to correct some of these differences. Using a more complete pan-genome will reduce the number of pseudo-genome assembly errors, and carries the promise to enable phased and chromosome-level assemblies of potato genomes using short reads only.

Here we present a haplotype-resolved pan-genome of tetraploid European potato, which includes more than 85% of the genetic variation of potato within Europe. The high sequence diversity between the haplotypes could be explained by introgressions from wild species during domestication covering an extremely high proportion (about 40%) of the cultivated potato genome. By contrast, haplotype diversity was strikingly reduced, which was in agreement with multiple bottlenecks in the history of European potato. This low level of haplotype diversity might represent a call to action for widening the haplotype space of European potatoes. However, including non-adapted or non-elite material into the modern gene pool is not straightforward. Foreign material might lack quality traits or bring in new deleterious alleles that would need to be purged from the genomes. Instead, genome editing might become an alternative way to advance the variation of the limited gene pool, either by introducing new beneficial alleles or by purging linked deleterious alleles. The recent decision of the European Union to agree to the use of genetic engineering in agriculture might promote such efforts in the European potato breeding programmes.

But the limited haplotype space also offers opportunities. In a proof of concept, we illustrated how the pan-genome can be converted into a genome graph (called haplotype graph) that can be used to reconstruct the haplotypes of a modern cultivar using cost-efficient short-read data only. The development of genome graphs is an active research field27,42,43,44,45, and recently pan-genomes of several crop species were constructed46,47,48; however, most of the current genome-graph tools would not support haplotype phasing of autotetraploid genomes. The pseudo-genome assemblies that we generated with short reads and the haplotype graph featured N50 values close to the values of de novo assemblies with long reads. The assemblies covered around 80% of the genome, which is an enormous fraction considering the repetitiveness of the potato genome, even though the precision of the assemblies was around 90% which implied some falsely included haplotype sequences as well. As many of these errors were related to missing information in the haplotype graph, we expect that the precision of the pseudo-assemblies will improve when more genomes are included in the haplotype graph. Such cost-efficient pseudo-genome assemblies will open the door for the broad exploration of large breeding panels, such as the more than 1,600 European potato cultivars that are at present registered for market access in the European Union49.

The haplotype graph method will continue to improve until the pan-genome captures the entire genetic variation in European potato. We estimated that it would require only 24 further genome assemblies to capture 95% of the haplotype space of European potatoes. Although this would still be feasible, it would require yet another 145 random genomes to reconstruct 99% of the haplotype space (as progressively less variation is added by further genomes). But instead of sequencing random genomes, it is more efficient to target cultivars that are known to carry haplotypes that were not included in the pan-genome so far. This is specifically important for integrating introgressions that were made by breeders in past decades, which have not been covered by our assemblies at all. Using genotype or pedigree data to select cultivars for sequencing would markedly reduce the number of genomes needed to complete the pan-genome—a daunting task, which so far has not been attempted for any species at all. However, considering the very low number of different haplotypes in European potato, there is no reason why the generation of a truly completed pan-genome would not be possible within the next few years.

The potato cultivars (Supplementary Table 2) were clonally propagated and grown on Murashige–Skoog medium for 3–4 weeks at Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research (MPIPZ, Germany). Plantlets were transferred to soil in 7 × 7-cm2 pots and grown in a Percival growth chamber for 2–3 weeks. Afterwards, the plants were transferred to 1-litre pots and grown until flowering. The plants were grown in long-day conditions (16-h light, 8-h night cycle) at 22 °C.

High-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA was isolated from 1.5 g of material with a NucleoBond HMW DNA kit (Macherey Nagel). Quality was assessed with a FEMTOpulse device (Agilent) and quantity measured by fluorometry by Quantus (Promega). A PacBio HiFi library was prepared according to the manual ‘Procedure & Checklist – Preparing HiFi SMRTbell Libraries using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0' (https://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/Procedure-Checklist-Preparing-HiFi-SMRTbell-Libraries-using-SMRTbell-Express-Template-Prep-Kit-2.0.pdf) with initial DNA fragmentation by g-Tubes (Covaris) and final library size binning by SageELF (Sage Science). Size distribution was again controlled by FEMTOpulse (Agilent). Size-selected libraries were sequenced on a Sequel II device at Max Planck Genome-centre Cologne (MP-GC) with Binding kit 2.0 and Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 for 30 h. (Read statistics are provided in Supplementary Table 2).

For each cultivar, an aliquot of HMW DNA was extracted from fresh leaves and used for a Dovetail Omni-C library created at MP-GC using the Omni-C Kit. The libraries were sent to BGI, Hongkong (China) on dry ice, where they were sequenced on a DNBseq platform (Supplementary Table 2). DNBseq reads were filtered with SOAPnuke filter with parameters ‘-T 4 -l 20 -q 0.2 -n 0.001 -4 100' (v.2.1.7)50.

Fresh leaves were sampled from 19 different cultivars and DNA was extracted with the Nucleo Mag Plant kit (Macherey Nagel), followed by Nextera LITE DNA preparation5. The libraries were sent to BGI, Hongkong (China) on dry ice, where they were sequenced on a DNBseq platform (Supplementary Table 2). Principal component analysis was used to analyze these sequencing samples to select the ten most diverse cultivars for pan-genome construction (Supplementary Methods). Blinding and randomization were not used.

Fresh leaves were sampled from ten selected cultivars and DNA was extracted with the Nucleo Mag Plant kit (Macherey Nagel). Genomic DNA was sent to BGI, Hongkong (China) on dry ice and whole-genome shotgun libraries were prepared according to the standard protocol of BGI, where they were sequenced on a T7 DNBseq platform (Supplementary Table 2). Cultivar ‘Russet Burbank' was processed in the same way. DNBseq reads were filtered with SOAPnuke filter with parameters ‘-T 4 -l 20 -q 0.2 -n 0.001 -4 100' (v.2.1.7)50.

Individual genome sizes were estimated using Jellyfish51 (v.2.2.10) and findGSE52 (v.1.0). Initial genome assemblies were generated with hifiasm21 (v.0.7) with default settings, and contigs with low sequencing support were purged. The contigs were classified on the basis of sequencing coverage (using samtools53 depth function (v.1.9)): according to the average sequencing depth per haplotype d, contigs with [0, 1.5 d], [1.5 d + 1, 2.5 d], [2.5 d + 1, 3.5 d], [3.5 d, 4.5 d] and [4.5 d + 1, infinite] were determined as haplotig, diplotig, triplotig, tetraplotig and replotig (Supplementary Fig. 30). Haplotigs were phased using Hi-C data to create haplotype-specific groups. Diplotigs, triplotigs and tetraplotigs were phased to two, three and four of the groups using code developed in this study (https://github.com/HeQSun/tetraDecoder). Next, HiFi reads were re-aligned to the contigs in each group, allowing a further, independent assembly of each haplotype. The resulting contigs were scaffolded with Hi-C data. Finally, Hi-C contact maps were built up with all four haplotypes of each chromosome using the ALLHiC54 package (v.0.9.13), and mis-phased regions were manually searched and corrected.

The contig-level assemblies were annotated using BRAKER (v.2.1.6)55,56,57. The GFF files of the BRAKER1 (refs. 58,59) and BRAKER2 (refs. 60,61,62,63,64) workflows were combined using TSEBRA65 (v.1.0.3), representing the final gene annotations. Gene annotations of each contig assembly were transferred to their respective final chromosome-level assemblies using liftoff (v.1.6.2)66. Base quality and sequence-level completeness of the genome assemblies were assessed using Merqury (v.1.3)23, and gene set completeness was evaluated using BUSCO (v.5.2.2)24.

For each chromosome, each of the 40 haplotype-specific sequences were aligned to each other using nucmer3 (v.3.1)67 with options ‘--maxmatch -c 100 -l 80 -b 500'. The resulting files were processed using delta-filter with options ‘-m -i 85 -l 200', and further with show-coords with option ‘-THrd', which resulted in coordinate files that were provided to SyRI (v.1.6)68 to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), structural variations and syntenic regions between all paired sequences. Visualization of the chromosome-level comparisons was performed with a customized version of plotsr69 (https://github.com/schneebergerlab/plotsr/tree/chr_objects).

Haplotype-specific sequences of each cultivar were aligned to the reference genome double monoploid (DM) 1-3 516 R44 using nucmer3 (v.3.1)67,70. SyRI (v.1.6)68 was used to call SNPs, structural variations and syntenic regions. The distribution of structural variation across the genome was determined using Msyd (v.1.0) (https://github.com/schneebergerlab/msyd).

Genetic variants of pairwise haplotype–DM comparisons were merged into a single genotype table. The genotype table was used to calculate minor allele frequency, pairwise nucleotide diversity (π)71, Watterson theta (θw)72 and linkage disequilibrium, as well as to cluster the haplotypes (Supplementary Methods).

Whole-genome sequencing reads of 20 wild potato species were aligned to the DM reference genome70 and cultivar haplotypes using minimap2 (v.2.20-r1061)73. Variant calling was performed using DeepVariant (v.1.4.0)74. The variants were merged into a unified dataset. Read depth was calculated across cultivar genomes using Mosdepth (v.0.3.1)75 in 100-kb windows and used to evaluate potential introgressions.

Phylogenetic relationships were analysed in 100-kb windows by constructing maximum likelihood trees with IQ-TREE (v.2.1.2)76 under the general-time-reversible (GTR) model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Consensus trees for each chromosome and the whole genome were generated using ASTRAL (v.5.7.8)77. Admixture analysis was conducted with ADMIXTURE (v.1.3.0)78 for K values from 2 to 10. In addition, D-statistics (ABBA-BABA79) and f4 statistics80,81 were calculated using Dsuite (v.0.5)82 to detect introgressions. Tests for introgressions were performed per chromosome and in 200-kb sliding windows.

The pan-genome was initialized with a single haplotype. Further haplotypes were iteratively incorporated using alignments against the haplotypes that were already included in the pan-genome using minigraph (v.0.20-r55966)27 with parameters ‘-cxggs -t 20'. A model, y = a1 × x/(x + a2) + a3, fitting the increasing pattern of the pan-genome size was constructed, for which the parameters were optimized using the BFGS method in R 4.3.0 (ref. 83).

A gene-level pan-genome was constructed using all genes in the 40 haploid genomes, which were first clustered with OrthoFinder (v.2.5.5)28, diamond (v.2.0.13)84 and Blast (v.2.12.0+)85. Core, softcore and dispensable genes were defined as shared by 40, 37–39 and 2–36 of the haplotype genomes. Private genes were specific to individual haplotypes. The pan-genome and the core-genome distributions were built on the basis of the OrthoFinder gene families, for which up to 2,000 random samplings from the 40 haploid genomes were performed for each sample size (from 2 to 40).

The pan-genome was transformed into a haplotype graph with the alignments of the 40 haplotype genomes to the DM reference using minimap2 (ref. 73). Genomic variants were identified using SyRI68. Specifically, the reference genome coordinates were binned into non-overlapping 100-kb windows. Haplotypes in each window were clustered together if the edit distance between their SNP profiles was less than 10% of the number of SNPs (that is, for any two haplotype instances assigned to the same cluster, they show less than 10 SNP differences per 100 SNPs to each other). In the haplotype graph, each cluster of haplotypes is then represented with one node. The nodes in adjacent windows were connected by edges if they were linked in any of the contributing haplotypes. For each node, we identified marker k-mers (k = 51) that were (1) in all the contributing haplotypes, (2) in regions being in synteny with DM and (3) unique to that node.

Using short reads of a query genome, marker k-mers were extracted using Jellyfish51 (v.2.2.10). The probability of a k-mer representing zero, one, two, three or four haplotypes was estimated with a Gaussian mixture model. On that basis, an iterative process of expectation maximization was used to classify nodes in the haplotype graph as representing zero, one, two, three or four copies in the sample, which would not finish until all nodes converged (minimum step size < 0.001) or 100 iterations were reached. Nodes with a non-zero copy number were then heuristically connected to form pseudo-contigs.

a. Assembly size before and after haplotype phasing of ten potato varieties, as compared with k-mer-based genome size estimates. b. Total contig size of chromosomes of initial and phased assemblies as compared with the reference genome. As a comparison, for example, chromosomes 3,6,7,10 after phasing (in orange) were clearly more complete than those before phasing (in dark blue). Note, as the total size of initial contigs aligned to each reference chromosome included contigs mixed from four haplotypes, the average size (i.e., the total size divided by four) was used to represent the initial assembly size of a haplotype chromosome. c. Base accuracy and completeness of ten tetraploid genome assemblies calculated by Merqury23. d. BUSCO24 evaluation of 40 haploid genome assemblies, based on the genome assemblies and the protein-coding gene annotations.

Source Data

a. Average pairwise nucleotide diversity π (average at 0.018 indicated by the red dash line) along the genome in 10 kb windows. Red dots indicate regions with the 5% lowest π values (below 0.003). Values calculated per 10 kb window from 40 haplotypes. b. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the 40 haplotypes across each of the 12 chromosomes. LD measured as R2 is shown as a heatmap throughout all chromosomes. The bottom panel shows the average R2 within windows of 200 kb. Dots in dark green indicate the windows with 5% most extreme values in the genome. c. Top panel: Number of different haplotypes in 10 kb windows (averaged across 20 windows) out of 40. The dashed line in red shows a genome-wide average of only nine distinct haplotypes per region. Bottom panel: Maximum haplotype allele frequency along the genome. Each window reports the number of haplotypes carrying the most frequent haplotype. Red and blue dots indicate the windows with 5% most extreme values. Green lines: pericentromeric regions. Light gray lines: number of aligned haplotypes to the reference sequence.

Source Data

Box plots represent the median (center line) from 40 haplotypes, interquartile range (bounds of the box), and minima/maxima (whiskers), excluding outliers (points), which are defined as values beyond 1.5× the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with p-values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. Sample sizes (n) in number of 500 kb windows for pericentromeric (PC) and non-pericentromeric (No-PC) regions per chromosome: chr01 (75, 103), chr02 (24, 69), chr03 (66, 56), chr04 (62, 77), chr05 (64, 48), chr06 (57, 62), chr07 (73, 43), chr08 (65, 54), chr09 (71, 65), chr10 (77, 46), chr11 (37, 57), chr12 (78, 42). For all chromosomes combined: PC = 749, No-PC = 722. Genetic diversity in pericentromeric regions was consistently lower than in non-pericentromeric regions, with the exception of chromosome 1 and 2 where no significant differences were found (p > 0.05). Significant differences are indicated with p-values.

Source Data

Histograms of the number of different haplotypes measured in windows with different sizes ranging from 2 kb to 1 Mb. In all panels values were calculated from all 40 haplotypes.

Source Data

a. Histogram of shared block sizes in all pairwise haplotypes comparisons. b. Histogram of the maximum shared block size per pairwise haplotype comparison. c. Histogram of the proportion of shared haplotype sequence in all pairwise haplotype comparison. Panels are split by chromosome. Mean values are indicated with a red vertical line.

a. Distribution of private, dispensable, softcore and core gene families. Private (only found within a single haploid genome), dispensable (shared by 2–36 haploid genomes), softcore (shared by 37–39 haploid genomes) and core (shared by all 40 haploid genomes) gene families represented 0.79%, 64.02%, 23.56% and 11.63% of all gene families, respectively. b. Distribution of private, dispensable, softcore and core genes in single haploid genomes, as characterized in a. Nearly no private genes were found within individual haploid genomes, while dispensable genes were highly abundant. This analysis involved 40 haploid genomes in total.

Metrics details

The rapid advent of high-throughput omics technologies has created an exponential growth in biological data, often outpacing our ability to derive molecular insights. Large-language models have shown a way out of this data deluge in natural language processing by integrating massive datasets into a joint model with manifold downstream use cases. Here we envision developing multimodal foundation models, pretrained on diverse omics datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics and spatial profiling. These models are expected to exhibit unprecedented potential for characterizing the molecular states of cells across a broad continuum, thereby facilitating the creation of holistic maps of cells, genes and tissues. Context-specific transfer learning of the foundation models can empower diverse applications from novel cell-type recognition, biomarker discovery and gene regulation inference, to in silico perturbations. This new paradigm could launch an era of artificial intelligence-empowered analyses, one that promises to unravel the intricate complexities of molecular cell biology, to support experimental design and, more broadly, to profoundly extend our understanding of life sciences.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Meet The AI Agent With Multiple Personalities","https://www.wired.com/story/simular-ai-agent-multiple-models-personalities/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 16:21:00 GMT","

In the coming years, agents are widely expected to take over more and more chores on behalf of humans, including using computers and smartphones. For now, though, they're too error prone to be much use.

A new agent called S2, created by the startup Simular AI, combines frontier models with models specialized for using computers. The agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks like using apps and manipulating files—and suggests that turning to different models in different situations may help agents advance.

“Computer-using agents are different from large language models and different from coding,” says Ang Li, cofounder and CEO of Simular. “It's a different type of problem.”

In Simular's approach, a powerful general-purpose AI model, like OpenAI's GPT-4o or Anthropic's Claude 3.7, is used to reason about how best to complete the task at hand—while smaller open source models step in for tasks like interpreting web pages.

Li, who was a researcher at Google DeepMind before founding Simular in 2023, explains that large language models excel at planning but aren't as good at recognizing the elements of a graphical user interface.

S2 is designed to learn from experience with an external memory module that records actions and user feedback and uses those recordings to improve future actions.

On particularly complex tasks, S2 performs better than any other model on OSWorld, a benchmark that measures an agent's ability to use a computer operating system.

For example, S2 can complete 34.5 percent of tasks that involve 50 steps, beating OpenAI's Operator, which can complete 32 percent. Similarly, S2 scores 50 percent on AndroidWorld, a benchmark for smartphone-using agents, while the next best agent scores 46 percent.

Victor Zhong, a computer scientist at the University of Waterloo in Canada and one of the creators of OSWorld, believes that future big AI models may incorporate training data that helps them understand the visual world and make sense of graphical user interfaces.

“This will help agents navigate GUIs with much higher precision,” Zhong says. “I think in the meantime, before such fundamental breakthroughs, state-of-the-art systems will resemble Simular in that they combine multiple models to patch the limitations of single models.”

To prepare for this column, I used Simular to book flights and scour Amazon for deals, and it seemed better than some of the open source agents I tried last year, including AutoGen and vimGPT.

But even the smartest AI agents are, it seems, still troubled by edge cases and occasionally exhibit odd behavior. In one instance, when I asked S2 to help find contact information for the researchers behind OSWorld, the agent got stuck in a loop hopping between the project page and the login for OSWorld's Discord.

OSWorld's benchmarks show why agents remain more hype than reality for now. While humans can complete 72 percent of OSWorld tasks, agents are foiled 38 percent of the time on complex tasks. That said, when the benchmark was introduced in April 2024, the best agent could complete only 12 percent of the tasks.

Zhong says that the amount of training data available may limit how good agents can become.

Perhaps one solution is to add human intelligence to the mix. While looking into Simular, I discovered a research project that shows how effective it can be to blend human skills with those of an AI agent.

CowPilot, a Chrome plugin developed by a team at Carnegie Mellon University, allows a human to intervene if an AI agent gets stuck doing things. With CowPilot, I can step in and click or type if the agent seems to be dithering.

Jeffrey Bigham, a professor at CMU who oversaw the project, which was developed by his student, Faria Huq, says the idea of having a human work with an agent “is almost so obvious that it's hard to believe it's not the way most people are thinking about it.”

Most interestingly, Bigham and Huq say that a human and agent working together can perform more tasks than either party working alone. In a limited test, the human-agent combo completed 95 percent of the jobs it was given, while requiring humans to perform only 15 percent of the total steps.

“Web pages are often hard to use, especially if you're not familiar with a particular page, and sometimes the agent can help you find a good path through that would have taken you longer to figure out on your own,” Bigham adds.

I don't know about you, but I like the idea of an agent that makes me more productive and less error prone.

It's often the case that the more that planets are studied and understood, the more remote the possibility of inhabiting them seems. Mars, for example, is the closest celestial body to Earth in terms of distance, but data shows its conditions are extremely hostile for life.

Despite this, NASA has plans to send astronauts to the Red Planet, and Elon Musk is a vocal proponent of establishing a human presence there. In the short term, the solution to colonizing Mars is the construction of special enclosed habitats. But in the long term, some have suggested a more ambitious strategy. Space colonization enthusiasts propose terraforming Mars—that is, transforming the planet to acquire characteristics similar to those of Earth.

Scientists accept that any proposal for terraforming Mars is decades away, although calculations are already underway to assess how this titanic process might work. Leszek Czechowski, a professor at the Institute of Geophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, has proposed how to convert the rusty-colored planet into a place where humans can walk without spacesuits. To achieve this, the researcher suggests bombarding it with asteroids from the far reaches of the solar system.

Mars is a desert planet, devoid of oxygen, and with an atmosphere so thin that it prevents the accumulation of liquid water on its surface. None of these characteristics will be changed if the lack of atmospheric pressure is not addressed first. If a person goes unprotected onto the Martian surface, they will not die from suffocation or freezing, but because their blood will boil almost instantly due to the lack of atmosphere.

On Earth, atmospheric pressure is due to the total mass of gases contained in its dense atmosphere. Here, at sea level, the pressure is equivalent to 101,325 pascals; on Mars it barely reaches 600 pascals, less than 1 percent of Earth's pressure. So to begin terraforming, scientists must first thicken the Martian atmosphere. Other major challenges, such as extreme temperatures, protection from solar radiation, and the presence of water, would then be addressed in subsequent phases.

Every scientist exploring the terraforming of Mars comes to the same conclusion: There is simply not enough material on the planet to change its atmosphere, and any attempt to transport elements there represents an unprecedented energy expenditure.

Czechowski's solution to this problem is to bombard the planet with asteroids. In his proposal, a large asteroid would be launched directly at Hellas Planitia, a huge impact crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars. According to this theory, the impact of a sizable asteroid, containing elements essential for the planet's habitability, would cause Mars to heat up while also causing its atmosphere to thicken.

But this cannot be just any asteroid—it has to be one with abundant water and nitrogen. That immediately rules out anything from the solar system's asteroid belt, which lies between Jupiter and Mars. Rather, any large rock would need to come from the Kuiper belt, the disc of material that surrounds the outer solar system and is full of frozen objects and primordial water.

Humans of the future would have to go directly to this remote region to select the ideal asteroid and attach a propellant to it. This would then be used to slow the orbiting asteroid down, allowing it to be drawn into the inner regions of the solar system by the sun's gravitational pull. Further bursts of propellant, as well as exploiting the gravitational fields of other planets, would then be used to make sure the asteroid ends up colliding with Mars, with the asteroid's journey estimated to take anywhere from 29 to 63 years. Upon impact, the elements of the asteroid would be expected to fuse with the Martian environment and, hopefully, trigger volcanic processes that will contribute to the formation of a denser, more life-friendly atmosphere.

“The creation of an atmosphere that allows human life is possible by importing matter from other celestial bodies,” Czechowski explains in his paper, which he shared at the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, LPSC 2025. The amount of energy needed to get to the Kuiper belt and then propel an asteroid to Mars could be equivalent to several years of total energy consumption here on Earth, Czechowski estimates. “Due to the enormous amount of energy required, a power plant based on a thermonuclear reactor (running on local hydrogen) and an ion engine seems to be the most suitable option” for powering the mission, he writes.

President Donald Trump's tariff roller coaster has had many unexpected impacts—including threatening the sex-toy industry and possibly making smartphones dumber. But the most recent odd aftershock from his yo-yoing decisions on whether to instigate tariff hikes against China has been good news for a previously little-known app called DHgate.

The app has shot to near the top of the App Store charts this week, according to Sensor Tower, an analyst firm. Its success is (practically) overnight: Last week it couldn't even crack the 100 most popular apps on Apple's rankings.

But what is it, why is it popular—and, perhaps most importantly, should you use it? DHgate's media relations team did not immediately respond to WIRED's request to participate in this story, but ecommerce experts have shared with us their thoughts.

Since 2004, DHgate has helped connect foreign buyers with Chinese manufacturers. The initials in its name is a reference to Dunhuang, a city once famed for its role in China's ancient Silk Road trade route.

“I remember I used to buy imported DVDs of Chinese films that you can't buy elsewhere,” says Arnold Ma, a Chinese ecommerce expert and founder and CEO of Qumin, an UK-based marketing agency specializing in Chinese audience behaviours. “They've always been more of a B2B business, but before Alibaba became popular, for global merchants to get stock from China cheaply and in bulk.”

The company behind it, DHgate Group, was founded by entrepreneur and former Microsoft and Cisco employee Wang Shutong and has since grown into a behemoth: as of late 2023, 77 million registered buyers across almost every country and region in the world, around 10 million of whom have reportedly bought from 2.6 million sellers in China and elsewhere. However, some of these claims ought to be taken with a pinch of salt. Implausibly, DHgate claims buyers are located in more “countries and regions” than there are countries in the world.

The growing trend of Chinese ecommerce manufacturers marketing their wares on apps like TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin, in response to Donald Trump's tariffs against China, has raised awareness of DHgate among the public. “It's recently got popular thanks to TikTok,” says Ma. “People are starting to wonder with the tariffs whether they can buy items from China directly.”

Those viral videos, made by representatives of factories that claim to make products for luxury goods retailers, suggested people could counter the price increases coming from tariffs by buying unbadged versions of the same products direct from them on DHgate at a much lower cost—though there are serious questions about whether the sellers are legitimately suppliers to Western luxury brands. Search interest spiked in the past week as a result, with “China ‘Exposes' Luxury Brands” now a trending topic on TikTok. “They've always wanted to dabble in B2C,” says Ma.

Like with almost every other shopping app, you download, log on, and search for items—but you can also access the marketplace via the company's website. DHgate categorizes the products it sells on behalf of manufacturers into groups, while you can also search for specific items using the search bar at the top of the page. A search for “laptop” returns more than 73,000 results.

Many of these are unbranded items; countless others are dupes of recognizable ones. Befitting its history as a business-to-business retailer, you can get discounts for buying in bulk.

As with any online retail transaction, it's worth checking reviews of individual items and ratings for the sellers in question: DHgate is a marketplace, not a supplier itself. “It's not as good as it says on TikTok videos,” says Ma. “There are still quite a lot of scammers, and there's a lot of cases where people don't get the product that they paid for. But when you do your research, and you do go to the right merchants on DHgate, you do genuinely get really good quality products that are 80 percent the same, made in the same factories for a lot less.”

There's no suggestion that buying items from DHgate is a risk when it comes to data collection: the platform is long-standing and a recognized name, so your credit card details are likely to be no less safe than they are on any other Chinese ecommerce platform. The app also has a buyer protection program and holds payments from sellers until buyers acknowledge receipt of their order—making it less likely you'll be scammed.

Whether the goods you receive will be top quality is another question. Prior to this month, DHgate was best known as a “prolific destination for designer knockoffs,” as news organizations have previously described it. In the past, WIRED has also called DHgate “one of the most established purveyors of counterfeits from China.” Indeed, if you do purchase counterfeit goods on DHgate, it could mean bought items end up seized by customs before reaching your home.

In 2020, DHgate launched its own in-house affiliate marketing program, which resulted in TikTok and Facebook influencers recommending products from the site, including counterfeit Golden Goose sneakers and knockoff jewelry from Van Cleef & Arpels.

“People need to realize DHgate is a platform,” says Ma. “They don't actually guarantee the quality or the authenticity of any products on the platform.” Others suggest exercising caution. “I would say it's likely to be hit and miss with quality,” says Ben Graham, a UK-based ecommerce specialist with more than a decade's experience. “Some sellers will probably be really good, and some will be pretty poor.”

That said, the quality of some items could well be similar to many bought from third-party retailers on major Western ecommerce platforms, simply because DHgate has traditionally operated as a business-to-business company and so likely supplies wholesalers that use platforms such as Amazon and eBay. “It's not that far removed,” says Graham. “At least you know up front"" where it has come from.

While Graham can recognize the lure of cheap items, he's less certain that buying direct from the app is good value. “I would always want to go to a brand that I know has stringent quality control and is accountable to UK, US or EU standards,” he says. That's particularly important when considering electrical goods or items with important and rigorous safety rules, such as toys.

There's also the question of whether your order will be caught up at the border when imported into the US and slapped with a 145 percent China-linked tariff anyway—nullifying some or all of the price advantage you might have found by heading to the app. And while the US de minimis exemption on imports under $800 remains in place until May 2 (at the time of writing), items shipped from China can take several weeks to arrive.

Given the Trump administration's focus on targeting China, it seems possible that any purchases could come with an additional import charge when they arrive on shore.

Still, having outlined all these concerns and possible pitfalls, getting a dupe or similar purchase from DHgate could still be cheaper than buying a legitimate product from a brand retailer. “The markup is, like, a lot higher than the tariff,” says Ma.

When Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 back in January, it confirmed long-standing rumors that the new handheld console would enjoy backward compatibility with the games from the original Switch—physically and digitally. Good news, but there was one disclaimer: ""Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2.""

That sent some players into, if not a panic, at least a period of confusion. Given that the original Switch launched in 2017, many have built sizable collections in that time, and the uncertainty over which among them would continue to be playable on the new generation of hardware was cause for concern. But things are looking better than expected, with the Switch 2 supporting some of the most niche titles in the Switch library, even those that required physical peripherals unique to the original hardware.

In an update posted to Nintendo's official site, the company revealed that nearly 100 percent of first-party games remain compatible with Switch 2 hardware, with “no issues found during basic compatibility testing” for 122 games published by Nintendo. On a bar chart, a tiny sliver of red, indicating “not compatible,” amounts to just one game.

That unfortunate outlier? Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, Nintendo's ambitious build-it-yourself virtual reality headset made of cardboard. The entire Labo line was aimed at kids, providing tactile experiences where you'd build steering wheels or robot suits, then play dedicated games built around the kit-bashed gadgets. The VR Kit took things to another level, providing the materials to build rudimentary goggles and a mock blaster. When constructed, the Switch tablet slotted into place while lenses split the onscreen image into a “My first VR”-level experience.

It's that specific physical combination of console and cardboard that makes Labo VR Kit the only original Switch game incompatible with Switch 2. Nintendo explains that “the Nintendo Switch 2 console cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles accessory, so this game cannot be played.” That's it. The Switch 2 simply doesn't fit the headset, so VR Kit becomes the only first-party game jettisoned into the tides of gaming history.

Even other Labo games can be used on Switch 2, thanks to what may prove to be the new console's secret weapon when it comes to backward compatibility—you can still use original Switch Joy-Cons on Switch 2. Nintendo says that if “you have Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers and connect them wirelessly to Nintendo Switch 2, you can play [select] games as you would on Nintendo Switch.” That's great news, opening the doors for far more of the Switch's software library to remain accessible than expected.

Perhaps the biggest surprise is that Switch 2 will continue to support Ring Fit Adventure. When the new console was announced with that caveat about compatibility, I was sure Ring Fit would be cut from the roster, primarily because of hardware compatibility. The fitness role-playing game requires the right-hand Joy-Con controller to be physically slotted onto its Pilates-style ring peripheral, which uses a slide bracket that could not accommodate a new, magnetically connected Joy-Con 2 from the Switch 2.

Much to my delight, though, you can play Ring Fit on the Switch 2. You just need to keep a pair of original Switch Joy-Cons to hand (the left Joy-Con is still required to slot into Ring Fit's leg strap to track lower body movement—Nintendo says that Joy-Con 2 won't fit). Given that Joy-Cons can be charged using a Joy-Con charging grip or a stand-alone dock, I may not even have to keep my Switch OLED set up to keep them juiced. This is great, since it's one of the games that helped me lose a lot of weight, and aside from the health benefits, it remains genuinely fun to play.

Several other first-party Nintendo games that wouldn't work natively on Switch 2 because of technological differences of the Joy-Con 2s are saved by the continued support for the classic Joy-Cons. For example, the new controllers lack the infrared motion camera built into the right-hand grip on the preceding generation, which would block 1-2-Switch!, a mini-game collection and launch title for the original Switch. Instead, you'll be able to continue to enjoy its dozens of quick-fire party games if that's your jam.

For the 2023 sequel, Everybody 1-2-Switch!, it doesn't appear you'll even need the original Joy-Cons. The only compatibility warning Nintendo gives is that the volume of the haptic feedback is quieter on Joy-Con 2s, so it might make one specific mini-game a bit harder. Elsewhere, Nintendo Switch Sports, the successor to the global phenomenon Wii Sports, gets the same leg strap warning as Ring Fit Adventure (clearly a fitness game thing), while Game Builder Garage and WarioWare: Move It! require that IR reader.

The Switch 2's solid backward compatibility support looks to extend to even older hardware as well. The GameCube adapter is still supported. Unlike the upcoming wireless recreation launching alongside Switch 2 to allow authentic playback of the digital GameCube games (if you subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online), these are hub-like accessories that allow up to four original, wired GameCube controllers to be connected to the Wii U, Switch, and now Switch 2.

Nintendo confirms that “this accessory can be used in TV mode by connecting via a USB Cable on the Nintendo Switch 2 dock.” I presume there'll be a small extra step involved here, as most models use a USB-A connector, so you'd presumably need a USB-A to USB-C widget to bridge the gap, since there is no USB-A port on the dock.

It may be best to rein in the excitement here, though, at least for now. The GameCube adapter is only supported on the original Switch for very specific games, chiefly Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. While classic GameCube games are coming to Nintendo Switch Online for the first time with the advent of Switch 2, starting with The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur II, and F-Zero GX, it's unknown if using an adapter would allow players to use original GameCube controllers on those games. We'll update as we hear more.

Unfortunately, things are not so rosy with third-party games. Nintendo has identified 141 games with startup issues on the Switch 2, meaning they may not launch reliably or at all, and 47 others that boot up on the new hardware, but “include some in-game compatibility issues.” In all cases, the company is still investigating the issue, and compatibility issues for these titles may be resolved by the June 5 launch date of the console. But it could also rise too—there are over 12,000 Switch games, so more issues could crop up, but the ratio is pretty good right now.

Think China's got it all sewn up when it comes to EVs? Well, at least when it comes to micro cars, Japan still has a few tricks up its sleeve—and the Nissan Sakura is the power player in the market.

Japanese automakers have generally tackled the electric transition with all the speed of a turning oil tanker. Toyota has, for example, steadfastly held out largely in the hopes that its gamble on solid-state batteries will play out.

Nissan on the other hand threw its hat early into the game with the Leaf, launched in 2010. So early, in fact, that Nissan claims the car is the world's first mass-market EV.

The Leaf, which believe it or not is an acronym for “leading environmentally-friendly affordable family car”, was for a long time one of the world's best-selling EVs. Had Nissan really capitalized on this EV leadership it might not have needed the now-canceled Honda engagement, but that's another story.

Nissan first showed the Sakura as early as 2019 in the form of the IMk concept, but it took until 2022 to morph into the production car. Was it worth the wait? WIRED went to Japan to find out.

Now, electric cars are not yet big in Japan, making up about 3 percent of sales. However, Japan's government has announced plans to increase the percentage of EVs and PHEVs in passenger car sales to up to 30 percent by 2030. For now, the Sakura, despite its diminutive length of 3,395 mm (about 11 feet), happens to be Japan's best-selling electric car.

Together with its Mitsubishi eK X EV sibling, which bar a few styling differences is largely the same car, it was one of the first electric kei cars in Japan, although it lagged significantly behind the Mitsubishi i-MiEV which was introduced way back in 2009.

A kei car is the smallest class of car legally allowed on expressways in Japan. They are limited to a length of 3.4 meters, a width of 1.48 meters, and a height of 2 meters. In return for the restrictions, the cars enjoy lower tax rates and insurance premiums.

At first glance, the Sakura seems quite similar to a number of micro EVs from China, probably best exemplified by the super cheap Wuling Hongguang Mini EV (which we tested). However, the Nissan is somewhat bigger than these, and a five-door hatchback to boot, although still only a four-seater.

Rather than giving the impression of just being a step-up from an e-bike, as is the case with some of the Chinese microcars, the Nissan feels more like a proper car.  With Japanese brands honing their kei car game since 1949 that's not surprising. Kei car sales peaked at 40 percent of Japan's total in 2013. Such is the premium on space in the Japan, kei cars, thanks to their tiny footprint, have become a class of car you can buy there if you don't own a dedicated parking space.

Still, the Sakura is a relatively basic car and purchasers have a basic choice between X and G. The price is basic, too: the “top-of-the-range” G version has a suggested selling price of Y3,082,200 ($20,290) while the X is cheaper still at Y2,599,300—that's just $17,110, cheaper than the Dacia Sprint.

For my test I took the G, the more expensive of the two with upgrades to the car's navigation and ProPILOT driver assistance system that helps with steering and braking (ProPILOT Park takes care of parallel parking.)

One other difference is the number of paint options available. For the X there are six solid and five two-tone options, but on the G the two-tone options expand out to nine and now include “titanium gray” as well as black for the second tone. WIRED's test car came in a fetching silky lilac for the body with black for most of the window surrounds and titanium gray for the roof and front pillars. Who said Japanese cars came in boring colors?

Spend any time with the Sakura and you soon realize it is a box of tricks. With kei cars having such a long history, Japanese producers know how to get the most out of the small footprint.

Along with the length of 3,395 mm, the Sakura's width of 1,475 mm comes in just 5 mm short of the regulatory limit. But where the Sakura more than compensates for these dimensions is with its height of 1,655 mm, which, incidentally, is taller than an average Japanese woman (158 cm).

Externally the car takes the Sir Alec Issigonis Mini ethos of a wheel at each corner. There is just a very short, stubby overhang at the front. The Sakura is actually based on the gasoline-powered Nissan Dayz, but is redesigned not just in terms of powertrain but looks as well.

While the box-like nature of the Sakura doesn't make for the most elegant of exteriors, it really benefits the interior space. Although the two front seats rub up against each other, they are of a full size and individually adjustable, and even manage to squeeze in a shared armrest.

Where the car's height really pays off is with rear seat space. Although it only seats two there is more than enough headroom for even the tallest of adults— and the legroom considering the dimensions of this EV is incredible, beating many normal-sized Western models.

With no center console, the drive selector is pushed onto the dashboard to the right of the capacitive touch panel climate controls. An electronic handbrake is controlled using the P button marked in the center of the selector.

The two staggered info screens are easy to use, with the 9-inch infotainment screen surrounded by some real buttons with shortcuts to items including the main menu, camera, and map. The instrument panel is a smaller 7-inch display.

Visually the car's interior scores highly particularly with the G version which gets a copper trim around the lower dashboard and extending into the door inserts. Perhaps not surprisingly given the price point, the materials don't hit so high when it comes to tactility, being largely hard plastics. Furthermore, the plastics on the dashboard seem flimsy around the air vents.

A double-layered trunk floor left me at first scratching my head as it didn't seem to serve any purpose. More investigation revealed that the rear bench could slide forward making more trunk space, and the redundant layer now being used to cover the flooring. With the seats fully back trunk space is just 107 litres, but about enough for the family's weekly shop.

Perhaps it is just a matter of getting used to the Sakura's layout, but as soon as you try to drive it you start noticing problems with the ergonomics. Firstly when in the driver's seat the Start/Stop button is difficult to see due to the steering wheel. It's a similar case with the Autohold and Drive Mode selection buttons hidden well down on the right, below-hand level and underneath a row mainly controlling the cruise control. Then there is the indicator on the right stalk, meaning I kept activating the windscreen wipers.

Once you are successfully in motion the car is a delight to drive thanks to its minuscule dimensions. The turning circle is just 9.6 meters, and the steering itself although on the light side makes it super easy to move in and out of traffic.

There are three drive modes: Eco, Standard and Sport, with at least some differentiation between all three. In Eco there is greater braking regeneration along with the acceleration being tapered off. In Sport, the car has a reasonable turn of speed given its metrics, with around a 10 second 0-62 mph time, so pulling out into flowing traffic should be fine.

It should be noted that Chinese micro EVs don't even quote such times. Furthermore, unlike those where the speed tops out at usually 62 mph, the Sakura can actually reach a highway-ready top speed of 81 mph. Although by modern car standards the 14-inch wheels, or the optional 15-inch on our test car, are tiny, they are still much bigger than the 12-inch ones used by the Chinese Wuling Hongguang Mini EV.

The ride itself is surprisingly comfortable, an effect furthered by the sofa-like seats. While the height helps with the headroom it does mean the center of gravity is not so low, leading to some body movement. Power comes from a 63 hp (47 kW) electric motor mounted on the front axle which can deliver 195 Nm of torque.

There are actually two forms of braking regeneration, the normal and the e-pedal variety. While the braking regeneration under Eco is definitely noticeable, it is nothing compared to what you get when you press the e-pedal button. With this engaged you get a near one-pedal driving experience, but it will not take you to a complete halt, just a crawl of around 5 mph.

Despite having only a 20 kWh battery pack the range as measured by the WLTC cycle is 112 miles, which is more than enough for a commute. It should be noted that the Sakura will use less electricity when driven at city speeds. Nissan reports that 83 percent of owners say they spend less than 5,000 yen ($33) a month charging the car.

Helping reduce energy consumption are features such as the LED lights and a heat pump, which reduces the amount of power needed to heat the car in winter.

Fast-charging, the Sakura's battery can go from 10 to 80 percent in around 40 minutes. It also supports vehicle-to-load, meaning you can use the car as a power source on household appliances and similar devices.

Surprisingly, the car's systems such as the navigation were possible to switch into English, so if the determined fan were to import one to the US, they wouldn't be stuck with a Japanese UI. Tech in general is an area the car scores highly on. The G version as standard has Nissan's ProPilot. Although I didn't try it on the highway, I did try the car's auto-parking function. You then select a target space and hold down appropriate park button while the car completes the maneuver. I found it to have variable effectiveness, with it claiming on occasions to have successfully parked when it had not fully reversed into a space.

In such small cars, safety is always a question mark—but, in 2022, the Sakura gained a 5-star rating in the JNCAP test, though it should be noted that this is not as stringent as the Euro NCAP rating. The car does, however, come with seven airbags, along with active evasive maneuver assistance, intelligent emergency braking, and collision warning.

Sadly, so far Nissan has shown no desire to sell the car outside Japan, although a few secondhand examples have ended up in right-hand drive markets such as New Zealand.

The Sakura might be Japan's best-selling EV (indeed, strong demand led to Nissan having to pause sales in late 2022 because it had too many orders), but it has the potential to be far more than that. It is the EV that many city EV drivers have been crying out for. While it might not be as ridiculously cheap as the Chinese micro EVs (which can go as low as $5,000), it is still, comparatively, an absolute bargain—and crucially more of a “proper car” than any of its China rivals.

With real safety credentials, fast charging, good handling and enough power to even be used for the odd (slightly) longer trip on the highway, surely there's a market for the Sakura in Europe and the US? We'll have to hope Nissan comes to think the same.

How often do you replace your laptop? Every five to seven years? Maybe more? You probably don't wait as long to upgrade your phone, but that's what the DIY supplier iFixit and the refurbished device retailer Back Market want to change.

Ahead of Earth Day on April 22, the two companies have partnered to launch a marketing campaign that encourages consumers to replace their phones every five years instead of the national average of two and a half to three years.

The responsibility of keeping older tech alive isn't just falling on you, though. The two companies are also asking policymakers and manufacturers to extend smartphone parts and software support to 10 years. Phone makers like Apple, Google, and Samsung support devices for about seven years, though most phones from other manufacturers get half that, if not less.

Kyle Wiens (left), CEO of iFixit, repairs a laptop with Back Market CEO Thibaud Hug de Larauze (right).

By replacing the battery and holding onto an iPhone 13 for five years instead of replacing the whole phone after the typical two and a half years, for example, the device's carbon emissions are cut by 49 percent—which could prevent 15.6 million tons of CO2 emissions per year. If you could keep it running for 10 years with repairs and refurbishment, those emissions would be reduced by 68 percent. Back Market says these numbers are calculated from various sources, like Apple's Product Environment Reports, studies on refurbishment emissions, repair emissions from the Fairphone 5, and more.

The partnership extends further: Back Market, which sells refurbished tech like phones, laptops, and even gaming consoles, will feature iFixit's how-to-repair guides on its app and on the web, beginning with iPhone repair guides. That way, instead of immediately trading your phone in for a discount on a refurbished model, you have an option to check out a repair guide and try a fix yourself. Many repairs are common and simple, like replacing the screen or the battery.

You'll also be able to buy iFixit's repair toolkit directly from Back Market. And if you're browsing iFixit but decide you don't have the time or energy to go through with a repair, you'll see options to trade in your device to Back Market for a refurbished model.

“We have the same fight,” Thibaud Hug de Larauze, CEO of Back Market, tells WIRED. “We want to extend the life of a tech product to make it more convenient for people when they have, let's say, a smartphone that is running out of battery or they have a broken screen—the vast majority of people upgrade to a new device, and we're here to offer them an alternative.”

The announcement comes during a tumultuous trade war between the US and China. While President Donald Trump exempted some electronics, like smartphones and laptops, from the 145 percent reciprocal tariffs on China, these products are still facing a hefty 20 percent tariff. Laurauze says last week, Back Market saw its growth triple as consumers snapped up refurbished electronics due to fears of price hikes.

Tariffs may not directly impact the used smartphone market much since all of these devices are available in the US. However, it will make repairs costlier, because the parts still come from other countries, and refurbished phones will likely cost more due to higher demand.

“I think it is likely that tariffs and costs will go up on new devices—that seems safe to assume,"" says Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit. ""In that world, we'd want to keep things running longer. Even if repair part prices go up slightly due to tariffs, they'll still end up being dramatically cheaper to repair than to buy a new one.”

Wiens says the big US carriers export many used smartphones to other countries, but that could change in the post-tariff world. That might mean more used smartphone options to choose from at your carrier store, especially if consumers cannot afford a new device.

The tariff chaos is also coinciding with some wins for the right-to-repair movement. According to Public Interest Research Group, there are currently 41 repair bills in progress across 20 states, covering various products from consumer tech to farm and lawn equipment. If these bills become laws, they would force manufacturers to make their products more repairable while opening up access to tools, instruction manuals, and spare parts for regular consumers.

All to say, if there was ever a time to start learning how to keep your devices in good working order longer, it's now.

AMD says that the U.S. government's license control requirement for exporting AI chips to China and certain other countries may have a material impact on its earnings.

If AMD doesn't successfully obtain a license, the company could be on the hook for roughly $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves charges, it said in a filing with the SEC on Wednesday. According to AMD, the new export rules apply to the company's MI308 GPUs.

“On April 15, 2025, [AMD] completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the [U.S.] government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries,” AMD wrote in the filing. “The [export control] applies to [AMD's] MI308 products. The company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted.”

AMD's shares were down around 6% in early morning trading on Wednesday.

The U.S.'s newly imposed export controls impact a number of chipmakers, including AMD's chief rival Nvidia. In a filing on Tuesday, Nvidia said it anticipates charges of $5.5 billion related to the export controls in the first quarter ending April 27.

Multiple government officials have been calling for stronger export controls on U.S.-built GPUs. Allowing China-based companies to obtain these chips, in particular AI companies, would threaten the U.S.'s dominance in AI as well as its national security, they argue.

In a statement provided to Reuters yesterday, a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said that the license requirement is in service of “the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security.”

Kia debuted its 2026 EV4 sedan at the New York International Auto Show on Wednesday, its first global electric sedan and one designed for customers looking for an affordable EV. 

Whether U.S. customers will gravitate towards a sedan is an open question — and one Kia isn't necessarily betting on. The company launched sales of the EV4 in South Korea and plans to bring it to Europe by the end of the year. Sales in United States are expected to begin in the last quarter of 2025 or first quarter of 2026, a Kia spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Kia's primary pitch with the EV4 is affordability, and with a respectable range, interior features, tech touches it could finally give consumers another option. While Kia hasn't yet shared U.S. pricing, some have estimated that it would start at around $35,000, adding another competitor to the Tesla Model 3. Eric Watson, VP of sales at Kia America, confirmed the ballpark price range to TechCrunch. 

Tom Kearns, Kia's chief designer, said Wednesday that what “many EVs have in common is the pricing that leans more towards the higher end. But our ultimate goal is to make electrified attainable driving for everyone.” 

That's why the EV4 has a “distinctive with a tech-forward design” and is affordable even with its “many advanced features,” many of which can be found in Kia's higher end EV6 crossover utility vehicle and EV9 SUV.

For U.S. buyers, however, that attractive price point could be at risk. President Donald Trump's proposed automotive tariffs threaten to add 25% to the cost of any imported vehicle — including the EV4, which Kia plans to build in South Korea and launch stateside in the first quarter of 2026. With the tariff landscape shifting by the day, it's impossible to say what buyers will be facing a year from now.

Watson noted that Kia was open to exploring the idea of bringing production of the EV4 to the U.S. The automaker already has a facility in Westpoint, Georgia where it builds its EV6 crossover utility vehicle and EV9 SUV for the U.S. market, with SK On as its battery manufacturing partner. 

Despite having American manufacturing and domestically produced batteries, Orth Hendrick, Kia America's VP of product planning, said, “There are still a lot of components that are subject to tariffs. It's not good for business. We're hoping there will be some developments maybe over the summer.”

The Kia EV4 does have several things going for it that could make a buyer risk the tariffs, most notably its decent range. The standard 58.3 kWh battery, which comes with the “Light” trim, has a range of 235 miles, and the long-range 81.4 kWh battery, which comes with the “Wind” or “GT-Line” trims, can go up to 330 miles. 

Kia said it focused on aerodynamics for the EV4, which likely helped boost those range numbers. The vehicle has a coefficient drag of .23 — the same as the Tesla Model 3. 

Both battery configurations provide power to the front-mounted 150 kW motors. And with V2L4 functionality, drivers can use the car's battery to charge devices like laptops and smaller electronics.  

The EV4 also charges with a DC fast-charger at a respectable 30 minutes, and its NACS charging port is located on the front passenger side for easy accessibility. 

Kia also played up its i-Pedal 3.0 system in the Ev4, which ecaptures energy and stores it in the battery, but gives drivers more control over the speed of deceleration using only the accelerator pedal. 

Now, onto the looks. 

Kearns said Kia wanted an opportunity to do things differently with the 2026 EV4, to break the norm of many EV makers that pushes prioritizes efficiency often at the expense of making a cool design statement. 

And looking at it up close, Kia's EV4 does have an interesting aesthetic; sort of a business in the front, party in the back vibe. Head on, you can see the low nose, long-tail silhouette, and fastback roofline of a classic sports car, and from the rear, vertical taillights, a two-piece roof spoiler, and sleek bumper design give it a more aerodynamic, tech-forward presence. 

Speaking of tech, the car boasts your standard futuristic, minimalistic, high-tech interior. Standouts include the two-spoke steering wheel, 64-color dynamic ambient lighting, a free-floating user interface comprised of dual 12.3-inch screens and a five-inch climate display.​ That's where you can find all your navigation and entertainment features, including wireless Apple Carplay and Android Auto.

Like Kia's other EVs, the EV4 also offers the chance to enhance connectivity and entertainment features through over-the-air updates, including adding personalized display themes across the cockpit like your “favorite NBA team” for all the environment-loving super fans out there. 

In terms of other tech-forward features, the drivers can access their EV4 via Kia's digital key through their cell phones, and Kia's AI Assistant uses voice recognition and natural language processing to help drivers control vehicle functions, trip plan, and more. 

The EV4 also comes standard with a suite of driver assistance features, including Kia's Highway Driving Assist, which automatically adjusts the vehicle's set speed to match the posted speed limit and maintains distance from the vehicle ahead. Kia's ADAS also includes assistance with forward collision avoidance, lane following, remote smart parking, driver attention warning, and hands-on steering wheel detection. 

This article has been updated with more information from Kia representatives about design and tariffs. It was originally published April 16 at 7:53 am.

Deck, a startup that claims to be building “the Plaid for the rest of the internet,” has raised $12 million in a Series A funding round — about nine months after closing its seed financing, it tells TechCrunch exclusively.

The new raise, led by Infinity Ventures, brings Montreal-based Deck's total raised since its January 2024 inception to $16.5 million. Golden Ventures and Better Tomorrow Ventures co-led its seed raise.

Deck claims that it is building the infrastructure for user-permissioned data access — across the entire internet. Its browser-based data agents “unlock” the data from any website through automation. 

To put it more simply, Deck helps users connect any account online and aims to turn the information into structured, usable data, with full user permission.

President Frederick Lavoie, CEO Yves-Gabriel Leboeuf, and CTO Bruno Lambert (pictured above, left to right) co-founded Deck in June 2024. 

The startup's approach is to treat the web itself as an open platform. It operates under the premise that users have “tons of valuable data” locked behind usernames, passwords, and session-based portals with no real way to share it securely.

Deck hopes to change that.

“Just like Plaid gave developers an easy, secure way to access bank account data with user permission, Deck does the same for the 95% of platforms that don't offer APIs such as utility portals, e-commerce backends, payroll systems and government services,” Leboeuf told TechCrunch. Its goal is to make it easier for developers to access the data users already have without all the manual work

When a user connects an account, Deck's infrastructure handles everything behind the scenes. Its AI agents log in, navigate, and extract the data “just like a human would — but faster, more reliably, and at scale,” said Leboeuf. 

It then generates scripts to keep those connections live and reusable without AI involvement going forward.

“Companies use Deck to eliminate the friction of getting their user data from places where APIs don't exist — or are incomplete, expensive, or unreliable,” Leboeuf said. “We basically ‘Plaid-ify' any websites. Whether you're doing accounting, KYC, automating reporting, or verifying a business, Deck lets you build those features in minutes instead of months.”

Leboeuf and Lavoie previously started Flinks, a startup that was dubbed the “Plaid for Canada.” The National Bank of Canada acquired it in 2021 for about US$140 million. (Lambert was one of Flinks' first engineers.)

After that sale, the founders started talking to entrepreneurs across industries.

“Again and again, we heard the same thing: Our data is broken,'” said Leboeuf.

One founder had millions in food sales intelligence trapped in dozens of “clunky” distributor portals. Another spent months trying (and failing) to access music royalty data — to help users claim over a billion in unpaid royalties.

“We even experienced the problem firsthand,” Lavoie said. “The pattern was clear: data access was fragmented, fragile, and failing — and not just in banking. It was everywhere.”

So they built Deck, which today competes with Arcadia, a company that the founders had tried using but grew frustrated by. 

The trio believes that recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have underscored the urgency of open access to non-financial data. Without it, AI risks being trained on outdated, biased, or incomplete information.

Initially, the company has been focused on working with utility companies, having connected to over 100,000 utility providers in more than 40 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Customers include EnergyCAP, Quadient, and Greenly. Deck is also working with non-utility customers such as Notes.fm, Glowtify, and Evive Smoothies. It believes that its technology can be applied to any industry where data is “trapped” in online accounts.

“Think of us as the bridge between the application layer and foundational tools like browser automation or AI operators such as Playwright, Browser Use, OpenAI Operator,” Leboeuf said. “We've taken the messy, foundational pieces — authentication, data normalization, rate limiting, consent management, and antibot protection — and turned them into a seamless, productized platform.”



Deck has seen the number of developers building on its platform “grow drastically” in the last couple of months, according to its founders. In February, for example, its connections grew by over 120% compared to the previous month. The startup's pricing model is performance-driven, charging clients based on “successful” API calls.

“That means you only pay when the data works,” said Lavoie.

Like Plaid and Flinks, Deck relies only on explicit user consent to connect and collect data.

“While it may hypothetically be violating some terms and conditions, our technology follows the open data international trend that was initiated and greatly popularized by open banking, and has pushed regulators across the world to make it clear in several jurisdictions that consumers and businesses have the right to access and transfer their data,” said Leboeuf.

Deck also claims to have proprietary technologies to avoid being labeled as bots or crawlers. Those technologies include several different methods, such as vision computing and human-like mouse movement. 

“While we see a lot of antibot technologies in sectors like telcos or HR, where there is a lot of fraud from identity theft, lots of other data verticals have limited to no antibot technologies,” said Lavoie. 

For now, it's not using the data collection to train models, instead focusing on building the best way to collect the data rather than building products on top of the collected data itself. 

“We operate in a dual consent environment, where we would need end-user consent, and Deck's client consent, to use the data,” Leboeuf said.

The company soon plans to launch a data vertical creator, which it claims will let any developer “get up and running for any data verticals for any industry… in no time.”

Presently, Deck has 30 employees.

Jeremy Jonker, co-founder and managing partner at Infinity Ventures, believes that Deck is “transforming” the user-permissioned data sector, “just as open banking reshaped financial data.”

“With a modular platform and reusable recipes, they deliver speed, reliability, and adaptability that extend well beyond utilities,” he told TechCrunch. Jonker has joined Deck's board as part of the financing.

Intact Ventures, along with previous backers Better Tomorrow Ventures, Golden, and Luge Capital also participated in the Series A financing.

In a bid to inject AI into more of the programming process, OpenAI is launching Codex CLI, a coding “agent” designed to run locally from terminal software.

Announced on Wednesday alongside OpenAI's newest AI models, o3 and o4-mini, Codex CLI links OpenAI's models with local code and computing tasks, OpenAI says. Via Codex CLI, OpenAI's models can write and edit code on a desktop and take certain actions, like moving files.

Codex CLI appears to be a small step in the direction of OpenAI's broader agentic coding vision. Recently, the company's CFO, Sarah Friar, described what she called the “agentic software engineer,” a set of tools OpenAI intends to build that can take a project description for an app and effectively create it and even quality assurance test it.

Codex CLI won't go that far. But it will integrate OpenAI's models, eventually including o3 and o4-mini, with the clients that process code and computer commands, otherwise known as command-line interfaces.

It's also open source, OpenAI says.

“[Codex CLI is] a lightweight, open source coding agent that runs locally in your terminal,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “The goal [is to] give users a minimal, transparent interface to link models directly with [code and tasks].”

In a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI added, “You can get the benefits of multimodal reasoning from the command line by passing screenshots or low fidelity sketches to the model, combined with access to your code locally [via Codex CLI].”

To spur use of Codex CLI, OpenAI plans to dole out $1 million in API grants to eligible software development projects. The company says it'll award $25,000 blocks of API credits to the projects chosen.

AI coding tools come with risks, of course. Many studies have shown that code-generating models frequently fail to fix security vulnerabilities and bugs, and even introduce them. It's best to keep that in mind before giving AI access to sensitive files or projects — must less entire systems.

Ride-hailing giant Lyft said it has agreed to acquire FREENOW, a German multi-mobility app with ride-hail at its core, from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for about $197 million in cash. 

The acquisition opens up the European market to Lyft for the first time. The company has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012, compared to its biggest rival Uber, which operates globally. 

FREENOW operates in nine countries and more than 150 cities across Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. 

The move comes a few months after FREENOW shared that its strategic focus on its taxi business resulted in year-on-year growth of 13%, and that it was hitting break-even. 

Lyft said the merger would nearly double its total addressable market to more than 300 billion personal vehicle trips per year, and increase annualized gross bookings by about $1.14 billion. 

“We're on an ambitious path to build the best, most customer-obsessed mobility platform in the world, and entering Europe is an important step in our growth journey,” said David Risher, CEO of Lyft, in a statement. “We found the perfect partner in FREENOW and can learn a lot from the team. FREENOW's local-first approach mirrors Lyft's values and embodies our purpose — to serve and connect.”

In a statement this week, BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility said they would continue to focus on their core operations in addition to electrification, AI, and decarbonization. 

Lyft said there will be no immediate changes to FREENOW's customer experience, but that “over time, new benefits will be made available to FREENOW drivers and riders.” It said the two companies will focus on integration so riders can use either app when they're in North America or Europe.

Artificial intelligence services at their heart are massive data plays: You need data — a lot of it — to build the models, and then the models need efficient ways to ingest and output data to work. 

A company called Hammerspace has built a system to help AI and other organizations tap into data troves with minimal heavy lifting, and it's been seeing impressive adoption. Now, with customers including Nvidia, Meta, Tesla, Palantir, and the Department of Defense, as well as other very recognizable names, Hammerspace is announcing $100 million in funding to expand its business. 

The funding is being described as a “strategic venture round,” and it values Hammerspace at over $500 million, sources close to the company told TechCrunch. Its backers include Altimeter Capital and ARK Invest, alongside strategic investors that are not being disclosed. The investors are being described as “highly participatory.” 

The funding is notable because it points to the ecosystem developing around the value that the market sees in AI companies, which are raising billions of dollars both to build their capital-intensive businesses and meet massive demand. 

But as Jamin Ball, a partner at Altimeter, noted, “You don't have an AI strategy without a data strategy.” So a company that is building a platform to enable that data strategy can itself become very valuable, too. 

Hammerspace said much of its growth so far has been through word of mouth. It will be using a portion of this funding to expand on that more proactively with sales and marketing. 

Hammerspace previously raised $56 million from Prosperity7 Ventures (the venture arm of Saudi Aramco), ARK Invest, Pier 88 Hedge Fund, and other unnamed investors. Prior to that, it was self-funded by its CEO and co-founder David Flynn, the pioneer technologist known for his early work on Linux, supercomputers, and flash computing.

There are a vast number of companies that have set out to plug the big gap that exists in the data market today. “Vast” is an operative word here, as it is one of the companies that competes with Hammerspace, along with Dell, Pure Storage, Weka, and many others in the worlds of data orchestration, file management, data pipeline, and data management.

That gap goes something like this: The apps and other digital services we use to work and do everything else in life these days produce a lot of potentially valuable data. But data troves exist in silos — they're fragmented, stored across multiple (competing) clouds and other environments, and are often unstructured. That makes them a challenge to use.

This gap applies across a wide range of enterprise use cases, but perhaps the biggest of these at the moment is AI. 

“AI has been the perfect storm for needing what I have built,” Flynn said in an interview. 

Hammerspace, as we've noted before, is named after the concept first coined from cartoons and comics, where characters pull objects they need out of thin air. 

This is, in effect, what Hammerspace does. The startup provides a way of making large amounts of data, regardless of where it lives or how it is used, accessible and available to an organization just when they need it, and keeping it out of the way when they do not. 

As Flynn describes it, typically the way that enterprises would have worked with data would be to port it from wherever it is to where it needs to be processed. “You need to install stuff on every system,” he said. “It's a mess.” 

It's also slow. “The AI arms race is such a sprint,” he said. With “time to value” now a key priority for these companies, Hammerspace is signing up a lot of customers that are anxious about idle time. 

Flynn's background in flash computing is central to Hammerspace's breakthrough. Built on Linux, ubiquitous in the database world, he could see that the key to organizing data across disparate locations was to create a file system to do so.

The heart of this is the Linux kernel NFS client, ubiquitous across many of the data systems. Hammerspace's co-founder and CTO, Trond Myklebust, was the lead developer of the Linux kernel NFS client, and the startup remains its lead maintainer. The “file system” that the company has built for managing, moving, and orchestrating data is based on a particular implementation in Linux that taps this. What it does, Flynn said, “is unique across the industry.”

Longer term, Flynn said last year that Hammerspace may go public as early as this year. That timeline has changed now but the direction has not. “Yes, IPO is absolutely the Hammerspace intended strategy,” Flynn said. “We likely are still approximately two years out (dependent on market conditions).”

    If our only goal is to run forever, the solution is immediate:

    ```rs

If you're unfamiliar with stateful serverless: it's like the actor model, where each actor maintains its own isolated, persistent state. (Think Lambda functions with local storage & runs indefinitely.) It enables easily building long-running, realtime, durable, or local-first backends with the flexibility of serverless infrastructure. The most widely used implementation is Cloudflare Durable Objects, powering products like Clerk, Tldraw, Liveblocks, and Playroom.A few months ago we launched Rivet Actors (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42472519) as an open-source alternative to Cloudflare Durable Objects. After that launch, we kept hearing three common concerns:- Vendor lock-in: Developers are hesitant to adopt a new programming model if there's no clear off-ramp. While it's straightforward to migrate a Postgres database, stateful serverless platforms can feel locked-in due to lack of viable alternatives.- Ecosystem: Choosing a well-known database like Postgres comes with a mature ecosystem. Adopting a new model means rebuilding tooling and patterns from scratch.- Conceptual gap: Many developers have spent their entire careers designing systems with intentionally separated state and compute. A model that merges the two can feel backwards at first.We realized the best solution was to build a stateful serverless framework that can (a) be portable across clouds and (b) be easily extended – similar to how Hono created a unified API for traditional serverless functions across different providers. Thus, ActorCore was born.Today, ActorCore supports running stateful serverless on Rivet Actors, Cloudflare Durable Objects, Redis, and standalone Node.js/Bun. The most common use cases include applications using collaborative, AI agent, local-first, and per-tenant database features.State in ActorCore is an in-memory JavaScript object, with SQLite support coming later this month. State is stored in memory near your users on the edge, removing database round trips and minimizing latency due to physical distance. Additionally, state writes have tunable consistency, which enables both fully durable compute workloads and high-frequency state updates.You may have noticed that this still leaves concern #3: the conceptual gap. While this isn't something we can solve with a framework, I've been spending ~40% of my time working on docs, content, and examples to help resolve this. ActorCore is also turning out to be community-driven as hoped, which enables more people to try and share their experience with stateful serverless.We'd love it if you'd give ActorCore a try, read the roadmap, and/or let us know where we can improve anything. If you're hesitant about trying stateful serverless, I'd love to learn more in the comments. Looking forward to feedback!

I've tinkered with Actor Core a bit but need to play with it more.How would you compare/sell it to someone who uses or is familiar with https://partykit.io/

I see ActorCore as picking up on PartyKits vision where they left off after acquisition by Cloudflare. Here's a few of the few things we've added to ActorCore:- Full TypeScript type safety for calling actions on actors – PartyKit provides raw WebSocket messages instead- Streamlined state persistence – PartyKit requires using low-level storage calls for persistence- Flexible scheduling API – PartyKit exposes the single alarm from Cloudflare instead- Simpler ""functional"" API – you might prefer PartyKit if you prefer using ES6 classes- Upcoming SQLite features & deep integrations for features like auth & local-first sync will make it easier to ship quickly- Not vendor-locked to CloudflarePartyKit already has a few integrations that is on our roadmap, such as YjsCurious to hear your experience using both.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","What is vibe coding, exactly?","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115135/what-is-vibe-coding-exactly/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

While letting AI take the wheel and write the code for your website may seem like a good idea, it's not without its limitations.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

When OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy excitedly took to X back in February to post about his new hobby, he probably had no idea he was about to coin a phrase that encapsulated an entire movement steadily gaining momentum across the world.

“There's a new kind of coding I call ‘vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists,"" he said. “I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding—I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.” 

If this all sounds very different from poring over lines of code, that's because Karpathy was talking about a particular style of coding with AI assistance. His words struck a chord among software developers and enthusiastic amateurs alike. In the months since, his post has sparked think pieces and impassioned debates across the internet. But what exactly is vibe coding? Who does it benefit, and what's its likely future?

To truly understand vibe coding, it's important to note that while the term may be new, the coding technology behind it isn't. For the past few years, general-purpose chatbots like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Google DeepMind's Gemini have been getting better at writing code to build software, including games, websites, and apps. But it's the recent advent of specially created AI coding assistants, including Cursor's Chat (previously known as Composer) and GitHub Copilot, that really ushered in vibe coding. These assistants can make real-time predictions about what you're trying to do and offer intuitive suggestions to make it easier than ever to create software, even if you've never written code before.

“Over the past three or four years, these AI autocomplete tools have become better and better—they started off completing single lines of code and can now rewrite an entire file for you, or create new components,” says Barron Webster, a software designer at the interface company Sandbar. “The remit of what you can take your hands off the wheel and let the machine do is continually growing over time.”  

But not all AI-assisted coding is vibe coding. To truly vibe-code, you have to be prepared to let the AI fully take control and refrain from checking and directly tweaking the code it generates as you go along—surrendering to the vibes. In Karpathy's longer post he explained that when he's vibe coding, he breezily accepts all suggestions that Cursor's tool gives him and puts his trust in its ability to fix its own mistakes. “When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it,” he wrote. “Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.”

A string of startups are racing to build models that can produce better and better software. They claim it's the shortest path to AGI.

Essentially, vibe coding is interacting with a code base through prompts, so that the engineer's role is simply to converse with the tool and examine its outcome, explains Sergey Tselovalnikov, a software engineer at the design platform Canva who regularly uses AI assistive tools. “Andrej is a bit of an influencer, and he defined that term very intentionally,” he says. “He just posted a joke of sorts, but because he highlighted what was going on in the industry more or less correctly, it just took off.”

The people most likely to benefit from vibe coding fall into two camps, says Tobin South, an AI security researcher at the MIT Media Lab. One is people like Karpathy, who already have a good grasp of coding and know how to fix any errors if anything goes seriously wrong if they're using it to build anything important; the other is absolute amateurs with little to no coding experience. “I'd define vibe coding as having a vision that you can't execute, but AI can,” he says.

The major appeal of vibe coding lies in how easy and accessible it is. The AI assistive tools make it much quicker to produce code and to whip up small projects like a prototype website, game, or web app than it would be for a human. But while this hands-off approach may make sense when it comes to creating these kinds of low-stakes, simple digital products, it's far riskier in bigger, more complex systems where the stakes are much higher. Because AI coding tools are powered by LLMs, the code they generate is just as likely to contain errors as the answers LLM-powered chatbots spit out. That's a big problem if what you're trying to code requires access to large databases of information, security measures to protect that data, large numbers of users, or data inputted from users, says Tselovalnikov.

“Vibe coding can make a lot of errors and problems, but in the environment of a tiny game or a small app that doesn't store any data, it's a lot less relevant,” he says. “I'd personally be a lot more careful with larger projects, because if you don't know if there are any security vulnerabilities and you didn't test the code yourself, that's very dangerous.”

For decades, coders wrote critical systems in C and C++. Now they turn to Rust.

This is particularly applicable to non-coders. Leo, a user on X and a champion of vibe coding, found this out the hard way when he posted about having built a SaaS application (software that runs over the internet, instead of being downloaded to a user's device) solely using Cursor last month. The post immediately caught the attention of mischievous web users, who instantly started poking holes in his service's security. “Guys, I'm under attack,” he posted two days later. “I'm not technical, so this is taking me longer than usual to figure out. For now, I will stop sharing what I do publicly on X. There are just some weird ppl out there.”

Ultimately, while vibe coding can help make a vague idea for a website or a game into a reality, it can't make it reliable or secure. But there are already plenty of existing tools to do this, helping you with everything from creating databases to adding authentication measures. So while you can't vibe-code real, valuable, secure, robust apps into existence, it can be a useful place to start so long as you're careful, says South. 

He believes that AI-assisted coding assistants are going to keep becoming more capable and that web hosting companies will keep integrating AI into their tools to make them easier to use, meaning the barriers to creating software will keep falling. “It takes the cost of producing software and dramatically reduces it to an exponential degree,” he says. “The world will have to adapt to this new reality. It isn't going anywhere.” 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

These newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations—and there's no way to stop them.

Conservative critics have long accused the State Department's Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub of helping to censor the American right.



The only office within the US State Department that monitors foreign disinformation is to be eliminated, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirming reporting by MIT Technology Review.

The Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub is a small office in the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy that tracks and counters foreign disinformation campaigns. 

In shutting R/FIMI, the department's controversial acting undersecretary, Darren Beattie, is delivering a major win to conservative critics who have alleged that it censors conservative voices. Created at the end of 2024, it was reorganized from the Global Engagement Center (GEC), a larger office with a similar mission that had long been criticized by conservatives who claimed that, despite its international mission, it was censoring American conservatives. In 2023, Elon Musk called the center the “worst offender in US government censorship [and] media manipulation” and a “threat to our democracy.” 

The culling of the office leaves the State Department without a way to actively counter the increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns from foreign governments like those of Russia, Iran, and China. 

Shortly after publication, employees at R/FIMI received an email, inviting them to an 11:15AM meeting with Beattie, where employees were told that the office and their jobs have been eliminated. 

Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed our reporting in a blog post in The Federalist, which had sued GEC last year alleging that it had infringed on its freedom of speech. “It is my pleasure to announce the State Department is taking a crucial step toward keeping the president's promise to liberate American speech by abolishing forever the body formerly known as the Global Engagement Center (GEC),” he wrote. And he told Benz, “We ended government-sponsored censorship in the United States through the State Department.”  

For years, conservative voices both in and out of government have accused Big Tech of censoring conservative views—and they often charged GEC with enabling such censorship. 

GEC had its roots as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC), created by an Obama-era executive order, but shifted its mission to fight propaganda and disinformation from foreign governments and terrorist organizations in 2016, becoming the Global Engagement Center. It was always explicitly focused on the international information space, but some of the organizations that it funded also did work in the United States. It shut down last December after a measure to reauthorize its $61 million budget was blocked by Republicans in Congress, who accused it of helping Big Tech censor American conservative voices. 

R/FIMI had a similar goal to fight foreign disinformation, but it was smaller: the newly created office had a $51.9 million budget, and a small staff that, by mid-April, was down to just 40 employees, from 125 at GEC. In a Tuesday morning meeting, those employees were told that they would  be put on administrative leave and terminated within 30 days. 

With the change in administrations, R/FIMI had never really gotten off the ground. Beattie, a controversial pick for undersecretary—he was fired as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration for attending a white nationalism conference, has suggested that the FBI organized the January 6 attack on Congress, and has said that it's not worth defending Taiwan from China—had instructed the few remaining staff to be “pencils down,” one State Department official told me, meaning to pause in their work. 

The administration's executive order on “countering censorship and restoring freedom of speech” reads like a summary of conservative accusations against GEC:

“Under the guise of combatting “misinformation,” “disinformation,” and “malinformation,” the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government's preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.  Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society.”



In 2023, The Daily Wire, founded by conservative media personality Ben Shapiro, joined The Federalist in suing GEC for allegedly infringing on the company's first amendment rights by funding two non-profit organizations, the London-based Global Disinformation Index and New York-based NewsGuard, that had labeled The Daily Wire as “unreliable,” “risky,” and/or (per GDI), susceptible to foreign disinformation. Those projects were not funded by GEC. The lawsuit alleged that this amounted to censorship by “starving them of advertising revenue and reducing the circulation of their reporting and speech,” the lawsuit continued. 

Elon Musk may have run tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast.

In 2022, the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana named GEC among the federal agencies that, they alleged, were pressuring social networks to censor conservative views. Though the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which found no First Amendment violations, a lower court had already removed GEC's name from the list of defendants, ruling there was “no evidence” that GEC's communications with the social media platforms had gone beyond “educating the platforms on ‘tools and techniques used by foreign actors.'”

The GEC—and now R/FIMI—was targeted as part of a wider campaign to shut down groups accused of being “weaponized” against conservatives. 

Conservative critics railing against what they have alternatively called a disinformation- or censorship- industrial complex have also taken aim at the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Stanford Internet Observatory, a prominent research group that conducted widely cited research on the flows of disinformation during elections. 

CISA's former director, Chris Krebs, was personally targeted in an April 9 White House memo, while in response to the criticism and millions of dollars in legal fees, Stanford University shuttered the Stanford Internet Observatory ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.  

But this targeting comes at a time when foreign disinformation campaigns—especially by Russia, China, and Iran—have become increasingly sophisticated. 

According to one estimate, Russia spends $1.5 billion per year on foreign influence campaigns. In 2022, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, that country's primary foreign propaganda arm, had a $1.26 billion budget. And a 2015 estimate suggests that China spent up to $10 billion per year on media targeting non-Chinese foreigners—a figure that has almost certainly grown.

In September 2024, the Justice Department indicted two employees of RT, a Russian state-owned propaganda agency, in a $10 million scheme to create propaganda aimed at influencing US audiences through a media company that has since been identified as the conservative Tenet Media. 

The GEC was one effort to counter such campaigns. Some of its recent projects have included developing AI models to detect memes and deepfakes and exposing Russian propaganda efforts to influence Latin American public opinion against the war in Ukraine. 

By law, the Office of Public Diplomacy has to provide Congress with 15-day advance notice of any intent to reassign any funding allocated by Congress over $1 million. Congress then has time to respond, ask questions, and challenge the decisions—though to judge from its record with other unilateral executive-branch decisions to gut government agencies, it is unlikely to do so. 

We have reached out to the State Department for comment. 

This story was updated at 11:25 to note that R/FIMI employees have confirmed that the office closed. This story was updated at 12:35 to include confirmation about R/FIMI's shutdown from Marco Rubio.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Jurassic Patent: How Colossal Biosciences is attempting to own the “woolly mammoth”","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115154/jurassic-patent-how-colossal-biosciences-is-attempting-to-own-the-woolly-mammoth/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

The company claiming it can restore lost species also wants to patent them.

Colossal Biosciences not only wants to bring back the woolly mammoth—it wants to patent it, too.

MIT Technology Review has learned the Texas startup is seeking a patent that would give it exclusive legal rights to create and sell gene-edited elephants containing ancient mammoth DNA.

Colossal, which calls itself “the de-extinction company,” hopes to use gene editing to turn elephants into a herd of mammoth look-alikes that could be released in large nature preserves in Siberia. There they'd trample the ground in a way that Colossal says would maintain the permafrost, keeping global-warming gases trapped and offering the chance to earn carbon credits.

Ben Lamm, the CEO of Colossal, said in an email that holding patents on the animals would “give us control over how these technologies are implemented, particularly for managing initial releases where oversight is critical.”

Colossal intends to file patents on additional “transgenic” animals, such as the genetically modified wolves it announced last week, Lamm said.

In that case, Colossal used gene editing to insert about 15 DNA changes from the extinct dire wolf into gray wolves. The company touted this work as the first success for de-extinction technology, a claim that drew wide criticism.

Colossal has raised more than $400 million and is investing in a range of gene-editing and reproductive technologies, although its business plans remain speculative. Lamm has suggested that each “mammoth” could generate $2 million in ""carbon capture services"" and that the company could collect a share of tourist dollars if it brings back other iconic species such as the dodo, which lived on a single island in the Indian Ocean.

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

Lamm said patents, which usually last 20 years, could provide “a clear legal framework during the critical transition period when de-extinct species are first reintroduced.”

In the US, patents on genetically engineered organisms have been allowed since 1980, when the Supreme Court signed off on one for an oil-eating bacterium. The justices famously said patent rights could cover “anything under the sun made by man.”

That opened the door to patents on animals, including the cancer-prone OncoMouse, glow-in-the-dark aquarium fish, and, more recently, pigs modified to grow organs for transplants. 

Colossal's woolly mammoth patent application, with its descriptions of modified cells and animals, represents “the current standard in biotech cases,” says Cassie Edgar, a partner at the law firm McKee, Voorhees & Sease in Des Moines, Iowa.

Yet Colossal's legal venture breaks ground in other ways. It appears to be a novel attempt to secure rights to the use of extinct DNA and could establish an unprecedented legal monopoly over wild animals, since one of Colossal's aims is to return revived species to their original habitats.

“This could set precedent for intellectual-property rights over engineered versions of extinct species—raising questions not just about science, but about who owns de-extinction,” Edgar says.

The basic de-extinction method works like this: Researchers obtain DNA from old bones or museum specimens and then use gene-editing technology to add ancestral gene variants to a closely related existing species. 

So far, no modified pachyderms have been born—elephant engineering remains too difficult. But last week, Colossal set off an eruption of headlines when it claimed it had used gene editing to re-create dire wolves, a species that went extinct some 13,000 years ago. One of the furry white canids, named Remus, appeared on the cover of Time magazine, with the word “extinct” crossed out.

Many experts dismissed Colossal's claim to the world's first successful de-extinction. They noted that in reality, the animals are gray wolves with an unusual coat color; their genomes contain only a few bits of dire wolf DNA, but the two species differ by several million DNA letters.

The company is taking steps to secure intellectual-property rights to nearly every aspect of its creations, even the names it gives its animals. MIT Technology Review found that Colossal had filed for trademarks covering some extra-hairy mice it revealed earlier this year, which were offered as evidence of progress toward a mammoth.

One trademark reserves the name “Mammouse” for use in the sale of “stuffed and plush toys.” Also trademarked is “Woolly Mouse,” covering its use as a motif for shirts, jackets, and athletic apparel.

Lamm says Colossal doesn't currently have plans to open a gift shop. But he does want to protect the “brand identity” of the animals. “It seems like people connect with these animals on an emotional level, which is actually quite encouraging,” he says. “We need to ensure that we can protect our brand.”

The existence of a patent application on mammoth-like elephants could tap into lingering public doubts over whether legal monopolies should really apply to living things, especially elephants, the world's largest land animals. “There are people that are unhappy about that, but that is certainly a pattern we've seen for a while in the US,” says Alta Charo, a specialist in legal issues raised by biotechnology who is Colossal's ethics advisor.

CRISPR will get easier and easier to administer. What does that mean for the future of our species?

Revive & Restore, a de-extinction organization in Sausalito, California, that is working toward reviving the passenger pigeon, says it doesn't think the birds should be controlled by intellectual-property claims. “Revive & Restore will not be patenting de-extinct passenger pigeons,” says Elizabeth Bennett, a spokesperson for the organization. The organization envisions that if it succeeds in reintroducing the birds, they will be “protected under existing wildlife laws,” Bennett says.

Even some genetic engineers involved in the mammoth project, initiated more than decade ago at Harvard University, have mixed opinions on patenting de-extinct animals. Cory Smith, now a biotech executive, was a student when he helped prepare an earlier patent application on engineered elephants, which the school filed in 2021. “I am not sure it should have an owner,” says Smith. “I have always been on the side that maybe the animals shouldn't be patented.”

During its press blitz last week, Colossal was careful not to reveal the exact genetic changes it had made to its wolves, telling advisors it needed to keep them secret for “intellectual-property reasons.” This prevented outside scientists from fully assessing the experiment. But it also would have also allowed Colossal to present the information to the patent office, since information already in the public domain can't be patented.

In response to emailed questions, Lamm initially sought to avoid saying whether or not Colossal had filed for a patent covering the transgenic wolves, similar to the one on the “mammoth.” It's a sensitive question, since such a patent would mean the canids are articles of commerce, not wild creatures returned to their “rightful place in the ecosystem,” as the company said last week.

“We take a thoughtful approach to intellectual property that balances scientific advancement with sustainable business practices,” Lamm said in his initial response. “What's important to understand is that any IP protection would be limited to specific technical methods and innovations we've developed—not the genetic heritage of extinct species themselves. We see ourselves as stewards of this science rather than owners of these magnificent creatures.”

The pending mammoth patent paints a very different picture. First filed in 2023, it is titled “Woolly mammoth specific gene variants and compositions comprising same” and contains a list of 29 claims that seek to control both a long list of mammoth gene variants and animals whose bodies contain that genetic code.

That is, this patent application doesn't cover any specific method or technology, but is instead aimed at securing rights to novel animals with genetic changes that alter their hair, body size, immune system, tolerance to cold, and even cognitive capacity. 

“Any animal with woolly mammoth genes falls under the claims,” says Jacob Sherkow, a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Patent offices will probably chop away at the application before it's approved and might even reject it. During the examination of a patent, inventors are typically required to narrow the commercial rights they're seeking to those elements that are truly “new and useful” and also must steer clear of statutory prohibitions about what can be patented, which differ widely by country.

“I imagine very few of these patent claims are going to get issued as they stand,” says Sherkow. “But they'll be a stalking horse—er, mammoth?—on what aspects of revived species are patentable.”

Ultimately, the reason Colossal is trying to patent elephants with ancient DNA in them could simply be that it gives investors a little more confidence in its novel and untested business plans in de-extinction. 

“Early-stage companies sometimes bet on long-tail events,” says Andy Tang, a partner at Draper Associates, one of the venture capital firms that put money into Colossal. Tang, who says he isn't speaking for the company, believes that “in the scenario woolly mammoth[s] become important for partners, then it would be better to create some barrier to entry.”  He adds, “I think it is just cheaper to invest in patents early.  Much cheaper to patent the core tech early in order to avoid being reactive.”

 

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

Why archaeologists are increasingly leaving historic sites untouched until we have less destructive technologies for studying them. 

The animals, the first to have been created by Colossal Biosciences, have fluffy coats and curly whiskers.

Colossal Biosciences claims it has revived an extinct species, but scientists outside the company are skeptical.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","AI is coming for music, too","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1114433/ai-artificial-intelligence-music-diffusion-creativity-songs-writer/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

New diffusion AI models that make songs from scratch are complicating our definitions of authorship and human creativity.

The end of this story includes samples of AI-generated music.

Artificial intelligence was barely a term in 1956, when top scientists from the field of computing arrived at Dartmouth College for a summer conference. The computer scientist John McCarthy had coined the phrase in the funding proposal for the event, a gathering to work through how to build machines that could use language, solve problems like humans, and improve themselves. But it was a good choice, one that captured the organizers' founding premise: Any feature of human intelligence could “in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” 

In their proposal, the group had listed several “aspects of the artificial intelligence problem.” The last item on their list, and in hindsight perhaps the most difficult, was building a machine that could exhibit creativity and originality.

At the time, psychologists were grappling with how to define and measure creativity in humans. The prevailing theory—that creativity was a product of intelligence and high IQ—was fading, but psychologists weren't sure what to replace it with. The Dartmouth organizers had one of their own. “The difference between creative thinking and unimaginative competent thinking lies in the injection of some randomness,” they wrote, adding that such randomness “must be guided by intuition to be efficient.” 

Nearly 70 years later, following a number of boom-and-bust cycles in the field, we now have AI models that more or less follow that recipe. While large language models that generate text have exploded in the last three years, a different type of AI, based on what are called diffusion models, is having an unprecedented impact on creative domains. By transforming random noise into coherent patterns, diffusion models can generate new images, videos, or speech, guided by text prompts or other input data. The best ones can create outputs indistinguishable from the work of people, as well as bizarre, surreal results that feel distinctly nonhuman. 

Record labels are suing two leading AI startups and are reportedly exploring a licensing deal with YouTube—actions that will determine what the future of AI music sounds like, and if there is one at all.

Now these models are marching into a creative field that is arguably more vulnerable to disruption than any other: music. AI-generated creative works—from orchestra performances to heavy metal—are poised to suffuse our lives more thoroughly than any other product of AI has done yet. The songs are likely to blend into our streaming platforms, party and wedding playlists, soundtracks, and more, whether or not we notice who (or what) made them. 

For years, diffusion models have stirred debate in the visual-art world about whether what they produce reflects true creation or mere replication. Now this debate has come for music, an art form that is deeply embedded in our experiences, memories, and social lives. Music models can now create songs capable of eliciting real emotional responses, presenting a stark example of how difficult it's becoming to define authorship and originality in the age of AI. 

The courts are actively grappling with this murky territory. Major record labels are suing the top AI music generators, alleging that diffusion models do little more than replicate human art without compensation to artists. The model makers counter that their tools are made to assist in human creation.  

In deciding who is right, we're forced to think hard about our own human creativity. Is creativity, whether in artificial neural networks or biological ones, merely the result of vast statistical learning and drawn connections, with a sprinkling of randomness? If so, then authorship is a slippery concept. If not—if there is some distinctly human element to creativity—what is it? What does it mean to be moved by something without a human creator? I had to wrestle with these questions the first time I heard an AI-generated song that was genuinely fantastic—it was unsettling to know that someone merely wrote a prompt and clicked “Generate.” That predicament is coming soon for you, too. 

After the Dartmouth conference, its participants went off in different research directions to create the foundational technologies of AI. At the same time, cognitive scientists were following a 1950 call from J.P. Guilford, president of the American Psychological Association, to tackle the question of creativity in human beings. They came to a definition, first formalized in 1953 by the psychologist Morris Stein in the Journal of Psychology: Creative works are both novel, meaning they present something new, and useful, meaning they serve some purpose to someone. Some have called for “useful” to be replaced by “satisfying,” and others have pushed for a third criterion: that creative things are also surprising. 

Later, in the 1990s, the rise of functional magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to study more of the neural mechanisms underlying creativity in many fields, including music. Computational methods in the past few years have also made it easier to map out the role that memory and associative thinking play in creative decisions. 

What has emerged is less a grand unified theory of how a creative idea originates and unfolds in the brain and more an ever-growing list of powerful observations. We can first divide the human creative process into phases, including an ideation or proposal step, followed by a more critical and evaluative step that looks for merit in ideas. A leading theory on what guides these two phases is called the associative theory of creativity, which posits that the most creative people can form novel connections between distant concepts.

“It could be like spreading activation,” says Roger Beaty, a researcher who leads the Cognitive Neuroscience of Creativity Laboratory at Penn State. “You think of one thing; it just kind of activates related concepts to whatever that one concept is.”

These connections often hinge specifically on semantic memory, which stores concepts and facts, as opposed to episodic memory, which stores memories from a particular time and place. Recently, more sophisticated computational models have been used to study how people make connections between concepts across great “semantic distances.” For example, the word apocalypse is more closely related to nuclear power than to celebration. Studies have shown that highly creative people may perceive very semantically distinct concepts as close together. Artists have been found to generate word associations across greater distances than non-artists. Other research has supported the idea that creative people have “leaky” attention—that is, they often notice information that might not be particularly relevant to their immediate task. 

Neuroscientific methods for evaluating these processes do not suggest that creativity unfolds in a particular area of the brain. “Nothing in the brain produces creativity like a gland secretes a hormone,” Dean Keith Simonton, a leader in creativity research, wrote in the Cambridge Handbook of the Neuroscience of Creativity. 

The evidence instead points to a few dispersed networks of activity during creative thought, Beaty says—one to support the initial generation of ideas through associative thinking, another involved in identifying promising ideas, and another for evaluation and modification. A new study, led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and published in February, suggests that creativity might even involve the suppression of particular brain networks, like ones involved in self-censorship. 

So far, machine creativity—if you can call it that—looks quite different. Though at the time of the Dartmouth conference AI researchers were interested in machines inspired by human brains, that focus had shifted by the time diffusion models were invented, about a decade ago. 

The best clue to how they work is in the name. If you dip a paintbrush loaded with red ink into a glass jar of water, the ink will diffuse and swirl into the water seemingly at random, eventually yielding a pale pink liquid. Diffusion models simulate this process in reverse, reconstructing legible forms from randomness.

For a sense of how this works for images, picture a photo of an elephant. To train the model, you make a copy of the photo, adding a layer of random black-and-white static on top. Make a second copy and add a bit more, and so on hundreds of times until the last image is pure static, with no elephant in sight. For each image in between, a statistical model predicts how much of the image is noise and how much is really the elephant. It compares its guesses with the right answers and learns from its mistakes. Over millions of these examples, the model gets better at “de-noising” the images and connecting these patterns to descriptions like “male Borneo elephant in an open field.” 

Now that it's been trained, generating a new image means reversing this process. If you give the model a prompt, like “a happy orangutan in a mossy forest,” it generates an image of random white noise and works backward, using its statistical model to remove bits of noise step by step. At first, rough shapes and colors appear. Details come after, and finally (if it works) an orangutan emerges, all without the model “knowing” what an orangutan is.

The approach works much the same way for music. A diffusion model does not “compose” a song the way a band might, starting with piano chords and adding vocals and drums. Instead, all the elements are generated at once. The process hinges on the fact that the many complexities of a song can be depicted visually in a single waveform, representing the amplitude of a sound wave plotted against time. 

AI generated a “7 out of 10” track. “But the reason you go into Hans Zimmer is for 10 out of 10,” says Gareth Edwards. 

Think of a record player. By traveling along a groove in a piece of vinyl, a needle mirrors the path of the sound waves engraved in the material and transmits it into a signal for the speaker. The speaker simply pushes out air in these patterns, generating sound waves that convey the whole song. 

From a distance, a waveform might look as if it just follows a song's volume. But if you were to zoom in closely enough, you could see patterns in the spikes and valleys, like the 49 waves per second for a bass guitar playing a low G. A waveform contains the summation of the frequencies of all different instruments and textures. “You see certain shapes start taking place,” says David Ding, cofounder of the AI music company Udio, “and that kind of corresponds to the broad melodic sense.” 

Since waveforms, or similar charts called spectrograms, can be treated like images, you can create a diffusion model out of them. A model is fed millions of clips of existing songs, each labeled with a description. To generate a new song, it starts with pure random noise and works backward to create a new waveform. The path it takes to do so is shaped by what words someone puts into the prompt.

Ding worked at Google DeepMind for five years as a senior research engineer on diffusion models for images and videos, but he left to found Udio, based in New York, in 2023. The company and its competitor Suno, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are now leading the race for music generation models. Both aim to build AI tools that enable nonmusicians to make music. Suno is larger, claiming more than 12 million users, and raised a $125 million funding round in May 2024. The company has partnered with artists including Timbaland. Udio raised a seed funding round of $10 million in April 2024 from prominent investors like Andreessen Horowitz as well as musicians Will.i.am and Common.

The results of Udio and Suno so far suggest there's a sizable audience of people who may not care whether the music they listen to is made by humans or machines. Suno has artist pages for creators, some with large followings, who generate songs entirely with AI, often accompanied by AI-generated images of the artist. These creators are not musicians in the conventional sense but skilled prompters, creating work that can't be attributed to a single composer or singer. In this emerging space, our normal definitions of authorship—and our lines between creation and replication—all but dissolve.

The results of Udio and Suno so far suggest there's a sizable audience of people who may not care whether the music they listen to is made by humans or machines.

The music industry is pushing back. Both companies were sued by major record labels in June 2024, and the lawsuits are ongoing. The labels, including Universal and Sony, allege that the AI models have been trained on copyrighted music “at an almost unimaginable scale” and generate songs that “imitate the qualities of genuine human sound recordings” (the case against Suno cites one ABBA-adjacent song called “Prancing Queen,” for example). 

Suno did not respond to requests for comment on the litigation, but in a statement responding to the case posted on Suno's blog in August, CEO Mikey Shulman said the company trains on music found on the open internet, which “indeed contains copyrighted materials.” But, he argued, “learning is not infringing.”

A representative from Udio said the company would not comment on pending litigation. At the time of the lawsuit, Udio released a statement mentioning that its model has filters to ensure that it “does not reproduce copyrighted works or artists' voices.” 

Complicating matters even further is guidance from the US Copyright Office, released in January, that says AI-generated works can be copyrighted if they involve a considerable amount of human input. A month later, an artist in New York received what might be the first copyright for a piece of visual art made with the help of AI. The first song could be next.  

These legal cases wade into a gray area similar to one explored by other court battles unfolding in AI. At issue here is whether training AI models on copyrighted content is allowed, and whether generated songs unfairly copy a human artist's style. 

But AI music is likely to proliferate in some form regardless of these court decisions; YouTube has reportedly been in talks with major labels to license their music for AI training, and Meta's recent expansion of its agreements with Universal Music Group suggests that licensing for AI-generated music might be on the table. 

If AI music is here to stay, will any of it be any good? Consider three factors: the training data, the diffusion model itself, and the prompting. The model can only be as good as the library of music it learns from and the descriptions of that music, which must be complex to capture it well. A model's architecture then determines how well it can use what's been learned to generate songs. And the prompt you feed into the model—as well as the extent to which the model “understands” what you mean by “turn down that saxophone,” for example—is pivotal too.

Is the result creation or simply replication of the training data? We could ask the same question about human creativity.

Arguably the most important issue is the first: How extensive and diverse is the training data, and how well is it labeled? Neither Suno nor Udio has disclosed what music has gone into its training set, though these details will likely have to be disclosed during the lawsuits. 

Udio says the way those songs are labeled is essential to the model. “An area of active research for us is: How do we get more and more refined descriptions of music?” Ding says. A basic description would identify the genre, but then you could also say whether a song is moody, uplifting, or calm. More technical descriptions might mention a two-five-one chord progression or a specific scale. Udio says it does this through a combination of machine and human labeling. 

“Since we want to target a broad range of target users, that also means that we need a broad range of music annotators,” he says. “Not just people with music PhDs who can describe the music on a very technical level, but also music enthusiasts who have their own informal vocabulary for describing music.”

Competitive AI music generators must also learn from a constant supply of new songs made by people, or else their outputs will be stuck in time, sounding stale and dated. For this, today's AI-generated music relies on human-generated art. In the future, though, AI music models may train on their own outputs, an approach being experimented with in other AI domains.

Because models start with a random sampling of noise, they are nondeterministic; giving the same AI model the same prompt will result in a new song each time. That's also because many makers of diffusion models, including Udio, inject additional randomness through the process—essentially taking the waveform generated at each step and distorting it ever so slightly in hopes of adding imperfections that serve to make the output more interesting or real. The organizers of the Dartmouth conference themselves recommended such a tactic back in 1956.

Forget one-click creativity. These artists and musicians are finding new ways to make art using AI, by injecting friction, challenge, and serendipity into the process.

According to Udio co­founder and chief operating officer Andrew Sanchez, it's this randomness inherent in generative AI programs that comes as a shock to many people. For the past 70 years, computers have executed deterministic programs: Give the software an input and receive the same response every time. 

“Many of our artists partners will be like, ‘Well, why does it do this?'” he says. “We're like, well, we don't really know.” The generative era requires a new mindset, even for the companies creating it: that AI programs can be messy and inscrutable.

Is the result creation or simply replication of the training data? Fans of AI music told me we could ask the same question about human creativity. As we listen to music through our youth, neural mechanisms for learning are weighted by these inputs, and memories of these songs influence our creative outputs. In a recent study, Anthony Brandt, a composer and professor of music at Rice University, pointed out that both humans and large language models use past experiences to evaluate possible future scenarios and make better choices. 

Indeed, much of human art, especially in music, is borrowed. This often results in litigation, with artists alleging that a song was copied or sampled without permission. Some artists suggest that diffusion models should be made more transparent, so we could know that a given song's inspiration is three parts David Bowie and one part Lou Reed. Udio says there is ongoing research to achieve this, but right now, no one can do it reliably. 

For great artists, “there is that combination of novelty and influence that is at play,” Sanchez says. “And I think that that's something that is also at play in these technologies.”

But there are lots of areas where attempts to equate human neural networks with artificial ones quickly fall apart under scrutiny. Brandt carves out one domain where he sees human creativity clearly soar above its machine-made counterparts: what he calls “amplifying the anomaly.” AI models operate in the realm of statistical sampling. They do not work by emphasizing the exceptional but, rather, by reducing errors and finding probable patterns. Humans, on the other hand, are intrigued by quirks. “Rather than being treated as oddball events or ‘one-offs,'” Brandt writes, the quirk “permeates the creative product.” 

He cites Beethoven's decision to add a jarring off-key note in the last movement of his Symphony no. 8. “Beethoven could have left it at that,” Brandt says. “But rather than treating it as a one-off, Beethoven continues to reference this incongruous event in various ways. In doing so, the composer takes a momentary aberration and magnifies its impact.” One could look to similar anomalies in the backward loop sampling of late Beatles recordings, pitched-up vocals from Frank Ocean, or the incorporation of “found sounds,” like recordings of a crosswalk signal or a door closing, favored by artists like Charlie Puth and by Billie Eilish's producer Finneas O'Connell. 

If a creative output is indeed defined as one that's both novel and useful, Brandt's interpretation suggests that the machines may have us matched on the second criterion while humans reign supreme on the first. 

To explore whether that is true, I spent a few days playing around with Udio's model. It takes a minute or two to generate a 30-second sample, but if you have paid versions of the model you can generate whole songs. I decided to pick 12 genres, generate a song sample for each, and then find similar songs made by people. I built a quiz to see if people in our newsroom could spot which songs were made by AI. 

The average score was 46%. And for a few genres, especially instrumental ones, listeners were wrong more often than not. When I watched people do the test in front of me, I noticed that the qualities they confidently flagged as a sign of composition by AI—a fake-sounding instrument, a weird lyric—rarely proved them right. Predictably, people did worse in genres they were less familiar with; some did okay on country or soul, but many stood no chance against jazz, classical piano, or pop. Beaty, the creativity researcher, scored 66%, while Brandt, the composer, finished at 50% (though he answered correctly on the orchestral and piano sonata tests). 

Remember that the model doesn't deserve all the credit here; these outputs could not have been created without the work of human artists whose work was in the training data. But with just a few prompts, the model generated songs that few people would pick out as machine-made. A few could easily have been played at a party without raising objections, and I found two I genuinely loved, even as a lifelong musician and generally picky music person. But sounding real is not the same thing as sounding original. The songs did not feel driven by oddities or anomalies—certainly not on the level of Beethoven's “jump scare.” Nor did they seem to bend genres or cover great leaps between themes. In my test, people sometimes struggled to decide whether a song was AI-generated or simply bad. 

How much will this matter in the end? The courts will play a role in deciding whether AI music models serve up replications or new creations—and how artists are compensated in the process—but we, as listeners, will decide their cultural value. To appreciate a song, do we need to picture a human artist behind it—someone with experience, ambitions, opinions? Is a great song no longer great if we find out it's the product of AI? 

Sanchez says people may wonder who is behind the music. But “at the end of the day, however much AI component, however much human component, it's going to be art,” he says. “And people are going to react to it on the quality of its aesthetic merits.”

In my experiment, though, I saw that the question really mattered to people—and some vehemently resisted the idea of enjoying music made by a computer model. When one of my test subjects instinctively started bobbing her head to an electro-pop song on the quiz, her face expressed doubt. It was almost as if she was trying her best to picture a human rather than a machine as the song's composer. “Man,” she said, “I really hope this isn't AI.” 

It was.  

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

These newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations—and there's no way to stop them.

In high school Earth science, you likely learned that hailstorms form when strong upward winds push water droplets to freezing altitudes, where they solidify and gather additional layers of ice as they cycle up and down the storm cloud. When they grow too heavy, they plummet to the ground. For once, however, new research suggests that the truth might be simpler than what we were taught to believe.

An international team of researchers has shed light on the formation and growth of hailstones in storm clouds by analyzing chemical signatures within the ice. Their analysis, published April 2 in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, shows that most hailstones form through simpler, more direct paths than previously assumed—an observation that challenges the idea that most hailstones form by repeatedly cycling through storms clouds. In addition to contesting widespread notions about hail formation, the study could help improve forecasts of severe weather.

“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Qinghong Zhang, a lead researcher of the study from Peking University's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, explained in a statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.”

The researchers from China and the U.S. analyzed stable isotopes (non-radioactive forms of atoms) to reveal the altitudes and temperatures at which the layers of 27 hailstones from China formed—essentially, a vertical map of the hailstones' movement in storm clouds.

The analysis revealed that most followed relatively simple paths. Ten hailstones grew while descending, 13 were elevated by upwinds only once, and three moved mostly horizontally. Only one of the 27 hailstones showed evidence of consistent cycling in storm clouds, challenging long-held beliefs about the prevalence of this growth process.

Furthermore, “trajectory analysis revealed that similar-sized hailstones from a single storm tended to form at similar heights, whereas those larger than 25 mm [0.98 inches] in diameter exhibited at least one period of upward growth,” the researchers explained in the study. This is consistent with the observation that intense hailstorms are associated with strong updrafts, or upward-moving currents of air.

Although most hailstone growth takes place at temperatures between 14 and -22 degrees Fahrenheit (-10 and -30 degrees Celsius), the researchers also discovered that hail “embryos” can develop within a broader range: 16 to -28 degrees Fahrenheit (-8.7 to -33.4 degrees Celsius).

The 27 studied hailstones were collected by citizen scientists in China through a project coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization. Moving forward, Zhang and her colleagues aim to study more hailstorms and integrate the analysis of particulate matter (a mix of liquid and solid particles) found in hailstones.

Ultimately, the study refines our understanding of hailstone formation, with important implications for forecasting severe hailstorms—especially as some scientists warn that global warming may promote the development of larger hailstones.

And here we are at the end of the road. The first season of Daredevil: Born Again hasn't been without its faults, but last week's “Isle of Joy” and our closer “Straight to Hell” has plenty of fun moments as its settles into the next chapter. A lot's going on here, to the point it doesn't feel like it's just an hour long, and it's all largely worth it in the end.



Last week, we learned Vanessa hired Poindexter to kill Foggy, and “Hell” opens with a flashback of that fateful meeting. She had his actions during the original show's third season wiped clean from his record in exchange for his services. She needs Foggy and his client dead, and Dex is the best man for this kind of job. “Your history with my husband isn't part of this,” Vanessa says, to which Dex groggily replies: “He's always part of this.” He's been felt more than seen this season, but if the brief tease of him in the closing montage is any indication, he might be all over season two and make getting revenge on the Fisks his priority.

Following the intro, Matt's recuperating at the hospital after Dex shot him. (“Karen?” being the first thing he says upon waking, and with Heather in the room, is extremely messy.) He remains adamant the Fisks are up to something, and he's got no idea how right he is; we later learn that Fisk has been so gung-ho about Red Hook because it's a free port exempt from local and federal jurisdiction. As the mayor with crime families and corrupt cops on his side, he'll happily turn the neighborhood into a city-state that can further his crime operation.

Now fully in Mayor Kingpin mode, he cuts off New York's power, giving Buck a window to kill Matt and an opportunity for some good ol' chaos to reign upon the streets. There's plenty of that going on, and the snapshots we see feel like a dark payoff to the civilian interviews and shots of New York from previous episodes. One of the darker moments comes when a cop executes a looter before shoving a mask on the corpse so it looks like a “justified” vigilante killing. His partner is more shocked by the killing itself than the frame job, but he's not angry enough to do anything about it. Various side characters throughout “Hell” react to what's going on around them like it's just dawned on them how much damage Fisk has done, and the position he's put them in. Daredevil: Born Again has repeatedly shown how easy it's been for the mayor to win people over with his charisma—Heather, after everything they've been through, is appointed as his mental health commissioner—or just find a weakness to exploit, while at the same time showing compliance can be as bad or worse than outright inaction.

Sheila is the best example of this: she's always had a look of concern whenever her boss or Daniel did something that seemed to overstep boundaries. But instead of taking a chance to get the hell out of dodge, she chooses self-preservation and dimes out police commissioner Gallo before he leaves town to get help with unseating Fisk. Her betrayal leads to “Hell's” most gruesome moment, wherein Fisk crushes Gallo's skull with his bare hands in front of a dozen task force cops. Several are visibly rattled by what they just saw, but if any of them are truly having second thoughts, those feelings will presumably be explored next season. When all is said and done, it's hard to imagine any task force dissenters or even Sheila coming back from this, either morally or alive at all.

As is, the fate of New York rests in the hands of its small number of vigilantes. Frank's already at Matt's apartment when he arrives, and after some fun banter, the two get to work taking down the task force cops storming the place. It's fun to see the pair in action, particularly Frank, who can't not kill these guys after everything he's heard about them. The slow-motion and close-up shots of his feral face as he tears through the cops serves as a welcome reminder that he is the Punisher and on another level. 

Only Cole North is lucky enough to survive the Daredevil/Punisher team-up, and it's here where the show seemingly reveals he's Hector's Ayala's killer. I say “seemingly” because it's unclear how true this claim is; Matt doesn't use his hearing to check Cole's heartbeat, and Cole doesn't confirm or deny his involvement. A grenade thrown from offscreen seems to put that to bed and possibly leave the door open for Cole's return. But until then, Karen's back! It's nice to have her here, and Frank as a temporary third wheel makes things delightfully awkward when the three head back to his place. Matt, the little shit that he is, can't help but comment on the “adrenaline” between Frank and Karen later on, giving fans of that pairing a small bone while leaving room open for more of them in the future. 

Frank's assistance ends there, because he's got some cops over in Red Hook to take care of. Like a slasher villain on a rampage, he shoots, stabs, and hatchets his way through the task force before they manage to overwhelm him. If there were any doubts that he didn't care for these Punisher wannabes, killing and insulting them to their faces is clear enough. To him, the greatest insult is the co-opting of his symbol without understanding or acknowledging what drives his actions. His very direct “go fuck yourselves” lands him in a cage alongside Fisk's other enemies, including Jack. But if there's one thing the Punisher's good at doing, it's persevering, and the mid-credits scene shows him begin his escape and eventual one-shot special.

On the other side of Red Hook, Matt and Karen learn this whole mini apocalypse isn't going to be fixed with a simple one-on-one fight between Devil and Kingpin. Previous Daredevil finales had him going in sticks blazing for the fate of the city, but that can't be the play this time. Martial law's been declared and Fisk's operation isn't going anywhere, so the only thing to do is recover and gather forces. Currently, Matt and Karen's ranks include some cops, plus Josie, Cherry, and Detective Kim. Not a great starter lineup, but they have other allies, whether they know it or not; Angela del Toro and Kirsten (who has the filing showing Red Hook's a free port) are prominently featured over a montage of the principal characters, indicating they'll have important parts to play going forward. Whoever else steps to up to help likely won't be turned down, because from here on out, it's a war for the soul of New York.

Thus ends the first season of Daredevil: Born Again. Over the last eight weeks, the show's had its highs and lows, eventually evening out to conflicted but competent. It's also found more of its own voice while continuing the spirit of its predecessor, and things end strong enough that another season would've been welcome even if it weren't already announced. Hopefully we see you new and improved in 2026, Matt.

Laptop users … you can do a lot on your laptop all itself, yes. Though you could be severely limiting yourself. A 17 inch laptop is considered to be on the larger side, yet monitors pretty much start at 10 inches larger than that nowadays. Then you have the super wide, 4K displays for even more field of view. Maybe you type a lot at your desk and you'd prefer having a tactile mechanical keyboard. On-board speakers for your laptop not loud enough? Gotta plug in speakers too. Then we have microphones, headphones, maybe even a drawing tablet for the artists out there. And all those need to be plugged in but you just have the one USB port on your laptop.

That's exactly why you need a good USB hub. This Anker USB C splitter is precisely what we're looking for. And best of all, it's on sale. You can save 29% which works out to a cool $10 discount. That black version is the one down to $25. It's also available in blue, green, grey, and white but those are only down to $28—still lower than full price.

See at Amazon

This docking station is a single cable solution so you can avoid a messy desk and tangled wires. Just plug your laptop in with the USB-C cable to connect to all of your accessories at your desk in one go. You can connect to a 4K display and watch videos up to 30Hz using the HDMI output. Do note though that the USB-C data port does not support video output. The HDMI should do just fine for you.

You laptop can even charge through the the same USB that's connecting it to your displays. The Anker USB-C hub supports up to 85W passthrough charging so no need for you power adapter anymore. The USB-hub can handle that so you only need to spare the one USB-C port on your laptop.

The USB-C hub can even be used to transfer files between devices and it does so super quickly. You can move files to and from your laptop at speeds of up to 5Gbps via the USB-C and USB-A ports.

Right now, this USB-C hub from Anker dropped in price by 29%. It's normally sitting at $35 so after the discount, you'll only pay $25. Save yourself $10 with the black Anker USB-C hub, or save yourself $7 and go with the fancy blue, green, grey, or white options.

Over the past decade, there's been a lot of talk about “ideological extremism” on both the left and right, and the government has often claimed that warped political beliefs are encouraging Americans to commit violent acts. However, under the new Trump administration, the government now seems prepared to go after people who don't believe in anything at all.

Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein writes that the government has a new target in its war on extremism: nihilists—more specifically, Nihilist Violent Extremists, or NVEs. The government has reportedly come up with this designation as a kind of catchall for the culprits behind various violent incidents, and the term has shown up in several recent court cases.

Who is a true NVE? That's a good question, and the answer is: anybody. Klippenstein aptly notes that the term has a conveniently loose definition that could be applied to all sorts of different groups that the government considers undesirable. He writes that the NVE term…

…has the beauty of being elastic enough to apply to individuals and groups who are the focus of the administration's war on all kinds of Americans. Nihilism also avoids all of the rusty and problematic words of the past: subversive, dissident, insurrectionist, revolutionary, or even “anti-government” (the Biden term).

Klippenstein writes that the term was recently used in the legal proceedings of Nikita Casap, a teen from Wisconsin who was arrested in February and charged with murdering his parents. Law enforcement claims Casap also planned to assassinate President Trump to spur a civil war in the U.S. But there are plenty of people who have been accused of committing violent crimes for vaguely anarchistic reasons, be it people like Luigi Mangione, or the gaggle of people of who have recently been arrested for vandalizing and firebombing Teslas, or the Zizians.

The road to this new low in law enforcement terminology has been long. While “ideological extremism” has always existed in the U.S., it became a political (and, eventually, policy) issue in the modern era during the Clinton years, when incidents like Ruby Ridge and the Oklahoma City bombing brought fears of the rightwing militia movement into the mainstream. During the Bush years, 9/11 spurred a war on Islamist extremism—both in the U.S. and all over the world. Then, during the Biden years, the specter of January 6th encouraged the government to declare a war on “domestic terrorism.”

In short, the government has always found reasons to justify its federal police powers, though few of them have ever been as sloppily constructed as the current government's newest fearmongering buzzword.

An engineer in the U.S. recounts being ""stressed out for the two weeks"" after someone bought their used Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card on eBay, then had the audacity to return it with the GPU and memory chips removed from the board. Piscian19 told fellow Redditors that a ""pristine"" used RTX 4090, sold on eBay, was almost immediately returned for the reason of ""no video."" Thankfully, the story has a happy ending, as eBay eventually refunded the emotionally frazzled seller.

Piscian19's spider senses were aroused by the eBay buyer's profile – a ""huge"" entity with a storefront and California business address. To be forewarned is to be forearmed, so the RTX 4090 seller decided to make sure they were covered. ""I took a ton of pictures, got mega insurance, tracking, etc,"" noted Piscian19.

The Redditor and eBayer's hunch was correct, as the buyer almost immediately started an eBay return process, asking for a refund due to the received graphics card being stone dead.

Upon receiving the return, Piscian19 noted that damage was clearly evident on the card's mounting bracket (these are usually steel) and messy wiring issues. Remember, the seller had pictured everything ahead of postage, and the ""pristine... barely used"" RTX 4090 certainly was now only a shadow of its former self.

The stressed-out engineer then decided it was time to contact eBay and politely mention legal action. However, while they were waiting for the wheels of the complaint process to turn, Piscian19 decided to tear down the card to get an understanding of the new issues before RMAing the hardware. This is when it was discovered that the cheeky buyer had desoldered the GPU and VRAM chips before returning the RTX 4090...

The best graphics cards are still difficult to obtain at reasonable prices, so the level of second-hand skulduggery seems to be amplified. However, there seems to be new hope in the market with more mid- to high-end cards trickling through to retail and both AMD and Nvidia beginning to address the mainstream mass-market '060 graphics card segment now, with their RTX 5060/Ti and RX 5060 XT models.

If you are dabbling in the used GPU market, take a leaf from Piscian19's book on the seller side. Photodocument as much of the sale and postage process as seems adequate to cover all eventualities. Used GPU buyers should also be diligent, as both sides of the equation have their swindlers.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB delivers 15% more performance than its 4060 Ti 16GB predecessor, at a theoretically lower price and with a lot more memory bandwidth. It's a good choice, assuming you can find it at a reasonable price.

Great mainstream value and performance

16GB of VRAM, with GDDR7 offering more bandwidth

Better to have Blackwell's features than not

How much will these actually cost?

Will they be readily available to purchase?

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB wraps up the Blackwell RTX 50-series GPU family, more or less — along with the 5060 Ti 16GB we're reviewing today, the announced RTX 5060 series also has a 5060 Ti 8GB card, and next month will bring the vanilla RTX 5060. Blackwell RTX GPUs land at various places on our list of the best graphics cards, provided you can actually find one in stock at your favorite retailer for a not-obscene price.

Compared to the prior generation RTX 4060 Ti, Nvidia has only made some relatively minor upgrades to the core specs of the 5060 Ti. Again, there will be both 8GB and 16GB models, but where the 4060 Ti 16GB was relatively uncommon compared to the 8GB variant that arrived first, it seems things will be swapped around this time. The 5060 Ti 16GB should be the more common AIB model, with the 8GB card seemingly deemphasized.

And for good reason. In our test suite, as well as in a variety of other games, 8GB cards are getting more than a little long in the tooth. Most games are still able to run okay at 1080p with maxed out settings, and often even 1440p. 4K on the other hand proves to be too much in 11 out of the 18 games in our current test suite — and we're aware of quite a few other recent releases where 8GB would also be problematic.

We've written a lot of supplemental coverage about Nvidia's new Blackwell RTX 50-series GPUs. If you want a primer, or additional information, check out these articles:

• Blackwell architecture
• DLSS 4, MFG, and full RT testing
• Neural rendering and DLSS 4
• RTX 50-series Founders Edition cards
• RTX AI PCs and generative AI for games
• Blackwell for professionals and creators
• Blackwell benchmarking 101

Nvidia officially gives MSRPs of $379 for the 5060 Ti 8GB card, and $429 for the 5060 Ti 16GB. In our opinion, $50 for double the VRAM should be a no-brainer for most gamers. Again, that's in stark contrast to the 4060 Ti where the original price difference was $100, and the intervening two years haven't caused more recent games to become less demanding — quite the opposite.

We have a whole host of related articles for Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs, which you can check out for additional background information. The short summary for the 5060 Ti is that it follows a similar pattern to the other RTX 50-series launches. The specs are pretty similar to the prior generation, with the same TSMC 4N process node, a similar die size, and similar transistor counts.

The big changes fall under what Nvidia classifies as ""neural rendering"" — DLSS upscaling and frame generation (Multi Frame Generation in the case of the 50-series), and the potential for AI to be leveraged in a variety of other ways to change the gaming experience. Let's start with the usual specifications table.

On paper, the 8GB and 16GB variants have the exact same specifications, with the exception of VRAM capacity. In practice, the additional VRAM can have a slightly negative impact on performance in situations where the GPU is at its power limit. We saw that consistently with the RTX 4060 Ti, usually to the tune of a 1–2 percent dip in performance in situations where the extra memory wasn't beneficial.

TGP (Total Graphics Power), as we've seen with the other Blackwell RTX GPUs, ends up 20W higher than the previous generation part. Factory overclocked cards — and both cards we have in for testing are overclocked models — can push power limits higher, though such tuning usually gets reserved for the higher tier card models. Combined with the slightly higher GPU core counts and clock speeds, it should allow for a larger gap between the prior gen 4060 Ti and its replacement.

One of the biggest changes with Blackwell is the support for GDDR7 memory. Nvidia used GDDR6 and GDDR6X with the Ada Lovelace GPUs, with the 4060 Ti getting vanilla GDDR6 memory running at 18 Gbps. The 5060 Ti gets GDDR7 running at 28 Gbps, giving a potential 56% increase in total memory bandwidth. In fact, the GDDR7 memory on a 128-bit interface delivers the same total bandwidth as the GDDR6 14 Gbps used on the 3060 Ti with its 256-bit interface — and the large L2 cache on Blackwell (and Ada) helps to further improve effective bandwidth.



The biggest unknown with the RTX 5060 Ti is pricing and availability. Traditionally, Nvidia (and AMD) have had more budget GPUs available at launch than mainstream cards, and more mainstream than high-end. Perhaps that has happened with Blackwell RTX, but whatever the total number of GPUs produced and sold so far, it has been woefully insufficient compared to the demand. The result has been higher prices across both new and old generation GPUs.

Nvidia's MSRPs have looked good, but outside of a few RTX 5070 cards (which are out of stock for the time being), almost nothing has actually sold at MSRP. The going rate for RTX 5070 seems to be $650~$700, over $100 more than the base MSRP, and that's the best of the recently launched GPUs. RTX 5070 Ti has been selling for $950~$1,050 (or more) since launch, $200 or more above MSRP. The RTX 5080 has been selling at $400~$500 above it's MSRP, and the RTX 5090 is basically going for twice the MSRP set by Nvidia.

AMD and Intel GPUs are doing any better. The RX 9070 is selling for $850 and more right now, $300 above its $549 MSRP. The RX 9070 XT starts at about $950, $350 above MSRP. Intel's Arc B580 has been regularly selling at $350–$400 since it launched last December, $100 or more above its supposed base price. Even the relatively ho-hum Arc B570 typically goes for $330, again $100 more than MSRP.

Naturally, Nvidia can't directly control what its AIB (add-in board) partners do in terms of prices, though in the past there have been rumored incentives and encouragements. Right now, with the data center GPUs and infrastructure accounting for 89% of Nvidia's staggering $130 billion in revenue from last year, and gaming GPUs accounting for just under 9% of the total, it's no wonder the consumer GPUs are taking a back seat in terms of wafer allocations.

A quick check around the usual places shows the previous generation RTX 4060 Ti 8GB card starting at $525, with the 16GB card starting at nearly $700. Supply of those parts has basically dried up, but it doesn't bode well for a newer, faster replacement to stay at MSRPs of $380 and $430, respectively. Time will tell where things end up, but if you're interested in picking up an RTX 5060 Ti, and you find one at anything close to MSRP (meaning, $430–$450), we'd suggest buying now and then deciding whether or not you want to keep it later.

AMD's Instinct MI308 reportedly gets export restrictions too.

Nvidia will take a $5.5 billion financial hit after U.S. authorities imposed new export restrictions on its H20 HGX AI GPU designed for the Chinese market, the company said Tuesday.

The U.S. government cited H20's memory and interconnect bandwidth as well as its potential use in supercomputers as reasons for the new restrictions. Nvidia is not alone: the U.S. Department of Commerce has also restricted sales of AMD's Instinct MI308 to China, according to Reuters.

""On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that the USG requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries […] of the company's H20 [GPUs] and any other circuits achieving the H20's memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof,"" a statement by Nvidia reads.

""The USG indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China. On April 14, 2025, the USG informed the company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future.""

President Trump's administration planned to restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 HGX and similar processors starting in April, so Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, reportedly even attended a $1 million-a-head dinner with the U.S. president to ease concerns. That did not work, and the company will now take a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter as it now has unsold inventory of its H20 GPUs.

According to section 8.01 of the report. ""The company's first quarter of fiscal year 2026 ends on April 27, 2025. First quarter results are expected to include up to approximately $5.5 billion of charges associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.""

Nvidia's H20 HGX is a cut-down version of its H100 processor that the company specifically engineered to comply with the U.S. government's restrictions imposed on GPUs bound for China in late 2022. Compared to H100, the H20 features significantly reduced AI performance and dramatically reduced HPC performance, which makes it barely suitable for supercomputer workloads that require FP64 compute precision.

The H20 HGX still carries 96GB of HBM3 memory with a peak bandwidth of 4 TB/s and 900 GB/s NVLink interconnections to build 8-way AI servers, thus providing competitive performance in AI workloads.

As a result, H20 HGX has become rather popular in China. Chinese companies like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent have deployed large AI training and inference clusters based on these GPUs. Earlier this month, it was reported that Chinese tech giants spent $16 billion on H20 HGX GPUs in the first quarter ahead of expected export restrictions by the U.S. government starting in May.

In addition to restricting sales of Nvidia's H20 GPUs to Chinese customers, the U.S. Commerce Department also restricted shipments of AMD's Instinct MI308 to China and other D:5 countries. Since AMD is considerably behind Nvidia in sales of AI GPUs, this will barely have a drastic effect on the company's business, though.

YouTuber SSD tests reveals problems all round on two-year-old TLC drives.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


You may not know it, but SSDs will lose data after a period of time if they are simply left unplugged, which can be a serious threat to your data if you store backups or precious files on unplugged SSDs. A year-two update on the how long can SSDs store data unpowered video series is another reminder about the importance of regularly refreshing your backups with a bit of juice. The tests consist of storing data on an SSD and then leaving it unplugged for years to see the impact on the stored data.

As a reminder, an SSD's endurance rating is calculated based on how long it can store data if left unplugged after a certain amount of data has been written, hence the importance of this testing.

TechTuber HTWingNut is back with a report on his modest experiment involving a quartet of SATA SSDs. The key finding was that the two-year-old, well-worn drive exhibited noticeable performance degradation and was affected by a handful of corrupt files. These are signs that this particular SSD was on its way to silicon heaven. HTWingNut's video is an update on an episode from a year earlier, and further updates are promised.

The four tested 'Leven JS-600' branded SSDs are basically bog-standard no-name units. HTWingNut says they are all TLC SSDs of 128GB capacity and rated to withstand 60 TB of written data. Every drive has 100GB of files containing random data, with hash values for all the content provided for later verification.

The two 'Fresh' samples have barely been used; perhaps only the 100GB data set was put on there and verified, and that's it. Meanwhile, the 'Worn' drives have been subjected to 280 terabytes of written data churn, much more than their rated 60 Terabytes Written (TBW) endurance rating..

If you watch the previous year-one video, you will have seen there were no issues with either 'Worn' or 'Fresh' drives. However, time has now taken its toll. Let's take a look at the year-two samples in turn.

The data on this SSD, which hadn't been used or powered up for two years, was 100% good on initial inspection. All the data hashes verified, but it was noted that the verification time took a smidgen longer than two years previously. HD Sentinel tests also showed good, consistent performance for a SATA SSD.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Digging deeper, all isn't well, though. Firing up Crystal Disk Info, HTWingNut noted that this SSD had a Hardware ECC Recovered value of over 400. In other words, the disk's error correction had to step in to fix hundreds of data-based parity bits.

Seeing these errors means ""the SSD is on its way out,"" according to HTWingNut. Indeed, if there is anything iffy about your data storage integrity, it is at least a warning. However, the errors could also have something to do with the drive being left unpowered for two years.



As the worn SSD's data was being verified, there were already signs of performance degradation. The hashing audit eventually revealed that four files were corrupt (hash not matching). Looking at the elapsed time, it was observed that this operation astonishingly took over 4x longer, up from 10 minutes and 3 seconds to 42 minutes and 43 seconds.

Further investigations in HD Sentinel showed that three out of 10,000 sectors were bad and performance was 'spiky.' Returning to Crystal Disk Info, things look even worse. HTWingNut notes that the uncorrectable sectors count went from 0 to 12 on this drive, and the hardware ECC recovered value went from 11,745 before to 201,273 after tests on the day.

In summary, the year-one fresh and well-worn drives had no issues. However, the year-two heavily worn SSD had file corruption and performance was poor. The so-called fresh drive was still good, but ECC figures still raised concern. Come back in late 2025 for the next update from HTWingNut.

We also want to say this is a very small test sample, highlighted out of our interest in the topic rather than for its hard empirical data. I have also experienced SSD data loss after leaving a Mini PC unpowered for just six months or so at my pied-à-terre in Taiwan. On return, Windows refused to boot or be repaired, but a reformat and reinstall seemed to return everything to normal.

Are your files going to be safer with Synology hard drives?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Synology's new Plus Series NAS systems, designed for small and medium enterprises and advanced home users, can no longer use non-Synology or non-certified hard drives and get the full feature set of their device. Instead, Synology customers will have to use the company's self-branded hard drives. While you can still use non-supported drives for storage, Hardwareluxx [machine translated] reports that you'll lose several critical functions, including estimated hard drive health reports, volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analyses, and automatic firmware updates. The company also restricts storage pools and provides limited or zero support for third-party drives.

For reference, precious few companies make hard drives, and Synology is not one of them. As such, a self-branded hard drive is merely a drive from a major vendor, like Seagate, Toshiba, or Western Digital, that gets a new sticker slapped on it alongside a potential custom firmware that serves as a sort of DRM, unlocking the correct functionality from the host device (in this case, a NAS).

The 2024 Synology models and older are not affected by this change. Still, those upgrading to or purchasing the latest Plus Series device, set to be released this year, will have to buy their drives directly from Synology or its certified suppliers to maximize their system. Because of this, you won't be able to pick from the best hard drives if you get Synology's latest Plus Series NAS Systems.

The company first applied this limitation to its enterprise solutions, where reliability is of utmost priority. This practice is fairly common in enterprise settings, as huge corporations are willing to invest in expensive storage solutions that minimize downtime and ensure the security of their data. However, smaller companies would probably think twice before dropping massive amounts of cash on self-branded hard drives that have no added functionality over third-party drives, especially if they can get them for cheaper from other reputable manufacturers.

The company told ComputerBase [machine translated] that it made using Synology-branded and Synology-certified drives compulsory because of the success it saw with its high-performance NAS systems, and that users of the upcoming Plus Series models would “benefit from higher performance, increased reliability, and more efficient support.” Furthermore, Seagate, one of the bigger manufacturers in the storage industry, has recently been rocked by a fraudulent HDD scandal that affected its NAS drives. So, it's likely that Synology wants to ensure that its customers do not get affected by uncertainties such as this.

Nevertheless, there is still a way you can circumvent this hard drive requirement. If you're using an “unsupported” hard drive with an already existing Synology NAS system and migrate it to a new Plus model, you can continue using it without any restrictions. So, you can first set up a non-Synology hard drive in an older Synology NAS system (or ask someone with one to do it for you), and then you can “migrate” the empty drive to your new one, thus saving you some money. However, that obviously isn't an option for the overwhelming majority of the company's customers.

Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) have demonstrated a high-speed wireless data transmission of 5.7 Tb/s (Terabits per second) across a distance of 4.6 kilometers (2.85 miles) using invisible infrared light beams. This achievement is said to represent the highest data rate recorded for wireless communication over such a distance in an urban setting.

The high-speed connection was established between the TU/e campus in the north and the High Tech Campus (HTC) in the south of Eindhoven. Utilizing advanced optical antennas developed by Aircision, a local telecommunications equipment supplier, the system employs free-space optical (FSO) communication. This technique transmits data through focused infrared beams, offering ultra-fast, interference-free wireless communication without relying on traditional cables or radio signals.

Infrared data transmission comes with some notable limitations, such as the requirement for a clear line of sight, a relatively short range, and vulnerability to environmental factors. These challenges make it less ideal for long-distance communication or use in environments where consistent, reliable connectivity is needed, especially when compared to other wireless technologies.

Vincent van Vliet, a Ph.D. researcher at TU/e involved in the project, highlighted the significance of this advancement, ""Infrared wireless communication combines the high data speeds known from optical fibers with the flexibility of wireless communication systems. By complementing existing wireless and fiber-optic technologies, we can build the densely interconnected networks required to bring high-speed data connectivity to every corner of the planet.""

The achievement was made possible using the Reid Photonloop testbed, a permanent setup launched by TU/e to experiment with high-speed wireless communication. This system integrates high-end technology that combines multiple wavelengths in a single transmission. This method is commonly used in fiber optics but applied here for the first time at this scale in wireless FSO communication. The highly focused nature of the transmitted infrared light allows for numerous communication links to coexist without any potential interference.

According to Chigo Okonkwo, Associate Professor and head of TU/e's High-Capacity Optical Transmission Lab, the testbed will help in refining high-speed wireless communication and optimize its reliability and availability in all weather conditions.

Aircision is reportedly exploring practical uses for the technology, including wirelessly linking new 5G or 6G antennas to existing networks—particularly in locations where installing fiber infrastructure is difficult or prohibitively expensive.

Body mass index (BMI) was developed by a Belgian mathematician who wanted to determine the metrics of the average man to better understand human physicality and social aptitudes. No one paid much attention to the equation until about 100 years later when it was popularized by physiologist Ancel Keys, PhD. Keys, the father of the Seven Countries Study and the modern Mediterranean diet, found BMI a useful tool for breaking anthropometric data into categories that could be more easily studied. He used it throughout his multidecade research on cardiovascular disease following a spike in cases after World War II.

BMI was intended to categorize research participants on the basis of their height and weight, and not as a way to determine health. No peer-reviewed research exists stipulating that a BMI of 24.99 makes a person healthy, while a BMI of 25 makes them unhealthy. But, in our attempt to quantify all aspects of the human condition for insurance reimbursement, we have allowed BMI to become a determining factor in care. 

Why are we using BMI to diagnose obesity? Why is there a BMI chart in every primary care office I've visited for the past 20 years? Why are our patients denied care on the basis of BMI rather than on an indicator based on actual research?

The obvious concern with BMI is that it only accounts for sheer mass and not the type of mass. Excess body fat is linked to increased risk for cardiovascular disease  while excess muscle mass is not. Yet, we don't routinely assess body composition; we simply look at a patient's weight and give them a stamp of “normal,” “overweight,” or the dreaded “obese.” Nearly all my career has been spent in the Deep South and I often work with patients who are lifelong laborers — farmers mostly, but some in construction or other physically demanding jobs. These patients, often male, are exceptionally well muscled and capable of impressive physical feats but are marked as “obese” because of their BMI.

Gynoid obesity, most often seen in women and associated with a “pear shape,” has been found to be protective against all-cause mortality, meaning a pear-shaped woman with a BMI in the overweight or even obese category could actually be less likely to die from chronic disease than a male of comparable anthropometrics with android obesity. Yet, I continue to see female, pear-shaped patients whose clinicians have given them an “ideal body weight” that brings their BMI down to 24, without considering the patient's shape, body composition, or any other indicator of health. This means that potentially half the world's population isn't accounted for when using weight-height ratios like BMI.

I would rather my female premenopausal patients focus on muscle development and heart and bone health as they progress into the next stage of life than give them some arbitrary goal of a weight that may or may not even be attainable, especially for women who have given birth. But I often have to wrestle with the patient's desire to please their doctor.

Some research even suggests that an elevated BMI over 25 can be protective against all-cause mortality in those over 65 years old. That same research, a meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that mortality significantly increased only among those 65 or older when their BMI was greater than 33. That is solidly in the class I obesity category, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

The “obesity paradox” has for years indicated that a BMI in the overweight or even obese category can be protective against mortality in those living with cardiovascular disease, yet we continue to allow this metric to determine the course of care. 

If we don't use BMI, how do we get the quantitative results that we're looking for? DEXA scans are expensive, and skinfold thickness tests are inconvenient and — if I'm being honest — painful. Bioelectrical impedance analysis via a Tanita scale or similar device may be a good option for in-clinic anthropometrics. 

Bioelectrical impedance analysis involves allowing a weak current to pass through the body from the hands to the feet and determines body composition on the basis of the speed at which the current travels through different tissues. There is the inconvenience of the client having to remove their socks to use it, and it may not be appropriate for all patients, specifically those with pacemakers. But it is generally an accessible and accurate method to retrieve quantitative measurements of fat mass to track a patient's body composition instead of just viewing all weight the same way. 

Can we get rid of BMI from our assessments? Not if we want our patients to continue to receive the best care that their insurance is willing to provide. But we can focus on other indicators of wellness alongside BMI.

What indicators do I follow, then? I follow weight loss trends and labs. I monitor blood pressure and frequency of bowel movements. And I follow a lot of subjective data as well: “How are your clothes fitting?” and “Is exercise a regular part of your life?” Research has shown that regular exercise can improve cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes; decrease the risk of developing breast, colon, and stomach cancer; and reduce risk for all-cause mortality. 

Why am I not referring to a patient's BMI? Because it's as relevant to their health as their preferred flavor of protein shake. That's to say that it doesn't matter to me. I am worried about my patients' health and wellness, and BMI is at the bottom of my list of concerns.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Patients with carotid tandem lesions who received intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular treatment showed similar functional outcomes and haemorrhage risks as those who received endovascular treatment alone. An analysis of 2267 patients with and without tandem lesions revealed no significant difference in the rate of symptomatic haemorrhage between treatment groups in those with tandem lesions.

""In conclusion, the presence of a carotid tandem lesion should not solely inform the decision to administer or withhold intravenous thrombolysis before endovascular treatment in patients presenting directly to centres capable of providing endovascular treatment. Intravenous thrombolysis plus endovascular treatment was neither superior nor inferior to endovascular treatment alone in patients with carotid tandem lesions,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Fabiano Cavalcante, MD, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online in The Lancet Neurology.

Tandem lesion criteria were defined by individual core laboratories in the included trials, potentially introducing bias. Tandem lesions were defined on the basis of the presence of extracranial carotid stenosis or occlusion on baseline imaging; this approach could have overestimated the prevalence of tandem lesions in trials with information from both CT angiography or MR angiography and digital subtraction angiography. The results were applicable only to patients presenting directly to centres capable of providing endovascular treatment without substantial delay.

Preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm) was associated with the development of airway obstruction over 10 years of follow-up, independent of smoking habits, with comparable odds for disease development across smoking histories. 

“In clinical practice, PRISm may indeed be treated and/or diagnosed as COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. Importantly, in our retrospective case-control study, we found that PRISm that transitioned into airway obstruction presented with more chronic bronchitis, dyspnea, and wheeze and a more rapid decline in FEV1 than PRISm that did not transition into airway obstruction during follow-up,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Helena Backman, PhD, and Tomi Myrberg, PhD, both affiliated to Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. It was published online on March 7, 2025, in CHEST.

The study relied on prebronchodilator spirometry. As PRISm is common in individuals with diabetes, the lack of comprehensive data on such comorbidities could have affected the findings. The sample size may not have been sufficient to detect meaningful associations, potentially introducing type 2 errors. 

The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, a regional agreement between Umeå University and Region Vasterbotten, the Swedish Respiratory Society, VISARE NORR Fund Northern County Councils Regional Federation, and the Norrbotten County Council.

 April 16, 2025  

Obesity Canada has published an updated guideline for managing obesity in children and adolescents.

An earlier guideline for managing obesity in adults, which was published almost 20 years ago, added limited information about children. This is the first time that a guideline has been developed exclusively for children and adolescents.

The new document stresses behavioral and psychological interventions as the cornerstone of care and includes input from children and their families as to their values and preferences.

The guideline was published online on April 14 in CMAJ.

Pediatric obesity is a chronic, stigmatized, progressive disease that can impair the health and well-being of children and their families. In Canada, about 1 in 4 children aged 11 years or younger and 1 in 3 adolescents aged 12-17 years have an elevated body mass index (BMI), suggesting overweight or obesity. Worldwide, the prevalence of pediatric obesity has tripled over the past 30 years.

The new guideline contains 10 recommendations. Of these, five focus on behavioral and psychological interventions, three on pharmacological interventions, and two on surgical interventions.

“The earlier guideline was a combination of adult and pediatric guidelines, and, to be honest, the pediatric was sort of an add-on, so when it came time to do the second guideline, it was decided to do the pediatric version separately,” co-author Geoff Ball, PhD, RD, professor and associate chair (research) in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, told Medscape Medical News.

Involving parents in drafting the guidelines was also a first. “This time around, we had parents involved right from the beginning: From establishing the research questions to evaluating the evidence to helping with the research review of what we did to drafting the guidelines,” said Ball. “We had caregivers involved right from the beginning, and so we recruited a group of parents and a group of healthcare provider staff [to talk] about what outcomes mattered to them.”

Somewhat surprisingly, Ball noted, health-related quality-of-life issues and anxiety and other mental health problems topped the list of what mattered to patients and their families.

“You might think it's all about waist circumference or body fat or weight, but when we ask families and healthcare providers about what outcomes matter to them, we hear things like health-related quality of life, anxiety, depression, adverse events; those were the highest priorities for them; it wasn't the weight and blood pressure and lipids. So, that is what we really keyed in on when writing the guideline because that's what people told us was important to them.”

Sanjeev Sockalingam, MD, scientific director of Obesity Canada, agreed that the behavioral component in the new guidelines is important. “Historically, people have focused on weight loss as a primary goal and BMI. We really wanted to shift that focus for children and youth to help them to think holistically about health outcomes that include quality of life and mental health, which they show is very important to them,” he said. Sockalingam did not help draft the guideline.

Another first for the guidelines is their suggestion that when all else fails, pharmacological interventions may be considered in older children.

“Medications may be a viable option for ages 12 and above. Not alone, in combination with behavioral interventions. But it's an option that we shouldn't wait for unnecessarily because many of these children are going to grow up to be adults living with obesity. If we can intervene, we can have a tremendous impact if we use all the tools that we have available,” said Sockalingam.

“Unfortunately, Canada is a bit delayed in recognizing obesity as a chronic disease, despite the 74 scientific societies who did so in The Lancet Commission,” guideline co-author Julie St-Pierre, MD, PhD, associate professor of pediatrics and director of the Bariatric Fellowship Program at McGill University in Montreal, told Medscape Medical News.

Only Alberta, of all the provinces, has recognized obesity as a chronic disease, said St-Pierre. “We need to catch up. No matter where you are right now in Canada, to apply these guidelines, we need financial support because most of our multidisciplinary clinics work with grants and out of our own pockets. It's not supported by the government now. So, if we want to deal with the most prevalent pediatric disease in Canada, the number one disease in kids below age 18 years, we must have support. The science is clear.”

This guideline was supported financially by Obesity Canada and an Alberta Health Services Chair in Obesity Research awarded to Ball. Ball reported having financial relationships with the Alberta Health Services Chair in Obesity Research, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Women and Children's Health Research Institute, Novo Nordisk Canada, and Obesity Canada. St-Pierre reported having financial relationships with Eli Lilly and Company and Novo Nordisk Canada. Sockalingam reported having no relevant financial relationships.

We look forward to hearing from you.

An 18-year-old man with no significant medical history presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain that awakened him from sleep at 4 AM. The pain has been constant since onset, is located in the midsubsternal region, and radiates to his neck. The patient describes it as a sharp pain; when asked to rate the pain on a scale of increasing severity from 1 to 10, he states that it is an 8. The pain worsens with inspiration and is associated with shortness of breath.

The patient denies having any fevers, chills, cough, hemoptysis, nausea, or vomiting. He has not had any recent trauma or surgeries. The patient has an 8–pack-year history of smoking cigarettes. He describes occasional marijuana use and remote experimentation with inhaled methamphetamines. He states that he does not use alcohol. He is not currently taking any medications and does not have any known medication allergies.

Upon physical examination, the patient is noted to be a well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress. He does not appear to be tachypneic or cyanotic. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure 94/58 mm Hg, heart rate 67 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.

No jugular venous distention is noted, and the patient has a normal respiratory effort. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, without any wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac examination reveals a regular rate and rhythm, with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended. His extremities do not exhibit any clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Small amounts of subcutaneous crepitus is appreciated over the anterior neck and upper chest on skin examination.

Initial laboratory findings show the following:

Basic metabolic panel findings are normal. Urine toxicology screen results are negative. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 5 mm/h (reference range, < 15 mm/h). An ECG is obtained (not shown here), which reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 65 beats/min and no ST-segment changes or T-wave abnormalities.

Plain chest radiographs are obtained (Figures 1 and 2).

Figure 1.

Figure 2.

The chest radiograph showed linear and curvilinear radiolucencies in the anterior mediastinum and possibly pericardium suggestive of pneumomediastinum and minimal pneumopericardium. CT of the chest was subsequently obtained, which confirmed the presence of pneumomediastinum (Figures 3 and 4) and pneumopericardium, with air tracking superiorly along the right carotid sheath (not included in the images provided).

Figure 3.

Figure 4.

No evidence of pneumothorax, bullous changes, or bronchopleural fistula was found. The remaining portions of the lungs were normal, with no areas of focal consolidation or pleural effusion.

The esophagus and trachea appeared normal. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy was noted. The vascular and bone structures had no abnormalities.

A diagnosis of pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium was established based on the imaging studies, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is defined as the presence of free air in the mediastinum without any apparent precipitating cause. Secondary pneumomediastinum is caused by certain events, such as trauma, infections in the intrathoracic or oropharyngeal spaces, or disruption of the aerodigestive tract. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a rare, usually self-limited disease primarily affecting young men. More than 75% of reported cases occur in males, with a mean age of 20 years.

The prevalence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum has not been clearly established because the only published reports available are case studies or small case series. Newcomb and Clarke[1] reported an incidence of 1 in 29,670 emergency department presentations, whereas the figure observed in a study by Macia and colleagues[2] was 1 in 44,511. Other sources have found the incidence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum to be between 1 in 800 and 1 in 42,000 hospital admissions. The incidence of this condition could be underestimated, given that it frequently goes unrecognized. The clinical presentation of spontaneous pneumomediastinum can often be subtle, and the diagnosis is sometimes missed or delayed.[1-7]

The most commonly proposed cause of pneumomediastinum is alveolar rupture, which occurs in the presence of elevated intra-alveolar pressure or damage to the alveolar walls. An increased pressure gradient between the intra-alveolar and interstitial spaces leads to air leakage from small alveolar openings and ruptured alveoli into the perivascular spaces, which in turn leads to interstitial emphysema. The pressure gradient then favors dissection of air along the vascular sheaths toward the hilum. Air can then decompress into the subcutaneous tissues and the deep cervical spaces, eventually spreading into the pericardial space and leading to pneumopericardium. Dissection of free air into the pericardial space is a common complication of barotrauma in neonates, but it is rare in adults, in whom the apposition of the pericardial layers is very tight.[1-3,7]

Various conditions can cause elevated intra-alveolar pressure, including airway obstruction (eg, mucus plugging in an asthmatic person or the presence of a foreign body), mechanical ventilation, blunt trauma, coughing, emesis, or the Valsalva maneuver (eg, during parturition). Certain conditions that can cause damage to the alveolar walls include pneumonitis, emphysema, lung fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.[1-4] COVID-19 has also been associated with the development of pneumomediastinum.[8,9]

The most commonly proposed cause of pneumomediastinum is alveolar rupture, which occurs in the presence of elevated intra-alveolar pressure or damage to the alveolar walls.

To diagnose spontaneous pneumomediastinum, the clinician must rule out causes of secondary pneumomediastinum. This is particularly vital because alternative causes of pneumomediastinum are potentially life-threatening. Determine whether the patient has had recent dental surgery or procedures of the upper digestive tract and evaluate for underlying conditions that can lead to pneumomediastinum, such as gas-producing infections of the head, neck, or abdomen, or neoplasms disrupting the mucosal integrity of the esophagus. Esophageal rupture must be ruled out by obtaining an esophagram when indicated. Events or conditions known to precipitate pneumomediastinum include vomiting (especially in the context of significant retching), asthma exacerbation, coughing, or physical activity.[1,3,5,7]

Patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum most commonly present with chest pain, dyspnea, and neck pain or discomfort. Chest pain is the most common symptom; it typically presents as an acute, retrosternal, pleuritic pain that may radiate to the neck, back, or shoulders. Other, less common symptoms include odynophagia, dysphagia, dysphonia, cough, back pain, or abdominal pain.

Physical examination may reveal signs of respiratory distress; subcutaneous emphysema; and the Hamman sign, which is pathognomonic for pneumomediastinum. The Hamman sign is crunching, crackling, or bubbling sounds that are synchronous with the heartbeat on auscultation; this signifies air in the mediastinum. The prevalence of the Hamman sign is highly variable; however, subcutaneous emphysema, mainly at the neck, is a more frequent finding that is seen in 40%-100% of cases.[1-5,7]

Pneumomediastinum has also been found to be associated with inhalational drug use. In theory, this is thought to be caused by barotrauma from prolonged forceful breath holding. Cocaine and marijuana users perform a Valsalva-type maneuver during deep inhalation of the respective substance (often through a water pipe in the case of marijuana use), leading to an increase in intra-alveolar pressure and subsequent alveolar rupture. No evidence suggests a direct pharmacologic effect of illicit drugs on spontaneous pneumomediastinum causation.[1-4]

The Hamman sign is crunching, crackling, or bubbling sounds that are synchronous with the heartbeat on auscultation; this signifies air in the mediastinum. The prevalence of the Hamman sign is highly variable; however, subcutaneous emphysema, mainly at the neck, is a more frequent finding that is seen in 40%-100% of cases.

The differential diagnosis of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is broad and includes musculoskeletal disorders, acute coronary syndrome, pericarditis, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, tracheobronchial tree rupture, and Boerhaave syndrome. Tracheobronchial tree rupture and Boerhaave syndrome are potentially life-threatening conditions. Boerhaave syndrome can be ruled out with contrast-enhanced esophagography if it is suspected, whereas suspected tracheobronchial tree rupture can be ruled out with bronchoscopy.[1-3]

The diagnosis of pneumomediastinum is investigated by obtaining posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs. Posteroanterior chest radiographs typically reveal radiolucency between the left heart border and the mediastinal pleura. A lateral view should always be obtained because, if only a posteroanterior radiograph is taken, the diagnosis is missed in as many as 50% of cases.[3] When air is limited in quantity, the only sign of pneumomediastinum on plain chest radiography may be a radiolucent band (hyperlucency) in the retrosternal area, which can only be seen in the lateral view. As many as 30% of patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum present with a normal radiograph; therefore, if the clinical suspicion is high but the diagnosis is unclear, CT of the chest can be obtained.[1-3]

The diagnosis of pneumomediastinum may be made after obtaining posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs. Posteroanterior chest radiographs typically reveal radiolucency between the left heart border and the mediastinal pleura. A lateral view should always be obtained because if only a posteroanterior radiograph is taken, the diagnosis is missed in as many as 50% of cases.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is almost always a benign, self-limited condition. Treatment consists of supportive measures, including rest, oxygen, and analgesics. Breathing 100% oxygen helps to enhance reabsorption of the free air by increasing the gradient of nitrogen between the alveoli and the tissues. Antibiotic therapy is not required for spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Patients usually respond well to supportive treatment, and pain typically resolves within 1-2 days. Follow-up chest radiography should be obtained within 12-24 hours. The chest radiograph findings usually return to normal within 1 week. Significant complications are virtually nonexistent, and most published series have not reported any cases of recurrence.[1-5,7]

The patient in this case was admitted to the hospital for observation, and supportive treatment with supplemental oxygen and analgesics was initiated. Findings from an evaluation by an otolaryngologist were normal. In addition, CT of the neck was obtained and the results were normal. Repeat CT of the chest obtained the day after admission showed no interval progression in the pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium.

The patient's pain and shortness of breath resolved within 24 hours, and he was subsequently discharged to home after a 2-day hospital stay. CT of the chest performed 3 days after discharge showed mild improvement in the pneumomediastinum and resolution of the pneumopericardium (Figures 5 and 6).

Figure 5.

Figure 6.

The condition usually is benign and self-limited. Typical treatment involves hospital admission for observation, supportive treatment with supplemental oxygen, and analgesics. Significant complications are virtually nonexistent.

At the time of discharge, the patient was counselled to refrain from future drug use and smoking and to avoid air travel or prolonged stays at high altitudes for 1 month. Physical activity was not restricted, except for scuba diving, which he was directed not to do for at least 6 months. These suggestions were based on the theoretical risk for recurrence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. The actual rate and risk factors for recurrence are not known; therefore, recommendations on avoidance of potential high-risk activities must be individualized on the basis of patient factors and known information about the recurrence of pneumothorax.

 April 16, 2025  

In 2025 alone, doctors and legislators across the country have already introduced more than 100 pieces of legislation meant to reform prior authorization. The cumbersome approval process is a leading cause of burnout among doctors, and changing it is a top priority of the American Medical Association (AMA). According to a 2024 survey, 93% of physicians say that prior authorization has led to patient harm.

Leaders in the health-tech arena believe prior authorization is ripe for an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven transformation. The problem is that most doctors aren't on board. 

In February, the AMA reported that 61% of physicians believe that using AI in prior authorization will increase denial rates and delay patient care. Moreover, medical associations in at least five states have introduced legislation meant to limit AI's use in patient decisions. 

Though innovators promise speed and better access, doctors say that insurers could easily use the technology to make approvals and appeals even more taxing. Medscape Medical News spoke to prior authorization experts, including doctors on the front lines, and they all agree that AI has the potential to change the game — but only if prior auth gets a makeover. If the process isn't reformed to be more transparent and patient-centric, AI will simply make a flawed system work faster.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, the Medscape Physician and Prior Authorization Report 2024 found that:

“The danger of layering AI on top of a broken system is that, while it offers a lot in terms of efficiency, if you introduce more efficiency and speed into that system, you just speed up the rate at which you do bad things,” said Amy Killelea, JD, assistant research professor at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms, Washington, DC. 

It's unclear how widely AI is already used in prior authorization. A new survey of 93 health insurers released at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) conference in March 2025 reported that 92% use, plan to use, or are exploring AI and machine learning. The preliminary results were not explicit about how health insurers are employing AI. 

If they're using the algorithm to collect relevant data from the medical record more quickly, that's a use case no one would have a problem with, Killelea said. But algorithms making decisions about claims and denying care is a problem. Cigna and UnitedHealth already face class action lawsuits after investigations showed they used AI to deny claims without doctor oversight. 

According to Leslie Lenert, MD, a primary care physician who researches computing at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, companies used rule-based AI to compare claims to insurer criteria. These kinds of if/then algorithms are too fragile for the complex reasoning it takes to evaluate claims, Lenert said. The result was thousands of claims denied at a time without a meaningful doctor review. 

Doctors are rallying to slow the use of AI in prior authorization — but contrary to popular belief and some headlines, it's not because they're anti-technology. 

Most doctors are pro-AI. “AI is probably a great way to save time and control cost. We have no problem with AI being involved in the first look” at a claim, said Sarah Lee-Davisson, MD, a general surgeon and an advocate for an Arizona bill regulating AI in prior authorization. She said that the apprehension has more to do with the nebulous prior authorization process. 

Even without AI, prior authorization is already a black box. Physicians often get little or no feedback on why a claim is denied and the approval metrics are constantly changing. A KFF analysis of ACA Marketplace plans in 2023 found that the most common reason listed for denial, at 34%, was “other reason not listed.” 

Brian Callaghan, MD, a neurologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, recently spent months working to get one of his patients rituximab. The claim was initially denied without a clear reason or a clear option to appeal. By contrast, he never has problems getting the drug for his patients at Veterans Affairs, where there's only one payer. 

“With private insurance, you feel like they are trying to deny as many things as possible,” said Callaghan, who is also lead author on a 2024 paper on using AI to refine prior authorization. Some form of cost containment is essential, but it needs to be easy, he said. He said that having a complex process means fewer things are approved — not because of science or clinical appropriateness, but because the process is challenging. 

While payers are heavily regulated in other areas, there are few to no guardrails in place to make sure that prior authorization is based on clinical data and in the patient's best interest. And payers have a clear conflict of interest, said Lenert. 

It's not technology that makes physicians nervous; it's an imbalance of power, Lenert added. “Insurance companies have unlimited access to resources to deny claims and plenty of incentive to do so,” he said. “And providers often don't have access to any additional resources [to push back].” 

Callaghan agrees. Doctors already put in long hours and have designated staff members handling prior authorization. While he's a firm believer that AI could help solve some of these problems if prior authorization continues as it is — complicated, ever-changing, and hard to speak to a peer physician — then AI may very well make the process even harder, he said. 

Still, doctors hope that if prior authorization is made more transparent, AI could relieve a huge burden. The technology could minimize time spent on paperwork for both sides. And if the first look at a claim is automated, approvals could happen faster. 

Start-ups in the space are already building AI-based tools to consolidate disjointed insurance portals, speed up pre-visit insurance verification, determine where prior authorization is needed, and automatically submit electronic requests to appropriate payers. 

In the future, more sophisticated generative AI algorithms probably could tackle denials, Lenert said. “Even if [AI could] turn around claim denials faster and give an explicit reason why, that would be a service.” That would give doctors far more information than they have to go on today. 

But as long as payers “can say no without taking responsibility for the need to act, that isn't fair,” Lenert said. That's true, with or without AI. The industry needs a new standard of denials. “If it isn't fully transparent, it's fully wrong,” he added.

At the state level, more legislation on prior authorization continues to be introduced, the NAIC reported. “It's reached a breaking point,” Killelea said. Prior authorization has transitioned from a healthcare industry debate to a public concern. “We are already seeing states jump into the fray.”

The aim is not to eliminate prior authorization but to set up some guardrails so the system can't be used to delay or deny clinically appropriate care. There's plenty of AI-specific legislation too. California and Colorado have already passed legislation limiting automated decision-making systems in prior authorization. Texas, Arizona, Connecticut, and Indiana have similar bills in the works. 

“We have no problem with AI being involved in the first look [at a claim],” said Lee-Davisson in Arizona, “but if there's going to be a denial of a test or medicine or surgery, we certainly think it warrants a doctor looking at it.” 

Zeke Silva, MD, a private practice interventional radiologist in Houston, is backing a similar bill in Texas. “We accept that prior authorization has some role. We accept that algorithms have some role in patient care,” he said. “But if you're denying care, it should be by someone trained to practice medicine.”

In March, I shared the case of a 31-year-old man with suspected type 2 diabetes who began treatment with semaglutide and followed behavioral recommendations — but his A1c kept getting worse. I decided the next best step in caring for this patient was to test for anti-islet antibodies to confirm my suspicion of adult-onset type 1 diabetes, and I asked readers for their feedback regarding my management plan.

It looks like half of the readers agreed with my decision and chose to evaluate islet autoantibodies. Some individuals left comments suggesting a C-peptide test, which can be a helpful adjunct to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. However, C-peptide levels can be normal or near-normal in cases of early type 1 diabetes — particularly among adults. Instead, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the application of islet autoantibody testing as a first-line test for type 1 diabetes.

The comments also suggested that this patient may have signs of pancreatic cancer, which is an astute observation. A previous review found that about 1% of patients aged 50 years or older who are diagnosed with incident diabetes will develop pancreatic cancer within 3 years. However, most cases of diabetes are not due to cancer and in this case, cancer is lower on the differential diagnosis checklist given the patient's age. Collecting family history and utilizing available clinical screening tools can be useful, important tools to assess pancreatic cancer risk. Personally, I would start with islet autoantibody testing. If the antibody testing comes back negative, then I would begin to more seriously consider the risk for pancreatic cancer.

Speaking of which, what should we do with the results of the islet autoantibody tests? If even one of the four autoantibody tests is positive, ADA guidance indicates that this patient should be considered to have type 1 diabetes. Additionally, a greater number of positive autoantibodies is associated with faster destruction of insulin-producing beta cells.

In the setting of a positive autoantibody test, I would recheck the test in approximately 3-4 weeks to help rule out the possibility of a false-positive. I would also recommend that the patient receive a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at that time. An OGTT can provide a more complete picture of his islet cell reserve and help predict the course of type 1 diabetes in the future. Finally, I would refer the patient to an endocrinologist, start the process to initiate continuous glucose monitoring, and discontinue semaglutide in favor of insulin treatment.

If the patient's test is negative for all four autoantibodies, his risk for type 1 diabetes substantially declines. Still, up to 10% of cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes have an initial negative autoantibody test. The next screening option could be a C-peptide test, but it may not cinch the diagnosis. Similarly, you could conduct genetic testing, but genetic tests are not always widely available and they don't guarantee a diagnosis.

In my practice, this scenario would also prompt a referral to an endocrinologist. In fact, I would classify the referral as “urgent” to minimize the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis and keep the patient safe. Although a rapid loss of insulin production is unlikely in this scenario, it is possible.

Finally, we must consider the cost and practicality of this workup (as one commenter aptly pointed out). The cost of a panel islet autoantibody workup varies but can range from $230 to $315. Personally, I have not encountered much difficulty getting these tests covered when I apply the correct diagnostic codes. However, clinicians can also utilize national programs, such as the ASK Research Program and TrialNet, to help children and adults receive free screenings for type 1 diabetes.

For patients with hyperglycemia who do not fit the normal pattern of type 2 diabetes, the cost of a missed type 1 diabetes diagnosis can be incredibly high — including hospitalization and even death. My hope, dear reader, is that you found this exchange helpful in our collective effort to reduce the health impact of diabetes.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Slower tapering of adalimumab reduced the recurrence risk for noninfectious uveitis by 60% in pediatric patients compared with faster tapering, and starting the tapering after at least 2 years of disease inactivity notably reduced the recurrence risk for juvenile idiopathic arthritis–associated uveitis.

“Slow tapering translates into a longer relapse-free time, both during therapy reduction and after discontinuation complete drug,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Achille Marino, MD, PhD, Unit of Pediatric Rheumatology, ASST G. Pini-CTO, Milan, Italy. It was published online on April 2, 2025, in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

According to the authors, the multicenter nature of the study implies potential differences in noninfectious uveitis management among participating centers. The involvement of only tertiary centers may have introduced selection bias, potentially limiting representation to more severe cases. Additionally, the frequency of ophthalmologic follow-ups could be influenced by the tapering modality, potentially affecting the timing of recurrence detection.

No specific funding was received for this study. Some authors disclosed receiving honoraria, consultancy fees, speaker fees, travel expenses, and other ties with various pharmaceutical companies.

Patients undergoing kidney transplantation in regions with the highest heat indexes show increased rates of kidney function decline and major adverse kidney events (MAKEs) compared with recipients of transplants performed in cooler environments, according to a study of 250 kidney transplant centers in the United States.

“In US kidney transplant recipients, higher heat exposure was independently associated with a modest progressive kidney transplant function decline and increased MAKE risk compared to lower heat exposure,” reported first author Gabriel Cojuc-Konigsberg, MD, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) 2025 Spring Clinical Meetings.

﻿﻿“Preventing heat exposure in kidney transplant recipients should receive higher priority in research, public health efforts, and clinical practice to prevent adverse kidney transplant outcomes,” he said.

Ambient heat exposure has been associated with worsening kidney outcomes in a variety of contexts, including potentially aggravating existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), causing acute kidney injury, and increasing the risk for kidney stone episodes, Cojuc-Konigsberg noted.

Additional research has shown that agricultural workers in tropical and subtropical regions are disproportionately affected by CKD, and these concerns have intensified under the threat of climate change.

“While the exact mechanisms of this association remain unknown, rising global temperatures pose significant threats to kidney health,” Cojuc-Konigsberg said.

To further investigate the role of heat exposure among kidney transplant recipients, Cojuc-Konigsberg and colleagues retrospectively reviewed 63,351 kidney transplant recipients identified in the UNOS-STAR cohort, who were transplanted between 2010 and 2023 and had at least two serum creatinine measurements within a year of transplant.

The patients had a mean age of about 53 years and approximately 39% were women. Most patients, about 53%, were treated with tacrolimus.

The 250 kidney transplant centers in the study were categorized as hot, with at least 12 months in which there was heat index of at least 30 °C in their location during the study period, or cold, with fewer than 12 months with a heat index of at least 30 °C. The heat index in the study was calculated based on perceived heat, including factors such as humidity and ambient dry temperature.

Overall, 58 of the centers (23%), where 14,901 (23%) of transplant recipients were treated, were classified as hot.

With a median follow-up of 4.9 years and four serum creatinine measurements, and after a multivariate adjustment, each additional year with an average heat index of at least 30 °C was associated with an average annual decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of −0.62%.

In addition, kidney transplant recipients who were transplanted in hot settings had a 30% increase in the risk for MAKE, a composite of death from any cause, graft failure, or doubling of serum creatinine, compared with kidney transplant recipients in cold centers (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.30; P < .001).

“In our primary analysis, we observed that increased heat exposure was associated with the progressive and faster eGFR decline,” Cojuc-Konigsberg said.

No differences were observed based on donor type (living or deceased), or the use of tacrolimus at discharge, however, of note, individuals with a lower baseline eGFR had a more rapid eGFR decline associated with heat exposure.

“Overall, we found that among individuals exposed to heat exposure, each additional year with a heat index above 30 °C was associated with a 30% higher risk of major adverse kidney events, defined as death, graph failure, or doubling of serum creatinine,” Cojuc-Konigsberg said.

Commenting on the study, Samira Farouk, MD, associate professor of medicine and medical education at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City, noted that a variety of factors could play a role in the effects of heat exposure on the kidneys.

“First, we know that volume depletion, in which people are dehydrated, is associated with acute kidney injury; and uric acid levels related to heat exposure may be damaging to the kidneys over time,” she told Medscape Medical News.

“Secondary factors could include access to clean water in some hot environments,” she added. Furthermore, hotter climates may predispose patients to certain infections, such as mosquito-borne diseases.

Another consideration, particularly with kidney transplant recipients, is the role of heat exposure in people at immunological risk.

“We know that other environmental exposures, such as the diet, pollutants in the air, and microbes that someone is exposed to can impact how the T cells are activated and behaving, so I think heat exposure could play into this as well,” Farouk said.

“We don't really have a good way of knowing how immunosuppressed someone is, and so it would be interesting to understand if being in a hotter climate has an impact on the immune system,” she said.

Farouk noted that encouraging kidney transplant recipients to stay hydrated is already a significant challenge, but the new findings underscore the importance of doing so.

“It is very important for kidney transplant recipients to drink water and try to maintain their volume status, which can be a challenge for someone having a transplant because if they have been on dialysis for many years, they may have been told to not drink much, and then they have a transplant organ making a lot of urine and are then told to drink more water,” she said.

“So if you add to that to a hot climate, I can imagine that [staying hydrated] becomes even more important, particularly now with this data.”

Cojuc-Konigsberg and Farouk had no disclosures to report.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV is a highly effective tool for preventing HIV transmission in all populations and countries. However, despite being approved and available by prescription, the “PrEP gaps” (individuals meeting clinical eligibility criteria but not initiated on PrEP) are a major obstacle to eliminating HIV in Europe.

At the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) 2025, held in Vienna, Austria, from April 11-15, a session organized by the European AIDS Clinical Society highlighted the current status of PrEP and standards of care in Europe. 

The discussion also addressed missed opportunities and barriers to broader use, such as resource constraints, costs, war, and migration, as well as potential solutions for improving the situation.

The session was led by Teymur Noori, MSc, an expert in HIV and migrant health at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and Milosz Parczewski, MD, PhD, vice president of the Governing Board of the European AIDS Clinical Society and president of the Polish Scientific AIDS Society.

As of 2023, approximately 830,000 people live with HIV in Europe, with approximately 110,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Epidemiological data and transmission routes vary significantly across Europe.

The goal of PrEP is to reduce the incidence of HIV, which remains a significant public health challenge. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set ambitious targets to reduce new infections in Europe by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030, compared with 2010. However, progress is lagging in 2023, with diagnoses increasing by 9% across Europe and only a 34% reduction in European Union (EU) member states. Similarly, PrEP uptake remains far below targets, with 285,000 individuals on PrEP across Europe by the end of 2023 (against a target of 500,000) and 130,000 in EU countries (against a target of 300,000).

What can be done to address this issue? Expanding PrEP implementation is critical; however, there is significant variability between countries in applying international guidelines and the level of public funding for this medication. The key barriers identified include, in order of importance, difficulty in accessing certain population groups, lack of PrEP availability in all regions or parts of a country, stigma associated with PrEP use, long waiting lists in countries with national programs, service costs, drug costs, and limited technical capacity among healthcare providers to prescribe PrEP.

The countries with the best PrEP implementation data are, in order, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain. However, disaggregated data reveal that men who have sex with men are the primary population reached in all these countries, with significant gaps among women and migrants. This highlights a major equity issue in PrEP access, particularly for women, migrants, transgender individuals, sex workers, and IDUs.

PrEP remains underutilized as a prevention tool across Europe, and scaling up its use is essential to reduce transmission rates. Combining PrEP implementation with HIV screening and rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy is necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

One of the most debated clinical topics is the mode of PrEP administration (continuous or event-driven) and its applicability to cisgender women, for whom the clinical effectiveness of event-driven PrEP has not been demonstrated.

In populations where efficacy has been established, both event-driven and continuous regimens have shown similar effectiveness. However, major gaps persist, mainly due to the low perceived risk for HIV among at-risk individuals and fear of stigma and discrimination. Many also lack knowledge about PrEP among those who need it, and there is a lack of awareness among healthcare providers. Additionally, the high cost of drugs for informal (nonregular) prophylaxis is another significant barrier to accessing PrEP.

Costs are particularly limited for long-acting antiretroviral agents, such as cabotegravir and lenacapavir, which could help overcome barriers to adherence. France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are considering reimbursements.

Individual online purchases are possible, but the cost of 30 tablets is around €50-€70 (approximately $54-$75) for traditional PrEP. For long-acting drugs, only the American market price for cabotegravir is available (up to $24,000), whereas lenacapavir pricing remains unknown.

Concerns regarding safety and adherence persist. The PARTNER study concluded that the combination of tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine causes fewer adverse effects on bone and kidney function. However, the efficacy of this combination is highly dependent on patient adherence.

The best opportunity to achieve the WHO goals is by increasing equity in access through various management options, including primary care, with the possibility of remote visits. This should include integrated management with screening and treatment for other sexually transmitted infections, as well as immunizations for hepatitis A and B, human papillomavirus, and monkeypox.

 April 16, 2025  

An American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) multidisciplinary panel has reached the conclusion that no recommendation can be made for or against the use of computer-aided detection (CADe)–assisted colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States.

The systematic data review is a collaboration between the AGA and The BMJ's MAGIC Rapid Recommendations. The BMJ issued a separate recommendation against CADe shortly after the AGA guideline was published. 

Led by Shahnaz S. Sultan, MD, MHSc, of the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and recently published in Gastroenterology, found only very low certainty of GRADE-based evidence for several critical long-term outcomes, both desirable and undesirable. These included the following: 11 fewer CRCs per 10,000 individuals and two fewer CRC deaths per 10,000 individuals, an increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications.

This technology did, however, yield an 8% (95% CI, 6-10) absolute increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) and a 2% (95% CI, 0-4) increase in the detection rate of advanced adenomas and/or sessile serrated lesions. “How this translates into a reduction in CRC incidence or death is where we were uncertain,” Sultan said. “Our best effort at trying to translate the ADR and other endoscopy outcomes to CRC incidence and CRC death relied on the modeling study, which included a lot of assumptions, which also contributed to our overall lower certainty.”

The systematic and meta-analysis included 41 randomized controlled trials with more than 32,108 participants who underwent CADe-assisted colonoscopy. This technology was associated with a higher polyp detection rate than standard colonoscopy: 56.1% vs 47.9% (relative risk [RR], 1.22, 95% CI, 1.15-1.28). It also had a higher ADR: 44.8% vs 37.4% (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.16-1.29).

But although CADe-assisted colonoscopy may increase ADR, it carries a risk for overdiagnosis, as most polyps detected during colonoscopy are diminutive (< 5 mm) and of low malignant potential, the panel noted. Approximately 25% of lesions are missed at colonoscopy. More than 15 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States, but studies have demonstrated variable quality of colonoscopies across key quality indicators.

“Artificial intelligence [AI] is revolutionizing medicine and healthcare in the field of GI [gastroenterology], and CADe in colonoscopy has been brought to commercialization,” Sultan told Medscape Medical News. “Unlike many areas of endoscopic research where we often have a finite number of clinical trial data, CADe-assisted colonoscopy intervention has been studied in over 44 randomized controlled trials and numerous nonrandomized, real-world studies. The question of whether or not to adopt this intervention at a health system or practice level is an important question that was prioritized to be addressed as guidance was needed.”

Commenting on the guideline but not involved in its formulation, Larry S. Kim, MD, MBA, a gastroenterologist in Denver, said his practice group has used the GI Genius AI system in its affiliated hospitals but has so far chosen not to implement the technology at its endoscopy centers. “At the hospital, our physicians have the ability to utilize the system for select patients or not at all,” he told Medscape Medical News.

The fact that The BMJ reached a different conclusion based on the same data, evidence-grading system, and microsimulation, Kim added, “highlights the point that when evidence for benefit is uncertain, underlying values are critical.” In declining to make a recommendation, the AGA panel balanced the benefit of improved detection of potentially precancerous adenomas vs increased resource utilization in the face of unclear benefit. “With different priorities, other bodies could reasonably decide to recommend either for or against CADe.”

According to Sultan, gastroenterologists need a better understanding of patient values and preferences and the value placed on increased adenoma detection, which may also lead to more lifetime colonoscopies without reducing the risk for CRC. “We need better intermediate- and long-term data on the impact of adenoma detection on interval cancers and CRC incidence,” she said. “We need data on detection of polyps that are more clinically significant such as those 6-10 mm in size, as well as serrated sessile lesions. We also need to understand at the population or health system level what the impact is on resources, cost, and access.”

Ultimately, the living guideline underscores the trade-off between desirable and undesirable effects and the limitations of current evidence to support a recommendation, but CADe has to improve as an iterative AI application with further validation and better training.

With the anticipated improvement in software accuracy as AI machine learning reads increasing numbers of images, Sultan added, “the next version of the software may perform better, especially for polyps that are more clinically significant or for flat sessile serrated polyps, which are harder to detect. We plan to revisit the question in the next year or two and potentially revise the guideline.”

These guidelines were fully funded by the AGA Institute with no funding from any outside agency or industry.

With 200 patients treated, the Hospital Clínico San Carlos in Madrid, Spain, has launched Europe's first Oncohaematological Immunoprevention Unit aimed at the early detection of immunodeficiencies in patients with cancer.

Detecting immunodeficiencies in patients with haematological cancers is the primary objective of the unit, Silvia Sánchez-Ramón, head of the Immunology Department, explained to El Médico Interactivo, a Medscape Network platform. Along with Celina Benavente, head of the Haematology Department, Sánchez-Ramón emphasised the critical role of immune system dysfunction in cancer. Between 25% and 50% of cancer-related deaths are linked to infections, and at least 80% of patients with cancer will experience at least one severe infection during their treatment.

Given this situation, early detection of immunodeficiencies and prompt treatment with immunoglobulins can reduce hospitalisation time, lower intensive care unit admissions, and significantly improve patients' quality of life.

The new unit employs an AI-powered algorithm with 92% accuracy to achieve early diagnosis in patients at risk for infections. This tool allows for personalised medicine to prevent infections and reduce the recurrence or progression of cancer, leading to better overall outcomes.

As Sánchez-Ramón pointed out, “We are now adopting a proactive strategy that involves five departments: Haematology, Immunology, Preventive Medicine, Pharmacology, and Hospital Pharmacy, along with Nursing. We have developed a specific AI algorithm for primary immunodeficiency, enabling us to detect it early and implement treatment with immunoglobulins.” She also noted that the AI system's sensitivity exceeds that of physicians, further enhancing the system's efficiency.

The algorithm analyses 37 high-quality clinical and immunologic variables using machine learning, ultimately narrowing down to two final variables. On the basis of accumulated experience, the algorithm has achieved over 91.8% accuracy in a study involving 151 patients. Of these, 66% with oncohaematological tumours (lymphoma, leukaemia, or myeloma) and recurrent or severe infections displayed a genetic variant of primary immunodeficiency. “Detecting these variants at the time of cancer diagnosis allows us to prevent infections caused by immunodeficiency,” said Sánchez-Ramón.

In light of these findings, she remarked, “We are changing the approach to immunodeficiency associated with haematological cancers, making treatment more personalized and precise.” Efforts are also underway to explore the application of this approach to other types of cancer.

Benavente emphasised the importance of teamwork and the immune system's role in preventing, developing, and prognosing neoplasms. “Multidisciplinary collaboration is key in this context, as it ensures comprehensive and coordinated patient care.”

The process followed in the Oncohaematological Immunoprevention Unit is as follows: Once diagnosed with lymphoma, leukaemia, or myeloma, patients receive comprehensive prevention, including personalised vaccination, specific treatment for their immunodeficiency, immunoglobulin prophylaxis, and health education on preventive measures provided by nursing staff.

Specialists also noted that patients with the genetic variant of primary immunodeficiency are eligible for treatment with medications specifically targeting their immunologic alteration and the genetic origin of their cancer.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. My name is Dr Sarah Barenbaum. Today, I'm going to be talking about medication-induced weight gain.

Medications, both prescription and over the counter, commonly cause weight gain, and they can also make it really hard for people to lose weight. Anytime you see a patient, it's important to do a thorough medication reconciliation, and don't forget to ask them about over-the-counter medications.

Some common classes of medications that cause weight gain include certain diabetes medications such as insulin or sulfonylureas, certain antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, antiepileptics, mood stabilizers, antihistamines, hormonal contraceptives, glucocorticoids, and beta-blockers. 

Within all of these classes of medications, there are options that are weight losing or weight neutral, meaning they can help with weight loss or not have any impact on weight. Even though it might be an appropriate choice for weight, it doesn't mean it will be the right medication for the other condition. 

How do you approach medication-induced weight gain? It's important to choose weight-losing and weight-neutral medications when possible. Use a shared decision-making model with the patient.

If you must start a medication that can cause weight gain, the patient needs to know they're about to start a medication that could have an impact on their weight so that they can decide with you this is the right thing for them. 

Never, ever discontinue a medication prescribed by another provider without discussing it with that other provider. Patients should not stop their own medications because of weight gain, because this could be unsafe.

If a weight-promoting medication must be used, try to use the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time to mitigate any weight gain.

Vision is one of the most complex functions of our brain and requires a seamless interaction between many different brain structures to decode shapes, colours, depths, and movements and turn them into a meaningful whole. Just like other brain functions, vision also depends on a balanced and controlled interaction between the chemical signals that ""activate"" and ""brake"" activity in the eye's cells – much like the accelerator and brake of a car. In research, the ""brake"" is known as GABA, which stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid, and it is the primary neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity and helps regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain.

Neuroscientific researchers have long been particularly interested in understanding how networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons work together. It has been a fundamental challenge to uncover how these complex interactions in neural circuits create the precise and targeted actions that underlie both vision and other cognitive processes.

Together with colleagues from the USA, researchers from DANDRITE have, for the first time, conducted a comprehensive functional mapping of how the ""brake"" – inhibitory signaling – works in the part of the eye that processes and sends electrical signals to the brain, called the retina. It is in the retina that the first visual information is processed and then transmitted to the brain.

In total, the researchers mapped 44 different visual cells – some of which had never been described before. What was even more interesting was that these cells were characterized by a higher degree of systematic organization than previously known.

""Our result can be compared to finding a complicated map of an unknown landscape. Previously, we thought the landscape was randomly divided, but now we have mapped it, so we can see that each region has its own precise path and function,"" explains Professor Keisuke Yonehara, elaborating:

""By understanding how the different cells in the retina are organized and work in specific directions, we have revealed how the brain can precisely 'see' movement and orientation in our visual field – as if they have found the most efficient route through a complex network.""

The key to this discovery was the development of a new GABA sensor, created by researchers in the USA, which allows for real-time observation and mapping of the precise activity of inhibitory neurons.

The research group's results have just been published in the prestigious journal Nature Neuroscience, and according to Keisuke Yonehara, this could be a breakthrough in understanding where and how certain eye disorders develop and occur.

Many eye disorders are linked to imbalances in inhibitory signalling, including congenital nystagmus, where the eyes move involuntarily, quickly, and rhythmically. Now we have a 'map' that can give us deeper insights into this condition and hopefully also others related to this area.""

Could a planet-friendly diet also shield your brain? New study links EAT-Lancet eating patterns to lower dementia risk, but only if your genes play along.

Study: Associations between the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet and incident dementia. Image Credit: marilyn barbone / Shutterstock

In a recent study in The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease, researchers used a large (n = 25,898, age = 45–73 yrs) Swedish cohort to elucidate any relationships between the EAT-Lancet diet and dementia incidence. The impacts of covariates, including APOE ε4 status, were also estimated. Study findings revealed that the EAT-Lancet diet does not exacerbate dementia risk, instead potentially reducing incident dementia in non-carriers of the APOE ε4 gene.

Participants excluding red meat entirely scored lower on some metrics, challenging assumptions about “all-or-nothing” approaches to planetary health diets.

Advances in medical research and clinical interventions are allowing humans to live longer than ever before. While the benefits of these advances cannot be understated, they have resulted in more of the global population surviving beyond reproductive age, increasing the incidence of non-communicable age-associated diseases such as cancers and dementia.

To combat the burden of these diseases, several past and ongoing scientific studies aim to unravel the risk factors associated with these diseases, thereby equipping public health agencies with the knowledge required to curb their incidence. Using these research findings, the Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention has identified several (n = 14) modifiable factors that can exacerbate dementia risk, including physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity.

While diet has not been explicitly listed, previous research has confirmed its association with neurodegenerative outcomes. Some 'healthy' diets, such as the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), have been found to reduce dementia risk, while unhealthy diets like the Western diet (WD) exacerbate it. Surprisingly, the dementia risk associations of the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet (2019) remain untested. The diet is primarily plant-based, leading some experts to believe that it may reduce mortality risk, while others argue that it may negatively impact brain health via nutrient deficiencies.

The study tracked participants for an average of 18 years, offering insight into how midlife eating habits might shape brain health much later on.

The present study aims to validate the neurodegenerative safety of the environmentally sustainable EAT-Lancet planetary health diet by investigating its risk associations with dementia incidence. Study data were obtained from Swedish Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) participants, a long-term, extensive (n = 68,905) cohort investigation of Swedish individuals initiated between 1991 and 1996.

The present analyses included individuals aged 45–73 with complete dementia and dietary data. The collected study data included dietary assessment, dementia evaluation, genetic risk determination, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation evaluations, and sociodemographic information.

The comprehensive dietary assessment comprised participants' dietary history, recorded using validated 7-day food diaries, participant-completed food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) comprising 168 items, and seven EAT-Lancet adherence scores. The scores were obtained from previous publications and were categorized into ‘proportional scores' (n = 4), ‘binary scores' (n = 2), and ‘ordinal scale scores' (n = 1). Scores were subjected to statistical transformations to enable comparisons between differing methodologies.

The Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) provided dementia and dementia subtype (all-cause, vascular dementia [VaD], and Alzheimer's Disease [AD]) diagnoses. Dementia was classified using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10).

Genetic predisposition to dementia risk was evaluated using participants' apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles as proxies, with APOE ε4 status (carrier/non-carrier) serving as a binary analysis variable. Participants' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ42 measured via INNOTEST ELISA were used for Aβ analyses. Sociodemographic information, particularly body mass index (BMI), physical activity levels (17 activities), alcohol consumption, education level, and smoking status, was used for potential confounder analyses.

A planetary health plate should consist, by volume, of approximately half a plate of vegetables and fruits; the other half, displayed by contribution to calories, should consist primarily of whole grains, plant protein sources, unsaturated plant oils, and (optionally) modest amounts of animal sources of protein. For further details, please refer to section 1 of the Commission. Image Credit: EAT

There was no link between following the EAT-Lancet diet and amyloid-β pathology, a hallmark of Alzheimer's, which points to other possible ways diet could protect the brain.

Of the 68,905 MDCS participants, 30,446 met the present study criteria, and 25,898 provided completed dementia and dietary information. Of these, 6.9% (All-cause = 1,783, VaD = 426, AD = 1,040) were reported to develop dementia by 2014 (follow-up time = 18 years), and 11.5% (n = 2,976) by 2020.

Diet-dementia association analyses revealed that five of the seven evaluated scores suggested that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence lowered the risk of developing (all-cause) dementia. However, after adjusting for education as a potential confounder, three scores remained statistically significant, and after full adjustment for all confounders (including age, sex, season, education, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, BMI, and energy intake), only one score (the Kesse-Guyot score) continued to show a significant association with reduced all-cause dementia risk.

When evaluating AD risk, one score suggested that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence was positively associated with reduced AD risk. Again, this significant association remained only for the Kesse-Guyot score after full adjustment for all confounders.

None of the models (with or without covariate corrections) suggest that EAT-Lancet dietary adherence increases dementia risk, validating its safety.

It is important to note that while the direction of effect was similar across most scores, the strength and statistical significance of the associations varied depending on the scoring methodology used to measure adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet. This highlights the importance of how dietary adherence is evaluated in such research.

When correcting for participants' APOE ε4 status, logistic regression analyses revealed an interplay between diet and genetic predisposition to dementia, particularly for non-carriers. Carrier participants did not reveal any changes in their risk, but non-carriers were observed to significantly reduce their all-cause (three scores) and AD (five scores) risk following EAT-Lancet dietary adherence. VaD risks demonstrated no such associations with genetic status.

No associations were found between EAT-Lancet dietary adherence and amyloid-β (Aβ42) pathology, as measured in the subsample with available CSF data.

The authors also performed a range of sensitivity analyses, such as excluding participants with diabetes or those who developed dementia within five years of baseline, and found similar patterns in results, supporting the robustness of their main findings.

Excluding people with diabetes or those who developed dementia soon after joining the study did not change the main findings, adding confidence to the conclusions.

The present study highlights the neurodegenerative safety of the EAT-Lancet diet, demonstrating that it does not increase dementia risk across all evaluation metrics. Instead, the diet may significantly reduce dementia (all-cause and AD) risk, particularly in APOE ε4 non-carriers.

However, since this was an observational study, the findings cannot prove causality, and limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, potential misreporting of dietary intake, and changes in diet over the long follow-up period.

""While intervention studies are needed to further clarify the impact of the EAT-Lancet diet on dementia incidence, results from this study indicate that environmental sustainability can be implemented into dietary guidelines in dementia prevention strategies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New study examines how obesity alters brain's reward circuits","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250415/New-study-examines-how-obesity-alters-brains-reward-circuits.aspx","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 02:53:00 GMT","

Obesity is on the rise. Among U.S. adults aged 20 or older, 4 in 10 met the criteria for obesity in the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, up from roughly 3 in 10 two decades earlier.

People with obesity have a significantly greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Despite recent health advances, estimates suggest diet contributes to more than 300,000 deaths annually in the United States.

Decision-making surrounding food drives these health conditions. And decisions about what foods to eat is a leading, modifiable driver of disease burden.""

Alexandra DiFeliceantonio, assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC and interim co-director of its Center for Health Behaviors Research

DiFeliceantonio is part of a cross-disciplinary team that will explore how obesity affects brain circuits involved in reward, motivation, and emotions with support from a four-year, $2.75 million grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.

The goal is to bridge the translational gap between animal and human studies. It also will provide a foundation for testing the relationship between the brain's food-reward mechanisms and markers of metabolic health and disease.

The other lead investigators are Matt Howe, assistant professor of neuroscience with Virginia Tech's College of Science, and Professor Read Montague, director of the Center for Human Neuroscience Research at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.

While animal studies in bees, rodents, and non-human primates have shown the role certain brain chemicals play in food and reward, scientists only recently have been able to track these chemicals in real time in people.

""Until the advances made by Dr. Montague, we had no way of measuring these signals at sub-second timescales for food reward tasks,"" DiFeliceantonio said. ""It's important because there are findings that are foundational in neuroscience that might be different in human beings.""

The Virginia Tech study will use groundbreaking electrochemistry techniques developed by Montague, a computational neuroscientist, and his team. The research, which involves neurochemical measurements taken using surgically implanted leads to monitor seizures in epilepsy patients, is being conducted in collaboration with Robert Bina, a neurosurgeon with the University of Arizona's Banner Health.

Scientists will measure brain chemical activity important for motivation and reward in people while they are drinking sugary drinks through a custom pump system and completing tasks related to emotion and food words to better understand how metabolic markers of health and disease influence decision-making.

""It's important to measure different types of rewards to understand if these brain chemicals encode something as basic as a sweet taste the same way as something complex like language,"" said Matt Howe, assistant professor of neuroscience in the College of Science.

""All the drugs used to treat overweight and obesity target these reward areas in the brain,"" DiFeliceantonio said. ""Most of the evidence that we have is that even after weight loss, the brain doesn't just return to where it was before the weight gain."" It's important to understand what's taking place as a foundation for next-generation interventions, she said. 

DiFeliceantonio also holds an appointment in the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Montague also holds an appointment in the College of Science's Department of Physics.

Men experiencing intimate partner violence turn to harmful coping strategies due to limited services and persistent social stigma, according to a new Simon Fraser University study. 

Using survey data from the Statistics Canada General Social Survey on victimization as well as interviews with 16 male survivors, the study found men were significantly less likely to seek outside help compared to women. 

""When intimate partner violence happens to men, it often feels like they're left to cope alone,"" says Alexandra Lysova, SFU criminology professor and co-author of a new study published in the Journal of Family Violence. ""Many deny the abuse, withdraw from social activities and relationships and throw themselves into work to avoid what's happening at home."" 

These avoidant strategies can prevent men from seeking support such as therapy or separation, she says. As a result, male survivors may experience worsening depression, substance misuse, and emotional distress, which can escalate the risks in the relationship.

This is especially concerning, says Lysova, because while violence is mainly bi-directional, women tend to experience the most severe consequences - 79 per cent of intimate partner homicide victims are women, for example. 

This research highlights a critical gap in support services and the importance of addressing intimate partner violence as a human issue - not just a gendered one, Lysova argues. 

There is a lack of gender-inclusive public awareness campaigns, training and protocols for front-line professionals-such as police, social workers and doctors-who are often the first point of contact for someone seeking help. Even when governments issue reports or expand services, they typically highlight female victims, leaving male survivors invisible."" 

Alexandra Lysova, SFU criminology professor 

Helping male survivors will help society more broadly, in part by reducing risk factors for future violence perpetrated by those who witnessed intimate partner abuse as children, Lysova adds. 

""When we help men, we also help women and children -- and ultimately, society,"" Lysova explains. ""Abuse is abuse. We need to stop treating violence against women and violence against men as separate issues. Addressing violence in all its forms - regardless of the victim's gender - helps create safer communities for everyone.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New discoveries explain how DNA repair signals are controlled","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/New-discoveries-explain-how-DNA-repair-signals-are-controlled.aspx","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 05:48:00 GMT","

Researchers from the University of Birmingham have uncovered answers that provide the detail to explain two specific DNA repair processes that have long been in question.

The publication of two papers demonstrates how work led by laboratories from the Department of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, and School of Biosciences at the University of Birmingham has made strides in understanding how the repair process is correctly orchestrated.

Our cells protect their DNA by constantly monitoring and repairing any damage. When DNA is damaged, internal signals activate within the cell to pinpoint the damage and recruit specialised proteins-DNA repair ""machines""-to fix the break. This repair process must be tightly regulated to ensure the correct proteins arrive in the right amounts and in the correct sequence.

Many chemotherapy treatments for cancers work by damaging DNA to stop replication and subsequent uncontrolled growth of tumours. Improvements in the understanding of complex DNA repair processes, such as knowing which proteins are enlisted and their specific roles and functions, have the potential to lead to refinements in future cancer treatments making them more effective at halting tumour growth.

These discoveries help us understand how our cells work to repair damaged DNA correctly. As many chemotherapies work by damaging DNA, the discoveries provide information about new ways that anti-cancer therapies could be enhanced and new ones developed.""

Jo Morris, Professor of Molecular Genetics, Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham

The first study, published in Nature Communications today (Monday 14 April), identifies a ""twisting switch"" that helps turn off early repair signals by altering the shape of proteins. Without the switch, repair signals stay active too long, disrupting the correct sequencing of the repair machine arrival at and exit from the broken site so that DNA repair is blocked.

The discovery of the twisting switch resolves a long-standing question about how the DNA repair protein RNF168, which has a tendency to cause uncontrolled signalling, is switched off. The paper outlines a four-step process that removes RNF168 from chromatin, preventing excessive DNA damage signals and demonstrates that without these steps, cells become hypersensitive to radiation.

A second study published in Molecular Cell identified that a component previously assumed to have very little function in cells, SUMO4, has a crucial role to help prevent the DNA damage signal from being overwhelmed.

Without SUMO4, there is an excess of one type of signalling, disrupting other signals and preventing some repair proteins from reaching the damaged site. As a result, DNA repair fails. The significance of this research comes from the way it challenges earlier assumptions about the importance of the SUM04 protein.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New analysis clarified the link between ""exclusive"" use of e-cigarettes and COPD","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250415/New-analysis-clarified-the-link-between-exclusive-use-of-e-cigarettes-and-COPD.aspx","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 02:01:00 GMT","

A Johns Hopkins Medicine-led analysis of medical information gathered on a diverse group of almost 250,000 people over four years has significantly clarified the link between the ""exclusive"" use of e-cigarettes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as high blood pressure in a sub-group of adults 30 to 70 years of age.

The findings, supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and published in the March. 15 edition of Nicotine & Tobacco Research, underscore the potential risks of e-cigarette use, and should provide context to inform advice and regulatory policies about the health risks of so-called vaping products.

The new analysis, they note, further verifies that while the use of either e-cigarettes or traditional ""combustible"" cigarettes is linked to higher risks and rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the effect is substantially stronger for traditional cigarettes.

In the U.S., e-cigarettes have become the second-most prevalent form of tobacco use after cigarettes, and the most common among young adults and adolescents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), e-cigarettes have risen in use among young adults from 3.7% in 2020 to 4.5% in 2021.

In 2021, about 3 in 10 (29.4%) adults who vaped also smoked cigarettes. While e-cigarettes are often marketed as being safe, some studies have indicated that e-cigarette aerosols may contain significant levels of dangerous organic compounds and higher levels of nicotine, which can be addictive and harmful.

Studies over many decades have shown that combustible cigarettes consistently increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. According to the CDC, combustible cigarette users account for 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths in the US.

A previous cross-sectional study - a study in which researchers collect data from many individuals at a single point in time - found increased risk of asthma in people using e-cigarettes, while a longitudinal study - a study in which researchers repeatedly observe the same individuals or groups over a long period of time - indicated a higher risk of new respiratory disease symptoms.

As a result, ""there remains great uncertainty about the relative harm of e-cigarettes as compared to traditional smoking. Until now, there has been scant longitudinal data in large high-quality datasets linking exclusive e-cigarettes use to new-onset cardiometabolic health conditions,"" says Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., senior author of the study and professor of cardiology and epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

For the analysis, researchers used medical information on 249,190 people, including 203,932 who reported never using e-cigarettes or combustible cigarettes (203,932), 3,164 who reported exclusively using e-cigarettes, 33,778 who reported exclusively using combustible cigarettes, and 8,316 who reported using both e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes.

Those who experienced disease were characterized by their e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use patterns. In the follow-up period after almost four years, 23,745 new cases of hypertension were found, along with 13,179 new cases of type 2 diabetes; 7,925 new cases of COPD; 9,801 new cases of heart failure; and 6,139 new cases of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Of those cases, it was found that exclusive e-cigarette use was not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes, heart failure or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but it was significantly associated with COPD. In a sub-analysis of individuals ages 30–70, there was a small increased risk of hypertension.

In contrast, results showed that exclusive use of combustible cigarettes significantly increased the risks for all outcomes, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, COPD, heart failure, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Similar results were shown for dual use of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes although risk estimates were slightly larger than for exclusive combustible cigarette use.

These results are a critical stepping stone for future prospective research on the health effects of e-cigarettes. While in this short-term study there was no association between exclusive e-cigarette use and cardiovascular events, there was an association with incident COPD and possibly hypertension that will need to be closely watched over longer term follow-up.""

Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., senior author of the study and professor of cardiology and epidemiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

Blaha says the new study suggests that e-cigarettes have definite potential health risks, although the risks may be less than what is seen for traditional combustible cigarette smoking alone.

This study received partial support from grants provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the Center for Tobacco Products at the Food and Drug Administration [HL120163].

Nuclera, the biotechnology company accelerating protein expression and optimization through its benchtop eProtein Discovery™ system, today announced the addition of a new membrane protein workflow to its system. This expanded capability enables the expression, purification and stabilization of challenging membrane proteins, which are often key targets in therapeutic development. Using cell-free protein synthesis, digital microfluidics, and optimized additive screening, eProtein Discovery can express and purify functional, correctly folded membrane proteins, in 48 hours.

Membrane proteins play vital roles in regulating cellular processes and many are implicated in the development and progression of disease. 60% of FDA-approved drugs target membrane proteins1 yet the extraction and stabilization of these structurally complex proteins remains challenging due to their intrinsic hydrophobic nature.

Nuclera demonstrated the capabilities of eProtein Discovery to produce membrane proteins by synthesizing MsbA (a membrane transporter) and ZMPSTE24 (an integral membrane protein)2. In 24 hours, eProtein Discovery evaluated different expression and purification conditions, including assessing the effects of using nanodiscs, lipids and detergents, to identify the optimal conditions for producing soluble, stable MsbA and ZMPSTE24. Scale-up production of these membrane proteins was achieved within 48 hours, enabling rapid functional evaluation. MsbA and ZMPSTE24 generated using eProtein Discovery had high-yield, were functionally active, and compatible with cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM).

Existing eProtein Discovery users can access this new membrane protein production capability through a software update.

Membrane protein production has long been a technical challenge, often resulting in misfolded or inactive proteins. eProtein Discovery overcomes these challenges, enabling scientists to rapidly produce functional membrane proteins, accelerating drug discovery and structural biology workflows.”

Dr Toby Ost, SVP of Product Development, Nuclera

Dr Konstantinos Beis, Reader in Membrane Protein Structural Biology, Imperial College London, added: “The eProtein Discovery System is a welcome new toolkit for membrane protein production. We were commissioned via Imperial Consultants to test the protein quality in our lab - and the early results are promising.”

The rise in AI use in medicine
Who is responsible? A long drawn argument
Legal considerations regarding AI use in healthcare
Future considerations to resolve the issue regarding liabilities

Most non-criminal lawsuits are over who will pay for misconduct, and either party seems to believe themselves to be innocent. With the rising use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine, more individuals seem to be asking the same question: if physicians use medical AI systems for diagnosis and treatment and make a mistake that ultimately harms the patient, then who should be held liable?

This article focuses on the legal implications of using AI in medical diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

AI technology, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, has been extensively applied in hospitals and clinics worldwide for varied applications, including stroke detection, diabetic retinopathy screening, and predicting hospital admissions.1

Several surveys have shown that this technology has significantly benefited the healthcare system by facilitating smarter and quicker solutions for both doctors and patients.2

By quickly and efficiently analyzing large datasets, AI tools enable accelerated disease diagnosis and monitor treatment response. For early cancer detection and diagnosis, radiologists use these AI-based algorithms to identify patterns in radiological images imperceptible to the human eye. 3

For example, AI algorithms have been designed to analyze computed tomography (CT) images and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to screen patients for lung and prostate cancer, respectively.4

The DL-based strategy has been used in the early detection of breast cancer through the interpretation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional mammography images.5 Multiple studies have shown that AI has improved the overall accuracy when used as an adjunct tool by radiologists interpreting mammograms.

At present, many commercially available algorithms do not perform efficiently due to the lack of comprehensive data on clinical effectiveness.6

Scientists have used AI to facilitate the automated characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity, which helps predict disease progression and treatment efficacy. The DL algorithm has been used to assess CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan images.

Radiomic evaluation of tumor morphology has led to a more precise monitoring of the treatment response of solid tumors.

AI healthcare tools, such as IBM Watson Health, Google DeepMind Health, Eyenuk, IBEX Medical Analytics, Aidoc, and Butterfly iQ, are among the most popular platforms used by doctors, radiologists, psychologists, and other healthcare officials for disease diagnosis and treatment plan for various diseases.

Who Owns Your Medical Data?

If an AI error leads to an unwanted effect, physicians could shift any liability for faulty AI performance to developers, and the company might point out that medical treatment decisions are ultimately made by doctors.

In the era of continually increasing AI use in the healthcare sector, it is important to understand who should take responsibility, i.e., the AI developer, the healthcare provider, or any other stakeholder, when an AI-based diagnosis or treatment plan harms a patient.

At present, there is no prominent line of responsibility between healthcare providers, AI system developers, and regulators overseeing them regarding faulty judgments that harm patients.

Therefore, comprehensive policies are required to assign responsibility to protect patients. Also, more clarity is required to understand whether any liability lies across the AI supply chain.

Although the application of AI in medical diagnoses and treatment has been immensely beneficial, this technology is also associated with valid legal concerns regarding accountability, privacy, and regulatory compliance.7

For instance, AI tools rely on access to patients' health data, which has triggered the question about data privacy protections and transparency in how the data is used. To protect sensitive health information from disclosure, regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) were established in 1996.8

Opaque AI systems can perpetuate preferences through training data imbalances, which could lead the AI tool to exacerbate existing biases. AI systems can generate unfair or discriminatory treatment recommendations if they are trained with data concerning specific patient demographics, narrowing down the generalizability.

In most AI systems, their inner working remain unexplained as ""black boxes"", which reduces accountability around AI-guided decisions. A greater transparency. AI developers must ensure transparency regarding the device mechanism, limitations, and clinical validation.9

Physicians are free to use AI, but many opt not to, despite understanding the benefits, for fear that errors by AI tools could charge them with practicing medicine below the standard of care.

Most healthcare AI tools are likely to fail under the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations because the existing framework focuses on medical devices rather than adaptive software algorithms.

Therefore, new regulations must be formulated to specifically address AI in medicine. This promotes innovation to improve efficacy and ensure user safety.

Can AI Outperform Doctors in Diagnosing Infectious Diseases?

The regulatory standpoints on AI tools in medicine are different across countries based on factors like risk tolerance and desire to spur innovation. The ongoing international collaboration between governance and healthcare AI will play a crucial role in balancing this hurdle and promoting innovation and public well-being.10

Precise regulations, accountability mechanisms, and technical standards are urgently required to support the use of AI in medicine.

Scientists and policymakers believe that continual examination of data bias, transparency, and privacy will be crucial to improving the accuracy and use of AI tools in the medical sector.

AI systems must provide the reasoning behind a diagnosis. This will help clinicians assess whether the key features were considered for disease diagnosis. Furthermore, regulatory bodies must establish a mechanism to assess the real-world performance of AI systems to detect any errors in the device.

Researchers at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology have discovered a promising strategy to improve treatment responses in multiple myeloma patients by blocking a protein that plays a key role in drug resistance. The study, published in Pharmacological Research, offers a potential new strategy to improve outcomes for patients whose disease has become less responsive to standard therapies.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. Patients are often treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid frequently used in the clinic to regulate immune responses and slow cancer growth. However, as the disease progresses, many patients develop resistance to glucocorticoids.

The research team found that high levels of a protein, the chemokine receptor CCR1, are linked to worse outcomes in MM patients, particularly as the disease progresses. CCR1 is a receptor expressed on the surface of myeloma cells, through which the cells respond to chemical signals in the bone marrow environment and helps cancer cells to grow and survive.

Our study shows that CCR1 is upregulated in MM patients with an unfavorable disease prognosis and plays a critical role in reducing glucocorticoid sensitivity in multiple myeloma cells. When we block CCR1 signaling, we see enhanced anti-cancer effects of dexamethasone in both lab models and patient samples.""

Bert Luyckx, first author of the study

The team used a CCR1 inhibitor called BX471 and found that it helped to restore the effects of dexamethasone in cells that had started to become resistant. The drug combination pushed cancer cells towards programmed cell death and disrupted proteins involved in drug resistance.

""By targeting CCR1, we were able to partially reverse glucocorticoid resistance in multiple myeloma cells,"" said Prof. Karolien De Bosscher. ""This could offer new therapeutic opportunities for patients who no longer benefit from existing treatments."" 

The findings suggest that CCR1 inhibitors could be used alongside current treatments to enhance their effectiveness. Further research is needed to explore how this approach can be applied in clinical settings.

For people with spinal cord injuries/diseases (SCI/D), performing daily tasks can be a challenge due to an impaired ability to grasp and manipulate objects with their hands.

University of Cincinnati researchers, in collaboration with end users in the community, have received a $200,000 grant from Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) to design a user-centered, easy-to-use assistive device to help restore hand grasping motions.

UC's Derek Wolf, PhD, the project's principal investigator, said biomedical engineers have developed many exoskeletons - robotic devices worn over the user's hand - to assist with grasping. These devices often work well in lab settings, but few end users adopt hand exoskeletons and wear them in real-world settings for the long term.

We make these really cool devices, but they don't get to that next step for any number of reasons. What we're trying to do with this project is involve end users throughout and focus on actually making a device that will translate beyond the lab."" 

Derek Wolf, Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, UC's College of Engineering and Applied Science

The research team is aiming to combine an exoskeleton device with another technology called functional electrical stimulation (FES) that runs electricity through a paralyzed muscle to get the muscle to contract.

""If you just put an exo on someone's hand, you're not really taking advantage of the hand that is there, arm muscles that are there,"" Wolf said. ""There's an efficiency gap when you just throw an exo on. We can use those muscles to generate force or motion.""

Wolf's background includes expertise in FES and incorporating it into hybrid systems. While the goal is to eventually fully integrate FES with a motorized exoskeleton, this project will first try to combine FES with a passive exoskeleton that cannot move on its own. 

""FES can be hard to control and get fine motor control, so our hope is to use the exo on top of it to make that control easier while the motion is still driven by the FES,"" Wolf explained. ""So if FES causes a finger to move, the exo is going to move with it and get a nice grasp.""

Wolf said major barriers include making interfaces user-friendly and simple for a lay person to operate, devices being cumbersome for users to quickly put on and take off by themselves, and the fact that each person's injury and needs are unique.

""Making a device that helps a lot of people but also is able to help an individual person is a real challenge,"" he said. ""Our hope is that, by including users throughout, we can really do that."" 

As paid members of the research team for the full two years of the project, advocates Sarah Elam and Dave Reed will provide input on their needs and test prototypes and new designs so that the final product can be useful and functional for end users like themselves.

""Professor Wolf told me, 'You can't simulate disability,'"" said Elam, 48, who has multiple sclerosis and is a quadriplegic with limited use of her nondominant left hand. ""That's not something they can make up using something else. It's been very important to them that I know I'm a teammate and not just the disabled person coming in to help them.""

Reed, 71, a retired UPS driver, has regained partial movement of his arms and legs and uses a power wheelchair after a C3 spinal cord injury. 

""I said yes to the project because I thought it would help other people like me, and I thought it'd be interesting, from a mental health sort of view, to be part of something bigger than myself,"" Reed said. ""I've always liked science. I thought it'd be good to be part of a kind of science project, and I'm really looking forward to doing this.""

Reed said the research could help him with tasks like steering his wheelchair better and signing his name. Elam noted that even in the project's early stages, it has been exciting to make progress as a team.

""In our first session, we were just working on picking up items and picking up and gripping a can and moving a can,"" she said. ""But there's excitement around - oh, holy crap, that worked the way we wanted it to!""

Wolf said engineers can often get caught up in an engineering challenge or big idea they believe will help users, but at the end of the project their innovations do not solve any real-world problems. 

""I'm very excited to be able to have Sarah and Dave involved, to teach me and teach the students in the lab how we actually solve the things that people care about,"" Wolf said. ""My hope is that the two advocates actually end up developing a relationship with us and stay with us long term - where they're guiding what the next project is, and the next project, and that every project we do is actually based on their needs and what they understand the needs of the community to be.""

Ryan Cuda, a student pursuing his PhD in mechanical engineering, will lead much of the day-to-day design aspects of the project and said he was envisioning working on projects like this when weighing graduate programs.

""I chose UC because it offers great opportunities to work in biomechanics, and having the medical school nearby is a huge advantage for collaboration and research,"" he said. ""At a lot of schools and in many research programs, you do the work but never see it lead to real-world change. What matters most to me is doing research that's truly translational - where we're building something that can directly improve people's lives.""

Working with Reed and Elam's feedback and needs, Cuda and the rest of the team are currently designing the first prototype exoskeleton. 

""From there, we're working in two-month sprints: designing a prototype, gathering feedback from users, refining the design and repeating the process to keep improving with each iteration,"" Cuda said.

Working on a PVA grant is personal for Cuda, who comes from a military family and planned to join the military himself before an arm injury derailed his plans.

""I understand the kind of support veterans and service members truly need, and I constantly hear about the gaps in care they're facing,"" Cuda said. ""My grandpa was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and since they work closely with PVA, it's really meaningful to come full circle and contribute to that same mission.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Mid afternoon inhaler use may improve nighttime asthma control","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250415/Mid-afternoon-inhaler-use-may-improve-nighttime-asthma-control.aspx","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

A single daily preventer dose of inhaled corticosteroid (beclomethasone), taken mid afternoon, may be the best timing for effective asthma control as it suppresses the usual nocturnal worsening of symptoms more effectively than dosing regimens at other times of the day, suggest the results of a small clinical trial published in the journal Thorax.

If the findings are confirmed in larger studies, this approach may lead to better clinical outcomes for patients without increasing unwanted steroidal side effects or medical costs, suggest the researchers.

Aligning the timing of drug treatment with the body clock, known as chronotherapy, can enhance the therapeutic effects of medicines, say the researchers. 

This may be particularly important in asthma, which has a distinct daily rhythm, with the cardinal effects of airflow obstruction and airway inflammation peaking overnight, when 80% of fatal asthma attacks occur, they explain.

Drawing on their previously published research, showing enhanced immune cell responsiveness to steroids mid afternoon, the researchers wanted to find out if a single dose of preventer inhaler at this time would better suppress the usual nocturnal worsening of asthma symptoms than either morning or standard twice-daily dosing, and without increasing the risk of steroidal side effects.

Twenty five people (aged 18-65) with confirmed mild to moderate asthma lasting at least a year, and common respiratory allergies to cat hair, dust mites, or grass pollen, were randomly assigned to one of three dosing regimens for 28 days each.

These comprised a single daily dose of 400 µg beclomethasone between 0800 and 0900 hours; the same once daily dose between 1500 and 1600 hours; and a twice daily dose of 200 µg beclomethasone between 0800 and 0900 hours and between 20.00 and 21.00 hours. 

At the end of each 28 day period, participants swapped their dosing regimen after a 14 to 21 day gap until all three trial arms had been completed. 

Spirometry readings and blood biomarkers (inflammatory cells, levels of cortisol and salbutamol from reliever inhalers) were measured every 6 hours for 24 hours at the start and end of each of the 28 day periods.

Twenty one people (84%), all of whom had similar sleep-wake cycles, completed all three of the trial arms.

Compared with baseline measurements, all the treatment arms improved night time lung function. But the timing of the improvement differed according to the dosing regimen. The largest Improvement, measured at 22:00 hours, was associated with the once daily mid afternoon dose (100 ml more than the morning dose).

Similarly, all the dosing regimens suppressed airway inflammation compared with baseline levels. And this was significantly lower at 22.00 and 0400 hours with the once daily mid afternoon dose than it was with the twice daily dose. 

There was no difference in cortisol levels between the three dosing regimens, compared with baseline levels, suggesting that there was no additional impairment in the body's ability to produce the hormone-a potential side effect of inhaled steroid treatment. 

The researchers acknowledge the small number of participants involved and the short length of their study, but suggest that the findings might form the basis of further larger trials.

""Our findings further support the hypothesis that the optimal timing of [inhaled corticosteroid] administration is at 16:00, coincident with enhanced glucocorticoid sensitivity at that time,"" they say. 

""The notion that the onset of the inflammatory cascade begins mid-afternoon may also explain the findings we observed, and the attenuation of the predictable rhythmic recruitment of airway inflammatory cells at this time point may abolish the subsequent excessive nocturnal dip in lung function in asthma,"" they suggest.

In a linked editorial, Drs Richard Russell and Nicola Smallcombe of, respectively, the King's Centre for Lung Health, King's College London,and the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, point out that the mid afternoon dosing regimen did not result in better symptom control.

But they explain: ""This lack of translation to patient outcomes may be attributed to the short duration of the follow-up period, the small numbers, and the relatively low symptom burden of participants at baseline, so there was no headroom for improvement.""

Because participants had mild to moderate asthma, and long acting beta agonist inhalers-recommended in the latest treatment guidelines-weren't included, the results might not be applicable more widely, they suggest.

""Additionally, when one considers the translation of these findings into clinical practice, with adherence to asthma therapies being the greatest challenge – around 30–40% of the general population struggles with inhaler compliance – introducing a specific time for inhaler use could potentially complicate matters further,"" they surmise.

But they conclude: ""This study offers promising insights into the potential benefits of using chronotherapy with inhaled corticosteroids for asthma patients. We believe that this is most likely to benefit those with more severe asthma, where marginal gains in lung function and a reduced eosinophil count are more likely to translate into better control and risk reduction.""

Spanish scientists reveal that snacking on whole peanuts, not peanut butter, could help protect your cells' youth, opening new doors to harnessing everyday foods for healthier aging.

Study: Unveiling the Impact of Peanut Consumption on Telomere Length in Young and Healthy Individuals: Insights from the ARISTOTLE Study: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Image Credit: Rolling Stones / Shutterstock

Did you know that telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes, shorten as we age, potentially accelerating aging and disease? In a recent study published in the journal Antioxidants, a research team in Spain explored whether consuming peanuts, which are rich in antioxidants, can influence telomere length in young, healthy individuals, to further our understanding of the potential role of diet in slowing down cellular aging.

Increases in monounsaturated fat and m-coumaric acid intake, both abundant in peanuts, were linked to longer telomeres in the study's analysis.

Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that shorten every time a cell divides. Their length is considered a marker of biological aging. Accelerated telomere shortening is linked to an increased risk of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Furthermore, factors such as oxidative stress and chronic inflammation play a significant role in this shortening process. Consequently, diets rich in antioxidants may help reduce the rate of telomere attrition.

Peanuts are a common dietary source of several antioxidant compounds, including vitamin E, niacin, and polyphenols like resveratrol. These compounds may neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce inflammation, potentially preserving telomere length. While some observational studies suggest an association between higher nut intake and longer telomeres, evidence from clinical trials remains limited and inconsistent.

Participants who ate skin-roasted peanuts saw no cases of accelerated telomere shortening, while 22% of the peanut butter group and 38% of the control group experienced significant shortening over six months.

The present randomized, controlled, parallel-design clinical trial was conducted over 6 months to investigate whether daily peanut consumption could impact telomere length in saliva samples of healthy young adults. A total of 63 participants were initially recruited, but 5 were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 58 participants aged 18–33 years for analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 25 g/day of skin-roasted peanuts (SRP), 32 g/day of peanut butter (PB), or 32 g/day of a control butter made from peanut oil (CB), which lacked phenolic compounds and fiber.

Before the intervention, baseline measurements were recorded, including anthropometrics, blood pressure, diet, physical activity, and fasting saliva samples. Dietary intake was tracked using a validated 151-item food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months. Physical activity was assessed via the Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, not accelerometers.

Telomere length was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on saliva-derived DNA, expressed as a telomere-to-single-copy gene (T/S) ratio. To assess compliance, researchers analyzed self-reported dietary records and urinary biomarkers linked to peanut intake, such as resveratrol metabolites and coumaric acids. Participants were instructed to avoid other nuts, grapes, dark chocolate, and wine during the trial.

Fiber intake spiked by 12% in the skin-roasted peanut group, suggesting whole nuts' structural integrity may play a role in gut health linked to telomere preservation.

The study found that after 6 months, the group consuming skin-roasted peanuts (SRP) showed a modest but statistically significant increase in telomere length compared to the control group (mean difference: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.01, 1.05). In contrast, peanut butter (PB) consumption did not produce significant changes relative to the control.

Notably, 0% of SRP consumers experienced accelerated telomere shortening (defined as a reduction in length below the 20th percentile), compared to 22% in the PB group and 38% in controls. The authors proposed that whole peanuts, unlike processed peanut butter, may promote gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which were previously linked to lower cortisol and depression biomarkers in the same trial.

Both SRP and PB contained added salt, but the researchers noted that unsalted peanuts might be preferable for older populations due to cardiovascular risks.

A key limitation was the relatively small sample size (58 participants) and lack of a peanut-free control group, as the CB contained peanut oil. While the SRP group showed higher baseline HDL cholesterol levels (1.73 mmol/L vs. 1.53 mmol/L in controls), this imbalance was not fully addressed in the analysis, potentially confounding results. While the 6-month intervention provided insights, telomere attrition is a slow process, and longer-term studies are needed to confirm effects.

The study suggests that daily consumption of skin-roasted peanuts for 6 months may slow telomere shortening in young, healthy adults, likely due to their high monounsaturated fat (MUFA) content and bioactive compounds like m-coumaric acid. Peanut butter did not show similar benefits, possibly due to processing-related changes in fiber structure or nutrient bioavailability.

""These findings highlight the importance of whole foods over processed alternatives in promoting cellular health,"" the authors noted. They emphasized the need for longer trials in diverse populations, particularly older adults, to validate these results.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Early menopause linked to worse cognitive function in later life","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/Early-menopause-linked-to-worse-cognitive-function-in-later-life.aspx","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 17:08:00 GMT","

A team of researchers from the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science found that women who entered menopause before the age of 40 had worse cognitive outcomes than women who entered menopause after the age of 50. This finding may be useful for clinicians, when assessing their patient's risk of developing dementia.

These findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association on April 15, 2025.

The research team chose to investigate this link because dementia disproportionally affects women worldwide, suggesting that dementia may have risk factors that are specific to women. In addition, early menopause is associated with higher risk of depression in later life, which is a known risk factor for dementia. However, direct evidence regarding the impact of earlier menopause on the age-related trajectories of depressive symptoms and cognitive function is scarce.

The team used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, classifying age at menopause into three categories: <40, 40-49, and ≥50 years. The study included 4,726 women and 4,286 men who were assessed in measures of cognitive functioning such as orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and verbal fluency. The team tested the association between sex and age at menopause, and cognitive functioning two years later after adjusting baseline modifiable risk factors for dementia.

When looking for associations, we want to rule out as many other modifiable risk factors for dementia as possible. Since early menopause increases the risk of depression, which then increases the risk of dementia, we had to control for this factor to determine if early menopause in of itself was a direct risk factor.""

Miharu Nakanishi, lead author, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine

After controlling for baseline outcome measures and other covariates (such as other modifiable dementia risk factors), menopause at <40 years, compared with ≥50 years, was significantly associated with worse 2-year follow-up orientation, as well as immediate and delayed recall. Cognitive function in women who entered menopause at ≥50 years old was actually better than the comparison group of men. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (a treatment to minimize menopausal symptoms) was not associated with cognitive function.

The results imply that women who experience early menopause may constitute a sex-specific high-risk group for cognitive decline. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between levels of female hormones and cognitive function.

""Understanding this relationship in-depth could potentially help us design treatments that delay the onset of dementia in at-risk patients,"" says Nakanishi.

Pediatric infectious diseases experts stress the importance of vaccination against measles, one of the most contagious viruses, which is once more spreading in the United States. In the article published in Pediatrics, they update pediatricians on this vaccine-preventable disease, which was previously declared non-endemic in the U.S.

The most effective way to prevent measles is vaccination. If parents are concerned that their child was exposed to measles or may have measles, they should call their child's doctor. They should not attempt to treat measles on their own without a physician's advice.""

Caitlin Naureckas Li, MD MHQS, lead author, infectious diseases specialist at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine

Measles carries risk of serious complications that may require hospitalization. Dr. Li and colleagues point out that in 2024 in the U.S., 40 percent of people with confirmed measles were hospitalized, including 52 percent of children under 5 years and 25 percent of those 5-19 years.

The authors also highlight that in the U.S., the measles mortality rate is estimated to be one-three deaths per 1,000 infections. The risk of death is higher in those under 5 years of age.

One of the more common complications of measles is pneumonia, with the lungs involved in over 50 percent of measles cases. Measles also can impact the brain. Encephalitis – an illness that can be fatal or lead to long-term brain damage in survivors – occurs in about one out of every 1,000 cases. SSPE, a near-universally deadly brain disorder that occurs years after measles infection, is another potential complication that strikes one in 100,000 cases, with higher risk in children under 1 year of age.

""MMR vaccination is safe,"" emphasized Dr. Li. ""This vaccine is the best way for families to protect their children from potentially life-threatening complications.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","WPSL Pro launching as 2nd-tier women's league","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/44691581/wpsl-pro-launching-second-tier-womens-league","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The United States will soon have a second-division women's professional league for the first time. WPSL Pro plans to launch late next year as a second-tier league, the organization announced on Wednesday.

The league's original intent was to launch in the third division, but league and club investors saw an opportunity to scale up and fill a gap in U.S. Soccer's pyramid.

""WPSL Pro is the bridge that's been missing -- not just for players, but for the communities, investors and brands ready to be part of the next chapter in women's sports,"" Sean Jones, the league's co-founder, said in a statement.

The league expects to launch with an abbreviated fall season after the 2026 men's World Cup, with a full April-to-October season beginning in 2027.

Each team will pay a $1 million franchise fee, a league spokesperson confirmed to ESPN, and the league expects to launch with 16-20 teams.

Fifteen teams have already been confirmed by the league, including an announcement on Wednesday of a team in Cleveland, Ohio, backed by several leaders of the group that recently fell just short of landing an NWSL expansion team.

The Cleveland group plans to build a $50 million, 10,000-seat downtown stadium for the women's team and an MLS Next Pro team, which is a slightly scaled-down version of its NWSL proposal.

Second-division professional women's soccer has not previously existed in the United States. The USL Super League initially planned to launch as a second division, but changed course during the U.S. Soccer licensing application process and launched as a first division in August, giving it the same designation as the incumbent NWSL.

Nothing in U.S. Soccer's bylaws prevents multiple leagues from occupying the same tier. USL recently announced that it would launch a men's first division to rival MLS.

U.S. Soccer sets minimum standards for each level of play through its Pro Licensing Standards. A second-division women's professional league must have at least six teams to apply for sanctioning. All stadiums must seat at least 2,000 people, and principal owners of teams must have a net worth of at least $7.5 million.

A WPSL Pro spokesperson told ESPN that the league is exploring the idea of giving players equity in the league. Organizers of WPSL Pro believe they can address a gap in the player development pathway.

There are a limited number of professional opportunities for women's players and, to date, no professional opportunities below the top tier of the pyramid.

""We are building WPSL Pro for players, for clubs, and for communities -- and we're excited to deliver a league that can unlock the still untapped potential of women's soccer at scale,"" said Benno Nagel, co-founder and project director of WPSL Pro, in a statement.

WPSL Pro was born from the amateur WPSL (Women's Premier Soccer League), which launched in 1998 and has grown to well over 100 teams that serve primarily as offseason homes for college players.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

""The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want,"" Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

""I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do,"" Adams said postgame. ""It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us.""

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino ""disappointed,"" again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

""I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic,"" Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: ""In football, anything can happen.""

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt ""shame"" after the two losses, and promising, again, that ""next time"" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

""I'm never concerned, man. It's football,"" he said. ""You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to.""","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

As U.S. Men's National Team midfielder Malik Tillman nears the conclusion of his second season with Eredivisie side PSV, the young American says he has no intention to leave the Dutch giants. 

While fellow USMNT youngster Gio Reyna appears set to depart Borussia Dortmund after another underwhelming Bundesliga season, Tillman has no plans to leave his current team just yet. The 22-year-old has been outstanding for the Eindhovenaars once again this year, scoring 13 goals in 29 games, during what was an unfortunately injury-shortened campaign.

Thankfully for Tillman and PSV, he completed a remarkably swift return from mid-season ankle surgery on March 30, making his return against Ajax in a 2-0 loss to the likely league champions. In the two games since, the former Bayern Munich youngster has scored in back-to-back games for Peter Bosz's side as he looks to help bring PSV's largely disappointing season to an uplifting end.

Tillman's excellent form, combined with the fact that his contract includes a buy-back clause for Bayern, are both likely to prompt transfer rumors in the coming weeks and months. However, in an interview with ESPN NL, Tillman said that “right now” he is certain he'll be remaining with PSV.

“I feel comfortable here. I know the city now, I know the people here. The club gives me confidence and supports me,” he said, adding that he doesn't often think about where the future may take him. “I still have a contract here, and I leave it to my agent [from there].”

Whether or not Tillman returns to PSV next season, he can at least end the current campaign safe in the knowledge that he's back to his old self after a tough period on the sidelines. 

Reflecting on his recovery, which saw him undergo surgery in Dubai before heading home to Germany for the start of his return to fitness, Tillman was thankful to have had his mom there to help him throughout.

Listen to our All Out Soccer podcast on both Apple and Spotify.

“My mother helped me the most. She made sure I ate well and I could talk to her about everything,” he explained. “That was a bright spot in a difficult time. My friends in Munich were also there for me.”

This “difficult time” for Tillman also coincided with an equally rough period for PSV and USMNT teammate Ricardo Pepi, whose outstanding season was brutally cut short after suffering a knee injury in the Champions League, which required him to undergo surgery.

“The hardest thing for me was that I couldn't help the team. We had a hard time, also because Ricardo Pepi wasn't there,” Tillman said. “Injuries are part of it, but it remains difficult. In such moments, you have to try to look ahead and come back stronger.”

Thankfully for Tillman, not only is he back in the starting lineup, but he's also back on the scoresheet with goals in a 3-1 win against FC Groningen and a 5-0 demolition of Almere City. “It was a good feeling to score again after my injury. It was a relief,” admitted Tillman, who is now preparing for PSV's final stretch of five games before the summer break.","{'href': 'https://www.themirror.com', 'title': 'The Mirror US'}","soccer"

Chelsea forward Joao Felix is only halfway through his loan spell at AC Milan, but he's already being linked with another temporary switch in the summer.

According to Record, Benfica are keen on reuniting with the versatile forward ahead of this summer's Club World Cup tournament.

The Portuguese powerhouse have reportedly opened talks to re-sign Felix from Chelsea in a bid to bolster their squad for the tournament.

The 25-year-old has struggled to find a permanent home over the past few years, floating across loan spells in Barcelona, Chelsea, and AC Milan.

The Blues took the punt on the dazzling forward after forking out £45 million to lure him away from Atletico Madrid, where he had fallen out of favour.

He made a fantastic start to life at Chelsea, scoring on his debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers, but has since fallen off the wagon, which has been a recurring theme for the Portuguese forward.

Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is a huge fan of Felix. However, with Cole Palmer proving indispensable, Maresca sanctioned Felix's loan switch to Milan in January.

As is customary with Felix, he scored on his Milan debut, but his influence has waned over the past few months, which cost him a place in the starting line-up.

Despite the change of scenery, Felix can only boast of a goal and an assist in 13 games for Milan across all competitions.

His decline has forced the Rosonerri to reconsider making his loan switch permanent, but he could be offered yet another lifeline with Benfica now looking to take him off Chelsea's hands.

According to Record, Benfica have already made contact with Felix's camp, with head coach Bruno Lage personally involved in efforts to persuade the player.

Lage believes Felix could be a shrewd addition ahead of the Club World Cup, and a return to his boyhood club could be what he needs to revive his once-promising career.

Along with Benfica, Chelsea are also participating in the Club World Cup and will face Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis in Group D.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Manchester City's stars are not expected to wear the club's traditional sky blue and white at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup, according to leaked images.

Pep Guardiola and his players will make the trip to the United States in the summer as a direct reward for their UEFA Champions League success in 2023, when a solitary goal from Rodri against Inter of Italy secured the club their first triumph in the competition's history.

Manchester City would then go on to win both the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, and the FIFA Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia – the final edition of the competition prior to its expansion and rebrand being launched Stateside this summer.

     

As such, the Etihad Stadium side will arrive in the United States as the reigning champions of the competition, looking to preserve the place of their gold ‘world champions' badge worn on all of their kits since their success in the Middle-East back in 2023.

While the summer is of course an opportunity for further silverware and history, it is also an excellent chance for Manchester City to expand their image across the globe to new audiences, and with that has come a bizarre marketing strategy from those within such positions.

It was revealed late last year that Puma would collaborate with KidSuper Studios – a streetwear clothing brand based in Brooklyn, New York – to launch special kits for the Club World Cup featuring novel colours different from Manchester City's traditional sky blue and white.

And now, supporters have been handed their first look at those shirt designs which will no doubt cause some controversy among supporters hoping to see the club's tradition and history preserved on the world stage.

According to information relayed by Footy Headlines, Manchester City's 2025 FIFA Club World Cup kits – made by Puma and KidSuper Studios – will combine the club's well-known sash design with a pattern simulating the iconic ‘Poznan' fan celebration.

With Manchester City seemingly ditching their traditional sky blue and white colours for the competition, it is revealed that the club's ‘home kit' will be predominantly white with a black and red sash across the front of the shirt.

Embedded within the shirt is also a design emulating the supporters' beloved ‘Poznan' celebration, which features fans in stadiums turning their backs on the game, linking arms, and jumping up and down.

As for Manchester City's new ‘away kit' for the competition, it is revealed that the design features a striking orange terms officially as ‘neon sun', with a diagonal black and neon yellow sash across the front of the shirt.

According to the same report from Footy Headlines, Manchester City are expected to launch the brand new shirts for the upcoming 2025 FIFA Club World Cup and make them available for purchase across the globe in late May/early June 2025.

Manchester City are confirmed to be taking on three fixtures in the group stage of the competition with clashes scheduled against Wydad AC, Al-Ain, and Juventus between the conclusion of the European season and start of the new campaign this summer.

There remains a possibility that the tournament could be the first chance for Pep Guardiola to show off some new signings, although the topic of conversation among some supporters is whether Kevin De Bruyne will still be at the club come the summer.

The 33-year-old confirmed earlier this month that he would be leaving the Etihad Stadium come the expiry of his contract this summer, however that date is in the middle of the United States-based FIFA Club World Cup.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Chelsea may well be saved by one club who want to try and sign a player from them before the Club World Cup starts in June.

The news comes off the back of Chelsea only managing to draw 2-2 at home with Ipswich Town on Sunday, a team who are destined to be in the Championship again next season.

One BBC pundit has pinned the blame on the players for the draw on Sunday, saying that they have to take a long hard look at themselves after that poor performance.

And head coach Enzo Maresca has also picked out two of his players for making some mistakes in the game which he believes was not good enough and cost them.

Overall though it was so poor, and blame really must be shared between the head coach, the manager, and those who have built an unbalanced squad at Chelsea that severely lacks quality experience and balance.

And when all this is over, attentions will turn to the summer transfer market and also, the Club World Cup, which Chelsea of course are in as well.

Joao Felix's former club Benfica could offer him a lifeline and also help Chelsea out this summer by giving them an outlet for Felix.

According to Record in Portugal, Benfica want João Félix on loan, and the goal is for it to be completed by the beginning of June at the latest. Rui Costa would like to be able to count on the forward for the Club World Cup.

Felix will be hard for Chelsea to sell this summer so they might have to make do with a loan move to get some of his wages off the books and also keep him playing to hold his value.

A team competing in this summer's Club World Cup are planning a move to sign a Chelsea-owned player before the tournament begins.

The Blues are currently focused on the business end of the season, where they're attempting to secure Champions League qualification and to win the Conference League.

However, the Club World Cup is quickly approaching as well because it kicks off in mid-June. Chelsea will take the Club World Cup seriously because of the financial rewards on offer within the 32-team tournament.

The latest transfer speculation suggests that a player on Chelsea's books could end up playing against Enzo Maresca's side at the summer competition.

Chelsea forward Joao Felix, 25, is currently on loan at AC Milan until the end of the season. Fresh reports suggest that he's already a target for a different club this summer, though.

According to Record, Benfica are interested in re-signing Felix, who came through their academy as a youngster.

Apparently, Benfica's aim is to sign the Portugal international on loan by the beginning of June at the latest because they want to use him at the Club World Cup tournament this summer.

It is explained that the Liga Portugal club have tried to sign Felix in the previous two summer windows, so let's see if their third attempt is more successful. The report adds that Benfica manager Bruno Lage is keen on securing the deal after previously coaching him

If Felix does end up joining Benfica in the next couple of months, there's a chance he could come up against Chelsea in the Club World Cup if both teams get out of their respective groups.

Milan won't be signing Felix permanently after a difficult spell with them since joining on loan in January.

Alvaro Morata described Felix as “special” in 2022 (Goal), but it feels like his career is at a crossroads because he can't seem to settle anywhere.

Even though Felix has incredible individual ability, he's not really kicked on like many expected since he left Benfica in 2019 to join Atletico Madrid.

The attacker was an exceptional talent when he broke into Benfica's first team, where he linked up superbly well with Lage.

Lage is currently back at Benfica for a second stint as their manager, so let's see if Felix returns to them for another spell.

Back in 2022, Felix raved about Lage's impact on him at Benfica. He told The Athletic: “He's (Lage) the best manager I've had that can manage a team and each player in the best way.”","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

A Dutch referee team will be active at the Club World Cup this summer as Danny Makkelie and his assistants travel to the United States.

“This appointment is truly fantastic,” Makkelie responded enthusiastically to the KNVB. “The Club World Cup brings together the best teams from every continent, each with their own playing styles and unique football cultures. It is precisely this diversity that makes refereeing this tournament both a challenge and a great privilege.”

Makkelie calls the upcoming Club World Cup ‘extra special' because of the new format. There will be 32 teams participating in the tournament and there will also be experiments with new rules that should limit the time-wasting of goalkeepers. The referees will also wear bodycams, of which the images can be broadcast live.

“I am extremely happy and proud to be part of such a beautiful and prestigious tournament, organised by FIFA at the highest level, together with my team,” concludes Makkelie. The Dutch referee will bring assistants Hessel Steegstra and Jan de Vries, as well as VAR Rob Dieperink.

World Cup

FIFA is in advanced negotiations with venues in Las Vegas to host the draw for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico — but soccer's world governing body has also discussed holding the event in Washington, D.C., if it made it easier for President Donald Trump to participate extensively.

When the U.S. last hosted a men's World Cup in 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, with Dick Clark presenting a gameshow-style event. James Brown was among a cast of star names — including Stevie Wonder (pictured above), Barry Manilow and Sir Rod Stewart — to perform. The late comedian Robin Williams assisted former FIFA president Sepp Blatter with the draw, and the 42nd U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared via video link.

The event, which determines the groups for the tournament's first stage of matches, setting the path to the final at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, is set to take place in December 2025, and FIFA has identified a return to Las Vegas as its preferred destination.

It is also the preference of several host city executives, who are hoping to entertain prospective commercial partners in Sin City before and after the draw.

In January, Alejandro Hutt, the director of the host city committee for the Mexican location Monterrey, told ESPN that they and Canadian city Vancouver had shown interest in hosting the draw but were informed by FIFA they would not be granted the privilege. The U.S. will host 75 per cent of the games during the tournament across 11 of the 16 host cities.

The Athletic has been told by sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, that FIFA has explored multiple venue options in Las Vegas, with the 17,000-seater MGM Grand Garden Arena among the sites it is considering.

FIFA has also studied alternative options in Las Vegas, including The Sphere and the T-Mobile Arena, but these are considered less likely because residencies, holiday concerts and events are in high demand in December. T-Mobile Arena, home of hockey's Las Vegas Golden Knights, must also adapt to the needs of the NHL regular season, for which the schedule has not yet been released.

Soccer's world governing body would also be competing for hotel rooms in Las Vegas; not only with holiday visitors but also the National Finals Rodeo, which takes place between December 4-13 at the Thomas & Mack Center. In 2024, more than 170,000 attended this across 10 days. Amazon's AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas has also become an annual tradition in early December and has more than 60,000 attendees.

FIFA has also enquired about the more intimate Dolby Live arena, which has a capacity of 6,400, but MGM, which operates it, provided initial feedback to say its preference was to keep the venue open for residencies or holiday concerts. Bruno Mars and Lenny Kravitz have multiple dates at Dolby Live booked for this summer, but arguably, the jewel in the Dolby's crown over the past 12 months has been Mariah Carey's residency. Her schedule for December is not yet announced, but last year, she went to 20 cities as part of her holiday season tour, and the Dolby is keen to maintain space in its calendar for further appearances by her, which limits FIFA's options.

In a statement to The Athletic, MGM Resorts International said: “As leaders in sports and entertainment, it would be a tremendous opportunity to host a FIFA event in Las Vegas. We are committed to delivering premier experiences that captivate fans worldwide and partnering with FIFA would offer another chance for the destination to showcase itself as the sports capital of the world.”

Some of those at FIFA have also noted President Trump's repeated references to the World Cup since he returned to the White House, with him regularly praising his FIFA counterpart, Gianni Infantino, who visited the Oval Office earlier this year and attended one of Trump's pre-inauguration rallies. Internally, FIFA has discussed the possibility of bringing the event closer to Trump, even floating ideas to host the event in considerably slimmed-down fashion at the White House or other potential sites in D.C.

Trump could still travel to Las Vegas for the event. He sent a video message for the FIFA Club World Cup draw held in Miami in December 2024, during an event that his daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and grandson Theo attended. Ivanka and Theo made the ceremonial first picks of the draw.

FIFA declined to comment on this story, with people at the organization indicating that negotiations are continuing and announcements may be made in due course. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

FIFA are in advanced talks to hold the 2026 World Cup draw in Las Vegas, a report has claimed - but President Donald Trump could scupper their plans.

The governing body is said to be locked in negotiations with several glitzy venues in the popular resort city ahead of the ceremony taking place this December.

The US last hosted a men's World Cup in 1994 and staged the draw at the Las Vegas Convention Center. President Bill Clinton made an appearance on video while Stevie Wonder and Robbie Williams were also part of the festivities.

According to The Athletic, FIFA would prefer to hold the event, which will divide the 48 teams into 12 groups of four, in Sin City but a final decision has not been made.

Several host city executives are also said to be keen for Las Vegas to get the nod, such is their desire to entertain potential commercial partners there around the draw.

FIFA have reportedly explored holding the ceremony at the 17,000-seater MGM Grand Garden Arena but alternative options are on the table. These include the T-Mobile Arena and The Sphere, the eye-catching venue which opened in September 2023.

However, the latter two locations are considered less likely because other events, including residencies and holiday concerts, would clash with the draw in December. 

In January, the director of the host city committee for Monterrey, the Mexican city where four fixtures will take place, revealed they and Vancouver had put forward their interest in staging the draw, only to be turned down by FIFA.

The US will host 75 per cent of the games next year and boast 11 of the 16 host cities. 

But FIFA are also reported to have discussed the idea of moving the draw closer to Trump in Washington D.C. Options on the table range from holding the ceremony in a slimmed-down format at the White House or using other potential sites in the capital.

It has not been ruled out that Trump could jet to Las Vegas for the occasion. The president recorded a video message for the Club World Cup draw held in Miami last December, an event his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner attended. 

Trump has made several glowing references to hosting the World Cup since returning to the White House and has praised FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Infantino, 55, attended one of Trump's pre-inauguration rallies and appeared alongside him in the Oval Office to showcase the Club World Cup trophy.

FIFA declined to comment and negotiations over the draw location are ongoing.

The newly expanded World Cup will feature 48 teams next year, 16 more than the traditional number of 32. The tournament will begin in Mexico on June 11, 2026. 

Seven teams have already booked their spot. Indeed, alongside the three host nations, Japan, New Zealand, Argentina and Iran are confirmed to take part.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"

FIFA has its sights set on bringing the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw back to Sin City.

The Athletic reported FIFA are in advanced negotiations with several venues in Las Vegas to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw come December. There are also possible talks of moving the event to Washington D.C. to allow President Donald Trump to more easily participate in the draw.

The United States already has experience hosting FIFA World Cup festivities in Las Vegas. The 1994 FIFA World Cup draw unfolded at the Las Vegas Convention Center and featured singer Stevie Wonder, late actor Robin Williams and then-President Bill Clinton, who made an appearance on video. 

Fast forward more than 30 years later and Las Vegas could once again be home to the FIFA World Cup draw. In 2025, FIFA has a wealth of options when it comes to venues, including the MGM Grand Garden Arena, T-Mobile Arena and even The Sphere.

Since Las Vegas was not named as one of the 11 U.S. host cities for the upcoming competition, it could now potentially still participate in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, coming to the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer. 

The newly-expanded 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature 48 teams, 16 more than the traditional 32 teams. Six months before the tournament kicks off in Mexico on June 11, 2026, the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw will divide the teams into 12 groups of four.

So far, seven teams have already qualified for next summer's tournament. Along with the three host nations, Japan, New Zealand, Argentina and Iran have all punched their tickets to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The qualified national teams will have to wait until the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw unfolds in December to find out their group stage opponents.

Hello. The World Cup is the greatest show on Earth — and if FIFA has its way, the draw for 2026 will be a close second.

On the way:

What is FIFA planning?

The simple act of picking balls from a hat to determine who plays who at a tournament is usually quite a big deal. Bigger when it's the World Cup. Humongous when it is held in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

As Adam Crafton revealed today, FIFA is looking to host December's draw in Las Vegas, where the glitz and glamour will no doubt come in bucketfuls.

It provides a full-circle moment. When the U.S. last hosted a men's World Cup in 1994, the draw took place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and the full use was made of the global superstars in its vicinity.

The irrepressible Dick Clark presented a gameshow-style event, Stevie Wonder (pictured above), Barry Manilow and Sir Rod Stewart performed, President Bill Clinton appeared via video link and comedian Robin Williams helped the FIFA president at the time, Sepp Blatter, deliver the draw. The duo formed quite the double act.

Why Vegas? What will Mariah say?

The Athletic was told about the Vegas plans by sources, who wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.

The city works for FIFA for several reasons, productivity certainly being one of them. Many host city executives are keen to entertain prospective commercial partners there before and after the draw, and where better to close deals than Sin City?

The Dolby Live arena has been looked at. But there's a snag… Mariah Carey.

After the singer's successful residency at the Dolby a couple of months ago, the venue wants to keep space in its calendar for her to return, limiting FIFA's options.

It might be that all FIFA will Want for Christmas is to host the draw there. But if all else fails, president Gianni Infantino will have to Shake It Off and settle for another venue. And there are options.

Will Trump attend?

The bromance between Infantino and Donald Trump is no secret, so it would not be a surprise if FIFA knocked Vegas on the head to move the draw closer to Washington D.C., not only to accommodate the U.S. president but also to ensure he can play a key role in the event. Shades of 1991, perhaps, when Trump did the English League Cup draw live on British television.

Given Infantino has visited the Oval Office and attended one of Trump's pre-inauguration rallies, Trump may well return the favour. He sent a video message for the Club World Cup draw in December and will surely participate in the World Cup draw in some capacity.

Maybe it will be held in Washington rather than Vegas. Or maybe the president will hop in Air Force One and be at the draw in person.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. FIFA declined to comment, but says an announcement will be made soon.

Villa come up short (just) – but what about Madrid?

Aston Villa's big night got off on all the wrong notes, even before they went 2-0 down to Paris Saint-Germain (5-1 on aggregate).

As the teams lined up pre-match, ready to be stirred by the Champions League anthem, the Europa League tune blared out instead, much to the bemusement of players (above).

But then Marcus Rashford went on a one-man mission to pull Villa from the depths. They scored three times but ultimately fell short.

Borussia Dortmund almost did the improbable, too. Serhou Guirassy — who we will surely hear more about during the summer transfer window — scored a brilliant hat-trick against Barcelona, but the four-goal deficit from the first leg was a mountain too steep to climb, with Niko Kovac's side going out 5-3 on aggregate.

So, no ‘remontadas' on Tuesday. Can Real Madrid or Bayern Munich pull off comebacks of their own? Bayern will have to do something only Milan have done this season: beat Inter at San Siro. They will be without goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, too, who has failed to shake off a calf injury.

The odds are stacked against Madrid. Only four sides have overturned a first-leg deficit of at least three goals in the Champions League this century. Madrid will have to do something they've never done before: score against Arsenal. Then, score again. And again. And again. And hope they don't concede. To get past William Saliba — who they admire — will be a tall ask.

Jude Bellingham told reporters: “It's a night tailor-made for Madrid.” History tends to agree. The Bernabeu seems to whip visiting teams in its tornado and dump them in a scrapheap on nights like these.

The roof will be closed, turning Madrid's stadium into a cauldron. But as one X user wonderfully said: Rice cooks better with the lid on. Arsenal will have no fear.

A stolen vase and a Japanese extradition row

If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a Netflix mini-series: a football “prodigy” with a “Premiership future” — as one headline put it — being the subject of an unprecedented extradition request from Japan after an alleged heist.

It's an interesting storyline but for Kaine Wright, this is as real as it gets. He started at West Ham United but after being released in 2013, trialled at various clubs, including Orlando City, and attempted to forge a professional career.

In November 2015, as Daniel Taylor explains, Wright and two other men are alleged to have stolen 46 items worth 106 million yen (£679,000; $739,000) from Tokyo's Harry Winston jewellery store, having entered the shop posing as customers. Wright's lawyers say he denies any involvement.

The Japanese government has applied for the extradition of Wright, 28, and his co-accused — the first time in history that Japan has applied for the extradition of criminal suspects from the United Kingdom.

A High Court judge ruled in favour of Japan's application this year but his lawyers believe it should be dismissed. Handing him over, they argued last Friday, would leave him vulnerable to mistreatment and torture in Japan's penal system.

Legal papers show written assurances from the Japanese authorities that the three men “will not be subject to torture or any other kind of physical abuse”. The case returns to court on May 16.

(Kick-offs ET/UK time)

Champions League quarter-final second legs: Inter vs Bayern Munich, Real Madrid vs Arsenal (both 3pm/8pm and Paramount+/TNT Sports).

Premier League: Newcastle United vs Crystal Palace, 2.30pm/7.30pm — USA Network, Fubo/Sky Sports.

Goalkeepers get up to all sorts when facing penalty kicks. And look, I get it, the odds are stacked against them. But what Tigres' Nahuel Guzman did against CF Monterrey in Mexico's Liga MX proved to be particularly nonsensical.

He did the usual — arms wide in an attempt to make the goal look small — but with his back turned to the ball and taker Sergio Ramos. The tactic did not work as the former Real Madrid defender slotted home shortly after the goalkeeper turned back around.

Thankfully for Guzman, after Monterrey had two players sent off, making it 10 vs nine, Tigres scored in the 90th and 95th minutes to stage a dramatic comeback. A quiet one, then…

Manchester United. Manchester City. Chelsea. Liverpool. Tottenham Hotspur. West Ham United. Nottingham Forest. Aston Villa. Ipswich Town. What do these teams have in common?

The answer is they have all won European trophies which are still active. As you likey noticed, Arsenal - the third-most successful English club of all time by honours - are not named. The Gunners' failure to turn decades of domestic dominance into continental glory is a mystery to this day. It's not even as if they can blame it on a curse a la Benfica post-1962 European Cup triumph.

The north Londoners have won two defunct European tournaments: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was not run by UEFA until it was replaced with the UEFA Cup in 1971, and the Cup Winners' Cup, which was absorbed by the UEFA Cup (all hail the UEFA Cup, by the way). So it's not as if they're complete nobodies away from the British Isles, at least, even if their haul is slim compared to their rivals.

A new age is dawning in N5, however. Arsenal are on the verge of changing their European footprint for the better, penning a new legacy for a generation of hopefuls, dreamers and optimists. It all starts with Real Madrid.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Dedura-Palomero had been ready to leave the Munich Open after crashing out in the second round of qualifying at the weekend, but the late withdrawal of Monfils meant the 17-year-old took the Frenchman's place as a lucky loser.

An hour into his opener against Denis Shapovalov on Tuesday, Dedura-Palomero was roaring in celebration after his Canadian opponent retired injured while trailing 7-6(2) 3-0.

""I was struggling all these years and I just got the wildcard for qualifying,"" said Dedura-Palomero, who is the first player born in 2008 to win a main-draw match.

""I won against Mackenzie McDonald and lost against Alexander Bublik. I had bad luck because there were three lucky losers who got in and I was the fourth one.

""I was waiting the whole day on Monday and then Monfils pulled out. He hugged me and he was so nice. I went in and told myself to have fun, go with the crowd and play my best.""

Dedura-Palomero, born in Berlin to a Chilean father and Lithuanian mother who also coach him, said he grew in confidence as the match wore on.

""You go over it in your mind. What happens if you win? Then I was focused all the time and tried to hold serve in the first set,"" he said.

""In the tie-break he got tight ... I tried to put the ball in and move him and fight for every point. In the end, I was just super happy.""

Submissions have been edited for brevity and clarity.

Hey everyone …

• Here's the latest Served podcast.

• Welcome to Greenland: 

• The legal match between PTPA and ATP is underway (see below). Daniel Kaplan filed this dispatch. Note the alleged union-busting by the ATP, Vasek Pospisil's surprise at Novak Djokovic's retreat and the projected $50 to $100 million in legal fees. (Where does the WTA in particular have these kinds of funds?)

Onward … 

Lots of questions and chatter this week about the latest in the PTPA lawsuit, especially after the aforementioned Dan Kaplan piece.

• It pains me to write this because I am—fervently, unreservedly, unswervingly—in favor of more player rights, player pay and player voice. I hate to be the person who starts sentences this way, but in 25 years of covering this wonderful and maddening sport, the lack of player empowerment is a persistent throughline. We should support a movement and association that unites players and attacks the collective action problem that has depressed the wages and rights of the talent doing the hardest work.

I am also sympathetic to the PTPA's frustration, which led them to this point. You feel unheard and unseen and not taken seriously. Your overtures to negotiate are not met with the courtesy of a response. If you can't go the legislative route, you go the legal route—especially if your finances, while opaque, seem to include a Bill Ackman-backed war chest. (And if, in fact, the ATP is engaging in the equivalent of union-busting tactics, there must be consequences.)

And yet, this lawsuit? As the kids say: This ain't it. It's sloppily drafted. It's sloppily reasoned. It's ventilated with holes and contradictions. It doesn't make a convincing case of illegality or collusion, nor, maybe more critically, does it offer a solution that would benefit the players. In keeping with the times, it's all flamethrowing, no problem-solving remedy. Ready. Fire. Aim. Weaken the institutions first; deal with solutions later.

This isn't just me talking. Outside the plaintiff's highly invested—and highly compensated—lead counsel, I have heard no sports lawyers offer optimism, approval or admiration for this effort. Speaking of silence …

There are literally no top players—i.e., those with the most leverage—who have spoken in support. That Djokovic, who co-founded the entire enterprise, is now backpedaling like a college tour guide, tells you plenty. (How do you file a splashy lawsuit without first getting the sign-off of the most important members of the enterprise? 

One imagines an equivalent: Musicians are really mad at Ticketmaster. Eddie Money, Sugar Ray and Lou Bega are ready to throw down in court!

Cool. But what about Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé and Taylor Swift?

No, they want nothing to do with this.

And when the top players write their own letter to the majors, rightly, asking for more money, how does that not erode the PTPA's position even further? 

There's been a lot of backlash, and it's easy to bag on the PTPA. But I commend them for the effort. And, ultimately, they're on the right side here. Yet, this salvo was an unforced error. Best case scenario: This lawsuit—a big legal nothingburger, as it is—gets them in the room. Together with the top players, they negotiate a wage increase, a rights increase, a loosening of restrictions, an injection of sanity into the punchline that is tennis scheduling … and the sport ends up in a better place. And if the ATP—and, more importantly, the less financially secure WTA—can avoid $10 million in billable hours, all the better.

Jon I saw the [reference] to Andre Agassi being a French Open broadcaster. How do you think he will do? I don't know how closely he's been following tennis lately, but personally I can't wait!

Cat, PA

• The usual disclaimer and disclosure that I have zero objectivity here. I've done media and corporate work with Andre, and I like him personally. With that out of the way, I think this has the potential to be groundbreaking (No pressure!). Think that's an overstatement? Let's look back at the 2007 U.S. Open, when he slapped on a pair of headphones and, with no preparation, offered a masterclass.  

As was the case when he played, Agassi sees a different game, he thinks a different game, he views (and articulates) tennis—not just the X's and O's but all of it: the thermodynamics, the social interactions, the risk-reward calculus—on a different plane. 

(I'll bore you with my full theory another time, but I always wanted to write a think piece about how Agassi's Las Vegas origins—his native familiarity with odds, with incremental house advantages, with boom-bust cycles, with bluffs, with strategic plays and ploys … how profoundly it all impacted his tennis. His discovery about Boris Becker's tongue movement presaging the direction of his serve? What was that if not a poker player at the Horseshoe discerning a tell at the table?)

Anyway, ah, yes, Agassi on TNT. He'll be great. He's spoken openly about this, so I don't feel like I'm violating any confidences. If there's been trepidation for TV in the past, it's that he's such a deep and singular thinker, the rhythms of tennis on TV can be problematic. Sometimes, analysts have 15 seconds to offer a quick pop of insight before the ball is in play (and, per the rules of engagement, there must be silence in the booth during the point). Agassi is barely clearing his throat in 15 seconds. Once he gathers his thoughts, this is someone who can offer an exquisite, never-thought-of-that-before soliloquy on the kick serve or the role of fear or a shift in playing conditions only he has discerned. But he needs a hell of a lot more than 15 seconds to do so.

My prediction: Warner Brothers (TNT et al.) will put Agassi in the best position to succeed. He'll arrive in Paris early and digest the tennis, getting up to speed not just on players but the venue, the vibe of the tournament—the micro and the macro. He'll step up to the baseline for the final few rounds. And the audience—fans of all intensity levels—will be in for a treat.

We had a handful of questions about the Billie Jean King Cup and the value of team competitions in general. (We talked a bit about this on Tennis Channel last week as well.) 

My hottish take, which includes the Davis Cup as well: In this globalized, borderless world, we are beyond the concept of a nation vs. nation competition. In tennis, players live and train all over the world. (And so many have moved out of their country of origin.) Kazakhstan is open for business. Just last month, we saw a top player seamlessly switch nationalities. We think nothing of Aryna Sabalenka setting up shop in Miami or Naomi Osaka representing Japan.

How many fans go to tournaments, follow players or fabricate rooting interests based on country code? (Said no one ever: I used to like Grigor Dimitrov, but then saw he is from Bulgaria and playing an American. Boo Bulgaria!) Nation vs. nation is just a weird and out-of-step (if not altogether irrelevant) distinction in 2025. 

Team competitions can work. Like college tennis, where players declare fealty to their schools and then return together to the same campus. Or Laver Cup, which attracts the best players with its cosmopolitan vibe (and big payday) and at least nods to the artificiality of nationhood by pitting Europe vs. The World. We all know that, for instance, the Czechs, Italians and Serbs are tennis powerhouses, punching above their weight. Whether they win or lose team competitions, it doesn't change much.

Then, there is the scheduling issue. The calendar is already over-crammed. Ten pounds of gear for a five-pound bag. On top of the tournaments, we're asking players to go from places like Charleston, S.C., to outposts for an event with no points and little money? Even players who didn't have to travel begged off, citing the unnecessary wear and tear—see: Iga Świątek in Poland.

Wait, there's more … after the U.S. Open, players head to China, where—in addition to the distance—the WTA recently pulled up its tent because the government failed to address a former WTA player's account of sexual assault. Literally and figuratively: What are we doing here? 

A mailbag theme: Fans take their cue from the players. This could be for issues. (When players gripe about the brand of ball, it's a good indication that we should believe it's a serious concern.) It could be for talent. (When players gush over João Fonseca, it goes a long way toward legitimizing him.) This could be for appearances. Laver Cup is legitimized less by pageantry and press releases than by the A-list players who prioritize it. Conversely, when so few top players commit to the BJK Cup and Davis Cup, fans say, If they don't care, why should we?

The ATP professional men's tennis tour is returning to Huether Family Match Pointe on the Sanford Sports Complex October 19-26 as the ATP Tour has renewed the MarketBeat Open for year two.

“Year one of the MarketBeat Open was a huge success,” HFMP Executive Director and MarketBeat Open Tournament Director Mark Vellek said in a press release. “We received high marks from both tour staff and the players. There was outstanding support from fans and local sponsors that made the event a great week, and we are excited for an even bigger and better tournament this year.”

The ATP Tour has upgraded the event for 2025 to an ATP 100 tournament.

“The upgrade of the tournament is a testament to the amount of work and pride that Mark and the staff at Huether Family Match Pointe devoted to the inaugural event,” President of Sanford Sports Steve Young said via the press release. “The Sioux Falls community embraced the athletes and ATP Tour, and we are excited to once again welcome them to the Sanford Sports Complex this fall for what will be another first-class event in our city.”

The MarketBeat Open is an ATP Challenger and USTA Pro Circuit event and has the USTA excited for its future after its inaugural year and upgraded status as well.

“We were incredibly pleased with the success of the first edition of the Sioux Falls event and are looking forward to seeing the event return for year two,” USTA Pro Circuit Managing Director Tracy Davies said via the press release. “We are excited that local fans will once again be able to experience high level professional tennis.”

The MarketBeat Open will feature 32 of the top singles players in the world as well as 16 doubles teams, and the prize money from last year has doubled. Many players from last year's event have enjoyed great success on tour since last October's tournament in Sioux Falls, including Brandon Holt, son of former Grand Slam Champion Tracy Austin, who has risen almost 100 spots in the world rankings since last year's tournament.

Borna Gojo from Croatia captured last year's singles title on his way back from injury after being in the top 100 in the world and making a run to the Round of 16 at the 2023 US Open where he lost to Novak Djokovic. Colton Smith finished second and has been a rising American star on tour since his run in Sioux Falls, capturing the Cleveland Open title in February and advancing to the quarterfinals of the ATP 250 event in Houston earlier this month where he lost to world No. 13 Tommy Paul.

“It (MarketBeat Open) was an incredible feat from everybody that was part of it,” said Smith of last year's event. “Everybody from around the area came out and supported the event. I met a lot of amazing people there.”

The player field will be determined 21 days ahead of the start of the event. Tickets for the MarketBeat Open will go on sale August 25, which is the first day of the US Open.

World No. 2 and defending champion Iga Swiatek will seek a fifth career Roland Garros title next month, and she will be joined at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament by the entire Top 100 in the PIF WTA Rankings this week.

The official entry list for the year's second major was released Tuesday, and Swiatek will be challenged by plenty of contenders seeking to dethrone her and capture a first Roland Garros title including World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, former finalist and World No. 4 Coco Gauff, last year's runner-up and No. 6 Jasmine Paolini, and No. 7 Mirra Andreeva, who last year announced herself on the Hologic WTA Tour by becoming the youngest Roland Garros semifinalist in 27 years.

The initial field is rounded out by four players who have entered the main draw using protected rankings. Two-time Wimbledon champion and two-time Roland Garros semifinalist Petra Kvitova leads the way in that quartet, as is seeking to play her first Grand Slam tournament since the 2023 US Open after the birth of her son last July. Also entered on a protected ranking are former Roland Garros quarterfinalist Sorana Cirstea, Jodie Burrage and Yanina Wickmayer.

Burrage, entered with a special ranking of No. 85, is expected to make her Roland Garros main-draw debut.

Also expected to debut in Paris is Alexandra Eala, the history-maker from the Philippines who, as a result of her first WTA 1000 semifinal appearance at the Miami Open last month, is into the main draw of a Grand Slam directly for the first time; Australian 18-year-old Maya Joint, the second-youngest player inside the Top 100 behind Mirra Andreeva; and Colombian No. 2 Emiliana Arango, who has fallen in Grand Slam qualifying 10 times but launched herself into the Top 100 by reaching her first WTA 500 final in Mexico earlier this year.

The last direct acceptance to the main draw is currently World No. 100 Robin Montgomery. Click here to view the full list of direct entries (pdf).

The first 15 alternates to the main draw in case of any withdrawals are as follows:

Aryna Sabalenka is looking to begin her clay court season at a WTA tournament where she has finished as runner-up on three occasions.

Sabalenka won the Miami Open for the first time last month after beating Jessica Pegula in the final.

This was a relief for the world number one, after Sabalenka had lost the Australian Open and Indian Wells finals already this year.

After Sabalenka met David Beckham in Miami, she has now returned to Europe for the clay court season.

Despite being unable to defend her Australian Open title this year, Sabalenka is the reigning US Open champion and is just two major titles away from completing the Career Grand Slam.

Roland Garros and Wimbledon are the two major tournaments that Sabalenka has missing to complete the set.

Ahead of the Stuttgart Open, Sabalenka was asked in her press conference about which of the two Grand Slams she thinks will be harder to win.

“I mean, how can we compare these two completely different surfaces?” questioned Sabalenka. “But both of them are pretty tough to win. 

“But probably physically will be tougher — mentally/physically will be tougher, Roland Garros. But that's my goal, and I'm working really hard and hopefully I can achieve that goal.”

Sabalenka struggled with illness at Roland Garros last year, where she lost in the quarter-finals to Mirra Andreeva.

However, Sabalenka has been closer to reaching Roland Garros final in 2023, having had a match point in her semi-final against Karolina Muchova.

The Belarusian is also a two-time semi-finalist at SW19, but Sabalenka missed Wimbledon last year after withdrawing due to shoulder injury.

Sabalenka has extended her lead over Iga Swiatek to 3,071 points after making a strong start to the 2025 season.

Despite reaching more finals than she had at this stage of the 2023 and 2024 seasons, Sabalenka does not think that it is her best start due to her lack of Grand Slam title.

“I think winning Australian Open was a better start for me in the previous years,” admitted Sabalenka. “That's definitely a great start for finals. I mean, I cannot complain. But of course I could do a little bit better in those two finals I lost.”

From her last three seasons, 2023 is the year where Sabalenka had the best win percentage just ahead of this year.

Before Sabalenka can think about winning Roland Garros and Wimbledon, she will turn her attention to another tournament that she has been previously close to the title.

Having finished as runner-up at the Stuttgart Open on three previous occasions, Sabalenka will be hoping to overcome rivals Swiatek, Pegula and Coco Gauff.

After Anastasia Potapova withdrew from their upcoming match, Sabalenka is already into the quarter-finals of the WTA 500 tournament where she will play either Diana Shnaider or Elise Mertens.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The Roland Garros men's singles main draw entry list was released on Tuesday.

Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz will try to lift the Coupe des Mousquetaires again in 2025 for the fifth major trophy of his career. The Spaniard has claimed at least one Slam trophy every season from 2022-24 and will try to make it a fourth consecutive year with a major by triumphing in Paris.



By winning the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz climbed to No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The 21-year-old will continue battling at ATP Tour events, including this week's Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell, to earn one of the crucial top two seeds at Roland Garros. 

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic also top the entry list.

Four players have used their protected ranking to enter the clay-court event: Reilly Opelka, Jenson Brooksby, Sebastian Ofner and Emil Ruusuvuori.

The last player inside the current cut is Hugo Dellien, the No. 101 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Immediately outside the cut are Luca Nardi, Chun-Hsin Tseng and Alexander Shevchenko.

Roger Federer has teased a potential return to tennis and admitted he misses playing every day since retiring nearly three years ago. The Swiss legend had a fairytale goodbye alongside Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray at his Laver Cup event, but could yet make a comeback in exhibitions.

Federer has made sparse appearances at events on the tennis calendar, most notably at Wimbledon last year, and laid very few hints about wanting to play on a court once again. But having played “so much” golf in retirement, Federer is ready to return to his first sporting love.

“Honestly, I'd love to play some more tennis again,” Federer told TNT Sports. “Enough with the golf, I've played so much. So seriously, I would love to start playing two or three times a week and hopefully get myself back on the exhibition court and fill up a few nice [stadiums] around the world. I have no plans yet.

“The training part, I miss it a little bit. I haven't played a whole lot since I retired because my body and mind needed a break. I have with my kids, but I would love to go and practice as I travel and hopefully you will see me play an exhibition soon.”

With Federer's long-time rival Nadal also retiring last year, pulses will have been racing at the prospect of the duo competing against - or with - one another.

Federer has never hidden his love of Wimbledon and he may question where better than the hallowed SW19 turf to mark his first appearance back on a tennis court.

The invitational doubles has long been an event used by the All England Club to bring back some of the game's favourite former players.

Last year, Ash Barty made a surprise return and played alongside old partner Casey Dellacqua. This was her first match at Wimbledon since lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish in 2021, retiring the following year at the age of 25.

She thoroughly enjoyed her time competing in the invitational doubles and even asked Murray to be her mixed partner for a future event. Barty told Express Sport: “I would have loved to play mixed doubles with Andy, but singles were my focus and I had already entered ladies doubles as well.

“I'm not sure my body would have coped with mixed doubles too. Maybe Andy will play in the invitational with me here next year?!”

What a treat the Wimbledon patrons would be in for if Murray, Barty and Federer all returned to action at this summer's Slam.

Tennis fans, brace yourselves for a potential comeback of epic proportions as Roger Federer drops hints about returning to the court, with Wimbledon possibly in his sights. The Swiss maestro, who bid adieu to professional tennis nearly three years ago, recently expressed his yearning to play the sport he loves once again.

In a surprising revelation, Federer confessed his longing for the game, stating, “Honestly, I'd love to play some more tennis again. Enough with the golf, I've played so much.” The 20-time Grand Slam champion acknowledged missing the training and the thrill of competing, fueling speculations about his imminent return to the tennis scene.

Fans are buzzing with excitement at the mere thought of Federer gracing the courts once more, especially at the prestigious Wimbledon championships, a tournament close to his heart. The prospect of seeing Federer back in action alongside his longtime rival Rafael Nadal has sent shockwaves through the tennis world, igniting hopes of witnessing a nostalgic showdown between the legends.

Moreover, the allure of invitational events like the doubles at Wimbledon, which have seen former stars like Ash Barty making comebacks, adds to the anticipation. Barty's return to the Wimbledon courts for the invitational doubles last year created a stir among fans, hinting at the magic that such events can bring to the sport.

As whispers of Federer's return continue to grow louder, tennis enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting any confirmation of his participation in upcoming exhibitions. The possibility of seeing Federer, Nadal, and other tennis icons back in action has set the stage for a potential resurgence of star power in the tennis world, promising fans a thrilling spectacle to look forward to.

Stay tuned as the tennis world braces for the return of one of its greatest champions, with Federer's potential comeback shaping up to be a headline-making moment that fans won't want to miss.

The ATP professional men's tennis tour is returning to Huether Family Match Pointe on the Sanford Sports Complex October 19-26 as the ATP Tour has renewed the MarketBeat Open for year two.

“Year one of the MarketBeat Open was a huge success,” HFMP Executive Director and MarketBeat Open Tournament Director Mark Vellek said in a press release. “We received high marks from both tour staff and the players. There was outstanding support from fans and local sponsors that made the event a great week, and we are excited for an even bigger and better tournament this year.”

The ATP Tour has upgraded the event for 2025 to an ATP 100 tournament.

“The upgrade of the tournament is a testament to the amount of work and pride that Mark and the staff at Huether Family Match Pointe devoted to the inaugural event,” President of Sanford Sports Steve Young said via the press release. “The Sioux Falls community embraced the athletes and ATP Tour, and we are excited to once again welcome them to the Sanford Sports Complex this fall for what will be another first-class event in our city.”

The MarketBeat Open is an ATP Challenger and USTA Pro Circuit event and has the USTA excited for its future after its inaugural year and upgraded status as well.

“We were incredibly pleased with the success of the first edition of the Sioux Falls event and are looking forward to seeing the event return for year two,” USTA Pro Circuit Managing Director Tracy Davies said via the press release. “We are excited that local fans will once again be able to experience high level professional tennis.”

The MarketBeat Open will feature 32 of the top singles players in the world as well as 16 doubles teams, and the prize money from last year has doubled. Many players from last year's event have enjoyed great success on tour since last October's tournament in Sioux Falls, including Brandon Holt, son of former Grand Slam Champion Tracy Austin, who has risen almost 100 spots in the world rankings since last year's tournament.

Borna Gojo from Croatia captured last year's singles title on his way back from injury after being in the top 100 in the world and making a run to the Round of 16 at the 2023 US Open where he lost to Novak Djokovic. Colton Smith finished second and has been a rising American star on tour since his run in Sioux Falls, capturing the Cleveland Open title in February and advancing to the quarterfinals of the ATP 250 event in Houston earlier this month where he lost to world No. 13 Tommy Paul.

“It (MarketBeat Open) was an incredible feat from everybody that was part of it,” said Smith of last year's event. “Everybody from around the area came out and supported the event. I met a lot of amazing people there.”

The player field will be determined 21 days ahead of the start of the event. Tickets for the MarketBeat Open will go on sale August 25, which is the first day of the US Open.

April 16, 2025



The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has announced a multi-year extension and expansion of its partnership with IMG, the sports marketing agency. The new agreement will see IMG represent and advise the USTA on both the international and domestic media rights of the iconic US Open Tennis Championships. The USTA has been working with IMG since 2011.

IMG advised and represented the USTA throughout the recent renewal negotiation with ESPN to continue broadcasting the US Open in the US, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean through 2037. The 2024 US Open was watched by a record-breaking global audience of more than 175 million and broadcast in more than 200 territories across 60 channels. 

“IMG has been an integral part of the US Open's growth, ensuring that it reaches core fans and new audiences across the world through innovative local and regional media distribution partnerships,” said Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer, USTA. “We are thrilled to extend the relationship with IMG to together bring the most spectacular sports and entertainment event to the world for many more years to come.”

Ed Mallaburn, SVP, Sports Management, IMG, added: “The US Open has grown into one of the world's most engaging and exciting sporting events, capturing the attention of audiences of all ages, spanning far beyond tennis and sports fans. The USTA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible onsite and onscreen, and we couldn't be prouder to continue to support such a bold and innovative rightsholder. The sport of tennis needs to leverage its unique assets in an ever-changing ecosystem and this year's revamped mixed doubles event is a perfect example of how the USTA is doing this.”

The 2025 US Open runs from August 18th – September 7th.

The USTA is extending its relationship with IMG as the governing body's representative in U.S. Open media rights negotiations on a multiyear basis. Parties declined to specify the length.

IMG has worked with the USTA since 2011, primarily focusing on international efforts, but will now add brokerage of domestic media rights to its purview. The group advised and represented the USTA in its recent domestic renewal with ESPN, which starts in 2026, runs through 2037, and is worth north of $2B total.

A key tentpole there is the revolutionized Mixed Doubles Championship, which will move from the second week of the U.S. Open main draw to Fan Week and feature a $1M prize. IMG and the USTA hope increased attention on the event will further expand international deals.

IMG also represented the French Tennis Federation last year in its 10-year, $650M domestic deal with TNT Sports to air the French Open, and is partnered with AELTC (Wimbledon), ATP Media and WTA Ventures.

The agency has a host of high-profile partners outside of tennis as well, including the NFL, which it represents in more than 30 markets across Asia and Europe. The NHL, NWSL, PBR and more are part of the portfolio. ","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","tennis"

ROUEN — Canadian tennis player Bianca Andreescu fell just short in her return to WTA Tour action after falling 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (2) to Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands on Wednesday in first-round action at the Open de Rouen.

The 24-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., made her return at the WTA 250 clay-court event after an absence of nearly six months.

Lamens, ranked No. 69, dominated the first set by converting three of four break points while converting nine of 11 first service points.

Andreescu came back by outscoring Lames 2-1 on breaks in the second set, but the Dutch player came though in the third-set tiebreaker.

Andreescu, a former world No. 4 and the 2019 U.S. Open champion, entered the tournament ranked 130th on the WTA Tour.

Her last match was a straight-set loss to Katie Boulter in the Tokyo quarterfinals in October before she took time off to focus on her health.

Andreescu returned from a nine-month absence due to a back injury at last year's French Open before taking more time off between a first-round exit at the U.S. Open and her two appearances in Japan.

      Former world number three Dominic Thiem has named two
youngsters he ‘love to watch' in men's tennis. The Austrian tennis star surprisingly
decided to retire at the age of 31, largely because he could not reclaim his
form after suffering a serious wrist injury that kept him out of action for
nearly 12 months.  


      Thiem was once regarded as one of the players to take the
reigns from the ‘Big Three' in men's tennis, specially when he lifted the US
Open back in 2020 after beating current world number two Germany's Alexander
Zverev in a five-set thriller with a score of 2–6, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3, 7–6. Thiem's
last appearance was on home soil, where he lost to Luciano Darderi in straight
sets with a score of 7-6, 6-2 in October last year.  


      Thiem has been recently quoted in a repo rt by Tennis.com, where he named two youngsters he loves to watch. The former US Open champion
stated that he loves to watch Brazil's Joao Fonseca and the Czech Republic's Jakub
Mensik and that he could watch them ‘every week'. “Mensik and Fonseca are
amazing,” he said. “I love to watch them. They already made it. There is no
question they are really going to be at the top. I could watch them every week
on the TV, but it's also interesting to watch somebody for the first time,”  


      Both youngsters have produced some incredible performances in recent times. Fonseca, who lifted the ATP Next Gen title last year as well, won
the Argentina Open this year after beating local favourite Francisco Cerundolo
in the final in straight sets with a score of 6-4, 7-6. On the other hand,
Mensik won an even bigger prize after beating Serbia's legendary tennis star
Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets with a score of 7-6, 7-6 to lift
the Miami Open title.

When they go low, Lois goes high!French tennis player Lois Boisson had the perfect response to the viral moment that came out of her first-round win at the WTA 250 Open Rouen Capfinances Metropole on Tuesday, where her opponent, Great Britain's Harriet Dart, openly criticized her hygiene.Boisson, 21, was a 6-0, 6-3 winner over Dart in the first round of the clay-court tournament in France on Wendesday, a result that ordinarily wouldn't be more than a blip on the most fans' radar. But it went viral for all the wrong reasons after it became clear that the Brit made an unkind comment about Boisson mid-match to the chair umpire.“Can you tell her to wear deodorant?” Dart, 28, was heared asking Yamila Halle during a second-set change of ends.

Halle brushed off the comment, and it appeared that Boisson didn't hear the interaction in the moment, either.

Boisson reached a career-high ranking of No. 152 last spring, on the back of three ITF circuit titles and her first WTA 125 title, and looked like the most promising young female talent out of France in recent years. But she tore her ACL in a match just weeks before Roland Garros was set to begin, and the tournament in Rouen is her first since then after nearly a year of rehab and recovery.Boisson is currently ranked No. 303.After the controversy exploded, Dart issued an apology, saying that the remark was a ""heat-of-the-moment comment that I truly regret.""“That's not how I want to carry myself, and I take full responsibility,"" Dart wrote. ""I have a lot of respect for Lois and how she competed today. I'll learn from this and move forward.""It remains to be seen if Dart will be penalized by the WTA for unsportsmanlike conduct.

STUTTGART—It's no secret that Iga Swiatek is the undisputed clay-court master on the women's tour. Similar to her great role model Rafael Nadal, it's the surface she performs best on. She has won the French Open four times since 2020, most recently in 2024, as well as the WTA 1000 in Rome three times and Madrid once.The 23-year-old has celebrated ten of her 22 career titles on clay, including two successes at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, where the winner is also rewarded with a brand new Porsche in addition to the prize money and world ranking points.The first time she won in Stuttgart, Swiatek celebrated her victory with a red Porsche Panamera, but in 2023 she left with a blue Porsche Taycan Turbo. After she was beaten in the semi-finals by Elena Rybakina last year, she now wants to expand her car collection once more.But what has happened to the two luxury cars since then? ‘I drive them all the time,' Swiatek said in an interview with Tennis Channel DE shortly before her start at this year's event. ‘My first car was the Panamera, so it's my favourite. I feel very comfortable in it and just love it.'

Her favourite song at the moment is “Can't stop” by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. She always plays it on her headphones when she's about to enter the match court before a tournament. 'I always start with this song.'

A bitter management shake-up. Angry public outbursts. A “narcissistic” pastor whose word is gospel. What in God's name is happening to the once-mighty pop icon? “Whatever he's going through, I pray for him” a longtime collaborator says.


							By 

	Shirley Halperin



	For the millions around the world wondering what Justin Bieber has been up to these past few years — since music seemingly took a back seat to his life as a full-time husband (he married Hailey Baldwin in 2018) and father (son Jack Blues was born in August) — it may be surprising to learn that the pop sensation did release something new this month.


	On April 3, the 31-year-old revealed his fashion brand, Skylrk, with a video directed by 3D artist Gal Yosef that shows an animated Bieber riding an electric scooter to a house that he then promptly burns. Strewn about inside are relics of his past life, including the smiley face logo of the Drew House clothing line he started in 2019 with former friend Ryan Good (Drew is Bieber's middle name); outside, waiting while the residence goes up in flames, is his wife with a stroller. The two kiss and walk toward the setting sun holding hands, never turning back.

	That Bieber chose a scooter running out of power as a visual element was presumably no coincidence. Scott “Scooter” Braun, the manager who discovered the Canadian talent through a YouTube video in 2008, has been a constant presence in Bieber's life from age 13 through adulthood. During their 15 years together, Bieber launched into the pop stratosphere, becoming one of the most popular artists on the planet, today boasting more than 78 million monthly listeners on Spotify, where 17 of his songs — or songs he's been featured on — have each amassed over a billion streams. Bieber's rise was the stuff of fairy tales. Reality, as it turns out, is a much more complicated story that's rooted in questions of loyalty, wealth and health.Indeed, Bieber has been torching his past in ways that aren't just metaphorical. Professionally, he separated from his longtime team last summer, joining a number of uber-successful musicians who self-manage, like Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars and Morgan Wallen. In taking the lead on his business affairs, the singer has enlisted a tight-knit crew of compatriots who share his resolve to chart a new direction. Many in his inner circle also share his faith, ascribing to the beliefs of Churchome, a nondenominational Christian community with an outpost in Beverly Hills that is run by 44-year-old pastor Judah Smith, who also serves as a spiritual adviser to Bieber.


	In recent months, Bieber has been giving glimpses into his new life on social media, but whereas usually what someone presents on Instagram is the best version of themselves — the most flattering angle, an idyllic backdrop, just the right filter and, of course, the caption conveying a life lived to its fullest — some of Bieber's posts have been more cryptic.

	











	“I think I hate myself sometimes when I feel myself start to become inauthentic. Then I remember we're all being made to think we're not enough but I still hate when I change myself to please people,” Bieber shared with his 294 million Instagram followers on March 22. That same day, he wrote, “I got anger issues, too,” adding that he wanted to “grow and not react so much.”


	In other posts, Bieber shared feeling “unworthy,” like he's “drowning and unsafe.” Further down the scroll are visuals of a hollow-eyed Bieber brazenly smoking a blunt and rapping about getting high. Recent photos of Bieber out and about show him looking gaunt and disappearing into his clothes. Off social media, he's also displayed some questionable behavior. At the Super Bowl, Bieber was seen dancing atop a VIP suite sofa shirtless and barefoot, bewildering nearby spectators. And just last week, Bieber had a testy exchange outside a Palm Springs coffee shop, chastising a group of paparazzi: “All you care about is money, not human beings.”


	For an artist whose music has lived under such hopeful banners as Purpose (the name of his fourth album) and Never Say Never (the title of his Jon Chu-directed 2011 documentary), the contrast was noticeably jarring for fans and casual observers alike (YouTube houses dozens of user-generated “What's Going on With Justin Bieber?” commentary videos). The prevailing sentiment is that he is struggling. (Bieber's reps refute this characterization.)


	Concern for Bieber's well-being turned into a full-on public discourse when, in January, he unfollowed a number of his former friends and associates — including Braun and deputy Allison Kaye (who, after running point on all things Bieber for the better part of two decades, resigned in January), Good (who was the best man at his wedding) and longtime security chief Kenny Hamilton (who shielded him from music industry vultures, bad actors and others, like accused sex trafficker Diddy, according to multiple people present at the time), among others.Now, former friends and ex-associates excised from his world, along with musical collaborators, his record company and, of course, his fans, are coming to terms with a new chapter in the book of Bieber. And some are questioning the choices he's making.

	











	“Whatever he's going through, I pray for him and hope he's OK,” says former Bieber collaborator Poo Bear, who co-wrote some of his biggest hits, including Billboard No. 1s “Despacito,” “I'm the One,” “Where Are Ü Now” and “What Do You Mean?”


	“Seeing him disintegrate like this … it's watching the embodiment of someone not living their purpose,” says one ex team member. “He's lost. There's no one protecting him because there's no one there willing to say no to him. You say no, you get blown out.”


	Mario Lavandeira, better known as Perez Hilton, who has been obsessively following Bieber's every post, posits to The Hollywood Reporter, “Justin Bieber is like a male Britney Spears: He's trolling, partly because he wants attention, and also because he thinks he's so funny.” (In an April 10 Instagram story, Bieber joked of Stevie Wonder, “This fool never sees my FaceTimes.”)


	To that end, a source close to the singer offers that Bieber is just doing as media-savvy pop stars do. “Artists are artists — they don't look at the world the way you and I do,” says the insider, who laughs off the notion that Bieber is in distress. “He's healthier than all of us — physically and mentally.”


	“He's managing himself through his own family office now, and there's skepticism on if he can do it alone,” says Chris Anokute, a veteran music executive who's worked extensively with Katy Perry. “He's leaving home for the first time. He's building a business without the team that took him here. I'm sure he's feeling that pressure. But he can [do it]. At the end of the day, Justin Bieber is a star, and consumers still want Justin Bieber. … He's showing a lot of courage and foresight on what the industry is going to look like in the future.”

	











	***


	Although Bieber long ago shed his teen heartthrob image, trading his staple swoop hair for a buzz cut and covering his body in tattoos, his carefully curated ascent has always given a sense of wholesomeness. Despite his ink, which includes a cross on his chest, an image of Christ on his leg, scriptures on his arm and the name Jesus in Hebrew on his rib cage, he was never a purity ring guy, à la the Jonas Brothers. But starting out at age 15, when legions of very young fans anointed him a role model, Bieber has been leaning into this good-guy ethos, carefully guided by his former management team, led by Braun (who declined to speak for this story), which heavily promoted Bieber's philanthropy as part of his image (via Make-A-Wish, where he's been among the most requested celebrities for many years running, and by donating a dollar of each concert ticket sold to a charity). After all, what kid plucked from obscurity and handed fame and fortune wouldn't feel grateful to those who cheered him on?


	Still, there's a feeling that his former managers may have “protected him too much,” to the detriment of his personal growth as a kid learning from his mistakes, several ex team members share. There had been instances of questionable behavior in the past; in his younger days, Bieber had a number of police altercations, including a 2014 arrest for DUI in Miami and a vandalism charge in Calabasas that same year. But Braun's team was always there to smooth the young star's path, in ways big and small, swooping in to delete embarrassing tweets and videos when necessary.“He never felt the consequence of his actions because we were so worried about the illusion of Justin Bieber being ruined,” offers an insider. “It wouldn't have ended his career. He would have felt the sting, though.”


	In their efforts to keep the artist happy, there was finger-pointing when things didn't go Bieber's way, sources reveal, especially concerning matters like budgets. Discussions about complicated music matters like song splits or creative decisions on ancillary projects could get tense, and Bieber, says a confidant, “doesn't like conflict or drama.” At the same time, Bieber wants to give of himself. “Justin is an exceptionally generous person,” adds the insider. “He doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings or get into arguments.” In fact, Bieber long ago instituted a team-wide directive: No talk of business after 6 p.m.

	











	Running the show as of fall 2022 is Will Bracey, a former tour manager for Fifth Harmony whose title is Chief Operating Officer at “The Office of Mr. Justin Bieber,” according to his email signature. The press-averse Bracey, who declined to speak for this article, is described as a sort of consigliere to Bieber by several people who've interacted with him. “He's running the logistics and operations in service of the family,” says one source, who distinguishes Bracey as “operating at a very high level” but also describes him as not a typical music biz bro. Adds the insider: “He's diligent and hardworking. He cares about Justin as a person.”


	Another describes Bracey, who is engaged to Fifth Harmony alum Ally Brooke, as “obsessive” about Bieber. “He's protective of people knowing about his closeness with Justin, but then he's always talking about Justin and about ‘being at his service,' ” adds the source.


	Bracey worked under Braun on Bieber's ill-fated Justice world tour in 2022, which was plagued from the get-go. The pandemic delayed its start by nearly two years, and four months after it finally kicked off in February, Bieber was diagnosed with a rare facial paralysis disease called Type 2 Ramsay Hunt syndrome and had to take several weeks off. By September, after completing around 45 concert dates, he pulled the plug on the rest of the Justice outing — a year's worth of shows in the Far East, South America, Australasia, the Middle East and Europe.

	











	Sources say that his management — Braun and Kaye at the time — advised against canceling, noting that the tour's routing, which was designed to include off days and buffers like weeklong breaks (during which the Biebers could work in luxe vacations), was the lightest lift possible. But Bieber wanted to get off the road to be with Hailey, according to people privy to his decision-making at the time. That meant forgoing the estimated $90 million he would have netted from the tour and laying off more than 100 crewmembers (many still recovering from the work stoppage of COVID). God's got his back, Bieber intimated of his decision, say multiple people involved with the tour. “Can't argue with God,” his handlers conceded.


	In September 2022, Bieber announced: “This past weekend, I … gave everything I have to the people in Brazil. After getting off the stage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I'm going to take a break from touring for the time being. I'm going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better.”


	The decision to “pull down” the remaining Justice dates brought Bieber's mental health to the forefront. Though his struggles with substance abuse (from which he recovered) were well documented — revealed in painful detail via Bieber's 2020 10-part YouTube Originals docuseries, Seasons — the public pronouncement of exhaustion had fans expressing worry and the industry wondering whether he's fit for the grueling demands of touring.

	











	The Justice cancellation also triggered a series of financial consequences that are still plaguing the artist today. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, he was left owing a large debt to AEG (insiders claim more than $20 million). According to sources, then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. To date, Bieber has only returned a portion of what he borrowed.


	While one might think that Bieber, who sat at the top of the pop heap for the better part of the 2010s, would be flush with cash, multiple insiders, who until recently were familiar with his finances, suggest he's overstretched — real estate purchases and renovations (he owns six homes, including a $26 million estate in Beverly Hills' exclusive Beverly Park neighborhood, a $16 million home in La Quinta, and a property in the tony Gozzer Ranch Golf and Lake Club in Idaho, where the Kardashian-Jenners are known to holiday) and destination vacations with friends are particularly taxing — even on the heels of a $200 million deal for the publishing rights to his catalog, executed in January 2023.


	(Bieber's reps vigorously deny the assertion, telling THR, “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.”)

	











	The sale of some 290 songs, his entire pre-2021 catalog, to Hipgnosis Songs — among them Bieber's portion of writing credits on “Sorry,” “Holy” and “Ghost” — was seen as a major win for an artist who was only 29 at the time. That is especially true given that Bieber has relied on collaborators for his biggest hits, splitting rights with as many as 11 people on 2021's “Peaches” (which also holds the distinction of setting a Grammy record for the most songwriters on a song of the year nomination).


	Though his publishing share was enough to draw a steady stream of “mailbox money,” as royalties are known colloquially — to the tune of millions in annual earnings — sources say Bieber was keen on selling, trading those regular payments for a lump sum. The publishing assets were appraised at a value of $140 million at the time, but Bieber's team, which then included Braun, attorney Michael Rhodes and business manager Lou Taylor, was able to get the price up by $60 million. The deal was geared toward putting Bieber in a position of financial security that would last him for quite some time — one person describes it as “the largest nest egg in music history” for what is ostensibly fractions of a song — and it may be one of the last catalog sales to command a price north of $200 million. Late rapper Biggie Smalls' songs, which include some of the most sampled beats and melodies in hip-hop, went for half that amount when Primary Wave purchased his publishing and publicity rights in March.


	Before the catalog gold rush, which opened the door to monster deals like Bruce Springsteen's $500 million sale of his recordings and publishing to Sony Music in 2021, “these asset sales were normally distressed sellers — people that had tax problems, divorces, or got to a point in their age where their health was failing them and limiting other income streams such as live [shows],” explains Hipgnosis founder Merck Mercuriadis, who helped propel the “song management” market and worked on the Bieber deal. “Making millions of dollars a year versus somewhere around 15 times that amount up front is not the same freedom. With the money up front, you're free to plan in a way where you don't have to be beholden to anyone else. You don't necessarily have to go on tour or make another record, if that's not how you want to spend the next few years. You can then afford to take some risks on yourself. … For Justin, I think that was the motivation: He had ill health and was at a time in his life where he was married and very in love and contemplating family. Making the deal gave him the freedom to focus on that and not have to be on the treadmill he'd been on for almost 15 years.”

	











	“I think it was smart,” says Anokute of the sale, which valued Bieber's share of each song at around $600,000. “With AI, I don't know what the value of a catalog will be in the future. Anyone frowning at making a quarter-billion dollars on music that you made before the age of 30 is a fool. He sold that music, and he has another 10 to 20 years ahead of him where he could own everything.”


	(It's worth noting that Hailey Bieber is herself a successful model and entrepreneur who launched her own skin-care line, Rhode — her middle name — in 2022, and is reportedly exploring a sale.)

	











	Smart or not, the deal also opened a rift between Bieber and Braun, with the former said to be resentful of the latter's ballooning wealth. In fact, the tension had been building for some time.


	Although widely credited with launching Bieber's career as a teen phenom (with the backing of Usher), Braun's Svengali-like guidance drew some ire from the general public, and even more so in recent years as struggles unique to child stars have been exposed in the media. Bieber himself made reference to the pressures on young performers in a teary interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe in 2020. Speaking of Billie Eilish, who was then 18, Bieber said, “I just want to protect her,” adding, “It was hard for me being that young and being in the industry and not knowing where to turn, and everyone telling me they loved me, and turning their back on you in a second.”

	











	There's little doubt that Braun is a savvy mogul. He was an early investor in Spotify, Uber and Waze, all the while guiding the careers of artists across the musical spectrum, from Ariana Grande to J Balvin to Demi Lovato. But with Bieber, Braun accomplished something truly rare in the music industry: growing a pop career into adulthood with a string of hit singles, two documentaries and 23 Grammy nominations (and two wins). Today, Bieber ranks among the five most-followed celebrities in social media (alongside Swift, Grande and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez).


	But as Braun's own stature in the entertainment industry was rising, with TV and film projects added to his portfolio (as an executive producer on the hit series Dave and the Balvin documentary The Boy From Medellín, and a partner with Marvel founding chairman David Maisel in Mythos Studios), he's also stumbled into some PR snafus of his own, like his feud with Swift over the ownership of her catalog, which Braun's Ithaca Holdings purchased in 2019 in a deal for Swift's Nashville-based label, Big Machine, for a reported $300 million. In the minds of millions of Swifties, Braun was the greedy bad guy who had “bullied” the singer out of the chance of owning her own music.


	(Both parties ultimately came out ahead. A year and change after purchasing the Swift catalog, Braun sold those rights to a private equity firm for a reported $405 million, a profit of over $250 million. For her part, Swift resolved — and delivered— to rerecord and re-release her earlier albums with the amended title “Taylor's Version.” Her reenergized base prompted monster streaming numbers on the rerecords, which fed appetite for new material and launched the record-shattering Eras tour.)


	The succession of prescient and profitable moves brought Braun to the attention of South Korean entertainment giant Hybe, which in 2021 acquired Ithaca Holdings in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. As part of the sale, longtime staffers were given a total of $50 million in stock from Braun's personal stake. Bieber and Grande were each gifted $10 million, per public filings. Bieber's contract with Braun would now move over to Hybe America, for which Braun serves as CEO.

	











	In June 2024, Braun announced that he was leaving artist management, writing of Bieber and Grande: “To see them both come up to be the legends they are today will forever be one of my greatest honors. As we change our working relationships now, I will continue to root for them with the same passion that I did at each of their humble beginnings.” But Braun is still bearing the brunt of criticism for participating in contracts that the public perceives as taking advantage of young artists — specifically in the realm of rights and ownership. 


	“It's easy to villainize Scooter,” says one high-ranking music executive familiar with all the parties, reasoning that Braun was already viewed negatively due to the dust-up with Swift. “He's not Lou Pearlman; he's the modern-day David Geffen. No trickery or shenanigans. You could make a plan and get things done with Scooter. And you could always make money with him.” Another longtime Braun associate echoes that view: “Actions speak louder than words, and Scooter put his money where his mouth is. He built a profitable business and made [Justin] a billion dollars.”


	***

	











	One figure who has seemingly benefited from an association with Bieber, and remained in the star's inner orbit, is his longtime pastor Judah Smith. He's seen his Churchome community grow steadily in the past decade, now reportedly drawing more than 10,000 parishioners weekly, among its five locations. Its Beverly Hills visitors have included Kourtney Kardashian, Ciara and Russell Wilson.


	Bieber regularly attends Churchome sermons on Zoom, in addition to appearing in person with Hailey. In 2019, he helped lead a service, noting in a clip leaked to TMZ that he hadn't done so before because “I didn't want people to think this was a show.”


	“He's got the biggest heart in the whole world, he forgives very easily, [and] he believes the best very readily,” the pastor once told The Daily Beast of his star disciple. “[We] talk all the time and pray a lot and think a lot together.” (The pair also have gotten matching tattoos together while on tour.)


	“Judah and his wife are great people,” says one congregant of Churchome, which is relatively permissive in its social ethos along the evangelical continuum, preferring hopeful messaging about scripture to Jim Bakker-like fearmongering. This accepting ideology is attractive to parishioners in its big, coastal cities with more liberal social views and values.

	











	Smith has pursued his own Hollywood projects. In 2017, Amazon reportedly shot an unaired talk show pilot, produced by Management 360's production arm, which would have seen him in conversation with famous figures about life's biggest questions. He incorporated a new entity, Pitiful Palace, in March 2024, which according to public records intends to focus on faith-based multimedia entertainment.


	Both Bieber and Smith, who sits on the board of one of the singer's companies, were longtime clients at Lou Taylor's business management firm Tri Star. They both appear to have left in spring 2024, shortly after Tri Star — which had already been embroiled in Britney Spears' conservatorship dispute — began to publicly figure into Diddy's legal saga. Taylor, herself the wife of a pastor, also exited the Churchome board. (She declined to comment.)


	As an adviser on records or tours, Smith obviously has none of Braun's chops, but the two men do share some common traits. Both are deeply committed to their respective faiths (Braun, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, is Jewish and helped bring the Nova Music Festival exhibit, honoring the hundreds killed by terrorists in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, to the U.S.); charismatic in private meetings and public speaking engagements; and each has an intuition for popular culture. But where one is fluent in the language of entertainment, the other now seated at the table is a novice in an industry that's fraught with shady practices and constant change.


	“You have a narcissistic pastor egging on a narcissistic artist, both fueled by Jesus, running around trying to do business,” says someone familiar with Smith and Bieber. Another affirms the tremendous sway and influence Smith has over Bieber when it comes to major career and life decisions.

	











	***


	And when the business is music, things get even more complicated. The industry is built on supporting album cycles — it may take a year to record and produce an hour's worth of songs, during which time the team is planning a tour, branding deals, merchandise and all manner of creative related to the project. That means working at least two years out on a global plan and committing the artist for two years post-release.


	In Bieber's case, the absence of an album cycle makes tapping large sums of money more challenging. And since Bieber sold off his publishing, smart financial planning is key to this new phase, when automatically generated income is diminished.


	Bieber's first record deal with Raymond Braun Music Group (RBMG), signed in 2008 and likely renegotiated, entitled the company then jointly owned by Braun and Usher (the latter sold his interest in RBMG in 2022 for an estimated $40 million) to share in the profits of Bieber's album and song streams and additional revenue sources related to the recordings. In 2020, Bieber's RBMG contract came to an end and he signed a new recording deal, where he and Braun partnered on a label (of which Bieber is a majority shareholder) that calls for four more albums via label partner Def Jam Records (a subsidiary of Universal Music Group), but since 2021's Justice, Bieber has only released guest appearances on tracks by Don Toliver and SZA.

	











	Insiders assert that Tunji Balogun, who joined Def Jam as CEO in 2022 after a decade at RCA Records working with the likes of Bryson Tiller, Childish Gambino, Khalid and Wizkid, doesn't have a relationship with Bieber, and his efforts go only so far. (Universal Music Group did not respond to requests for comment.)


	“He'll release music when he feels comfortable,” says a confidant of Bieber. Meanwhile, Bieber has been hosting “jam sessions” at his house where attendees have included his longtime DJ Tay James, musical director HARV, SZA collaborator Carter Lang and Australian artist Eddie Benjamin (whose song “Maniac” soundtracks the Skylrk visual).


	Staffers at Universal Music universally agree: They would love to have a new Bieber album, as the demand for Bieber's return remains strong. But things may be complicated for the label “until Justin and Scooter sort out their issues,” says one company insider.


	Often, when a manager and a longtime client break, there's a “sunset” period in which commissions are still being collected on deals negotiated prior to the split. Such extrication from a years-long relationship can be awkward, and in the case of Bieber and Braun, it most certainly is. According to multiple players, Bieber is pushing to renegotiate his recording contract in order to lessen Braun's share in his future music. So far, they remain at an impasse.

	











	“There's a hole right now,” says Anokute. “A lot of the leading artists are female … and the male artists aren't your traditional pop stars: It's Benson Boone, Teddy Swims, Shaboozey. The marketplace is in desperate need of the music Justin Bieber has given us over the years. We're welcoming him in with open arms.”


	Indeed, a music agent familiar with the numbers says Bieber is “still demanding seven to eight figures” but doesn't see him touring anytime soon. “An occasional pop-up show, maybe,” the agent hints.


	So where does this leave Justin Bieber? Is he satisfied with the life-work balance he's chosen? What will it take to come back, and will the fans, now also in their 30s, show up? “He's meant to be onstage,” says a former adviser. “Like his brain needs that dopamine release and he's not getting it. But at what point does it become Timberlake? No one wants to see a bunch of 30-year-olds out there dancing. It becomes nostalgic.”


	His current team is of another mind, and while no one from the “Bieber Family Office” would speak on the record, the sentiment seems to be, hasn't he given enough?

	











	Anokute concurs: ”He's been a winner for 16 years. Everyone goes through stuff; people have struggles financially, relationship problems. Do you know what it's like to be a man at 30? To be a father? He's living his life. Let him evolve. Let him grow. He's gone through the fire and this is a phoenix moment for him. He's going to rise.”

The horror-thriller series, based on a cult manga and starring Yuya Yagira and Show Kasamatsu, has become Disney's most successful streaming series in Japan to date. 


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	The hit horror-thriller series Gannibal, which centers on a remote village's secret tradition of eating children alive, was always an unlikely choice as Disney‘s first big-budget, live-action streaming series produced in Japan, a country with deep ties to the House of Mouse's classic, family-friendly brand. Production of the show's first two seasons also ran over schedule and over budget — but Disney's big bet on the series appears to be paying off.


Gannibal has become Disney+'s most-viewed title in Japan since the launch of its second season on March 19, and it surpassed 1 million hours streamed within just nine days of release, a new record for the service in the country (in the U.S., Gannibal streams exclusively on Hulu).

	“To be fully transparent, it did take us by surprise when this IP was first offered to us,” says Gaku Narita, Disney's executive director of original content in Japan. “On the surface, it's a very horrific story, and we initially had our doubts — until we started reading the source material, and then we couldn't put it down.”


Gannibal is based on a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masaaki Ninomiya that ran from 2018 to 2021. The title is well known in Japan, but it has more of a cult following than the country's blockbuster manga hits like YuYu Hakusho or City Hunter, both adapted into live-action spectacles by Netflix last year.


Gannibal follows Daigo Agawa (played by Yuya Yagira, who won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor award in 2004 when he was just 12 years old for Hirokazu Kore-eda's Nobody Knows), a young investigator reassigned from the city to serve as the sole police officer in Kuge, a small traditional village deep in the Japanese hinterland. Soon after Daigo's arrival, with his wife and young daughter in tow, he learns that the village's previous police officer mysteriously went missing. The local villagers are unpredictable to Daigo and his family, making welcoming gestures one day and then bristling with annoyance the next, coming up with vague pretexts for how the family has offended the community's traditions with their big-city ways. When a corpse turns up in the nearby forest — ostensibly the victim of a bear attack — Daigo is brought into contact with the Goto family, Kuge's most powerful and brutish clan, which boasts a lineage stretching back hundreds of years into the region's past. Gradually, Daigo comes to learn of a superstitious folk tradition the Gotos have secretly kept alive into the present day — the sacrificial eating of a young child during the village's annual traditional summer festival.

	











	Much of the suspense of Gannibal‘s first season stemmed from Daigo's cat-and-mouse game with the Gotos as he struggled to come to grips with their cultish practices and ascertain how much — if not all — of the village was involved. The second season goes deeper in exploring how the Gotos' cannibalistic tradition came to be and the impossible compromises the family's young patriarch, Keisuke Goto (played by Show Kasamatsu, the breakout Japanese lead of Max's Tokyo Vice), has made to keep his family's twisted traditions alive. For a show with such a ghoulish premise, the sense of mystery is sustained improbably long, and the character development goes impressively deep, resulting in an understanding of Keisuke Goto's predicament, if not empathy for his horrific actions.


	“What drew us into the project was the universal theme about family,” explains Narita. “The word we kept coming back to when discussing the essence of the show was ‘protect.' It's about protecting your family, of course, but also your values and your way of life. There were a lot of universal themes lying latent inside the material.”


	Narita adds: “In a tumultuous world, where people are feeling divided and insecure for all kinds of reasons, we thought this theme would resonate — in Japan and overseas.”


Gannibal‘s core creative team is made up of rising young Japanese talent excited to break out of the quick, low-production-value mode of series creation common to the Japanese TV industry of the past several decades. Takamasa Oe, who was co-nominated with Ryusuke Hamaguchi for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2022 for Drive My Car, wrote all of Gannibal‘s adapted scripts. Producer Teruhisa Yamamoto, also Oscar-nominated for Drive My Car, is the show's lead producer, while rising talent Shinzô Katayama directs nearly all of the episodes (Katayama apprenticed as an assistant director under Korea's Bong Joon-ho early in his career, and he's currently shooting The Human Vapor, Netflix's biggest Japanese series project for 2026).

	











	For each of Gannibal‘s seasons, Yamamoto estimates that Disney spent about three times the typical cost of a single season of live-action Japanese TV. Each season also took about six months to shoot — twice the norm in Japan. It all shows up on the screen, with many local fans now raving that the series has set a new high watermark for TV production quality in the country. 


	“We surrounded Katayama with craftspeople and production personnel from the world of Japanese cinema, rather than TV because we wanted the series to have a movie-level production quality,” Yamamoto says. “That's something very different for Japan.”


	He adds that over 90 percent of the show was also shot on location. The location shoots spanned Japan's Hyogo, Aichi, and Nagano prefectures, giving Gannibal a feeling of grounded realism despite its more fantastical elements.


	Katayama, whose versatile directorial work is a consistent standout of the show, says his priority for Gannibal‘s second season was to up the action as Daigo's relationship with the Gotos transitions from intrigue to violent confrontation.


	“I really thought a lot about how I could make this season really fun to watch,” Katayama says. “For example, there's a lot more gun action, and in the series finale, there are some high-speed sequences that we used a lot of challenging techniques to achieve.”


	Katayama says he suspects part of Gannibal‘s broad appeal in Japan comes from the way it uses an extreme premise to tap into common anxieties about the need for generational social change in the country. 

	











	“For centuries, the older generation of Kuge, this very isolated village, has been carrying out this tradition that the younger generation knows is very wrong and needs to be corrected,” Katayama explains. “I think the current younger generation in Japan often faces similar problems, where they are struggling with both respect for tradition and how to change the customs or bad habits of the older generation that need correcting.” 


	He adds: “I thought about this theme a lot while shooting the show, and I think that's how the audience is able to empathize with Keisuke in a sense.”


	The second season of Gannibal ends where the story of Ninomiya's original manga series concludes. The show's creative team says they've begun discussing potential ideas to broaden the story but won't proceed unless they get the author's — and Disney's — blessing.


	“The story of Daigo and Keisuke comes to an end,” explains Oe. “When we talk about a possible next season, we have some ideas and feelings for new angles that we like for what could come next, but we would have to discuss all of that with Ninomiya, and we wouldn't go forward without him.”


	Yamamoto notes how momentum has been building across Japan's content sector in recent years — the ever-growing global popularity of anime, the Oscars success of Drive My Car and Godzilla Minus One, and the smash-hit samurai series Shogun, which was produced by FX but starred a mostly Japanese cast.


	The domestic Japanese TV industry is still adjusting to the recent incursions and investments of Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon's Prime Video, which have begun to shake up the tired production models of the country's insular traditional broadcasters.

	











	“The premium streaming series is still something new here, and we're all trying to figure out what budget and approach is suitable for this new era,” Yamamoto explains. “No one knows the answer to that question yet, so for Gannibal, we just pursued quality as much as possible.”


	He adds: “This is a critical time for our industry. We want the world to notice us — and to know that they can rely on us to create great live-action TV shows, too.”

The filmmaker said she never intended ""to be embraced by Wall Street bros"" as Christian Bale's ""very clearly making fun of them.""


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


American Psycho director Mary Harron said she's “mystified” by the way the 2000 film has been “embraced by Wall Street bros.”


	The filmmaker recently chatted with Letterboxd Journal about the “sigma male” social media phenomenon and how some men have grown to look at Christian Bale‘s Patrick Bateman as a role model.




	“I'm always so mystified by it,” Harron said. “I don't think that Guinevere [Turner, American Psycho writer-actress] and I ever expected it to be embraced by Wall Street bros, at all. That was not our intention. So, did we fail? I'm not sure why [it happened], because Christian's very clearly making fun of them… But, people read the Bible and decide that they should go and kill a lot of people. People read The Catcher in the Rye and decide to shoot the president.”

	However, The Notorious Bettie Page director added that “Wall Street bros” actually missed the overall point of the film, which follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York City investment banking executive who hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.


	“It was very clear to me and Guinevere, who is gay, that we saw it as a gay man's satire on masculinity,” Harron explained. “[American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis'] being gay allowed him to see the homoerotic rituals among these alpha males, which is also true in sports, and it's true in Wall Street, and all these things where men are prizing their extreme competition and their ‘elevating their prowess' kind of thing. There's something very, very gay about the way they're fetishizing looks, and the gym.”


	In Ellis' novel, Patrick Bateman also idolizes Donald Trump, who is currently serving his second term as the U.S. president. While American Psycho is set during the Reagan era in the '80s, when the AIDS Epidemic hit the LGBTQ community, the filmmaker was taken aback at how the story has aged over time, as transgender rights are now under attack by the Trump administration.


	“It was about a predatory society, and now the society is actually, 25 years later, much worse. The rich are much richer, the poor are poorer,” she said. “I would never have imagined that there would be a celebration of racism and white supremacy, which is basically what we have in the White House. I would never have imagined that we would live through that.”

	











	As American Psycho celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, Luca Guadagnino is set to helm a new film adaptation for Lionsgate.

Fronting her first series since '30 Rock,' 'The Four Seasons' creator and star opens up about loss, that Lorne comment and why she's ignoring the impulse to hide and retire: ""I'm always out here hustling.""


							By 

	Mikey O'Connell


TV Features Editor


Tina Fey is wearing a matching pajama set, perched on the edge of an oversized chair and discussing her tenure as a receptionist at the Evanston, Illinois, YMCA in the early '90s. The men were gross, the commute from Chicago was long, but it paid for her Second City improv classes. 


	This intimate scene plays out onstage for 5,000 people. It's the audience Q&A closer during a Detroit stop on Fey and Amy Poehler's Restless Leg Tour, where one attendee even asks the women, without any context, whether she should quit her job. (The answer is yes.) The two finish each show like this. They tailored the 90-minute set to their preferred wardrobes and bedtimes as much as their devoted fans' tastes. Fey and Poehler can make it back to their respective hotel rooms and into their real PJs by 10 o'clock.

	Later, Fey tells me about how things went the last time she tried to stay out long past midnight. It was February's Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary. One of the most successful and recognizable figures to graduate from Studio 8H, Fey returned as a staff writer for the NBC special. And she intended to celebrate. “I've never been able to get over the fact that I left the 40th afterparty before Prince's surprise set,” she says. “So the whole week leading up to the 50th, I drank water, I went to bed early, I saved it all up. But when I got to the afterparty, I couldn't find any of my friends, and obviously there was no chance of Prince, so I thought, ‘Actually, I'm out.' “


	The parties are never what she remembers, anyway. It's the planning, the problem-solving and the thrilling surrender to a finished product — of which there've been many. Over the quarter century since Fey broke out as an SNL wunderkind, the 54-year-old created and starred in 30 Rock, produced six other TV series, starred in more than a dozen films and wrote Mean Girls. She then made Mean Girls­ — more of a pop culture institution than a movie — into a 2018 Broadway musical with her composer husband, Jeff Richmond, and in turn adapted that into a movie musical. 


	And there are her collaborations with Poehler, this latest one a comedic homage to their 30-year friendship. Most material gets recycled from city to city, except for a segment that puts them back at the “Weekend Update” anchor desk they shared at SNL. During the first of two Detroit shows in April, 15 minutes of fresh material includes a joke about Elon Musk while an image of a burning Tesla projects behind them. The sold-out crowd, most of them white women and one of them my mother, scream-laughs in approval. 

	











	“Cranking these things out is not easy — they're true labors,” says Poehler. “Yet no one is happier to get it right than Tina. When she comes up with a good idea, a good joke or some new take, she still gets delighted.” 


	Her newest take is on middle age. Fey and fellow 30 Rock writers Tracey Wigfield and Lang Fisher have adapted The Four Seasons, Alan Alda's 1981 comedy about boomers navigating midlife crises, as a Netflix series out May 1. She stars alongside Steve Carell, Colman Domingo and Will Forte, marking her first regular on-camera TV role since 30 Rock wrapped in 2013. But over a few hours and many cups of coffee — discussing her evolving work-life balance, the pains of making the second Mean Girls movie and her “irreplaceable” mentor, Lorne Michaels — the multihyphenate almost exclusively refers to herself as a writer. She takes multiple detours into astrology and the Enneagram along the way, as well.


	“While we're on nonsense,” says Fey, “there's all that talk about love languages. I give acts of service. If I like you, my way of showing that is to be like, ‘I wrote this for you.' I try to help you fix the thing you're doing. And if I don't like you, I'm going to write you something so good that you're going to be ashamed. Either way, I'm always out here hustling.”


	***

	











	Fey does not show up in a black car to the French café. It's a rainy April morning in the Paris of the Midwest, and she arrives on foot. She sports a baseball cap embroidered with her production company's logo: a doodle of firstborn Alice, then a toddler, dressed as the NBC peacock for Halloween. Alice turned 19 in September. Now it's just Fey, Richmond and their youngest, 13-year-old Penelope, at home.


	Her presence is more obvious as soon as she pulls off her cap. Garnier kept that mane under contract for a reason. Still, she is only approached once. Mike Duggan, the mayor of Detroit, happens to be holding court in a nearby booth. He thanks her for putting the city on the tour itinerary before asking for a photo. Fey slips into her well-worn self-deprecation, talking her way out of a selfie by explaining that she's not wearing makeup. This is half true.


	“He seems very nice,” she says, voice lowered as she departs the mayor's table, “but I do not know that man's politics.” (Duggan, long a moderate Democrat, very controversially announced in December that he would run as an independent in the 2026 Michigan gubernatorial race.)


	She says she's not as reserved as she once was, but she's clearly still skilled at vetting people. “Tina, like my husband, is a Taurus,” says Domingo, who didn't know Fey personally before he boarded The Four Seasons. “When you first meet her, I wouldn't say she's guarded, but she's assessing. She sizes you up, figures out her way in. The moment it clicks, she's affectionate and warm and funny. I think I got there faster because I'm from Philadelphia.” 

	











	Fey, who grew up just outside Philly in Upper Darby, says she's learned to expedite this assessment period. 


	“Parenthood makes you push through because you have to demonstrate for your kids how not to be shy, so I'm better than I used to be,” says Fey. “Steve Carell and I made a whole movie together without ever breaking through to the other side because we're both very shy,” she segues, referring to the 2009 two-hander Date Night. “Without anyone to make us talk, he and I would both sit in polite silence. After working with this big group, I feel like Steve and I are actually all-the-way friends now.”


	Early in her career, Fey was frequently dubbed a workaholic. It's an exhaustively overused label but perhaps a fitting description for anyone with the capacity to write, produce and star in 138 episodes of a sitcom. It does not hold for somebody who actively seeks out time to improve her watercolor portraiture and cooking skills, two of Fey's joys. She'll watch every chickpea recipe on TikTok. That's the only social media platform where she lurks these days, having deleted a burner Instagram after she found it made her dislike some of the people she knew in real life. (No, she won't name names.) She's trying to read one book a month and jokes that having a daughter in middle school is the only thing keeping her from crafting full time. She suspects she and her husband are New York City lifers, even if, come summer, her personality is Fire Island. “The dumpy side,” she clarifies, “not the business side with the boys.”

	











	There are plenty of jobs she wants to take, mostly making work with friends. She and longtime collaborators Robert Carlock and Sam Means just filmed an NBC pilot for 30 Rock pal Tracy Morgan. He has his colorful reputation, most recently prompting a 10-minute delay at a Knicks game after vomiting on the Madison Square Garden court. But Morgan's a Fey loyalist, and she didn't have to put up with him regularly threatening to quit 30 Rock as she did with co-star Alec Baldwin. “If you go to Knicks games 300 days a year, one of those days, you've got to be sick,” says Fey, assuring me Morgan recovered from his food poisoning in time for the shoot. “It could happen to any of us, but it did happen to Tracy.”


	There are also plenty of jobs Fey doesn't want to take: hosting another awards show, for example. “Nikki Glaser killed it at the Globes, and she should keep that job forever,” Fey says of the event she and Poehler emceed four times. “Me? No. I shouldn't say never, but it's such a high risk for such low reward.”

	











	How she spends her time is more important to her than ever. One Restless Leg act finds Fey delivering a PowerPoint-style recap of her and Poehler's post-SNL lives, and it's not all funny. She talks about being left unmoored by the 2015 loss of her father, Don Fey, a man she lionized with an essay in her 2011 memoir, Bossypants. Her mother, Jeanne, spent her last years sharing Fey and Richmond's Upper West Side apartment before her 2024 death. 


	“This sandwich generation stuff, having your kids and an aging parent in the same house, it's wonderful … but it also really takes a lot out of you,” says Fey. “My mom passed away in the summer, my older daughter went to college in August and my husband [Richmond is also a producer and director] and I went to work on The Four Seasons in the fall. That kept me in the world. It saved me from just shrinking up like a little granny apple head.” 

	











	Like much of what warrants a green light in Hollywood, The Four Seasons is an update on established intellectual property. Sources say Netflix beat out Apple and Amazon for the project. Whether that title is enough to goose subscriber interest is unclear. Neither Lang nor Wigfield had seen the film before Fey coaxed them into watching. A digital ghost, it is not presently available on any streaming platform, even for purchase or rental. The lone video store in Los Angeles that has a copy only carries it on Blu-ray, not DVD. To watch it before meeting with Fey, I resorted to texting a film editor friend — film editors can find anything — to track down a bootleg torrent.


	“Now you have to give me $20,” Fey scolds. “I'll get it to Alan.” 


	When the film was released, seeing her favorite comic actors (Alda and Carol Burnett) play a married couple blew a tween Fey's mind, even if some of the themes were over her head. Alda blessed the remake, is a credited producer and makes a cameo in one episode. Like his film, the series follows three couples — Fey and Forte, Carell and Kerri Kenney-Silver, Domingo and Italian playwright-actor Marco Calvani — over quarterly vacations as their dynamic is upended when one of the men leaves his wife and starts bringing a younger woman (Erika Henningsen). Aging, parenting adult children, long-term monogamy and stresses on old friendships are examined over lengthy dinner-table scenes. It's a comedy where shit gets real. In short: timely for Fey.


	“When I was younger and anybody said you've got to have some heart in a script, I'd always go, ‘Fuck heart! This is comedy!' ” says Forte, who worked with Fey at SNL and 30 Rock. “The further you get into this work, the more you realize that the heart stuff is what makes people want to watch this stuff. And Tina can crystallize those things, especially with dialogue, in a way that I've never been able to find.”

	











	This is not the joke-joke-joke style of writing that people may expect from her, but Fey's sensibility is no less apparent. “Very early in writing the first Mean Girls movie, I told Lorne, ‘It's going to be about relational aggression among girls,' ” she says. “He was like, ‘Right, right, but they can have nice outfits and cool cars, too.' I've learned that you can make your thing as smart or true as you want and still try to make it commercial.”


	***


	Michaels and Fey are very close. She's not the only former staffer to have such a rapport with her old boss, but it is a rarefied class. She's worked for Universal TV, alongside Michaels, since she moved from Chicago to join his NBC sketch show in 1997. And with speculation about who might take the 80-year-old's job upon his departure from SNL an intramural sport among the entertainment media — often fueled by Michaels himself — Fey's name has long been in the mix.


	Then Michaels walked the red carpet at the delayed 2023 Emmys, the one that happened in January 2024. A reporter floated the possibility of Fey as a successor to the man himself. He responded by saying she “could easily” do the job. Hundreds of publications picked up the comment, many interpreting his two words as an endorsement.

	











	Michaels soon reversed course on retirement talk. He says he has no plans to leave anytime soon. But that doesn't make the subject any less the third rail for nearly everybody in the SNL orbit. I broach the Fey “could easily” remark with Poehler, and she very politely shuts me down. “Me on that would be so clickbaity,” she says. “I will say that I feel like there are very few things that Tina wouldn't do well in this world.”


	Adds Fey of Michaels' comment, “It was nice of him to say that, and I love him very much.” She has no response to the suggestion of ever taking the job herself. “He's irreplaceable,” she says. “His set of gifts and skills are entirely unique. His eye for talent! He's one of the last three people in show business who actually understand everything. I'll leave it at that.”


	Fey has sought Michaels' advice throughout her career. Jon Hamm credits the pair with helping the Mad Men star not get stuck playing Don Draper types before either really knew him. “After I hosted SNL the first time, Tina called Lorne and was like, ‘Is this guy even funny?' ” says Hamm, who now counts Fey among his closest friends in the business. Michaels confirmed, and Fey put Hamm on 30 Rock: “My work on that show, which got more and more ridiculous, showed everyone that I was down to clown — that I was looking for funny projects.”

	











	She now leans on Michaels for the big stuff when she finds herself at an impasse. Fey credits him with helping her make the movie musical of Mean Girls a reality, a process she does not describe as easy. “[Paramount] kept moving the line of what it would take to get it made; you would've thought this wasn't a piece of IP that they knew about,” she says of the 2024 release that grossed $104 million on a $36 million budget. “If I was boots on the ground, Lorne was the general. He was helping me say, ‘Yes, for sure,' to the studio and then figure out how to still get everything done.” 


	Fey is an achiever, a fact that was pseudoscientifically confirmed during a 2022 girls trip. She was vacationing with former SNL colleagues Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Emily Spivey — “That's the core, the group chat,” says Fey — in upstate New York. Poehler had taken an interest in the Enneagram, a personality classification system that places individuals into one of nine interconnected categories, so she hired an expert to test and analyze each of the women's responses. (Hardly new, the Enneagram seems to be having a moment — Mike White was having his entire White Lotus cast take the test as well.)

	











	Fey got No. 3, The Achiever, described by the Enneagram Institute as “ambitious, competent and energetic, they can also be status conscious and highly driven for advancement.” She kind of buys it, more than astrology anyway. At least this is based on a questionnaire, she says. And it does align with her priorities, even if the achievements aren't necessarily her own. 


	“The impulse to hide and retire is very strong because I do think it's time to help new voices get in the mix,” she says. “It's something I'm already doing, but I want to do more. Even on the walk over here I was like, ‘I am so tired of hearing from me. Surely everyone else is tired of hearing from the same people over and over again.' “


	***


	At Restless Leg's pajama-clad conclusion, Fey lingers on her old YMCA gig a little longer. No, she did not particularly enjoy it, answering the audience member's question, but she is tickled to recall the mix of overprotective North Shore mothers and eccentric old men who'd pass through the lobby. “Why have I never made that into a multicam show?” she asks herself. “Because I hate money.”


	Fey is always pitching. She says the Morgan project is funny and she's hopeful it moves forward, but she is candid about the fact that broadcast's current approach to comedy may be hastening its own death. There is an industry-wide desire for more sitcoms, yet they are absent from the schedule for much of the year. “You can't program comedy only 13 weeks a year and expect people to come to you for comedy,” she says, noting there's no quick fix. “They have to reclaim that space. And it's going to be a little bit like these tariffs. You're just going to have to suffer for 10 years.” 

	











	Lowering her face within a few inches of the table, Fey speaks directly into the iPhone recording our conversation: “She didn't say ‘tariffs.' She didn't bring up anything about tariffs. She does not understand tariffs.”


	One of Fey's running bits is that her TV output has never pulled the same audiences or paydays as that of the Chuck Lorres of the world. You're more likely to hear her talk about 30 Rock‘s low ratings (it ranked 102 out of 142 shows in its first season) than its three straight Emmy wins for best comedy. But if she ever earnestly chased the highest echelon of commercial success, the impulse has apparently left her. “I've never had the brain to be like, ‘You know what the market's looking for these days? Twins!' ” she says. “I don't know how to work backwards. The fact that I tried to follow 30 Rock with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt [a sitcom about a woman who escapes a bunker after 15 years in captivity] shows you I have no sense for the business.”


	It's the penultimate self-deprecation. I counter by asking what she thinks the business wants from her at this juncture in her career. “What does Hollywood want from me?” Fey repeats, allowing herself a few seconds to think of an answer that might delight her. “A tasteful facelift.”

Reports indicated that frontman Roger Daltrey was unhappy with Starkey's performance at a recent Royal Albert Hall gig.

The Who have parted ways with drummer Zak Starkey after nearly three decades, following the band's recent run of London shows.


	In a statement to The Guardian, a spokesperson for the veteran group said: “The band made a collective decision to part ways with Zak after this round of shows at the Royal Albert Hall. They have nothing but admiration for him and wish him the very best for his future.”


	The gigs, which took place last month on March 18 and 20, were in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. The Who's frontman, Roger Daltrey, is a patron of the charity and until 2024 acted as curator for their annual gig series at the historic venue.

	Tensions came to a head when Daltrey complained onstage last month about Starkey's performance. A report of the first performance via Metro suggested that the singer stopped several songs mid-performance, citing difficulty hearing the band over the drums.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	It also said that Daltrey paused their final song, “The Song Is Over,” and told the audience: “To sing that song I do need to hear the key, and I can't. All I've got is drums going boom, boom, boom. I can't sing to that. I'm sorry guys.”


	Starkey appeared to pre-empt his dismissal over the weekend (Apr. 13), when he posted an all-caps message to his Instagram page that read, in part: “Heard today from inside source that Toger Daktrey [sic] lead singer and principal songwriter of the group unhappy with Zak the drummer's performance at the Albert Hall a few weeks ago is bringing formal charges of overplaying and is literally going to Zak the drummer.”


	Daltrey, 81, recently revealed during those Teenage Cancer Trust shows that “the joys of getting old mean you go deaf. I also now have got the joy of going blind.” 


	The decision wraps up a significant chapter in the legendary rockers' history. Starkey joined the band during their 1996 Quadrophenia world tour. He was introduced to drumming by The Who's original drummer, Keith Moon, a close family friend who gave him a drum kit for his eighth birthday. He went on to play major shows with the group, including the 2010 Super Bowl and the 2012 London Olympics. At press time spokespeople for Starkey and the Who had not returned Billboard‘s request for additional comment.


	Starkey is the son of Beatles drummer Ringo Starr and Maureen Starkey, and has also enjoyed a fruitful career outside of The Who, playing with Oasis, Johnny Marr, Paul Weller and Graham Coxon. He currently performs in the recently-formed supergroup Mantra of the Cosmos, also featuring Shaun Ryder and Bez of the Happy Mondays and Black Grape, and Andy Bell of Oasis and Ride.

He's best known for his work in TV, but he once had a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. 


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Wink Martindale, who had success as a DJ, radio personality, game show host and TV producer, died in Rancho Mirage, California, on Tuesday (April 15).  He was 91.


	Martindale was best-known for hosting Gambit from 1972 to 1976 (and again from 1980 to 1981), Tic-Tac-Dough from 1978 to 1985, High Rollers from 1987 to 1988 and Debt from 1996 to 1998.


	He also had a short-lived career as a recording artist. His spoken-word hit “Deck of Cards” reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1959. The song had been a No. 2 hit for “T” Texas Tyler in 1948 on Billboard's Best-Selling Retail Folk Records chart, a forerunner to Hot Country Songs.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Martindale landed just one other Hot 100 hit, “Black Land Farmer,” which reached No. 85 in 1961.


	The future broadcaster was born Winston Conrad Martindale in Jackson, Tennessee. He began his career as a DJ at age 17 at WPLI in Jackson, earning $25 a week. After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson's only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending college at Memphis State University.


	In 1959, he became morning man at KHJ in Los Angeles, moving a year later to the morning show at KRLA and finally to KFWB in 1962. He was a regular presence on Los Angeles radio into the 1990s. He had lengthy stays at KGIL (AM) from 1968 to 1971, KKGO-FM/KJQI and Gene Autry‘s KMPC (now KSPN-AM) from 1971 to 1979 and again from 1983 to 1987, a brief stint on KABC during 1989, and KJQI from 1993 to 1994.


	Martindale's first break into television was at WHBQ-TV in Memphis, as the host of Mars Patrol, a children's series. While at that station, Martindale became the host of the TV show Teenage Dance Party, where Elvis Presley (who would become a friend) made an appearance in June 1956.


	Martindale's first game-show hosting job was What's This Song?, which he hosted for NBC (credited as “Win Martindale”) in 1964-65. In 1970-71, he hosted a similar song-recognition game show, Words and Music, again on NBC.


	While Martindale's greatest claim to fame is as a game-show host, he periodically returned to music programming. Martin filled in as guest host for Casey Kasem on American Top 40 in October 1975.


	In the 2000s, Martindale had a daily three-hour show on the syndicated Music of Your Life format. In 2012, Martindale hosted the nationally-syndicated The 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.

	











	On June 6, 2021, Martindale began hosting the syndicated The History of Rock ‘n' Roll, a two-hour weekend review of music from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The production was created by Martindale, producer/engineer Peter Jay Gould of The Intervale Group, and writer/producer Gary Theroux.


	Martindale was one of the hosts featured in the 2002 NBC special Most Outrageous Game Show Moments, alongside four other game show mainstays – Bob Eubanks, Jim Lange, Ben Stein, and Peter Marshall.


	Martindale's last program was the GSN original series Instant Recall, which premiered on March 4, 2010.


	On June 2, 2006, Martindale received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is located at 7018 Hollywood Boulevard, adjacent to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel – site of the first Academy Awards ceremony.  On Oct. 13, 2007, Martindale was one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame in Las Vegas.


	Martindale married Madelyn Leech in 1954, with whom he had four children; the couple divorced in 1972. He married his second wife, Sandy (née Ferra), on Aug. 2, 1975.

	Amazon is not proceeding with the Citadel international offshoots Citadel: Honey Bunny and Citadel: Diana, which will not be returning for second seasons. Meanwhile, the upcoming second season of the mothership series starring Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra-Jonas has gotten a Season 2 premiere window and an official logline.


	“Having successfully traversed India and Italy, storylines from both Citadel: Honey Bunny and Citadel: Diana will be woven into the upcoming second season of the mothership series Citadel,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “While these successful and widely enjoyed international chapters will not continue as individual series, Season 2 of Citadel will be our most exhilarating yet. With high-stakes storytelling, new additions to our amazing cast and bold, cinematic ambition, the new season will deepen the emotional journeys of Nadia, Mason and Orlick against the relentless force that is Manticore. We're excited to share what's next when Citadel Season 2 premieres globally in Q2 of 2026.”

	The cancellation of the two spinoff series is not surprising. While they have done well in their local markets, Citadel: Diana and Citadel: Honey Bunny have not been global breakouts and have been waiting for word on their fates since launching their first seasons in September and December, respectively. 


	Additionally, as Deadline reported last month, plans for other potential spinoffs in countries like Mexico have been put on hold as the focus is put squarely on finishing Season 2 of the main series.

	The Citadel franchise has been under scrutiny following the recent exit of Amazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke on whose idea it was based. It was probably the biggest gamble of her tenure  — an ambitious, expansive and expensive multi-series, multi-country endeavor for which she brought in the Russo brothers‘ AGBO.


	Season 2 of the mothership series is currently in post-production. It was targeting a late 2025 delivery and previously eying a Q1 2026 release. It will now debut about three years after the April 28, 2023 Season 1 premiere. 

	











	Season 2 is set one month after the events of the first season. In it, we find our Citadel spies underground, as they're being hunted by Manticore agents around the world. They're pulled out of hiding to join forces with a new team of unconventional spies when Manticore's Brazilian billionaire Paulo Braga threatens to unleash a cataclysmic piece of technology, built by Citadel's own Bernard Orlick, into the world.

	The series made headlines with its tortured development and Season 1 production history that included multiple showrunner changes, multiple cuts and reshoots that reportedly pushed the budget north of $200 million for six episodes. It delivered respectable but not extraordinary ratings performance — Citadel became at the time Prime Video's second-most-watched new original series outside the U.S. and fourth-most-watched worldwide after 24 days of release with modest U.S. viewership..


	From Amazon MGM Studios and AGBO, Citadel is executive produced by Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot and Scott Nemes for AGBO, with David Weil serving as showrunner and executive producer.

Senior Film Reporter


Netflix has unveiled a trio of first-look stills from Fixed, its new adult animated comedy from renowned filmmaker Genndy Tartakovsky (Primal), announcing that it will premiere on the service on Wednesday, August 13. 


	Starring Adam Devine, Idris Elba, Kathryn Hahn, and more, Fixed tells the story of Bull, an average, all-around good dog who discovers he's going to be neutered in the morning. As the gravity of this life-altering event sets in, Bull realizes he needs one last adventure with his pack of best friends as these are the last 24 hours with his balls! What could go wrong…?

	In a statement explaining the style of animation chosen for Fixed, and how the project evolved over time, Emmy winner Tartakovsky said, “I love caricatured and exaggerated animation, so I knew the sensibility that I like to do and it was a matter of dialing the amount of exaggeration. I think it started out as a rated-R Lady and the Tramp, then as we got into it it naturally became more cartoony and specific to itself. I would say it began to really take shape as we were fortunate to hire some of the best animators working in 2D from around the world.”

	 Tartakovsky and Jon Vitti penned the script, from their story conceived with Steve Greenberg and Rich Lufrano. Pic's all-star cast also includes Fred Armisen, Bobby Moynihan, Beck Bennett, Michelle Buteau, and River Gallo. Michelle Murdocca produced the film, with Christian Roedel co-producing, and Sony Pictures Animation as the production company.


	A stylistically influential five-time Emmy winner known for series like Samurai Jack and Dexter's Laboratory, as well as Sony's Hotel Transylvania franchise, Tartakovsky is coming off a couple of series for Adult Swim: the critically acclaimed award winner Primal and adult animated fantasy series Unicorn: Warriors Eternal. Check out the first-look stills from his latest project above and below.

	Here's your first look at The Roses, the latest feature from Jay Roach starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman. 


	Directed by Roach from a screenplay by two-time Oscar nominee Tony McNamara, the film follows the life of picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing – as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. 


The Roses is inspired by the 1989 Danny DeVito-directed, Michael Leeson-scripted movie The War of the Roses starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, based on the novel by Warren Adler. The original adaptation was released by 20th Century Fox in 1989, garnering a BAFTA and three Golden Globe nominations, including for Best Motion Picture, among other accolades.

Lebanon has banned Disney's Snow White remake from playing in cinemas because Israeli actress Gal Gadot, one of the film's stars, is on the country's boycott list.


	Ahmad Hajjar, Lebanon's Interior Minister, recommended the ban, according to local newspaper An-Nahar. 


	Gadot stars as the Evil Queen in Snow White. The actress was born in Israel and prior to becoming a model and actress, served in the Israel Defense Forces, as her native country mandates it. Gadot has been a prominent supporter of Israel since October 7 and the country's subsequent military campaign in Gaza. During an impassioned speech at the Anti-Defamation League's summit in 2024, she said: “Never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews.”

Snow White opened in U.S. cinemas on March 21 and has been both a critical and box office bomb. Based on the famed Brothers Grimm tale, the story follows a princess who is rescued by seven dwarf miners who make Snow White part of their household after she's exiled into a dangerous forest by her wicked stepmother.


	Marc Webb (The Amazing Spider-Man) directs from a script by Greta Gerwig (Barbie) and Erin Cressida Wilson (The Girl on the Train), with Marc Platt producing. Also starring is Rachel Zegler, and Tony winner Andrew Burnap portrays Jonathan, a new male lead character. Original songs for the pic were penned by the EGOT-winning La La Land duo of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land, Dear Evan Hansen).

Joanna Gaines is telling Chip to shove off… at least for a little while.

Although the couple hosts the long-running “Fixer Upper” as well as a number of spin offs including ones subtitled “The Hotel,” “Welcome Home” and “The Lakehouse,” this new show will be hyper focused on much smaller projects.

The famed host is setting up her own renovation project for Magnolia Network's “Mini Reni.”

Variety dropped the news that this new show will follow Gaines as she “takes on a series of ‘mini' projects with quick timelines. In each episode, she makes a few intentional, creative additions to transform smaller spaces with big impact.”

In a statement to Variety, Gaines says “Mini Reni” allows for unwavering freedom in more focused spaces.

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

“These aren't whole-house renovations, so the heart behind the show is to inspire people to design their home gradually, and thoughtfully,” she tells the outlet. “So that instead of having to wrap your mind around the million details that go into a bigger renovation, you can enjoy the process of creating beauty by narrowing in, flexing your creativity, and embracing the small details that really tell your story.”

Whether the show aims to renovate just rooms or feature smaller DIY projects remains to be seen. It's also unknown who the projects will be for in the storyline of the show itself.

This isn't the first time Gaines has gone solo. The host also heads a cooking series called “Magnolia Table.” She also cohosts “The Retro Plant Shop with Mikey & Jo” with Mikey McCall.

Gaines also has eight books available for purchase. Fans can check out two memoirs, three volumes of cookbooks, an interior design book and two children books.

Allison Page, the Magnolia Network president, is excited for the new show's distinct approach.

“To us, ‘Mini Reni' is a celebration of Magnolia Network and the platform it has been for so much creativity,” Page says. “Viewers are going to love seeing this side of Joanna, and I can't wait to share this special project.”

The show is produced by the Gaines couple via their company Blind Nil.

“Mini Reni” is set to land on Max on May 14. Meanwhile, linear TV viewers can catch the series on the Magnolia Network. New episodes of the nine episode season will premiere weekly on Wednesdays at 8 PM through July 9.

The producers previously indicated they would like to stick with correct ages for all characters, meaning that the children will be 11 to start and grow throughout the life of the show.

“We haven't made any final choices, but we're workshopping with a shortlist in January. And there are some crackers,” Mylod told The Hollywood Reporter regarding casting the children. 

Filming is set to begin in the U.K. in 2025-2026.

Just a few days after sharing some life-changing news, actor Eric Dane was spotted out and about, proving that he wasn't going to let this get him down. 

TMZ shared a photo of the”Euphoria” and “Grey's Anatomy” star visiting a friend in Los Angeles on Sunday. He was dressed in a white t-shirt, an off-white sweater, and khakis. 

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

This comes after he revealed to People on April 10 that he has been diagnosed with ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

“I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter. I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to [the] set of ‘Euphoria' next week. I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time,” he told the outlet.

Dane's announcement came on April 10, but just a day before, his wife, Rebecca Gayheart, spoke with E! News about their marriage. 

Her sentiments followed her decision to dismiss her divorce from Dane in February. 

“We are best of friends. We are really close. We are great coparents,” Gayheart said. “We really figured out the formula to staying a family and I think our kids are benefiting greatly from it and we are as well.”

“I think it's important to not look at a relationship that ends as a failure. It's just a season. It wasn't a failure. It was a huge success,” she continued. “We were married for, I mean, we are still married, but together for 15 years and we had two beautiful kids so I think that's a successful relationship, and that's how we look at it.”

On April 11, Colman Domingo spoke with People, reacting to Dane's diagnosis. 

“I haven't been able to speak with him yet,” Domingo said. “I just got the news yesterday too, and I'm wishing him well. I look forward to working with him.”

Dane made it clear when he announced the news to People that he will be continuing to act. 

“I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to the set of Euphoria next week,” Dane told the outlet. “I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.”

“Golden Bachelor” star Gerry Turner is giving a major update about his cancer battle.

“I feel great,” he said. “Until I have any symptoms, there's no treatment. So I go frequently for blood tests. I'm on, like, a six-month schedule now, and I feel optimistic because the doctor has said, ‘Well, when you turn 75, we're going to have to go three-month increments,'” Turner said on the Bachelor Nation Happy Hour.

“So it's telling me that at least he expects me to live another couple of years to get to that. But the bottom line is I feel really good,” he said on the podcast.

Turner also gave an update on his love life.

On the podcast, Turner also gave a major update about his personal life. He revealed that he has been dating since his divorce from “Golden Bachelor” winner Theresa Nist.

Fans had followed the “Golden Bachelor” couple from their first date in a diner to their televised wedding and then their lives post-divorce.

“The person I'm dating will say, ‘Do you want to go do-' And before she even gets out the rest of the sentence, I will say yes. So I'm in on everything,” he said on the podcast. 

“And it makes life exciting because you kind of in the back of your head feel like you've got a lot of living to do and you don't know how long you have to do it, so don't turn down anything. And so, in a way, it's really a good thing.”

Turner did not give any clues to the woman's identity, however.

On the podcast, Turner also described how cancer had changed him and, in some ways, he said that the struggle has changed him for the better.

“I mean this sincerely, from the time I got this diagnosis, it's a privilege to live like you're dying,” he said. “I don't turn down anything. I feel like I'm more open to emotions. I'm more open to experiences.”

In December, Turner revealed to People magazine that he was diagnosed with a slow-growing form of bone marrow cancer.

“It was like 10 tons of concrete were just dropped on me. And I was a bit in denial for a while, I didn't want to admit to it,” he told People at the time of the diagnosis.

Among the hundreds of thousands who watched pop star Katy Perry and an all-female crew blast off aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft on April 14, 2025, was her former “American Idol” castmate Luke Bryan. 

While appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” the following night, Bryan described how he “accidentally” found himself live streaming the entire event from his farm in Franklin, Tennessee — mainly because he was worried it might “blow up.” 

Perry was one of six women on the April 14 Blue Origin flight, along with “CBS Mornings” anchor Gayle King, former TV personality Lauren Sánchez, NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, film producer Kerianne Flynn and bioastronautics research scientist and activist Amanda Nguyen.

When Kimmel asked Bryan what he thought of Perry's participation, Bryan replied, “I accidentally started following it. I was doing my morning walk around the farm, which turns into checking Instagram and stuff, and I saw where she was, like, posting on her Instagram that it was happening at 8:30 central, and totally got roped into the moment. I went and clicked on the links!” 

Bryan said he had reached out to Perry when she announced she'd be part of the flight, telling Kimmel, “I had sent her a text going, ‘Good luck, wow, that's crazy you're getting to do that!” 

“Couple months later, there I am walking around my farm, watching the one-hour telecast of it,” Bryan quipped, then mimicked the live stream announcer giving play-by-play details of the launch. 

Bryan added, “It roped me in because when you have a friend (going), I mean, let's let's face it — it could blow up! So, I wanted it to not do that.”

Of Blue Origin's 31 missions thus far, Perry's was the 11th flight with crew members, per People. The outlet said Blue Origin's spacecraft have taken 52 people past the Kármán line, the “internationally recognized boundary of space,” before returning to Earth.  

When Kimmel asked Bryan whether he saw what Perry said after her space mission, the country star said, “I saw her kiss the ground, which — that would be my reaction, too.” 

Kimmel then played a clip of Perry moments after returning to Earth, when she was asked how it felt to “officially” be an astronaut.  

“I feel super connected to love, so connected to love,” Perry replied. “I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, like how much love you have to give.” 

Laughing, Kimmel asked Bryan, “I mean, what do you think went on in that thing!?”

Looking puzzled, Bryan joked, “Was there a pre-flight meal? Did Bezos serve mushrooms on it? Like, I really want to go to space now!”  

“It must have been quite the euphoric ride through the cosmos,” he added. “Maybe she'll debrief me on those emotions.” 

When Kimmel asked Bryan whether he'd want to be a “space cowboy” on a similar flight, the dad of two teen boys said his family would give him a “resounding no,” but that his curiosity has been piqued. 

“It'd be a very delicate negotiation,” he smiled. “I probably would do it just because, I mean, you got to take that chance.” 

“Do you?” Kimmel laughed. “Do you? No, you don't, you really don't have to take that chance!”

Every one of the 12 “American Idol” contestants who took the stage during the second night of season 23's live performances in Hawaii managed to get the celebrity judges out of their chairs to dance or applaud on April 14, 2025. But only one caused Luke Bryan to leap onto his chair, jumping up and down with excitement. 

Bryan couldn't contain himself as 24-year-old Josh King of Charlotte, North Carolina, wrapped up his joyful rendition of Elton John's “I'm Still Standing.” It was one of several moments during the episode when the judges celebrated the growth of singers they've seen blossom in the months since they first auditioned for them in the fall of 2024. Those singers all now await their fate as viewers' votes are tabulated.

A post shared by Luke Bryan Official (@lukebryan)

After King's performance, complete with a soulful harmonica solo, host Ryan Seacrest sauntered onstage and pointed out, “Luke is jumping on the furniture. Nice moves up here!” 

“I'm just excited for him,” Bryan said of King, an airport piano player who made it to Hollywood after his audition, but was challenged by the judges to shift from lounge singer to pop singer in the weeks ahead. Otherwise, they predicted, he'd flounder — but it seems King took their advice to heart.  

“You're the type of person America falls in love with,” Bryan told King after stepping down from his chair. “We remember your audition, and we remember every little growth to get to this point. And then, you just did a whole performance and when you brought the harmonica out, the intensity of the crowd went to another level. You're working the stage, everything looks great, and America is gonna love you for that!” 

Carrie Underwood agreed, telling King, “Before this just happened, I was just saying, ‘If you had told me on your first audition that you would be here, right now, just crushing it, I probably wouldn't have believed you. But you have, like, come into your own. I feel like I was at the Josh show! I would have paid money — I will pay money — to hear a full two hours of that. Let's go!” 

Lionel Richie also sang King's praises, telling him he “lit up the audience” and that he's a “showman on top of being a great singer.” 

“American Idol” first headed to Disney's Aulani Resort in Hawaii in 2019, per ABC, bringing the Top 40 contestants to Ko Olina to perform for a live audience. The judges — Bryan, Richie and Katy Perry — then narrowed down the competition to the Top 20 before live voting begin. 

After that first year, the show cut the number of contestants who get to go to Hawaii to the Top 24, and now viewers get to vote on who will make it to the Top 20, which will be announced on the next episode, airing on April 20. 

At the end of the April 14 episode, after Amanda Barise's showstopping delivery of “Defying Gravity,” Bryan said it was fitting that her powerful performance would “kind of bookend and cap off what I think has been our best Hawaii experience we've ever had.”

Netflix has come to the rescue of Genndy Tartakovsky's 2D adult-animated “Fixed,” which was dropped by New Line in 2023 via Warner Bros. Discovery in a cost-cutting measure similar to the “Coyote vs Acme” hybrid and “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,” which were picked up by Ketchup Entertainment. The R-rated co-production with Sony Pictures Animation was picked up by the streamer and will premiere on August 13.

“Fixed,” from a story by Tartakovsky, Steve Greenberg, Rich Lufrano, and Jon Vitti, follows Bull (Adam Devine), an average dog who discovers that he's going to be neutered in the morning. As the gravity of this life-altering event sets in, Bull realizes he needs one last adventure with his pack of best friends as these are the last 24 hours with his balls. There's also a romance with the dog next door. The canine hero's pack of pals includes characters voiced by Idris Elba, Kathryn Hahn, Fred Armisen, Bobby Moynihan, Beck Bennett, Michelle Buteau, and River Gallo.

The 2D animation was done in a Warner Bros. style by Renegade Animation and Lightstar Studios, with Tartakovsky (“Primal,” “Samurai Jack”) pushing the envelope in style and humor. But it proved too risky. Developed at SPA, where the director made three successful “Hotel Transylvania” films, the project stalled until he got New Line interested, and the project was back on track. When “Fixed” reverted back to Sony, they shopped it around, and it finally wound up at Netflix (with Hannah Minghella head of feature animation and live-action family film), which is very adventurous and not risk-averse. The streamer will also release Sony's “In Your Dreams” and “K-Pop: Demon Hunters” this year. 

For Tartakovsky, “Fixed” is the fulfillment of a hand-drawn dream project that began 15 years ago as his introduction to Sony. “The animation gods blessed me with the premise,” he told IndieWire. “In its own self, it's a unicorn, this project. It's got raunchy comedy, we're doing all the layouts here, so it's very hand-crafted. It's got heart, it's got real character humor, and [is] not filled with one-liners. And the dogs act like canines and not humans.”

Tartakovsky described the animation style as Tex Avery, though not as exaggerated in its expressions. “At the end of the day, once the initial shock is over after the first sequence, because we start pretty crazy, you'll hopefully settle into the character story and you'll fall in love with these dogs.”

Two years after staging his newest play, David Mamet is returning to the big screen with a brand-new cinematic adaptation of the work. “Henry Johnson,” Mamet's first film since his 2013 Al Pacino-starring Phil Spector TV movie, reunites the full original cast from the stage version, including Shia LaBeouf, Evan Jonigkeit, Chris Bauer, and Dominic Hoffman. The film's first trailer, an IndieWire exclusive available below, hints at the acidic drama to come.

Per the film's official synopsis, “Henry Johnson” is “a drama that follows the title character (Jonigkeit) as he navigates his search for a moral center, after an act of compassion upends his life.  Looking to authority figures he encounters along the way — including his eventual cellmate, Gene (LaBeouf) —Henry's journey leads him down a road of manipulation and ethical uncertainty.”

When the play was first mounted at Venice, California's Electric Lodge in October 2023, reviews praised LaBeouf's work as a scheming prisoner in particular, with Variety deeming it “tortured and slightly volatile” and with “a delicious unpredictability.” The new film version was shot in less than a week earlier this year.

The film was written and directed by Mamet, who previous film efforts include directing “The Spanish Prisoner,” “Oleanna,” “House of Games,” “State and Main,” “Heist,” “Spartan,” “The Winslow Boy,” and others, plus his work adapting his own “Glengarry Glen Ross.” For his screenwriting work on “Wag the Dog” and “The Verdict,” he was twice nominated for Oscars.

Despite an uptick in distaste for both Mamet's work (in one of the most memorable essays on his creative foibles, in 2013, Los Angeles Times theater critic Charles McNulty took Mamet to task for letting “anti-P.C. rage blunt his work”) and his political leanings (we'll let this 2008 Village Voice op-ed speak for itself), his work is still a draw: his “Glengarry Glen Ross” is currently back on Broadway (with recent Oscar winner Kieran Culkin toplining the cast) and “Henry Johnson” is also back on stage in Chicago (where its staging has drawn some protests, along with glowing reviews).

It's also the latest addition to LaBeouf's 2025 slate. The embattled actor and filmmaker is also at the center of “Slauson Rec,” a documentary about his “unconventional” teaching style that's still searching for a distributor. LaBeouf founded a free theater school at the Slauson Rec Center in South Central Los Angeles in 2018; the experimental theater company continued until November 2020, shortly before LaBeouf was sued by his ex-girlfriend FKA Twigs for sexual battery, assault, and emotional distress.

 










The new film was produced by Jonigkeit, who is married to Mamet's daughter Zosia Mamet, and 1993's Lije Sarki, and executive produced by Peter Baxter, Marcel Bonn-Miller, and Sheldon Stone.

In partnership with GATHR, the filmmakers will independently release “Henry Johnson” at The Aero in Los Angeles on Friday, May 9, with rentals also being available at the same time through the film's website, henryjohnsonmovie.com. The film will expand theatrically to major markets throughout May, with additional listings to follow on the website.

Check out the first trailer for “Henry Johnson” below, an IndieWire exclusive.

Before Hailey Gates made her Sundance-winning feature film “Atropia,” the young filmmaker was attempting to make a short film, “Shako Mako,” based on the real-life military training village she ended up depicting in the feature. The fashion brand Miu Miu, as part of its Women's Tales filmmakers series, helped make it happen. The brand provided clothing, some financing, and other resources, but — above all — was hands-off with the creative.

An Afghanistan War satire might not seem like a particularly relevant brand association for an upscale fashion line, but for Miu Miu, just being in Gates' orbit makes an impact. Jett Steiger and Lana Kim, who produced “Atropia” via banner Ways & Means, said it's all about brands trying to find authentic ways to engage with consumers: making content their customers would want to watch, dispatching cool female filmmakers to parties, and using those connections to fuel good PR.

Miu Miu didn't have any official ties to the feature “Atropia,” but having that short in their portfolio proved a valuable sales tool for the producers when it came time to get co-star Callum Turner aboard. For Miu Miu? The brand can boast that Gates is just one more in a growing roster of emerging female filmmakers it has supported, even if most consumers will never make the connection between “Atropia” and the clothing brand.

“I feel like it creates this cultural halo effect such that, by the time it gets to someone at the store putting down their card, they've been influenced in a way they're not even aware of,” Steiger said.

There's no shortage of brand-sponsored or -backed films premiering at festivals or online that all have eyebrow-raising affiliations. Did you know WeTransfer helped make Riz Ahmed's Oscar-winning short “The Long Goodbye”? Or that “Emilia Pérez” was bankrolled by Yves Saint Laurent and that the brand has another project with Pedro Almodóvar?

But whereas paid advertorials or blatant product placement have become too transparent to most audiences, more brands are waking up to the idea of investing in narrative feature films and series, whether on major studio projects or smaller indies. Some even go a step farther than Miu Miu or Saint Laurent and want to be creative partners. For some Hollywood creators, they too are willing to welcome their creative input — and especially their dollars.

 










Rick Parkhill of Brand Storytelling said that, 10 years ago, brands wanted to get the next viral hit, like creating “Uncle Drew” or videos featuring racer Jeff Gordon as an undercover driver to sell Pepsi. Today, they're looking for a return beyond just marketing. They want to be investors in projects. “All brands are saying, do we have a ‘Barbie‘ moment ourselves? What kind of IP can we leverage?,” Parkhill said.

In some instances, brands are trying to get ahead of the stories that others are telling about them. The “founder” film genre has exploded in recent years with films like “Air,” “Tetris,” “Flamin' Hot!,” “Unfrosted,” or quite literally “The Founder,” which tell the story of a brand in a dramatic narrative. In those cases, the brand wasn't involved or in some cases even aware. 

But for films like “Barbie,” “The LEGO Movie,” or the just-announced movie about the founder of Hershey's that was put into development, the brand is involved, and able to be protective of their history and values. Enter Starbucks, Crocs, or Chik-Fil-A, which have all launched their own production banners. And if you're thinking we're not far from Seth Rogen's character in “The Studio” green lighting a “Kool-Aid Man” movie, you're not alone.

Parkhill says brands today want to be what people seek out, not what interrupts their attention. The best recent example happened by accident, when Mike White filmed the first season of “The White Lotus” at an empty Four Seasons resort during pandemic lockdowns. Now Four Seasons is all over the series, even though the show doesn't bear any paid branding or take any creative input from the brand itself.

 










“People are booking trips because they see that. There's no Four Seasons branding, but where the hell is that? Oh, it's the Four Seasons Thailand. Let's go there. That's not unnoticed in the travel industry,” Parkhill said. He wonders when Viking Cruise Ships might sponsor a remake of “The Love Boat.”

Michael Sugar, longtime manager of Steven Soderbergh, and his company Sugar23 are trying to “manufacture the accident.” He's seen how “The Queen's Gambit” increased interest in chess, how “Sideways” tanked sales of Merlot, and how “Drive to Survive” accelerated the popularity of Formula One.

He wonders, why Adidas or Nike can't have been the one to come up with “Ted Lasso,” even if athletic shoes weren't necessarily integrated into the content? The hit show was originally based on an NBC Sports sketch, so it's only a matter of time before another company manages to develop their own IP that becomes a hit.

“LeBron James isn't screaming ‘Buy Bitcoin' every time he takes a free throw just because Crypto.com names the arena he plays in,” Sugar said. “The same can be true with content: if you deliver something amazing, and the audience knows it's from you, the brand, then the brand is going to get a value prop for it.” 

While companies think they can't have their own “Barbie” moment because they sell shoes instead of dolls, Sugar is trying to get them to realize brands themselves are IP. The problem is Hollywood and the corporate marketing world have long been disconnected, and when brands are approached to be sponsors or financiers, they're generally the last one to the table and don't necessarily see these opportunities aligning with their values. 

 










They want to, through entertainment, evoke a feeling about how a customer responds to their brand.

“Brands don't want to be treated as banks, they want to be treated as advertisers who are partners in the creative process,” Sugar said. “We're hearing from brands that, we get a lot of projects from Hollywood, the problem is they're not right [for them]. The reason they're not right is most producers in Hollywood don't have the institutional knowledge we have been working hard to acquire on what would solve for a brand. It's really, how we can tweak something creatively to make something more right for a brand without making it less right for the creative team? That's the sweet spot that we try to live in.”

Along with Jae Goodman's Superconnector company, Sugar23 is one of the major juggernauts trying to bridge the gap between the ad world and Hollywood. They're connecting them to directing and writing talent the creative market agencies don't normally have access to, and they're pitching them on the idea that brands have enough of their own history and values to develop something from the beginning.

Not only are they finding that brands are willing to participate if they're involved in the vision, if a studio executive is presented with something they would buy anyway, it matters less that a brand is involved.

 










Sugar recently hosted what he dubbed The Way Upfronts; instead of the Upfronts, where studios present their TV slate to advertisers, producers and creators pitched their early ideas to advertisers with money to invest, aiming to build a marketplace where brands can match with creators that share their values. Of importance: Sugar told them not to bring the “broken toys” that have been shopped around and couldn't find other buyers, but fresh ideas that will have a lot of interest. 

People like Scarlett Johansson, John Legend, Tom Brady, and Elizabeth Banks all showed up, “a lot of money was moved,” and Sugar23, which wants to position itself as a creative marketplace between brands and Hollywood, intends to host another round soon.

Brian Newman, the former Tribeca head who now runs brand consultant Sub-Genre, said brands have always wanted to be involved early in the creative process, but it's only because of projects like “Barbie” that others are increasingly getting involved on bigger-budgeted, bigger-risk Hollywood-style development.

Some of the early adopters to this space who count among his clients were outdoor brands like Patagonia, The North Face, and REI. REI in particular backed the Kyra Sedgwick film “Space Oddity” and the Netflix drama “Frybread Face & Me” about two Indigenous boys. Neither film's story is explicit in its branding, but they evoked themes of climate change and land rights issues that are important to REI's values. 

 










The films even created some more tangible returns on REI's investment. Newman said, while those partnerships can lead to more in-store or online sales, there are other returns: it boosts awareness of the brand without needing to air an annoying 30-second spot, and it even helps with employee retention, especially for Gen-Z employees who want to know that the company they work for shares their own personal values. Some are thinking even farther ahead than that.

“Smart brands are thinking a step ahead of the other ones,” Newman said. “REI knows if they don't get people outdoors and off their butts, they're not going to have customers in 10 years. Being associated in your customers' mind with certain values and aesthetics, it will feel better shopping for it if you know they've done these things.” 

One studio executive working with brands told IndieWire that, while there are a handful of scripted studio features in the works, the reality is it's still too risky for most brands to undertake a major feature. But it's those .5 percent of brands willing to experiment and take the risks who will win. 

What's more, an agent working in the brand space said that, historically, brands were willing to spend millions on such projects, but the distribution pipeline wasn't yet there. Ever since streamers like Netflix started introducing advertising, those walls have been coming down, and streamers are looking for new ways to monetize content on their platform.

 










As for what's coming next, the agent said he's spoken with a number of food brands with character mascots, kicking around ideas with companies like M&Ms and Lucky Charms, to name just a couple.

For anyone who doesn't want branding anywhere near their art, that's completely understandable. But Parkhill spins it this way: if you took just 10 percent of the trillions of dollars spent on billboards, 30-second TV spots, and internet marketing and instead put it toward bankrolling the creativity of people like Almodóvar, “we're going to live in a better world full of better media to consume.”

“We're going to give them something that they're going to really enjoy, and that's going to boost our brand more than than buying billboards, radio ads, and television commercials. That's where things are headed,” Parkhill said. “Plus, Hollywood needs the money.”

Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch are married folks from hell in “The Roses.” The feature is a remake of 1989 film “The War of the Roses,” which starred “Romancing the Stone” alums Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, with Danny DeVito directing. “The Roses” now is written by “The Favourite” and “Poor Things” screenwriter Tony McNamara, a reunion for “The Favourite” Academy Award winner Colman.

The official synopsis reads: “Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing – as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. ‘The Roses' is a reimagining of the 1989 classic film The War of the Roses, based on the novel by Warren Adler.”

“‘The Roses' is a wildly funny, bigger than life, and yet deeply human story,” Searchlight president Matthew Greenfield told Variety. “With Jay at the helm, and Benedict and Olivia and Tony, we have a dream team bringing it to life.”

Colman previously told IndieWire she would definitely reunite with “The Roses” screenwriter McNamara's longtime collaborator Yorgos Lanthimos, whom Colman worked with on “The Favourite.” “I mean, I would work with him again for free any time, to be honest,” Colman said of Lanthimos, “and I think he probably knows that. I know whenever he wins everything, and I text him and go, ‘You're amazing!'”

Colman will next appear in the “Pride and Prejudice” series as well as a romance film co-starring Dev Patel. Emma Corrin leads the “Pride and Prejudice” series and also executive produces. 

Cumberbatch starred in 2024's “Eric” and Wes Anderson's “Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar.” He is expected to reprise his role as Doctor Strange in the MCU with the latest phase.

“The Roses” premieres in theaters August 29. Check out the trailer below.

CinemaCon is an industry event held every April in Las Vegas for theater owners, designed to get them excited to want to book a given studio's movie on their screens, but increasingly it's become more akin to something like ComicCon. Fanboy bloggers attend to be the first to see footage from upcoming films, oftentimes months before anything is released to the public online. And we as journalists spend time describing the footage we saw, how the audience reacted, and what studio brass have to say about it all.

Now the movie theaters are doing our job for us. Select movie theaters nationwide will screen some highlights of CinemaCon 2025, a curated presentation of trailers, extended scenes, and other promos that you can watch in your local theater before that footage eventually gets played before an actual movie sometime down the road.

Patrons who buy a ticket (yes, you will have to buy a ticket, more on that below) will see roughly 70 minutes of trailers — not quite the length of an actual movie, but you'll still need a babysitter — with some other footage thrown in. The content shown is stuff all of us special people got to see for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and maybe a little stuff just for this crowd. The footage will be a mix of PG, PG-13, and R rated previews of movies coming out this summer and fall, but specific movies or studios participating will have to be a surprise.

Included? Likely lots of good stuff. We saw first looks at “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” the Bruce Springsteen biopic “Deliver Me from Nowhere,” “The Naked Gun” remake, “Roofman” with Channing Tatum, “The Running Man” with Glen Powell, “Wicked: For Good,” Maggie Gyllenhaal's “The Bride,” and so much more.

The special presentation takes place on Tuesday, April 22 and again on April 24 and will screen at thousands of theaters nationwide. Tickets are just $3 and are on sale now via atthemovies.co, and as a nice touch, proceeds from the presentation go to charities, including Variety — The Children's Charity, Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation, Canadian Picture Pioneers, and The Cinema Foundation.

The Cinema Foundation is the non-profit arm of Cinema United (formerly NATO), which each year hosts CinemaCon and is putting on this Sneak Peek Showcase. 

 










“Sneak Peek Showcase helps bring a little taste of the famed industry-insider event CinemaCon to movie lovers with a fun look at the upcoming theatrical slate,” says Bryan Braunlich, Executive Director of The Cinema Foundation. “For the first time, cinema-goers will get a glimpse of the most anticipated movies coming soon to their neighborhood theaters all in one program. We are proud to have proceeds benefit industry charitable organizations, and we are grateful for the support of our sponsors, Fandango and The Coca-Cola Company.”

The Cinema Foundation in 2025 is trying to get more people out to theaters by offering a variety of special promotional days. Among them are Date Night @ The Movies that will offer discounts for couples on August 15 and Family Day @ The Movies for… you guessed it, families, on November 9. Back on January 19 was National Popcorn Day, which allowed unlimited popcorn refills for people who went to the theater that day.

Seoul producer Yetsuby's music, like that of her duo Salamanda, is a jumble of brightly colored baubles: marbles and beach glass, sequins and gumdrops, all spun into mesmerizingly symmetrical abstractions. You might be momentarily reminded of Hiroshi Yoshimura, Steve Reich, '90s ambient, and fantastical video-game soundtracks, yet the references float by so gently and swiftly that you're too swept up in the downy tumult to think too closely about them. But there's a moment on Yetsuby's new album 4EVA that's so uncharacteristically strident, it might make you wonder if someone else's audio files got mixed in with hers on the way to the mastering engineer.

“SOUNDCLOUD”—a title, a genre, a browser tab?—begins more or less like her most upbeat tracks typically do, with a beat made of balloon squeaks and finger snaps. But the offbeats are punctuated by what might be the trumpeting of a tetchy elephant; an agitated teakettle adds a dash of pandemonium. Egged on by rushing, rolling breakbeats, gruffly squawking cut-up vocals further stoke the frantic mood. It sounds like a Bomb Squad tribute fronted by a harried Dizzee Rascal and recorded on a diet of Pop Rocks and Coke.

The garishness of the sensory overload marks the song as an outlier in Yetsuby's catalog, but it shares the restlessly inventive spirit found in the rest of her work. In the context of the new album, “SOUNDCLOUD” signals Yetsuby's refusal to fall back on old patterns. On 4EVA, she's determined to try new things, even if they risk damaging the veneer of her typically beatific music. It's her most energetic record yet, heavily informed by contemporary club styles though rarely reducible to any one sound or mood.

The album opens with a fake-out. “s2WINGS s2” begins as a soft explosion of gold dust, filigreed layers of wordless Auto-Tune tracing curlicues atop thrumming chimes and dewdrop synths; it sounds a little bit like Skrillex's “With You, Friends (Long Drive)” reimagined by beatless techno wiz Barker. It gathers steam as it goes, levels rising as though it's about to peak in a concussive drop. Instead, having reached some imperceptible zenith, it simply dissolves into a fine spray of acoustic guitar artifacts, like Jim O'Rourke's Eureka run through an atomizer. “FLY,” which follows, might be a remix of the same sound files: same tempo, same angelic coo, same pointillistic pastel rush. The drums are punchier, the groove more pronounced, but the predominant feeling is an almost overwhelming oxytocin glow, a tidal wave of bliss.

Things briefly get heavier: “Aestheti-Q” rides a brisk, syncopated drum pattern and a barrage of monosyllabic vocal samples fashioned into a hiccuping arpeggio. But even in the album's most insistent moments, what stands out is the high-def quality of her production—like a flickering handclap sound hard-panned across the stereo channels, making you feel like you're flanked by a pair of militant hummingbirds. Crystalline sounds come in waves, a gentle juggernaut of prismatic streamers and laser zaps—Jersey club reimagined as a geyser of diamonds.

The album's back half turns weirder and more freeform. “;P” drifts like an amorphous cloud of metallic space debris, Wall-E chirps and warbling Auto-Tune lending an emotional center to the chaos. The title track pairs children's choirs with xylophone and chunky breakbeats, a rave anthem for a cartoon paradise. And “Where is my..” and “aaa1” fold in music boxes and '60s jazz, Hollywood strings and cricket chirps, before “I AM 뇌로운 인간” closes the album out with the shirred textures—crinkling up voice, guitar, and synths like wads of colored cellophane—that DJ Koze loves so much.

The song's title comes from a childhood portrait of the artist drawn by her younger sister, accompanied by the Korean-language caption “나는 뇌로운 인간” (I am a brain-ful human)—a misspelling of what should have read “외로운 인간” (lonely human). Yetsuby calls the song a meditation on solitude, and a certain sense of melancholy does bleed through its intricate counterpoints. But that accidental reference to the artist's “brain-ful” nature feels apt. Surrounded by fantastical designs of her own invention, she reminds me of Blade Runner's J.F. Sebastian and his genetically engineered menagerie of cuddly, bumptious critters. With an imagination like hers, Yetsuby will always have someone to keep her company.

7.0

Genre:

Pop/R&B

Label:

Sony Music Argentina

Reviewed:

April 16, 2025

For Juana Rozas, forgiveness is overrated. On the Argentine singer's new album, a clubby tribute to the chameleonic sounds of the Latin rave underground, her titular protagonist would rather throw a drink in someone's face than keep quiet—she's all for making a scene. And against the electro-maximalism of TANYA's world, it feels better to beef.

Rozas' 2022 album, Vladi, explored a bubblier, more celestial palette. Her ethereal vocals and the songs' short runtimes channelled PinkPantheress' bedroom pop confections, never sticking around long enough to get heavy. TANYA swaps out the cutesiness for anger. The club isn't just a place to giggle with friends in the bathroom; it's an opportunity to let off some steam.

Rozas is a rising star in Buenos Aires' pop landscape, which revels in artifice, excess, and irreverence. She found her creative stride attending queer perreo raves after years of playing in the male-dominated Argentine rock scene. Alongside fellow porteñas like collaborators Six Sex and Chita, Rozas is carving out space for femme and queer experimentation. Their success coincides with years of feminist organizing in the Argentine music industry, including passage of a law to require a mandatory quota for women on festival lineups.

Although the heavy beats of TANYA are meant for raving, the lyrics aren't exclusively hedonistic. Apart from “BAD CHOICE,” an electrifying ode to saying “fuck it,” Rozas is more concerned about relationships outside the club. She understands that sweating it out is often the best way to cope. She thirsts for her toxic on-again-off-again fling on album highlight “ANTONIO,” writing about a guy she can't bear to shake. Her voice run through harsh distortion, she admits she's looking for someone to trap her. The crashing beats bleed into a sugary electronic whirlpool. It's as if she just hit her stride on Rainbow Road and pushed the other racers into the abyss.

Much of TANYA exists in a similarly feverish intensity. “UN ÁNGEL” feels like losing control of your body in the flow of a crowd, its jittery electronics spiraling into discord. Rozas leans into her penchant for gothic imagery, winking at the devil on her shoulder: “Posee un crucifijo dentro de su valija/No tengo confesiones, pues nunca he pecado/Solo mentí un poquito para estar a tu lado” (“He's got a crucifix in his suitcase/I have no confessions, because I never sinned/I only lied a little, to be by your side”). Rozas belts most of her lyrics, but despite the revved-up sound and omnipresent distortion, her voice never slides into monotony.

TANYA isn't all restless headbangers. Rozas cages her prickly persona and lets her softer side out to play on the back half of the album. On “RIDĺCULO,” she chronicles a failed relationship alongside Argentine indie rocker Santiago Motorizado over fuzzed-out synths. What begins as straightforward dream pop grows glitchy as it goes, but it doesn't have the same excitement as her chaotic electroclash. The jarring transition from fiery anthems to longing romantic interludes undercuts the record's conceptual unity. The quieter moments are more snooze than catharsis. But as a club provocateur, Rozas knows how to craft a heater.

Streamer Adin Ross clutches Drake's shoulder in giddy anguish. They've just lost $100,000 on Nine to Five, an online slot machine themed after office workers trapped in the rat race, with little cartoon icons of men with glasses and grime-stained typewriters. And they're about to do it again another seven times. “It's like a hit,” Ross cries excitedly, encouraging Drake to bet even more. Within 45 seconds, they lose enough money to buy an NYC penthouse. But it's just a drop in the bucket for Drake, who spends the entire Kick stream—itself a glorified ad for Stake, the crypto-based online casino they played on—talking about gambling. He puts up $100k on a weightlifting competition with Ross; he shouts out the UFC champion who recently scored him almost a million; he ponders the idea of betting on Ross' sports league Brand Risk. They have the gall to offer motivational speeches in the middle and end, some virtuous window dressing to an otherwise unsavory two and a half hours of gambling. “Clearly, it's not about winning, it's about being around the people you love,” Drake grins in the final minutes.

Maybe after a decade and a half of ruling the charts, the only thing that offers Aubrey Graham an escape from anhedonia is the fleeting euphoria of a lottery hit. When you have enough money to get anything you could possibly want, the only thing left is the unattainable—the dopamine that consumerist goods alone can't provide, the primordial himbo high of “money go way up” in a climactic instant. But even now you can see on his face that the thrill is gone, it doesn't feel the same as it once did. He's going through the motions, fulfilling a brand promo.

Drake reportedly signed a $100 million/year endorsement deal with Stake, and he's promoting the company more feverishly than his own music. His Instagram grid looks like he was hacked by a Bitcoin scammer who spammed fake testimonials. Watching their session the other night, where Drake prattled on about gambling calls as if they radiated a mythical force while Ross played the role of obsequious glazer, it felt like a rock bottom moment for the new era of streamer-musician collaborations. Drake has steadily moved along the streamer axis, from shouting out more positive role models like Kai Cenat to wasting hours gambling with xQc and Ross, who palled around with Andrew Tate and went full sycophant for Donald Trump.

The Curaçao-based Stake's comeup in the last few years has been legally murky. It's banned in the US, so the founders created a sister site where people in the country can play without using real money. But there aren't many guardrails to prevent US residents from using VPNs. It's already facing lawsuits from US plaintiffs who say they're running an illegal casino, as well as people accusing the company of exploiting their gambling addictions. Stake is at the forefront of a swarm of new betting platforms, from sports gambling sites like FanDuel to “prediction markets” like Kalshi and Polymarket, which let you bet on everything from tariffs to Eurovision winners. The company's revenues reportedly reached $4.7 billion in 2024. Drake becoming Stake's cultural mascot is insidious—he's marketing the app to millions of aspirational obsessives, turning his fanbase into a horde of gambling degenerates who trust their favorite influencers' baseless “calls” with divine faith. It's astrology for boys nursed on Barstool. It's even darker because Stake likely gives Drake credit to use for promotions, so there are no stakes to him going berserk with bets. He always wins.

The mainstream lust for gambling feels especially poignant in this Trumpian moment, where falsehoods become fact if you will it hard enough and you become a winner if you repeat loudly enough that you are one. We're awash with so many get-rich-quick fantasies, from AI-generated shortform slop to shitcoin rug-pulls to endless prediction markets. It speaks to how unstable and slippery money feels now, or at least how corporations want you to feel it is—that anyone can make a million in an afternoon as long as you hit the right buttons. You want to believe you're lucky, that you can brute force your way into getting a jackpot because you feel “W vibes” in the air, that you're the chosen one endowed with a god-bestowed gift. It's a kind of magical thinking promoted by the uber-rich, who gamble because they have way too much money, and often bought into by the poor, who desperately dream of succeeding but end up swindled. The infestation of this sort of attitude in music isn't a surprise, it fits right in alongside the way label execs bet on untested artists who get one song with mammoth numbers on TikTok. It's all deliriously insubstantial.

Drake started doing gambling streams back in 2022; he once apparently lost $20 million on roulette. Last November, he did an especially insipid livestream with xQc, where he burned $1 million in a couple of hours and complained after the Weeknd and Steve Lacy came on the speakers. His stream with Ross tried to be cooler than that—he plays hopecore music and a 454 song; he shouts out PlaqueBoyMax and crowns Ross with a glittering chain. But underneath all the friendly hi-jinks and props, this is a cut-and-dry ad with a dual purpose: to make Drake richer and provide some image recovery after his catastrophic beef with Kendrick. Little flashes of insecurity still shine through, like when he made everyone cut the music after Ross said he thought he could beat Drake in a fight; he tried to make Ross recant it immediately.

There's something like a musical manosphere nowadays, fanbases full of terminally online acolytes who worship artists with varying histories of grifting and misogyny. In the rap mainstream, the options for young fans can be pretty grim. There's the rage-or-death crew—the Travis Scotts and Opium moshpit pyros; the Kanye West Nazi cult; the Stake merchants like Drake, who'll only tease info about new albums if it's sandwiched between hours of gambling that lines his pockets. It's hard not to feel like the ghouls are taking over as musicians pander to soulless corporations, creators, anyone who gets them in the eyes and ears of teens. Watching the live chat's deluge of bigoted jokes, a waterfall of noxious brainrot, made it clear there are some people you don't want to court. Drake's too concerned with clutching onto the zeitgeist to self-reflect, but going full-throttle into this world is only a downward spiral.

Militarie Gun and Dazy have shared a new song. “Tall People Don't Live Long” is the second collaboration between the Los Angeles hardcore group and Richmond-based artist, following their 2022 joint single, “Pressure Cooker.” Watch the accompanying music video, directed and produced by Militarie Gun frontman Ian Shelton, below.

“What started as a joke between us turned into a real conversation about how sometimes people who have reached certain heights in life begin to look down on others,” Shelton said in a press statement. “‘Tall people' became our tongue-in-cheek term for anyone that's lost so much perspective that they think it's alright to make someone feel less-than. This song is about rejecting that attitude—the bigger they are, the harder they fall.”

“Tall People Don't Live Long” marks Militarie Gun's first new music since their 2024 single “Thought You Were Waving.” The band released its debut album, Life Under the Gun, in 2023, and James Goodson put out his latest project as Dazy, Otherbody, that same year.

7.1

Genre:

Folk/Country

Label:

Kill Rock Stars

Reviewed:

April 16, 2025

Sarah Mary Chadwick's music is often a difficult listen, but that's the whole point. Throughout her career she's dealt with heavy subjects, including the death of her father and her own suicide attempts, delivering every line with blunt honesty. It's a style consistent with other modern-day eccentrics like Joanna Sternberg and St. Lenox, artists who update and refine the so-called outsider singer-songwriter music of Daniel Johnston. So intimate is Chadwick's style that it can sound almost as if she's making up the songs as she goes along, simply setting her internal monologue to music, whether she's playing an 147-year-old organ on 2019's The Queen Who Stole the Sky or embracing lush chamber pop on 2020's Please Daddy and 2023's Messages to God.

Mostly, Chadwick sticks to her main instrument, the piano. On this album, Take Me Out to a Bar / What Am I, Gatsby?, she strips back as far as she can go, to just stark block chords and the occasional glissando. Engineer Chris Townend recorded the piano with contact mics, which pick up sound from direct physical vibrations rather than from the air. Once recording was complete, Townend played the entire thing back while holding down the sustain pedal, capturing the sound of the piano resonances and layering them into the mix. That simple choice gives the album the scale of Chadwick's more ornate records. Even as she's pushed back on the descriptor “raw” (“There's a lot of craft in what I do,” she told Bandcamp in 2019), this record's rawness is an aesthetic choice, not a default. If the video for Please Daddy single “When Will Death Come” suggested Amélie-esque whimsy, with golden lighting and sprightly choreography, this new music is willfully monochromatic, leaving us with just her scratchy alto.

About that alto: Though the songs are better structured, Chadwick's singing is less polished, with loose vocal doubles and frequent voice cracks. Seconds into “What Am I, Gatsby,” she sings, “Request a song right now/And I'll sing it from the he-a-a-art,” deliberately and cheekily off-key. Other off-key moments feel like a natural outcome of the raspier singing style. As evidenced by her discography, she could write more conventional songs and sing them well, but that's not what this album is for. Instead, it feels like one more exorcism of her demons before learning to coexist with them.

It's genuinely unusual to see Chadwick looking up, even if she nestles that optimism within a song characterizing Life as a chronic abuser. “I'm Not Clinging to Life” is suitably morbid, but there's an old-fashioned folk lilt to the melody. She sings about accepting hardship instead of wallowing in it: “I have lots of fun things/Planned to make up for how/He mistreated me badly/From birth until now.” Somehow, it's one of the more optimistic songs she's made. That resilience resurfaces on “The Show Musn't Go On” and “She Never Leant Upon a Bar,” two songs where Chadwick knowingly stops short of her darkest material. In “The Show Musn't Go On,” she departs a bar before the night goes sideways, reminding herself, “It's fine for me to take a little time to feel good.” Once again, it's a message with personal implications: By the time of the album's release, she was sober and adapting to a new diagnosis of Bipolar II, milestones she shared on social media. Gatsby, then, is the sound of someone learning to want to live.

							By 

	Jason Newman



TV on the Radio, the celebrated group whose experimental amalgam of rock, post-punk, electronic, and soul made it sui generis in the 2000s New York scene, knew it was time for a break. It was 2019, and after nearly 20 years and five albums together, the nonstop demands of recording and touring had taken its creative and physical toll.


	For co-founder Tunde Adebimpe — let's stick with “co-founder” and not “frontman” for reasons that will be explained later — it was a time to both recalibrate a bit and dig through demos that, for one reason or another, didn't make it to a TVOTR album.


	But in June of that year, someone broke into Adebimpe's garage and stole his laptop, 15 years of hard drives and all of his backups. “And tons, tons, tons of demos,” he says. “It's stuff that's meaningless to anyone else.” (His studio space in downtown Los Angeles was also the victim of a presumably unrelated break-in. “It felt a little cursed for a while,” Adebimpe says.)

	











	For more than 25 years, Adebimpe has quietly been one of culture's most creative multihyphenates. He was one of the first animators on MTV's turn-of-the-century claymation gorefest Celebrity Deathmatch before turning his attention to music — he remains the group's co-vocalist and principal songwriter, has made numerous guest appearances and recorded multiple side projects — and film. (Adebimpe has mingled indie performances like an acclaimed role in 2008's Rachel Getting Married with the bigger popcorn fare of Spider-Man: Homecoming, Twisters, and last year's Star Wars: Skeleton Crew.)




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Along the way, he's been a director, voice actor, art director, cartoonist — you get the idea. But having just turned 50, Adebimpe can now add a new appellation: solo artist.


Thee Black Boltz, co-produced by Wilder Zoby and out Friday via Sub Pop, is a devastatingly gorgeous listen colored by unimaginable loss yet imbued with optimism. In 2021, as Adebimpe was still mapping out the album, his 41-year-old sister Jumoke died suddenly of a heart attack. “The whole album is dedicated to her,” Adebimpe says. “She's probably the closest person in the world to me.”

	Adebimpe's voice has always had a comforting warmth belying the “basement hardcore shows” that soundtracked his teens. But tracks like “ILY,” a sparse elegy to Jumoke, and the skittering, Kid A-channeling “Drop” feel like sonic gut punches. The former, an album highlight, could somehow soundtrack both a wedding and a breakup; a paean to immortal love or the audio to that which was once cherished and now gone.

	











	Adebimpe, however, tries to remain upbeat on Boltz, attempting to turn life upheaval both globally and personally into pockets of exuberance. “Pinstack” sounds like a slightly fractured take on a Sixties pop song, while album closers “Somebody New” and “Streetlight Nuevo” veer more dance-pop and otherworldly keyboards, respectively.  


	Speaking to Rolling Stone in his Los Angeles garage in March, Adebimpe takes out a notebook filled with various artwork and rough musical references he looked toward for Boltz, which included everyone from Suicide, the Stooges, and Nation of Ulysses to Nick Drake, Bjork, and Tom Waits.


	The garage is filled with books, art supplies, a Mellotron and a small mixing board all befitting his diverse interests. A board with photos of Toni Morrison, one of Adebimpe's heroes, and Gerard Smith, the former TV on the Radio member who died in 2011, are never far from him. The band reconvened, sans founding member Dave Sitek, for a series of celebrated live shows last year. (They'll tour Europe and North America this summer.) But for now, Adebimpe is firmly in “solo mind.”

Numerous labels rejected this album. Why do you think that was?I'm so incredibly psyched to be on Sub Pop, a label that was responsible for me even thinking I could make music. It was early days in the pandemic and people were confused about touring and didn't want to take on any new acts. I also think it was that I'm not a young, sexy superstar who's…


Slow down, Tunde.Oh, it's all right. It's not negative. One of the things about hitting 50, you just know yourself. Maybe I'm an old, sexy pop star.


Did that affect your ego?One hundred percent for about two days. The first day, I was just like, “Oh, right, it's not 2008 and this isn't the band.” But it was good [because] I don't know what people are thinking and I shouldn't let that affect what I'm doing. And coming up in [the] punk-rock DIY scene doing basement hardcore shows, it's like, “If you tell me that I can't do something, the thousand ships that I'm going to launch with the words ‘fuck you' are going to be long and strong.” It was good to go back to zero and be like, “The great thing is it feels like nobody cares. So, we have to care and just have fun.”


How conscious were you of differentiating Boltz from TV on the Radio?With TV on the Radio songs, especially by [2014's] Seeds, [the band's last album], I'd gotten used to writing demos and thinking like, “Okay, I've got this part and I don't really have to worry about these other parts because I know [member] Kyp [Malone] will have an idea that goes there and I'm writing this with that negative space in it that I know that he or [members] Jaleel [Bunton] or Dave [Sitek] can fill in a great way.”

	











	I have a face-recognition blindness [with TVOTR] where I know that we made that, but I couldn't tell you how we did it. We get into this trance where we feel more about it than think. I guess I know what a TV on the Radio song sounds like, but whatever I'm writing is a combination of all the influences I've had musically since 16 or 17 when that stuff starts to drill itself into your head and all the detritus of that floating into whatever you're doing. The only way for me to make something that's definitely not a TV on the Radio record was if I made a country-rap record.


Did last year's shows almost feel like a victory lap of sorts? The clichéd “elder statesmen of rock” return.Victory lap sounds a little braggy, but it's just like you get to reconnect with people who've been with you from the start, and you get to see so many new fans. And that's one of the coolest things about going back out is realizing there are people who — it sounds so weird to say — but just were not born when we started.


How were the crowds different than in the 2000s?One of the coolest things is there were way more Black and queer kids and people of color than when we were starting and [seeing] it be a regular thing instead of this weird fucking anomaly. You're talking to these young punks, and it was just like, “We would've been best friends in high school, but you weren't around. And I'm so happy that anything I've done has led you in this direction.”


I want to detour into nostalgia a little because TV on the Radio almost feel like a totem of a particular era, time and place for fans of a certain age. What does the word “nostalgia” mean to you?I think it's a gratitude for all the things that happened to bring me and us and anyone who's listening to this point. There's so many other musicians … Bartees Strange told me, “When I saw the ‘Wolf Like Me' performance on Letterman, it was a big part of me thinking, ‘I want to do that.'”


You once said “I don't know who that person is” when looking at photos of yourself from years ago.You have a vague idea, but you can be a little jealous of this person who had no idea how wrong things could go. So you went full on as far as you could and didn't have any fear about that because they didn't know what to be scared of. It's funny to hear about things like electroclash being this huge movement, and I'm kind of like, “electroclash was two bars over the course of a month and a half.” But nostalgia is not something I'm interested in right now. The pandemic was one of the first times in my life that I was like, “Wow, I'm looking backwards more than forward” and that's a really unsettling feeling.

	











There's a poignant line on the new album from “Magnetic” about being in “the age of tenderness and rage.”Yeah, there's this British photographer named Misan Harriman, who takes beautiful, moving pictures at protests. He took a photo of someone at a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020 with a sign that said “This is the age of rage and tenderness.” It encapsulated to me the feeling of the times. Sometimes, it feels like there's waves of evil coming towards you, and you have to combat those by being a decent person and standing up for people who cannot stand up for themselves. But to do that, you have to be open to those feelings. You can't shut yourself off if you don't want to get steamrolled by racists and sexists and fascists. There's a lot to rage against, and it's because you have some kind of love in your heart that you want to fight.


The day after Trump was elected last November, you posted a quote from Toni Morrison about, “This is precisely the time when artists go to work.” What does “work” look like for you?That's also the question: What role does art have in all of this? I don't know. It might be really naive, but for me, it's making music or art that connects people and lets them know that there's a place for them in this and encourages people. It could even just be dance tracks, if you need to flail around in your room in the morning so you can go out and recognize everyone as human.


	I'm not someone who is striving for a bunch of attention. But if someone's going to be pointed in my direction because of something I'm doing that they like, I feel obligated to share information with them. If I feel like something's fucked up, I'm going to let someone know this is fucked up and it doesn't have to be this way. The problem is getting it to the people who really need to have a point of view expressed to them in a way that can resonate with them. I have not figured out how exactly that can happen.


“ILY” finds you talking to your sister. How difficult was it to write?The circumstances around it were hard, but writing it wasn't difficult. I have such an admiration for simple and effective songs because you can hear something that sounded like it's there forever. It's pretty much just a letter to her saying, all of these messy feelings boil down to the fact that our love remains. You think about them even more than you did while they were here. 

	











	[After her death], I was like, “I don't think I'm going to finish this record. I actually don't want to do anything right now.” But that's the great thing about the safety net of art: I've got a built-in thing where it's just like, “Well, you're thinking about this. You're just going to drive yourself fucking crazy until you write it … and put it in a place where you can look at it like a scale model of these feelings.” 


How do you feel she manifested herself on the album?We were four years apart, but we were twins, essentially.… I feel so lucky to have been this particular person's brother and so lucky that she was my sister because we got to kick through this weird-ass world together and had such a shared affection for things and were each other's biggest cheerleaders. Whenever one of us felt like, “I'm not really sure about this,” the other one was just like, “What the fuck are you talking about? You're the shit. I've been around for 20 years and there's nothing about you that doesn't let me know that you can do whatever the fuck you want. And I'll always be here to tell you that.”


	When I flamed out after she passed away, one of the things that kicked in was she would've been like, “No, you got to go harder now. You have to make good on the promise that you made to yourself forever ago that this is your path and that you're not going to shy away from feeling these things. And that maybe if you put all of this shit in a place, it will help someone out the way that it's helped you out.” I'm going to give you a few words of advice or solace or let you know how I worked my way through this so you know that you can do it.


You've talked a lot in the past about having stage fright. Does being a solo artist amplify that fear?I don't know if it's easier, but it's just normal now. If you're in cold weather, you're just really sharp about shit. I'm very aware of everything. I think it's mostly having a slight anxiety about wanting to do the best that you can do and leave enough space where you can still play with what you're doing. It's more of a giddiness where you're just like, “Oh shit, I don't know what's going to happen.” And that's really exciting. I would love these shows to be really raucous.


	I was reading an article a few years ago where Kim Gordon was talking about how music and shows don't feel dangerous anymore and I knew exactly what she was talking about. Where there's some moments where you're just like, “Oh shit, should I be this close to the stage?”

	











You occupy an interesting perch when it comes to fame and celebrity. You get stopped in certain places but from the outside, you always felt like a reluctant rock star. TV on the Radio always felt like a repudiation of the genre's worst impulses.I just don't … I don't know. For me, in whatever scenes I was coming up in, a rock star was a bad thing to me. It was a negative. Where it was sort of like, I don't have a Jimmy Page or Bono or any of the “masters,” I guess. That's not my floor of the building. I don't even like the term frontman.


Why not?It just sounds so gross.


You were an usher at New York's Film Forum in your early twenties. What's the best story from those days?I don't know if I should say. It was a sleepy enough theater at points where when we went to take the garbage out, a co-worker and I would just get stoned and come back in and call out the movies in a really childish way. There's this movie called La Maman et la Putain, which [translates to] The Mother and the Whore. It's a great movie, but these two fucking 20-year-olds yelling, like, “6:30 showing for The Mother and the Whore!” Very un-Film Forum. The manager was just being like, “Guys, could you just chill out?” And we're just like, “What do you mean chill out? We're just ushing. We're ushers.”

What's the status of a new TV on the Radio album?We're not doing anything right now, but the nice thing about these shows is that it's like, “I don't know what's going to happen and I'm fine with that because as a band, I know that we've built this motorcycle and we know how to ride it. We can do wheelies and donuts, all of that.” Just coming back together and being like, “This is something that we know how to do and can have fun with that.” We'll probably figure it out over the course of this tour. It's just fun again.


Can you start to envision what it looks like or are you firmly in solo mind?I'm in solo mind, but everyone's always writing and I've got a bunch of stuff that just didn't make it onto this record that I could see if the band wanted to do it. Whenever we do things separately and come back together, it's like everyone went to either their little university or vision quest and brings back what they learned from there.

Aimee Lou Wood revealed that Sarah Sherman sent her flowers after The White Lotus actress called out Saturday Night Live for airing a “mean and unfunny” sketch about her. 


	On Tuesday, Wood shared a photo of a colorful bouquet on her Instagram Stories, thanking Sherman “for the beautiful flowers.” Sherman herself hasn't publicly addressed the backlash following SNL‘s “The White Potus” sketch, which aired on Saturday night, but Wood has been vocal about her dislike of the portrayal. 


	The five-minute sketch spoofed Mike White's beloved HBO series and gave it a MAGA update, with Jon Hamm, the episode's guest star, playing an RFK Jr. version of Walton Goggins‘ character, Rick Hatchett. In the skit, he contemplates removing fluoride from the country's drinking water. Sherman appears as Wood's character Chelsea, parodying her heavy Manchester accent and prominent teeth. Sherman responds to Hamm's plan by saying, “Fluoride? What's that?”


	Wood called the spoof “mean and unfunny” in a series of Instagram Stories. “Such a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple of weeks ago,” she wrote. “Yes, take the piss for sure – that's what the show is about – but there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?”

	She added, “I don't mind caricature – I understand that's what SNL is. But the rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on … Not Sarah Squirm's fault and not hating on her. Hating on the concept.” The response spurred a slew of think-pieces and supportive comments from fans, and Wood later wrote that she got “apologies from SNL.”

	Goggins, notably, enjoyed the sketch, adding more fuel to the flame that there is a feud between himself and Wood. The actor posted on the official SNL Instagram page, “Hahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg.” He also shared the sketch on his IG Stories, captioning it, “SMASHING. Jon… I knew I was miscast.” That post has since been deleted.


	Goggins' and Wood's vastly different reactions to the skit increased speculation about a possible rift between the two actors. Since the Season Three finale, the rumor mill has been churning heavily, especially after fans noticed that the two no longer follow each other on Instagram (despite both also sharing heartfelt and earnest tributes to the show and their characters).

Gayle King has been on the receiving end of backlash and criticism from pop fans, outspoken celebrities, and even some of her own friends since returning to Earth from the 11-minute space flight she took on Monday with Jeff Bezos' space tourism company Blue Origin. The broadcast journalist, who overcame an intense fear of flying to experience the trip, issued a challenge of her own to those expressing criticism: Blast off or back off. 


	“My question is, have y'all been to space? Go to space or go to Blue Origin and see what they do and then come back and say, ‘This is a terrible thing,'” King said on Extra, noting that she wishes “people would do more due diligence” before calling out the expenses associated with the flight and its somewhat flawed mission statement. “Every time a flight goes up, they get some type of information that can be used for something else,” she added, referencing the Blue Origin's goal “to figure out a way to harness the waste here and put it in space to make the Earth a better place.”

	











	NASA previously reported that there are already tons of orbital debris, or “space junk,” moving at top speeds around low Earth orbit, or LEO. “Due to the rate of speed and volume of debris in LEO, current and future space-based services, explorations, and operations pose a safety risk to people and property in space and on Earth,” the agency stated in 2023. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's possible that Blue Origin made enough of a compelling argument to get King and her fellow capsule occupants — singer Katy Perry, journalist (and Bezos' fiancée) Lauren Sánchez, sexual assault survivor advocate and Nobel nominee Amanda Nguyễn, film producer and documentarian Kerianne Flynn, and former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe — to have faith in Bezos' mission. Framing it as a feminist milestone for it being the first all-female space flight since 1963, when cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman in space, couldn't have hurt, either.


	“I know there are cranky Yankees, I know there are some haters, but I'm not gonna let people steal my joy and steal the joy of what we did or what we accomplished that day,” King said. “I'm just not going to let it in. I'm not. And these are some of my friends that are throwing shade!”

	Regardless, others haven't been convinced. 


	“I think that this space mission is confusing to people because seeing women and people of color in spaces like science and politics that have not previously included them feels and looks like, really looks like — optically looks like — progress,” Emily Ratajkowski shared in a TikTok video that questioned the point of the flight. “But the truth is, is that having a man who has gained his power and become a part of the one percent purely through exploitation and greed deciding to take his fiancée and a few other famous women to space for space tourism is not progress.”


	Olivia Munn added: “I know this is probably obnoxious, but like, it's so much money to go to space, and there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. What's the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it's a bit gluttonous. Space exploration was to further our knowledge and to help mankind. What are they gonna do up there that has made it better for us down here?” 


	King expressed disappointment toward people framing the voyage as a “ride,” noting a double standard in the response to the all-female trip versus the 10-suborbital Blue Origin flight with humans aboard that have carried men into space. “You never see a man, a male astronaut, who's going up in space and they say, ‘Oh, he took a ride,'” she said. “It's always referred to as a flight or a journey, so I feel that's a little disrespectful to what the mission was and the work that Blue Origin does.”

	Still, she acknowledged that she does understand where some of them are coming from. “I think it's good that we can really address it,” she said, “because I was one of those people before I went on this flight and before I became educated. ‘Why are we spending so much money on space when there's so much to do on Earth?' I was one of those people.” She also knows that Blue Origin's flights aren't necessarily financially accessible, but considered: “If you get enough people who are interested, it doesn't have to be that expensive.”

	Blue Origin and its passengers have not publicly revealed the total cost of a New Shepard spaceflight, but the website for the aerospace company does note that “Blue Origin will collect a $150,000 USD fully refundable deposit to begin the order process.” A seat on its first-ever flight auctioned for $28 million. 


	When King returned to Earth, she reflected on what she experienced during her three to four minutes of weightlessness. “You look down at the planet and you think, that's where we came from?” she said. “To me it's such a reminder about how we need to do better, be better.”

Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman play a married couple on the verge of entering the violent arena of divorce in the new trailer for The Roses, a “reimagining” of the novel and 1989 film The War of the Roses.


	In the domestic black comedy directed by Meet the Parents' Jay Roach, Cumberbatch and Colman's marriage goes downhill when the former loses his job and the latter's professional career as a chef takes off.


	Thrust into a Mr. Mom role, the two constantly and comically bicker, with Cumberbatch admitting he has “sporadic” hatred for his wife. Things escalate throughout the trailer, with ruined dinners and heated divorce hearings ultimately leading to Colman pointing a gun at Cumberbatch in the lavish home the couple are forced to share.


	“Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids,” Searchlight Pictures said in its synopsis. “But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing – as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites.”

	1989's The War of the Roses, based on the Warren Adler novel, starred Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner — the pair previously starred in Romancing the Stone and The Jewel of the Nile together — as the ill-fated couple (though Douglas played a successful lawyer and Turner an exasperated homemaker), with Danny DeVito both directing the film and co-starring as Douglas' divorce lawyer.

	Wilmer Gutiérrez last saw his son the morning of Feb. 24. Later that day, his nephew called to tell him that 19-year-old Merwil Gutiérrez had been arrested just steps from their shared apartment in the Bronx. “The officers grabbed him and two other boys right at the entrance to our building,” he recalled. “One said, ‘No, he's not the one,' like they were looking for someone else. But the other said, ‘Take him anyway.'” 


	Merwil was among the 238 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, according to Documented, a newsroom reporting on immigrant communities in New York City. He has no criminal record, neither in Venezuela nor the U.S, per the outlet, and does not have any tattoos, which is one of the criteria ICE officers use to claim migrants are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.


	William Parra, an attorney at Inmigración Al Día, the law firm representing his case, says Merwil's detention was unjustified as he has an immigration court case pending with his father and was taking the proper steps to formalize their situation. “Merwil was detained for hanging out with friends and was at the wrong place at the wrong time. ICE was not looking for him, nor is there any evidence whatsoever that Merwil was in any gang,” said Parra.

	











	The father and son arrived in the U.S. in 2023, along with Merwil's grandfather and cousin. The family had fled Nicolás Maduro's dictatorship and came to America in hopes of economic stability. Before he was arrested, Merwil had received his immigration papers and had a court date scheduled for February 2027.


	Wilmer has struggled to understand why his teenage son was sent to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison tied to allegations of human rights abuses. “I feel like my son was kidnapped,” said Wilmer. “I've spent countless hours searching for him, going from one precinct to another, speaking with numerous people who kept referring me elsewhere. Yet, after all this, no one has given me any information or provided a single document about his case.”

	“I could have understood if he'd been sent back to Venezuela,” he said before asking: “But why to a foreign country he's never even been to?”


CBS' 60 Minutes released a report that found 75 percent of the Venezuelans — 179 men — deported by the Trump administration in March had no apparent criminal record. The migrants — who the administration claimed had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua — were sent to El Salvador without any due process.

	











	The Department of Homeland Security later admitted it had wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an innocent man with protected status, to CECOT due to an “administrative error.” Despite being ordered by the Supreme Court to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., the Trump administration has openly disregarded the ruling.

	On Tuesday, Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura — who is an American citizen — pleaded with the Trump administration and El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, to “stop playing political games with the life of Kilmar.” 


	“Today is 34 days after his disappearance, and I stand before you filled with a spirit that refuses to bring down,” she said before a crowd of reporters and protestors. “Enough is enough,” she concluded. “My family can't be robbed of another day without seeing Kilmar. This administration has already taken so much from my children, from Kilmar's mother, brother, sisters, and me.”

It is certainly no secret that Real Madrid are a force of nature when it comes to the Champions League.

The Spanish giants' remarkable ability to completely defy all the odds and consistently turn teams over in the dying moments is why Arsenal still - despite their 3-0 lead - have their work cut out at the Bernabeu on Wednesday night.

Eight days ago, two stunning Declan Rice free-kicks and a crisp finish by Mikel Merino sent the Emirates into raptures and put the Gunners in a commanding position to reach the last four of the European Cup for only the third time in their history. 

But a glance at the Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, several of their star men and the thousands of travelling fans would have you fooled at the size of the task before the LaLiga side in the second leg.

Los Blancos are confident in their ability to overturn the mammoth deficit and their history of dumbfounding escapes is likely to play a major factor in why.  

Ahead of the mouth-watering clash in the Spanish capital, here are Mail Sport's top 10 picks for Real Madrid's trademark Champions League comebacks.

Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich  (agg 4-3) - 2023-24

Alphonso Davies' silky curling strike for the Germans was enough to keep Madrid at bay until 88 minutes had passed, and it was an unlikely hero in Joselu that would decide the game. 

The Spanish forward was brought on by Ancelotti as Thomas Tuchel took talisman Harry Kane off, and gave the performance of his life, scoring two goals right at the death to send Madrid into the Champions League final.

Manchester City 2-3 Real Madrid (agg 6-3) - 2024-25

This game had non-stop drama to it, even off the pitch, with City fans displaying a banner of Rodri smooching the Ballon D'or to rub salt in the wounds of Vinicius Jr. 

Erling Haaland's 80th minute penalty put City in the driving seat, with just 10 minutes to see the match out, but Madrid proved they are still as relentless as they've ever been, as goals from Brahim Diaz and a last-gasp winner from England star Jude Bellingham granted Madrid the win.

Real Madrid 4-2 Bayern Munich (agg 6-3) - 2016-17

Madrid had already had to stage a comeback to win 2-1 at the Allianz Arena in the first leg of this tie. Surely, they wouldn't do it twice? 

‘Mr Champions League' himself managed to bring Madrid level following Robert Lewandowski's spot conversion, but Sergio Ramos took everyone by surprise by scoring an own goal, making the tie even on aggregate. 

Arturo Vidal was then sent off for the Bavarians before a brace from Ronaldo and a goal from Asensio put the final nail in the coffin.

Real Madrid 5-2 Borussia Dortmund – 2024

For most teams, coming back from 2-0 to win the game would be great enough, but Madrid – as always – took it even further. After finding themselves 2-0 down after just half an hour, they had to find an answer and find it quick. 

A goal from Antonio Rudiger, an outstanding hattrick from Vinicius Jr. and a goal in the 83rd minute from Lucas Vazquez saw them sink Dortmund in a manner many would say only Madrid are capable of.

Real Madrid 2-3 Chelsea (agg 5-4) - 2021-22

Madrid came into this fixture in prime position to breeze past Chelsea to the last four of the Champions League after their 3-1 victory at Stamford Bridge, but it was nearly a different story altogether. 

Goals from Mason Mount, Timo Werner and Rudiger almost saw the Blues pull off a miraculous comeback. 

That was of course until an audacious trivela assist from Modric allowed Rodrygo to score. Much like that season, though, it proved to be the Karim Benzema show, as the Frenchman headed in the winner to break Chelsea hearts.

Real Madrid 3-1 Manchester City (agg 6-5) - 2021-22

With City having a two-goal lead after 90 minutes, Guardiola's men had almost booked their spot in the Champions League final. But Rodrygo had other plans as he converted Benzema's cross in the final minute. 

The Brazilian then did the unthinkable, heading home from Marco Asensio's flick-on with just seconds left on the clock. Madrid rose from the ashes yet again before they would meet Liverpool in the penultimate game.

Liverpool 2-5 Real Madrid (agg 6-2) - 2022-23

This round of 16 game saw the Reds explode out of the starting blocks as Darwin Nunez's sublime 4th minute flick was followed by Mohamed Salah scoring 10 minutes after. 

The tide would swiftly turn in Madrid's favour, though, as Vinicius Jr's superb brace clawed the away side back into game before the half-time whistle. Centre-back Eder Militao put Madrid in front after break, and just to really kick Liverpool when they were down, Benzema's brace decimated Liverpool's hopes of gaining any sort of advantage heading into the reverse fixture.

Real Madrid 3-1 Paris Saint-Germain (agg 3-2) - 2021-22

A brilliant solo winner from Kylian Mbappe snatched a win for PSG at the Parc des Princes and it would be the superstar winger who drew first blood in this game to double his side's lead on aggregate. 

This was before Benzema pulled something almighty from his sleeve. 

The legendary striker rescued his team by netting an emphatic 17-minute hattrick, with the third being a tidy low-driven finish. This saw him ascend above Alfredo Di Stefano to become Los Blancos' third highest all-time scorer at the time.

Real Madrid 3-0 Wolfsburg (agg 3-2) - 2015-16

The German side were a whisker away from what would have been one of their greatest European nights following their shock 2-0 win from the first leg. 

But in typical fashion, Ronaldo managed to single-handedly drag Madrid out of the depths by scoring a hattrick, with the first two goals closing the deficit in just 17 minutes, before a stunning free kick sealed the deal for him and his side, scoring his third hattrick of that Champions League campaign.

Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico - 2013-14

It is safe to say that Ramos cemented his status as a Real Madrid legend in their ‘La Decima' Champions League final against their bitter rivals. 

Before the defender fired in an exquisite header in the 93rd minute, taking the game into extra time. Real wasted no time after the full 90, with goals from Gareth Bale and Marcelo brutally snatching the trophy away from Atletico, not to mention Ronaldo ripping his shirt off after he added fuel to Atletico's fire via the penalty spot.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Shakespeare Theatre Company will present a strictly limited two-week engagement of the thrilling new play, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, a special add-on production for the 25/26 Season. An original story set in the world of the terrifying Paranormal Activity film franchise, the production will run in STC's Harman Hall from January 28 – February 7, 2026. The show is presented in a co-production with Chicago Shakespeare Theater, Center Theatre Group, and American Conservatory Theater.

The haunting thriller is written by celebrated playwright Levi Holloway, whose Tony-nominated Grey House premiered on Broadway in 2023. The production is directed by Felix Barrett, pioneering founder and artistic director of the acclaimed Punchdrunk—whose immersive Sleep No More played more than 5,000 performances in a record-breaking 14-year run.

Synopsis: James and Lou move from Chicago to London to escape their past…. An original story set in the world of the terrifying Paranormal Activity film franchise, this thrilling new play will haunt you long after the lights go out. We can't say anything else. 

“Writing Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage, collaborating with Felix Barrett in London—working to create an actual nightmare—has been a dream,” said playwright Holloway. “We strived to create something impossible, mixing the familiar with the uncanny, heart with horror. American audiences have a nose for honesty on stage and little patience for anything else. They'll find it here, right alongside all the mischief we've made to trouble their sleep.”

Tickets for the STC run of the show are currently available exclusively to  25/26 Season subscribers. Tickets will go on sale to the general public later this summer.

All Things Go Festival 2025 has revealed the lineup of the 11th DC-area edition, with headliners including Noah Kahan, Doechii, Lucy Dacus, Clairo, Kesha, and The Marías.

An infamous haunted house in Massachusetts could be yours — for $1.2 million.

The S.K. Pierce Mansion at 4 West Broadway in Gardner is officially on the market for just over a million dollars, its listing states.

The seven-bed, three-and-a-half bath Victorian home, built in 1875, spans three full floors “of historic grandeur and chilling intrigue.”

The house has been cited as the second most haunted house in Massachusetts and the ninth most haunted house in the country, according to the mansion's website. It has famously been explored on TV shows like “Ghost Hunters,” “Ghost Adventure” and “My Ghost Story.”

Sylvester K. Pierce was a wealthy businessman whose successful furniture company helped establish Gardner as “Chair City” during the Industrial Revolution, MassLive previously reported. Pierce and his two wives, three sons and many staff members are among many spirits that paranormal investigators believe still reside in the home.

Some notable locations in the mansion include the “red room” on the second floor where Pierce's first wife died just weeks after moving in. Another spot filled with haunting energy is the second-floor bedroom in which Finnish immigrant Eino Saari burned to death in 1963.

For a chilling new living space, check out the mansion's listing here.

When a person passes away, family members and loved ones handle it in a variety of different ways. They will grieve for a certain amount of time, and then they may see a therapist or to help process the loss. Sometimes, they'll pursue more unique measures and consult a psychic to see if they can connect with the person who has passed to the afterlife.

Matt Fraser, is one such psychic, who is  from Rhode Island. Along with being a psychic medium, he's also a prolific author and a reality TV star on the show “Meet the Frasers”. He is taking the stage at The Park Theatre in Cranston on April 24.

We had a talk ahead of the event about his childhood and his career before becoming a professional psychic, among other things.

Rob Duguay: Being from Providence, what was your upbringing like, and was there anything in your youth that made you realize that you could be a psychic, like a certain event or interaction?

Matt Fraser: I grew up in a psychic family, but I didn't always embrace my gift. My mother and grandmother were both psychic, so I was surrounded by the spirit world from a young age. As a child, I would see and hear spirits at night, which was terrifying for me. I remember waking up to voices in my room and seeing figures at the foot of my bed. My grandmother always told me, “Talk to them! They just have messages to deliver”, but as a kid, I wanted nothing to do with it.

It wasn't just at home, I also had these experiences at school. I attended Stadium Elementary School (in Cranston), and I would see and hear spirits even in the classroom. I would tell the other kids about them, and they would run and tell the teacher. I quickly learned to be quiet about it because nobody else understood what I was experiencing. At the time, I didn't know that what I was seeing was real, and I certainly didn't know that one day it would become my life's work.

It wasn't until later, as a teenager, that I realized I had a gift that could bring healing to others. That's when I decided to stop running from it and embrace my calling.

RD: Before becoming a professional psychic, you were trained as a paramedic and a physician assistant while eventually working as an emergency medical technician. The medical field can be stressful, so do you feel that your psychic abilities give you a different perspective on certain situations? If so, how?

MF: Absolutely. When I was working in the medical field, I saw firsthand the thin veil between life and death. There were moments when I could sense a patient's spirit leaving their body or feel the presence of their loved ones from the other side waiting for them. It gave me a deep understanding that life doesn't end when we take our last breath. I also believe that my intuition helped me in ways I couldn't explain at the time, whether it was anticipating a medical emergency before it happened or just knowing what a patient needed in the moment.

Eventually, I realized that my true calling wasn't in medicine, but in helping people find healing and closure through mediumship.

RD: What are your thoughts on this upcoming show at the Park Theatre?

MF: Rhode Island is home, and performing here is like being with family. Most of the people in my audience have been with me since the very beginning. They've watched my journey from the time I first started giving readings to now taking my gift across the country. The Park Theatre is such a special venue, and it holds a lot of history for our community. It's exciting for me to come back to a place so close to home, where I know the audience personally connects with what I do. I always say that my events feel like a big family gathering, and in Rhode Island, that's especially true.

RD: What can people who haven't seen you on stage before expect from the upcoming show?

MF: Expect the unexpected! My shows are an emotional rollercoaster, but in the best way. One moment you'll be laughing, the next you'll be crying, and before you know it, you'll be blown away by the connections being made. I don't pick the people I read, the spirits do, and they have a way of making sure the messages get to the right person at the right time. It's not just a show, it's an experience. Whether you receive a reading or not, you'll leave with a new understanding of the afterlife and the reassurance that your loved ones are always with you.

RD: After the show, what are your plans for the coming months? Are you working on another book, or do you have any other projects?

MF: I'm always working on something. Right now, I'm traveling across the country with my live events, connecting people with their loved ones in spirit. I'm also working on new classes and workshops to help people develop their own psychic abilities, and yes, I do have another book in the works. I can't share too much just yet, but it's something I'm really excited about. My goal is always to help people find comfort, healing, and inspiration, whether it's through a reading, a live event, or the words I put on the page.

The quasi-periodic eruptions of X-rays from a black hole 300 million light-years away are unlike any researchers have ever seen before.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In December 2019, an ordinary galaxy 300 million light-years from us in the constellation Virgo suddenly woke up. After decades of inactivity, the black hole at the galaxy's heart burst with light. Now, the cosmic monster appears to be doing something that is forcing astronomers to re-evaluate their understanding of these massive celestial bodies.

The black hole now gives off powerful X-rays at nearly regular intervals. These outbursts are known as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), and have been observed emitting from other black holes. But the bursts observed here are up to 100 times more powerful than normal, according to new research. First observed in February 2024 by astronomers at Valparaiso University in Chile, this behavior grants scientists an unprecedented view of a black hole that seems to be awakening from dormancy with no sign of going back to sleep.

Led by the Valparaiso team, a group of researchers published their observations of the black hole's QPE in a study on April 11 in the journal Nature Astronomy. In addition to giving astronomers a novel view of black holes, these events are also spurring researchers to reconsider how black holes behave.

""This is the first time we have observed such an event in a black hole that seems to be waking up,"" the paper's first author Lorena Hernández-García, an astronomy researcher at Valparaiso University, said in a statement. ""This rare event provides an opportunity for astronomers to observe a black hole's behaviour in real time.""

The galaxy, called SDSS1335+0728, first called attention to itself in 2019 when it unexpectedly started gleaming. At that time, astronomers from the European Southern Observatory studied the event by consulting NASA's Swift X-ray space telescope and data from the eROSITA X-ray telescope. After investigating the galaxy's central region — nicknamed Ansky — they concluded that the flash resulted from Ansky's massive black hole beginning an active phase.

But in February 2024, Hernández-García's team noticed bursts of previously undetected X-rays emanating from Ansky, caught by X-ray space telescopes XMM-Newton and NASA's NICER, Chandra, and Swift. These QPEs are momentary, recurring X-ray flares. Astronomers believe QPEs result from interaction between accretion disks — the swirling ring of red-hot matter that surrounds a black hole — and nearby objects, like a star or a smaller black hole.

But Ansky's QPEs aren't typical. They're remarkable because they last 10 times longer and are 10 times more luminous than average QPEs, the researchers said. Persisting for more than four days, they each release one hundred times more energy than what's expected. These QPEs reveal a whole new aspect of black holes that don't fit neatly into astronomers' prior understanding of the cosmic bodies.

In particular, these unusual QPEs can help broaden our understanding of how these events occur. For example, there's no evidence that Ansky has shredded a star into its accretion disk, which is what researchers currently believe triggers most QPEs. Therefore, there must be another explanation for the impetus that causes the QPEs in this case.

The X-ray bursts may instead come from energetic shocks in the accretion disk spurred by a small celestial object repeatedly disrupting its orbiting material, according to the paper.

—Black holes can destroy planets — but they can also lead us to thriving alien worlds. Here's how.

—Black holes may obey the laws of physics after all, new theory suggests

It's also possible that these repeated QPEs come from gravitational waves. The European Space Agency's upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set to launch in 2035, may confirm that connection by detecting gravitational waves with greater fidelity than ever before.

For now, Ansky is reshaping how we conceive of black holes.

""Studying Ansky will help us to better understand black holes and how they evolve,"" Hernández-García said.

Mark Zuckerberg departs E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House in Washington, DC, on April 14. 

Seven years ago Mark Zuckerberg floated the possibility of spinning off Instagram from his social media empire amid rising regulatory scrutiny of the technology sector and an increasing concern that the photo sharing app was “cannibalizing” the success of Facebook.

Writing in a May 2018 message to senior leaders at his company, the billionaire acknowledged that he thought the platforms may be broken up in the next five to 10 years, and it was worth exploring whether the executives should get ahead of this possible outcome.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The World Trade Organization warned on Wednesday that the outlook for global trade has ""deteriorated sharply"" in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs regime.

""The outlook for global trade has deteriorated sharply due to a surge in tariffs and trade policy uncertainty,"" the WTO said in its latest ""Global Trade Outlook and Statistics"" report out Wednesday.

Based on the tariffs currently in place, and including a 90-day suspension of ""reciprocal tariffs,"" the volume of world merchandise trade is now expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025, before posting a ""modest"" recovery of 2.5% in 2026.

The decline is anticipated to be particularly steep in North America, where exports are forecast to drop by 12.6% this year.

The WTO also warned that ""severe downside risks exist,"" including the application of ""reciprocal"" tariffs and a broader spillover of policy uncertainty, ""which could lead to an even sharper decline of 1.5% in global goods trade,"" particularly hurting export-oriented, least-developed countries.

The recent tariff disturbances follow a strong year for world trade in 2024, during which merchandise trade grew 2.9% and commercial services trade expanded by 6.8%, the WTO said.

The new estimate of a 0.2% decline in world trade for 2025 is nearly 3 percentage points lower than it would have been under a ""low tariff"" baseline scenario, the WTO added, and marks a significant reversal from the start of the year when the trade body's economists expected to see continued trade expansion supported by improving macroeconomic conditions.

""Risks to the forecast include the implementation of the currently suspended reciprocal tariffs by the United States, as well as a broader spillover of trade policy uncertainty beyond U.S.-linked trade relationships,"" the WTO said.

""If enacted, reciprocal tariffs would reduce world merchandise trade growth by an additional 0.6 percentage points, posing particular risks for least-developed countries (LDCs), while a spreading of trade policy uncertainty (TPU) would shave off a further 0.8 percentage points. Taken together, the reciprocal tariffs and spreading TPU would lead to a 1.5% decline in world merchandise trade volume in 2025.""

Trump stunned trading partners and global markets in early April, when he announced a raft of so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from more than 180 countries. Beijing was hit the hardest of all, with the U.S. duty on Chinese imports now effectively totaling 145%. China in turn struck back at Washington with retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% on U.S. imports.

The tariffs between China and the U.S. will likely to lead to a ""drastic contraction"" of trade between the two, Ralph Ossa, chief economist at the WTO, told CNBC's Silvia Amaro on Wednesday.

Widespread market turbulence following the tariffs announcement prompted a temporary climbdown by Trump, with the president last week announcing that the new duties on imports from most trading partners would be reduced to 10% for 90 days in order to allow for trade negotiations with Washington's counterparts.

The WTO said in its Wednesday report that the impact of recent trade policy changes is likely to vary sharply from region to region.

In the adjusted forecast, North America now subtracts 1.7 percentage points from global merchandise trade growth in 2025, turning the overall figure negative.

Meanwhile, Asia and Europe continue to contribute positively, but less than in the baseline scenario, with Asia's input halved to 0.6 percentage point.

The disruption in U.S.-China trade is expected ""to trigger significant trade diversion,"" the WTO added, raising concerns among third markets about increased competition from China.

""Chinese merchandise exports are projected to rise by 4% to 9% across all regions outside North America as trade is redirected. At the same time, U.S. imports from China are expected to fall sharply in sectors such as textiles, apparel and electrical equipment, creating new export opportunities for other suppliers able to fill the gap,"" the trade organization remarked, noting that this could open the door for some least-developed countries to increase their exports to the U.S. market.

Many WTO members have raised the issue of trade diversion, Ossa said.

""But one thing that's really important to keep in mind is that this is a two-way street in a way, if you think about European firms for example trying to export cars to the United States, they also face a 25% tariff now and they will also need to find new destination markets for these products. So, its not just Chinese goods coming into Europe for example but its also European goods that need new customers,"" he said.

Ossa added that it was important for these effects to be managed in a cooperative way.

Follow:


            US Sen. Chris Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador Wednesday that he was unable to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia in the maximum-security mega-prison where he is being held.
    


            Instead, the Democrat announced he met with the Salvadoran vice president and vowed to “keep pressing” for answers and the man's release.
    


            “There will be more members of Congress coming,” Van Hollen said in an emotional media availability. “This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, so it cannot continue.”
    


            The March deportation of Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, has become a flashpoint in the fight over the Trump administration's hardline deportation push. The administration conceded in court filings that it had mistakenly deported the father of three to El Salvador last month as part of its recent deportation flights to the Central American nation, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.
    


            Van Hollen said he specifically asked Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa if he could meet with Abrego Garcia or at least speak with him over the phone or via video conferencing. Again, Van Hollen said the request was denied.
    


            Pressed on whether he had concerns about the man's health, Van Hollen said: “I don't know about his health status which is why I wanted to meet with him directly.”

What to know about Abrego Garcia's deportation case



            The senator's trip swiftly drew the ire of the White House.
    


            Communications director Steven Cheung called Van Hollen “a complete disgrace” and the Office of Communications accused the senator in a statement of a lack of concern regarding crimes they say were committed by undocumented immigrants against his constituents. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes in the United States.
    


            While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error.
    


            In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. US officials have alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward.
    


            The Wednesday meeting, Van Hollen said, started with a “point of agreement” that the countries should work together to “crack down” on gangs like MS-13. However, he said the case of Abrego Garcia “does not have to do with MS-13.”
    


            Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return, White House officials have argued it's up to El Salvador whether to do so. The Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele made clear during an Oval Office meeting earlier this week that the Maryland man wouldn't be returned to the US.
    


            Bukele said during the meeting that while he has the power to release Abrego Garcia, he wasn't willing to do so.
    


            Officials in the Oval Office meeting, including President Donald Trump, made no effort to ask for his cooperation in the matter.
    


            Van Hollen said Wednesday that the Salvadoran vice president had echoed comments made by Bukele at the White House that El Salvador “can't smuggle” Abrego Garcia to the US.
    


            “I said I am not asking him to smuggle Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States, I am simply asking him to open the door of CECOT and let this innocent man walk out,” the senator said.
    


This story has been updated with additional developments.

Editor's note: Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine.



            Lately I find myself feeling stuck in a chronic state of stress, constantly worrying about my work, my kids' futures and yes, the health of my retirement portfolio. Sound familiar?
    


            I didn't always worry so much, but life has a funny way of piling on the pressures as we get older and take on more responsibilities. While my family is not in crisis now, it has gotten harder to manage this stress.
    


            Because my specialty is urology, I also care about what acute and chronic stress are doing to your bladder and hormones as well as your overall health.
    


Note: This is meant to be a general overview. For advice specific to your health, please see your medical provider.

What people should know about stress, according to a doctor



            It helps to distinguish between two types of stress: acute and chronic.
    


            Acute stress is your body's immediate reaction to a perceived threat. Think about how your heart pounds before a big presentation or how you jump when you hear a loud noise. It's intense but usually short-lived. Our bodies are built to handle acute stress and typically return to normal afterward.
    


            Chronic stress, however, is persistent. It's the daily weight of ongoing issues, such as financial woes, relationship issues, work pressures or health concerns. Unlike acute stress, chronic stress keeps you in a constant state of high alert — chipping away at your health, often without you noticing.
    


            When you are stressed, your body launches a carefully coordinated response known as the fight-or-flight reaction. It all begins in the hypothalamus, the brain's command center, which activates two parallel systems in your adrenal glands: the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, or HPA, axis.
    


            The sympathetic nervous   system triggers the release of adrenaline, which primes your body to act quickly. This fast-acting hormone increases your heart rate and blood pressure, opens up your airways, heightens your senses and sends more blood to your muscles.
    


            Cortisol is released a little later through the HPA axis. Unlike adrenaline's quick action, cortisol plays a longer-term role in helping the body cope with sustained stress. Cortisol increases blood sugar, enhances the brain's focus and memory, and puts things such as digestion, fertility and immunity on the back burner — because in a crisis, your body is focused on survival.
    


            Working together, adrenaline and cortisol   seamlessly help the body cope with short-term threats. However, if stress becomes chronic, elevated cortisol levels can lead to fatigue, sleep problems, weight gain and other health issues.
    


            For me, this response kicks in during intense moments in surgery — such as seeing an unexpected gush of bleeding. Instead of fleeing (which would be frowned upon in the operating room), my body shifts into fight mode: I zero in on the bleeding vessel, focus sharply and act swiftly to get things under control.
    


            In such high-stakes moments, the stress response is not just helpful but essential.  But when the triggers are constant — unpaid bills or work deadlines — your body can get stuck in that heightened state.
    


            Over time, consistently high cortisol levels disrupt your immune system, impair metabolism, affect mood regulation and even contribute to chronic inflammation — all of which can increase the risk of long-term health issues.

Stress has a sweet spot. 5 tips to help you find it



            Have you ever noticed how anxiety makes you suddenly need the bathroom — especially right before a big speech or meeting? I experience this firsthand before every speech or live TV appearance: Without fail, my bladder goes into overdrive, and I find myself desperately looking for the nearest restroom.
    


            Stress directly affects bladder control by overstimulating the nerves responsible for regulating bladder function, leading to increased urgency, more frequent trips to the bathroom and even occasional leaking.
    


            My most memorable (and embarrassing) bladder moment was just before delivering a TEDx talk. There I was, backstage with two microphones strapped on, hair and makeup flawless, counting down the final two minutes before going live. Then suddenly — my bladder called.
    


            With no time to spare, I sprinted to the bathroom. I was still there when they announced my name. I bolted back out, breathless, laughing awkwardly as I stepped onto the stage. I played it off as a joke then, but deep down I knew my bladder was reacting to stress.
    


Research has consistently linked higher stress and anxiety levels with overactive bladder symptoms. Your bladder doesn't just respond to how much fluid you've had to drink; it also reacts dramatically to your mental state.

What your peeing frequency can say about your health



            Chronic stress is no friend to your sex life. When your body is constantly flooded with stress hormones such as cortisol, it throws your natural hormonal balance out of sync — significantly reducing levels of testosterone in men and estrogen in women.
    


            As stress hormones rise, sex hormones fall. The result? Lower libido, erectile dysfunction in men, difficulties with arousal in women, and trouble reaching orgasm for everyone. Studies have highlighted psychological stress as one of the leading causes of sexual dysfunction among otherwise healthy adults, emphasizing just how deep the mind and body are connected when it comes to sexual health.
    


            But hormones aren't the only factor. Chronic stress can also affect blood flow, which is vital for sexual response. And when stress disrupts your sleep, it further compounds the problem since sleep is essential for healthy hormone production and sexual functioning.
    


            The emotional toll is equally significant. When you're stressed, intimacy and connection often take a back seat as your mind becomes occupied with worries. Over time, this pattern can strain relationships, further dampening sexual desire.
    


            If you've noticed stress affecting intimacy, remember it's not “all in your head.” It's a super complex hormonal, physical and emotional response — one you can address by taking steps to reduce stress and prioritize relaxation, intimacy and self-care.

            Chronic stress can also hijack your sleep. High cortisol levels and persistent anxiety prevent deep, restorative sleep, leaving you feeling exhausted even after a full night in bed. Poor sleep then elevates stress levels further, creating a frustrating, self-perpetuating cycle that can profoundly affect your health.



            I experienced this firsthand last year. I went through a period of terrible sleep — tossing, turning, waking frequently and never feeling truly rested. I started gaining weight rapidly, and despite dedicated workouts, I didn't see progress in the gym. I felt sluggish, drained and defeated.
    


            Eventually, I had to acknowledge that my poor sleep, driven by chronic stress, was the real culprit.

            Beyond affecting sleep, chronic stress is a powerful trigger for numerous serious health conditions. Sustained exposure to cortisol and other stress hormones promotes inflammation, suppresses immune function and creates conditions in the body that set the stage for disease.
    


            Chronic stress has been directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. The American Heart Association emphasizes that stress not only directly raises blood pressure but also indirectly contributes to unhealthy habits, including smoking, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles.
    


            At one point, chronic stress started causing me frequent heart palpitations. Initially, I blamed caffeine, lack of sleep due to being on call and general fatigue. When I finally saw a cardiologist and underwent extensive testing, my diagnosis was stress. I was stunned. I am a physician accustomed to diagnosing others, yet chronic stress had quietly compromised my own heart health.
    


            The risks associated with stress don't end at your heart. Research suggests chronic stress might even accelerate cancer progression by impairing your body's immune defenses and creating conditions that encourage cancer cell growth. Chronic stress also increases the risk for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.
    


            My own experiences served as a powerful wake-up call: Stress was not a minor inconvenience — it was a genuine threat to my overall health. Recognizing and addressing it through targeted stress-management strategies isn't just good advice — it could literally save your life.

            While stress is unavoidable, understanding how it affects your bladder, sexual health, hormones, sleep and overall well-being gives you the power to recognize and manage it before it takes control.
    


            To be clear, not all stress is harmful. Acute stress can even motivate you, helping you tackle challenges head-on. But chronic stress — the kind that builds quietly from daily pressures such as financial worries or family concerns — is what slowly chips away at your health, often going unnoticed until symptoms become impossible to ignore.
    


            So, the next time you catch yourself anxiously refreshing your retirement portfolio or losing sleep over your kids' futures, take a moment. Step away. Stretch. Take a short walk. Or just breathe. These small acts can lower stress levels, reset your nervous system and protect your long-term health. And yes, I'll be prescribing the same medicine to myself.

Follow:


            Five students were injured in a shooting Tuesday afternoon at Wilmer-Hutchins High School in southeast Dallas when a 17-year-old allegedly snuck into the school and fired “indiscriminately,” according to a state affidavit for the suspect's arrest warrant.
    


            The injured, aged 15 to 18, were taken to a hospital for treatment, with their injuries ranging from non-life-threatening to serious, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesperson Jason Evans told CNN affiliate WFAA.
    


            The Dallas Independent School District Police initially said four students were injured, but the affidavit later increased the number of victims to five.
    


            The teen is being held at a Dallas County jail on a first-degree aggravated assault mass shooting charge, a felony, with a $600,000 bond, according to county records. It is unclear if he has obtained an attorney or made an initial court appearance.
    


            The shooting began just after 1 p.m., and an officer at the school responded within two minutes, followed by officers from numerous agencies, Stephanie Elizalde, superintendent of the Dallas Independent School District, said at a Tuesday news conference.
    


            A review of school surveillance cameras showed that an unidentified student let the suspect into the school through an unsecured door at approximately 1:03 p.m., according to the affidavit.
    


            The suspect “displayed a firearm and began firing at the students indiscriminately,” the affidavit said.
    


            Authorities did not provide any information on a motive for the shooting, as the investigation was fluid, Christina Smith, the school district's assistant police chief, said at the news conference.
    


            “This is just becoming way too familiar, and it should not be familiar,” Elizalde said. Classes at the high school have been canceled for the rest of the week, she said.
    


            The shooting occurred nearly a year after a different incident at the high school left one student injured, according to WFAA. In the April 2024 incident, a student brought a handgun into the school, bypassing metal detectors and a clear-bag policy, the outlet reported, citing what officials said at the time.
    


            Following Tuesday's shooting, Wilmer-Hutchins Elementary School, located adjacent to the high school, was put on lockdown as a precaution due to its proximity, though it was not in danger, Elizalde said. The elementary school will hold classes on Wednesday and Thursday with a heightened police presence, she added.
    


            Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called Elizalde to receive a status report and offer any necessary state resources, the superintendent said. All evacuated students were subsequently reunified with their parents and guardians, she added.
    


            “Our hearts go out to the victims of this senseless act of violence at Wilmer-Hutchins High School,” Abbott said in a release.
    


            “I offered to support the school district families, students, and staff and to provide law enforcement with the tools they need to arrest the criminals involved and bring them to justice,” he said.

Follow:


            To quote one of their father's famous lyrics, Liv and Mia Tyler shared some “sweet emotion” over how they first met.
    


            The pair are the daughters of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler and have a complicated family situation.
    


            Liv Tyler was born to singer, model and former Playboy Playmate Bebe Buell in 1977. However, for many years, Tyler believed she had been fathered by another rocker, singer Todd Rundgren, who signed her birth certificate and raised her.
    


            Mia Tyler, who was born in 1978, is the daughter of actress, model and publicist Cyrinda Foxe. The Tyler daughters talked about how they first met during a recent episode of the podcast, “Sibling Revelry With Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson.”



            Kate Hudson brought up the sisters' “Beautiful, but traumatic story,” she described as “bizzare.”
    


            Mia and Liv went on to say that when they were 8 and 9 years old respectively, their mothers brought them to the same Aerosmith concert.
    


            “I remember there were no kids backstage, so we played hard that night,” Mia Tyler said. “And we were at this VIP area, outside of the green rooms and we were just like, you know, doing our 8 and 9-year-old thing, and this fan lady came up and she was like, ‘Oh my god, you girls are so cute. Are you guys sisters?'”
    

A post shared by Sibling Revelry (@siblingrevelry)


            Guns n' Roses was touring with their dad's band and Liv Tyler remembered running to the side of stage to watch them and seeing her - unbeknownst to her at the time - half-sister.
    


            “I just remember standing there watching them play, looking and seeing this girl who looked exactly like me. Like we literally had the same outfit on. We had both had perms, like spiral perms, pink frosty lipstick,” Liv Tyler said. “We were both wearing a Aerosmith concert t-shirt with black leggings and Reebok high top sneakers. I looked and I was like, wait, that's me. It was really weird. I was literally like looking in the mirror seeing double.”
    


            Mia Tyler said that Guns n' Roses lead singer Axl Rose would dedicate their hit “Sweet Child O' Mine” to her. After that dedication, Liv Tyler looked to her mother.
    


            “I looked at my mom, and she just started crying.

Ukraine will begin blending all motor fuel with bioethanol starting next month as part of the country's EU integration plans, the news outlet Economic Pravda reported on Wednesday.

Legislation passed last year in Ukraine mandates a shift to a 5% bioethanol mix in gasoline starting May 1. However, the looming deadline has raised questions about how the new law will be implemented given the lack of quality control in the country, according to a government source cited by the outlet.

Bioethanol, an alcohol made from plants such as sugar cane or maize, boosts fuel combustion efficiency and cuts greenhouse gas emissions. Until recently, biofuel hadn't been used in Ukraine's gasoline blends. That changed in June 2024, when the country's parliament passed a law mandating its use to align with EU sustainability standards. Nearly all EU countries require gasoline to contain at least 5% bioethanol – known as E5 – with many already moving toward E10, a 10% blend.

According to the report, the new mandate will apply to all automotive fuel sold at wholesale and retail locations in the country, with the exception of high-octane 98 gasoline and fuel used by the Ukrainian military. However, the news outlet notes that the country currently does not produce E5-grade fuel and will rely heavily on imports.

“Some 90% of the imports will be already mixed. In other words, everyone will try their best to import already mixed gasoline from abroad,” Sergey Kuyun, head of the A-95 consulting group, told the outlet.

Gas station owners have expressed concern over the implementation of the new law.

“It won't be controlled properly. Who will do it and how? There are no methods, no specialists, and extra funds are needed to carry out the checks,” the head of a major fuel network told the outlet.

Representatives from Ukraine's State Environmental Inspectorate and the Energy Efficiency Agency said there would be no fines for non-compliance during the first few months, as enforcement legislation is not yet finalized.

“Consumers will most likely be forced to do their own quality control. If they buy low-quality fuel at a certain gas station, they will not return there. In principle, that's how it works even now, because in fact there is no quality control in Ukraine,” a government source told the outlet.

Experts warned that the move could drive up fuel prices in the country, as most European producers have switched to E10 and would need to modify their facilities to supply Ukraine with E5.

Ukraine received its first two batches of E5 containing 4.8% bioethanol from Lithuania's Orlen Lietuva and Romania's OMV Petrom over the weekend, according to media reports. Additional shipments from Poland's Orlen refinery and Germany's PCK Schwedt are expected to begin in mid-April.

The UK Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the term “woman” refers to biological sex, not gender identity, meaning that transgender individuals who were born male are not legally considered women for the purposes of single-sex protections.

The ruling comes after the For Women Scotland rights campaign challenged a Scottish Government law aimed at increasing the number of women on public boards, which included transgender women with legal recognition as female. 

The group claimed this violated the UK-wide Equality Act 2010 - a law that protects people from discrimination based on characteristics like sex, race, and disability. They asked the UK Supreme Court to confirm that “woman” in the Act means biological female, not someone assigned female status through a gender recognition certificate.

In its judgment, the court stated that “the terms ‘women' and ‘sex' in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex,” adding that interpreting sex to include acquired gender “would lead to incoherence” in provisions protecting women on the basis of pregnancy, maternity, and other sex-specific criteria.

A government spokesperson, responding to the judgment, stated that the ruling “brings clarity and confidence, for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs.” The spokesperson added that “single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government.”

Lord Hodge, one of the presiding justices, also noted that the court did not view the ruling as “a triumph” of one group over another and that it was simply necessary to provide legal clarity on the meaning of terms in existing legislation.

British author J.K. Rowling, one of the most prominent supporters of For Women Scotland, also hailed the court's ruling.

“It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,” the writer said on X.

Some, however, have criticized the Supreme Court's decision, claiming it could reduce legal recognition for transgender people. The Scottish Greens issued a statement slamming the ruling, calling it “deeply concerning for human rights.” LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall also expressed “deep concern at the widespread implications” of the move.

A German man was fined €4,500 ($5,100) on Tuesday for sneaking into Chancellor Olaf Scholz's motorcade and hugging him on the tarmac. The defendant, whose name was withheld by the authorities, also had his driver's license suspended for two and a half years.

In May 2023, the man, driving a dark Audi, joined the chancellor's motorcade as Scholz was returning to Berlin after the 25th anniversary of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. Once the convoy arrived at Frankfurt Airport, the driver exited his car, shook Scholz's hand, and hugged him on the tarmac. He was then detained by police.

According to Deutsche Welle, the man insisted he had joined the convoy by mistake. He explained that he was high on cocaine and had been partying for two days. The court found him guilty of driving under the influence of drugs and trespassing.

“People saying hello and greeting me is never something that particularly affects me,” Scholz said shortly after the encounter, as quoted by AFP. “That's very normal and I didn't find this situation dramatic either.”



The chancellor's spokesman, Wolfgang Buechner, later told reporters that Scholz “didn't feel threatened at any point.”

Nevertheless, the lapse in security sparked public scrutiny, given the rise in verbal abuse and physical attacks on German politicians in recent years.

In 2024, an assailant struck Franziska Giffey, Berlin's economy minister, in the head during an event at a library. That same year, a group of teenagers attacked Matthias Ecke, a member of the European Parliament, while he was hanging campaign posters, and aggressive bystanders cursed and spat on Green Party politician Yvonne Mosler on the street.

Israel Katz says blocking aid is ‘one of the main pressure levers' on Hamas, which continues to hold hostages

Israel has said it will keep blocking humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, as it vowed to force Hamas into releasing the remaining hostages from the 7 October attacks.

Aid supplies including food, fuel, water and medicine have been blocked by Israel from entering Gaza since 2 March, more than two weeks before the collapse of the ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group with a return to air and ground attacks on the territory.

The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said on Wednesday that Gaza was becoming a “mass grave for Palestinians”.

The Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said: “Israel's policy is clear: no humanitarian aid will enter Gaza, and blocking this aid is one of the main pressure levers preventing Hamas from using it as a tool with the population.”

He added: “No one is currently planning to allow any humanitarian aid into Gaza, and there are no preparations to enable such aid.”

Amnesty International is among the aid agencies that have described Israel's blockade on all supplies going into Gaza as a crime against humanity and a violation of international humanitarian law. Israel has denied any violations.

More than 51,000 Palestinians have died in Gaza since the conflict began, including more than 1,600 since Israel resumed airstrikes and ground operations on 18 March. The Gaza health ministry does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but has said more than half of those dead were women and children.

Another 13 people were killed in airstrikes overnight, with a well-known photographer, Fatema Hassouna, among those reported dead in the northern area of the strip.

Doctors and aid groups on the ground said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was becoming graver by the day. “The situation is the worst it has been in 18 months in terms of being deprived of your basic necessities and the resumption of hostilities and attacks against Palestinians in all of Gaza,” said Mahmoud Shalabi, a director at Medical Aid for Palestinians.

Israel has been accused of worsening the humanitarian situation by targeting hospitals and medical personnel working in Gaza, with two hospitals struck and debilitated by airstrikes this week. Israel has claimed Hamas has used medical facilities as a cover for terrorist operations.

On Tuesday, a report by the New York Times revealed that the autopsy reports of 14 medics and rescue workers killed by Israeli troops in Gaza in March showed they had mainly died from gunshot wounds to the head and the chest, and most had been shot several times.

The resumption of aid into Gaza has become a highly inflammatory political issue in Israel. There are 58 hostages still in Gaza, who were taken captive after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, with 24 believed to still be alive. Far-right figures in Benjamin Netanyahu's government have said no aid should be restored to the civilians of Gaza until Hamas agrees to the hostages' release.

“As long as our hostages are languishing in the tunnels, there is no reason for a single gram of food or any aid to enter Gaza,” the national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on Wednesday.

Katz said Israel intended to eventually set up its own “civilian-based distribution infrastructure” for aid in Gaza, to prevent supplies falling into the hands of Hamas militants, but he gave no timelines or details of how it would be established.

Reports have suggested this could involve the Israel Defense Forces setting up and running logistics centres for aid, and vetted aid agencies being tasked with distributing it. However, the plan remains unclear and the UN is said to have so far refused to hand over the names of employees.

Efforts by mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US to restore the collapsed ceasefire in Gaza and return the hostages have continued to hit stumbling blocks.

Katz said that no matter what deal was agreed, Israeli troops would remain in the buffer zones it had occupied in Gaza, as well as in neighbouring Syria and Lebanon.

Since resuming operations in March, Israeli troops have seized control of 30% of the Gaza Strip, establishing what they describe as an “operational security perimeter”. Hamas has demanded that any hostage deal must guarantee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.

Katz said: “Unlike in the past, the [Israeli military] is not evacuating areas that have been cleared and seized.” The military would “remain in the security zones as a buffer between the enemy and [Israeli] communities in any temporary or permanent situation in Gaza, as in Lebanon and Syria”, he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Mark Rutte makes pledge after Donald Trump blames Volodymyr Zelenskyy for starting war; three hurt in ‘massive' Russian drone attack. What we know on day 1,148

Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has visited the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and declared “unwavering” support for Ukraine in the aftermath of a Russian attack on the northern city of Sumy that killed 35 people. Rutte said the military alliance was still strongly behind Kyiv, even as it also supported the ceasefire push by US president Donald Trump, who has issued fresh criticism of Zelenskyy, accusing him of starting the war. “Nato stands with Ukraine,” Rutte said at a press conference with Zelenskyy on Tuesday. “You and I know that this has been true all along. I also know that some have called Nato's support into question in the last couple of months. But let there be no doubt: our support is unwavering.” Rutte also said: “Russia is the aggressor, Russia started this war. There's no doubt.” Zelenskyy said the main focus of the talks was strengthening Ukraine's air defence. “Absolutely everyone sees how urgent Ukraine's need is for air defence systems and missiles for them,” he posted on X.

A “massive” Russian drone attack on Odesa overnight injured three people, sparked fires and damaged homes and civilian infrastructure, Ukrainian officials said early on Wednesday. Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov posted photos on Telegram depicting a residential building and other structures that had been nearly destroyed, while others showed emergency workers sifting through rubble. The full scale of the attack was not immediately clear. There was no immediate comment from Russia.

Ukraine's military said it had hit a base belonging to the Russian rocket brigade that conducted the Palm Sunday missile attack on Sumy. The Ukrainian strike caused a “secondary detonation of ammunition” and the results “are being clarified”, the military said on Telegram on Tuesday. World leaders have condemned the Sumy attack, Ukraine's deadliest of 2025, and Zelenskyy called it an act of deliberate terror. Ukraine moved on Tuesday to dismiss Sumy governor Volodymyr Artyukh after he made comments implying the Russian attack had targeted a military gathering.

Sweden said it had summoned the Russian ambassador  to its foreign ministry to protest against Moscow's attacks on Ukraine's cities and civilian population. “Russia's responsibility to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in accordance with international humanitarian law was emphasised to the Russian ambassador during his appearance,” the Swedish foreign ministry said on Tuesday.

China rejected what it called “manipulation and hype” around two of its nationals captured in Ukraine after Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of dragging Beijing into the war and said hundreds of Chinese nationals were fighting on the frontline. “China is verifying the relevant information and circumstances,” foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said about the prisoners of war, urging “relevant parties to accurately understand China's objective and impartial stance”. Ukraine held a press conference on Monday at which the two Chinese prisoners of war under armed guard said they hoped to be in a prisoner swap and warned other Chinese nationals not to go to fight.

A court in St Petersburg has jailed a woman for five years and two months for criticising the Russian army on social media, allegedly after she was denounced by her neighbour. Anna Aleksandrova, a 47-year-old hairdresser, was arrested in November 2023 over posts she made under a pseudonym on VKontakte, Russia's largest social network. Prosecutors accused her of giving information about how to avoid military mobilisation and of posting information critical of Moscow's Ukraine offensive. Aleksandrova pleaded not guilty at the trial, saying she was set up by a neighbour, with whom she was embroiled in a land dispute, according to the Mediazona news outlet.

A Ukrainian drone strike on the Russian city of Kursk killed an elderly woman and wounded nine others on Tuesday, local authorities said. Six of the injured were hospitalised for shrapnel wounds, burns and head injuries, they said. A Kyiv official alluded to the attack on social media but claimed a military target had been hit in the regional capital, about 90km from the Ukrainian border.

A Russian military court has sentenced five young people for up to 18 years in jail after finding them guilty of setting fire to railway infrastructure and a helicopter outside Moscow last year, the state news agency Tass reported. It cited state prosecutors as saying that the group – then aged 19 to 22 – had acted on the orders of people close to Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency. GUR posted video at the time purporting to show the helicopter – which it said belonged to the Russian defence ministry – on fire, but it did not claim responsibility for the attack.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration plans to eliminate the IRS' Direct File program, an electronic system for filing tax returns directly to the agency for free, according to two people familiar with the decision.

The program developed during Joe Biden's presidency was credited by users with making tax filing easy, fast and economical. But Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use.

The program had been in limbo since the start of the Trump administration as Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency have slashed their way through the federal government. Musk posted in February on his social media site, X, that he had “deleted” 18F, a government agency that worked on technology projects such as Direct File.

There was some hope that Musk, with his DOGE team of computer programmers, could take over Direct File and improve it. But the two people familiar with the decision to end Direct File said its future became clear when the IRS staff assigned to the program were told in mid-March to stop working on its development for the 2026 tax filing season.

The two people were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

Adam Ruben, a vice president at the liberal-leaning Economic Security Project, said “the fix was in from the beginning.”




“It is an outrage to see everyday taxpayers play no role in this decision,” he said. “Cutting costs and saving money for families were just empty campaign promises.”

But David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, which describes itself as a nonpartisan organization that disseminates research and analysis on the government's effects on the economy, said Direct File was “problematic” from day 1, citing the program's costs and noting that many people who started the process never finished. According to the IRS 423,450 taxpayers logged into Direct File and 140,803 submitted accepted returns in 2024.

“From hidden costs to taxpayer confusion, the program is riddled with issues,” Williams said. 

Direct File was rolled out as a pilot program in 2024 after the IRS was tasked with looking into how to create a “direct file” system as part of the money it received from the Inflation Reduction Act signed into law by Biden in 2022. The Democratic administration spent tens of millions of dollars developing the program. 

Last May, the agency announced that the program would be made permanent.

But the IRS has faced intense blowback to Direct File from private tax preparation companies that have made billions from charging people to use their software and have spent millions lobbying Congress. The average American typically spends about $140 preparing returns each year.

Derrick Plummer, a spokesman for the commercial tax preparation company Intuit,, said in a statement that “Direct File is and has been a solution in search of a problem, a drain on critical IRS resources and a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

The IRS accepted 140,803 returns filed by taxpayers using Direct File in the 12 states where it was available last tax season. It was expanded to include half the country this year. It is unclear how many taxpayers have used Direct File this year.

Amanda Renteria, CEO of Code for America, which worked with the IRS to create a state tax filing integration program for Direct File, said the decision was “a betrayal of public trust at precisely the time government should be demonstrating its ability to deliver basic services effectively.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a proponent of building out Direct File, said in an emailed statement that Trump and Musk “are going after Direct File because it stops giant tax prep companies from ripping taxpayers off for services that should be free. Americans want a free and easy way to file their taxes — Trump and Musk want to take that away.”

President Donald Trump says he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from tariffs he previously imposed, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains. The Republican president's statement hints at yet another round of reversals on tariffs.

Japan's chief trade negotiator headed to Washington Wednesday, seeking to convince U.S. officials to remove President Donald Trump's tariff measures against the East Asian ally.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he held telephone talks on Monday with President Donald Trump and told him he is “strongly concerned” that U.S. tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world's biggest investor in the United States in the past five years.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.

The Republican president said in a post on his social media platform that he'll attend the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.

“Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!” Trump wrote in the social media post.

The president's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade agreements as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.

The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.

The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.




With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.

U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.

Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been “ringing off the hook” with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.

On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.

Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.

“The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.

Although Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks. 

Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.

“Japan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and ‘TRADE FAIRNESS,'” Trump posted on Wednesday.

U.S. officials will be meeting in Washington with Japan's chief trade negotiator, Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa.

“I am prepared for the talks,” Akazawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before boarding his flight. “I will negotiate in order to firmly protect our national interest.”

He said that both Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are “known to be pro-Japan and professionally talented” and that he hopes to build a relationship of trust with them.

“I believe we can have good talks toward a win-win relationship that will serve national interest for both Japan and the United States,” he said.

Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.

Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks. 

Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs' uncertainty but that he's also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China. 

“In the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

“Together, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family,” he added.

Xi has promised Malaysia and Vietnam greater access to Chinese markets on his visits, although few details were shared.

In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China.

Trump's demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese.

Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan's GDP.

Kansas health officials confirmed five new cases of measles Wednesday in an outbreak in the southwest corner of the state that's linked to Texas and New Mexico. 

Last week, U.S. measles cases topped 700 as Indiana joined five others states with active outbreaks. Even as the virus continued to spread and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention redeployed a team to West Texas, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in a televised Cabinet meeting Thursday that measles cases were plateauing nationally. The U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.

Texas is reporting the majority of measles cases. Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter of the outbreak in rural West Texas. An adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated also died of a measles-related illness. 

Other states with active outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include Indiana, Oklahoma and Ohio.

The multistate outbreak confirms health experts' fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization has said cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak. 

Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.




Here's what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.

Texas' outbreak began in late January. State health officials said Tuesday there were 20 new cases of measles since Friday, bringing the total to 561 across 23 counties — most of them in West Texas. Two more Texans were hospitalized, for a total of 58 throughout the outbreak, and Reeves County logged its first case.

State health officials estimated Tuesday that about 4% of cases — fewer than 25 — are actively infectious.

Sixty-five percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 364 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county's residents.

The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Kennedy. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February — Kennedy said age 6. 

New Mexico announced five new cases Tuesday, bringing the state's total to 63. Three more people are in the hospital, for a total of five since the outbreak started. Doña Ana County reported its first case. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Two are in Eddy County and one in Chaves County.

State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas' outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult on March 6.



Kansas has 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday. 

Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.

The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.





Cases in Oklahoma remained steady at 12 total cases Tuesday: nine confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. 

A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Rogers and Custer counties, but wouldn't say which counties had cases. 





The Knox County outbreak in east-central Ohio has infected a total 20 people as of Tuesday, according to a news release from the county health department, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.

The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 20 measles cases in the state last week: 11 in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, seven in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties. The state updates its count on Thursdays, and it only includes Ohio residents.

The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.



Indiana confirmed six connected cases of measles in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — four are unvaccinated minors and two are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. 

The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Wednesday. The first case was confirmed Monday. 





Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The agency counted seven clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025 as of Friday.

In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles. So far in 2025, the CDC's count is 712.



The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.

Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don't need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.

A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but experts don't always recommend it and health insurance plans may not cover it. 

Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. 

People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don't know which type they got.



Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.

The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.

Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.



There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.



In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.” 

But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.

The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.

Fox News national correspondent Alexis McAdams has the latest on an arson investigation at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's mansion on 'Special Report.' 

Police in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are still working to piece together the arson and attempted homicide attack on the governor's residence as details about the suspect's possible motive and criminal history come to light. 

Cody Balmer, 38, who is suspected of arson, was out on bail when he allegedly set the governor's residence ablaze on April 13. Additionally, Balmer was already expected to appear in court this week over a 2023 assault charge.

According to an affidavit obtained by Fox News on the 2023 charge, a 13-year-old called police to report that his stepfather was beating his mother. Police wrote that the mother, identified in the affidavit as Adrian, was in an ""elevated state, yelling and crying about her husband."" Balmer had allegedly taken a full bottle of pills in a suicide attempt before the argument broke out. He is accused of ""violently"" shoving and punching the 13-year-old, punching Adrian and stepping on his 10-year-old child's previously broken leg.

PENNSYLVANIA ARSON SUSPECT WAS FREE ON BAIL ‘TO CO-PARENT' AFTER ALLEGED FAMILY VIOLENCE: REPORT

A lieutenant at the Penbrook Police Station told Fox News that Balmer's mother called police prior to the arson attack because he was not taking his medication, and she was concerned about his mental health.

Pennsylvania State Trooper Michael Gragg details the video of the arson attack, Balmer's 911 call and an interview with Balmer in warrants obtained by Fox News. 

Surveillance video described in the warrant allegedly shows Balmer breaking a window at the governor's residence before throwing ""an incendiary device"" inside. According to the warrant, Balmer then broke another window, entered the residence and deployed another incendiary device before he ""approached the dining room exit."" The warrant also states that a woman – seemingly identified as Balmer's ""ex-paramour"" – said he confessed to committing the attack and asked her to call police to turn him in.

The second warrant describes Balmer's interview with troopers in which he allegedly admitted to ""harboring hatred towards"" Gov. Josh Shapiro. Additionally, Balmer also reportedly said that he planned to beat the governor with his hammer if he were discovered in the residence. Balmer also allegedly told an unnamed trooper that he was responsible for the arson attack. 

PennLive obtained a search warrant for Balmer's devices that could point to his motive for Sunday's attack. He allegedly targeted Shapiro, who is Jewish, because of ""what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.""

According to PennLive, in the warrant for Balmer's devices, Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Benjamin Forsythe said the suspect targeted Shapiro over ""perceived injustices to the people of Palestine."" Forsythe also allegedly pointed to the governor's Jewish faith as a possible motive behind Balmer's attack, but apparently did not elaborate.

""This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society,"" Shapiro said. ""And I don't give a damn if it's coming from one particular side or the other, directed at one particular party or another, or one particular person or another. It is not OK and it has to stop. We have to be better than this.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Zillow just started an all-out war over real estate listings","https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-new-real-estate-agent-listings-rules-homebuyers-search-homes-2025-4","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:04:00 GMT","

Real estate listings have descended into chaos. Homebuyers will pay the price.

Thousands of real estate agents across the US opened their email Saturday night to find an unexpected message from Andy Florance, the CEO of CoStar Group and Homes.com. As the top executive for one of real estate's largest search websites, Florance had a lot on his mind. For months, the industry has been embroiled in a fight over ""exclusive inventory"" — homes marketed for sale by real estate agents but purposely kept off public search portals like Homes.com or Realtor.com. Florance wasn't writing to complain about this practice, though. He'd set his sights on another target: his company's chief rival, Zillow.

Two days earlier, Zillow had unveiled a new rule threatening to blacklist scores of homes from its well-trafficked website. The surprise announcement took direct aim at exclusive inventory, also known as secret or hidden home listings. A growing number of agents at large brokerages, most notably the national power player Compass, had been hoarding listings and testing the waters by advertising them on their own websites before sharing the homes widely across the internet. Zillow said it would permanently ban from its site any listing that had gone through this preview period. If you're going to market a home somewhere, the company argued, you have to market it everywhere.

Zillow, by far the most popular destination for online home shoppers, framed the move as a defense of consumers: ""Fragmented listing access — in which a home is available on one platform but not another, or shared with some agents but not others — creates frustration and distrust,"" the company said in its announcement. But Florance wasn't having it. He lambasted Zillow's new rule as ""an incredible move of audacity and a pure power play of epic proportions."" Homes.com, Florance told the agents, would happily welcome any listings scorned by Zillow.

This is the messy state of play in real estate: With sales stuck in a protracted malaise, agent commissions under pressure, and the rules of the game in flux, everyone is scrambling to protect their share of the homebuying pie. Zillow's declaration adds yet another twist, marking an explosive turning point in the long-simmering dispute over exclusive inventory and hidden home listings. The company is flexing its considerable muscle, presenting agents with a daunting choice: Either share your listing with Zillow and everyone else as soon as you so much as stake a sign in the front yard, or explain to your client why their home will never appear on the website that's become synonymous with real estate.

""That's the spark,"" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""And now everybody, whether they like it or not, they have to have a position. They have to make some decisions, and they need to act.""

As usual, regular consumers will bear the brunt of these changes. Sellers need to understand exactly how — and where — their agents will advertise their homes, while buyers may have to canvass a range of websites for inventory. Finding that dream home could soon become a game of hide and seek.

Many agents don't bother with exclusive inventory. As soon as they agree to market a home on behalf of a seller, they add it to the multiple listing service, or MLS, a local database that shares the information with other agents, brokerages, and big search portals like Zillow. Once a listing is live in the MLS, it's pretty much everywhere.

But agents have other options that are growing more popular. They can quietly shop a home around to other agents within their brokerage, a practice known as ""office exclusives."" These are shared via email, word of mouth, or internal listing platforms, so the homes don't actually pop up on the internet for casual browsers to see. Another option is to add the listing to the MLS and advertise the home publicly on the brokerage's website but opt out of the data feeds that share listings with other websites that display homes, including other brokerages and search portals like Zillow. In both instances, a brokerage like Compass, the largest in the country by sales volume, can lure agents and clients with early access to homes they can't find anywhere else. There's been a lot of debate over whether this is actually good for the seller, but the financial upside for the brokerage is enormous.

It's easy to get bogged down in the details of how this all works, and it remains to be seen how Zillow will actually implement these changes. But the spirit of Zillow's new rule, spelled out in last week's announcement, is pretty simple: ""If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere."" Redfin, another leading search portal, has taken a similar stance, saying it will also ban listings that are not shared everywhere. Both sites notably make exceptions for homes that were originally office exclusives — if a seller wants to remain truly private, they can do so within the walls of their brokerage and turn to Zillow or Redfin later. But as soon as the general public can lay eyes on a home, the broker has a day to share it with everyone through the MLS — or else. (Zillow has said that listings can be unbanned if the seller breaks up with their broker.)

Zillow's hardline stance has already mobilized support. At least two big brokerages — eXp Realty, the third-largest brokerage by sales volume, according to the consulting firm T3 Sixty, and NextHome, which has 6,000 agents nationwide — have made public commitments to abide by Zillow's policy. The Consumer Policy Center, a new nonpartisan think tank, has also come out in support of the new rule.

""We encourage all brokers to support Zillow's efforts to maintain the transparency of real estate markets and prevent their balkanization,"" Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at CPC and a former senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, said in a statement.

But there are problems with Zillow and Redfin's position. Ironically, they could push more home listings into the shadows by encouraging brokerages like Compass to pursue ""office exclusives"" rather than sharing homes publicly on the Compass website. They also risk appearing power-hungry and desperate to preserve their web traffic (and bottom lines) at all costs.

""It's not the flex they think it is,"" says Amanda Orson, the founder and CEO of Galleon, an alternative marketplace that connects homebuyers and sellers directly. ""It's a tell. Zillow realized that not having all of the inventory available is their Achilles' heel, and they just telegraphed it.""

Glenn Kelman, Redfin's CEO, doesn't see it that way. The search portals, like the MLS, track how long a house has been on the market and whether the seller has dropped the price — data points that end up harming sellers, in Compass CEO Robert Reffkin's telling. If that's the issue, Kelman says he's fine with dropping that info entirely. Redfin has called on MLSes to create an option that would allow agents to share listings while preventing websites from showing price drops and days on market, which Kelman describes as a middle ground. The most important thing, he says, is for consumers to be able to see all the homes no matter which website they visit.

""You shouldn't have to go to 10 different websites to see 10 different sets of inventory,"" Kelman tells me. ""That will be a challenge for consumers.""

Here's one thing I'm sure of: This is a mess. There are more than 500 MLSes around the country, each with its own policies and enforcement mechanisms. Compass appears unlikely to back down from exclusive inventory, setting up more battles down the line. In an email to Compass agents the day after Zillow's announcement, Reffkin advised agents to ""keep doing what you're doing.""

""This moment goes beyond a policy — it's about control versus choice,"" Reffkin wrote.

For the average American trying to hop into the housing market, the new battle will likely only cause confusion and frustration. Sellers may not know what they're agreeing to when they opt for a limited advertising campaign, or they may turn litigious when they realize their homes have been blacklisted from Zillow. Buyers may be forced to scour a range of websites to get an idea of what's out there, and even then, they could risk overlooking their dream home. Even real estate executives are confused about some of this stuff — now imagine the reaction of a typical buyer or seller, who goes through this kind of transaction only a handful of times in their lives.

When confusion runs rampant among regular consumers — when the very rules of the game are unclear — that's usually a sign that government intervention could be on the way.

""As much as many of us wouldn't like that to happen, it's kind of getting set up to where it could happen,"" Saul Klein, a longtime real estate executive and the CEO of the San Diego MLS, tells me. ""And so I think we've got to be real careful and work not to keep confusing the marketplace.""

Indeed, Andy Florance's email to agents over the weekend included a postscript with a link to contact the Department of Justice. But government action is hardly guaranteed, and it could be years before anything happens. In the interim, expect the fight to get uglier.

""There is something larger at stake than just who gets control of the inventory,"" Kelman tells me. ""It's the US housing market, and we're supposed to all be at an age where we actually care about that. And I think everybody does, but emotions are just running high right now.""

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he wanted to start a self-deportation program for immigrants in America.

Trump was speaking to Fox Noticias in an interview when he said his administration would be rolling out new schemes to tackle illegal immigration in the US.

""These are rough, bad people. We want them out, and that's mostly our focus, but what we want to do is we are going to have a self-deportation program, which we haven't even announced yet,"" Trump said on Tuesday.

Trump added that he hadn't worked out the exact details of the program, though it could involve giving immigrants a stipend so they could return to their home country.

""We are going to give him a stipend, we are going to give them some money and a plane ticket, and then we are going to work with them. If they are good, if we want them back in, we are going to work with them to get them back in as quickly as we can,"" Trump continued.

Cracking down on immigration has long been a focus for Trump. While on the campaign trail, Trump said deporting millions of immigrants would result in more job opportunities for Americans.

Immigration researchers and analysts, however, told Business Insider that Trump's plans could exacerbate America's demographic challenges as well as result in a labor shortage for the agriculture and construction industries.

Earlier in the interview, Trump acknowledged that farmers and business owners rely on immigrants as a source of labor and said he would help businesses hire them lawfully.

""We are making it so that if a farmer can give recommendations to people, we're going to be very soothing in terms of perhaps letting that farmer take responsibility,"" Trump told Fox Noticias.

""But you know, ultimately, at some point, we want people to go out and come back as legal,"" he added.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

In late 2023, Cobi Blumenfeld-Gantz testified at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about how health insurance brokers target elderly Americans. “The Medicare enrollment and navigation process is broken,” Blumenfeld-Gantz told the committee. He described a thicket of marketers and lead generators who sought to persuade patients to choose private Medicare Advantage plans, often in lieu of the standard federal program known to most people as just Medicare.

Those private plans, which make up the most profitable category of the health insurance industry, provide additional benefits beyond what Medicare offers, such as dental and vision insurance, but they come with trade-offs. Whereas most doctors accept Medicare, the typical Medicare Advantage option has a much more limited network of doctors, requires prior authorization for more medical procedures and sometimes leaves patients with unexpectedly large out-of-pocket costs. According to Blumenfeld-Gantz, the people pitching those private plans don't always make these trade-offs clear. Instead, he told the Finance Committee, they “traffic in scare tactics, imitate government agencies like the federal Medicare program and inaccurately advertise plan benefits.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed concern in a speech Wednesday that the central bank could find itself in a dilemma between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.

With uncertainty elevated over what impact President Donald Trump's tariffs will have, the central bank leader said that while he expects higher inflation and lower growth, it's unclear where the Fed will need to devote greater focus.

""We may find ourselves in the challenging scenario in which our dual-mandate goals are in tension,"" Powell said in prepared remarks before the Economic Club of Chicago. ""If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close.""

The Fed is tasked with ensuring stable prices and full employment, and economists including those at the Fed see threats to both from the levies. Tariffs essentially act as a tax on imports, though their direct link to inflation historically has been spotty.

In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Powell said tariffs are ""likely to move us further away from our goals ... probably for the balance of this year.""

Powell gave no indication on where he sees interest rates headed, but noted that, ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.""

Stocks hit session lows as Powell spoke while Treasury yields turned lower.

In the case of higher inflation, the Fed would keep interest rates steady or even increase them to dampen demand. In the case of slower growth, the Fed might be persuaded to lower interest rates. Powell emphasized the importance to keeping inflation expectations in check.

Markets expect the Fed to start reducing rates again in June and to enact three or four quarter percentage point cuts by the end of 2025, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.

Fed officials generally consider tariffs to be a one-time hit to prices, but the expansive nature of the Trump duties could alter that trend.

Powell noted that survey- and market-based measures of near-term inflation are on the rise, though the longer-term outlook remains close to the Fed's 2% goal. The Fed's key inflation measure is expected to show a rate of 2.6% for March, he said.

""Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,"" said Powell. ""The inflationary effects could also be more persistent. Avoiding that outcome will depend on the size of the effects, on how long it takes for them to pass through fully to prices, and, ultimately, on keeping longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.""

The speech was largely similar to one he delivered earlier this month in Virginia, and in some passages verbatim.

Powell noted the threats to growth as well as inflation.

Gross domestic product for the first quarter, which will be reported later this month, is expected to show little growth in the U.S. economy for the January-through-March period.

Indeed, Powell noted: ""The data in hand so far suggest that growth has slowed in the first quarter from last year's solid pace. Despite strong motor vehicle sales, overall consumer spending appears to have grown modestly. In addition, strong imports during the first quarter, reflecting attempts by businesses to get ahead of potential tariffs, are expected to weigh on GDP growth.""

Earlier in the day, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales increased a better-than-expected 1.4% in March. The report showed that a large portion of the growth came from car buyers looking to make purchases ahead of the tariffs, though multiple other sectors showed solid gains as well.

Following the report, the Atlanta Fed said it sees GDP growing at a -0.1% pace in Q1 when adjusting for an unusual rise in gold imports and exports. Powell described the economy as being in a ""solid position"" even with the expected slowdown in growth.

Chinese online retailer Temu, whose ""Shop like a billionaire"" marketing campaign made its way to last year's Super Bowl, has dramatically slashed its online ad spending in the U.S. and seen its ranking in Apple's App Store plunge following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on trade partners.

Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, had been on an online advertising blitz in recent years in a bid to attract deal-hungry American shoppers to its site. With hefty spending on TV ads as well across Facebook, the company promoted clothing, jewelry, home goods and electronics at bargain basement prices.

The strategy was so effective that Temu topped Apple's list of the most downloaded free apps in the U.S. for the past two years. Downloads of Temu on Apple's App Store have fallen 62% in recent days, according to data from SimilarWeb, a digital data and analytics company. Ads for 50-cent eyebrow trimmers and $5 t-shirts that used to blanket Google search results and Facebook feeds have all but disappeared.

President Trump's tariffs have upended Temu's business model, along with its advertising strategy. Packages shipped from China are now subject to a tariff rate of 145%, while the de minimis provision, which allows shipments worth less than $800 to enter the country duty-free, is set to go away on May 2.

Temu and Shein, a fast-fashion marketplace with ties to China, plan to raise their prices in response to the tariffs. Both companies posted notices to their websites in recent days that warned they'll be raising prices late next week.

""Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up,"" Temu said on its site. ""To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025.""

Sellers on Amazon's third-party marketplace, many of whom source their products from China, have said they're considering raising prices as they reckon with higher costs from the tariffs. Many businesses on TikTok Shop, the social media app's marketplace, also count on Chinese manufacturers for their items.

Amazon launched a competitor to Temu last November, called Amazon Haul, which features items under $20 that are largely from China.

The Temu app is now No. 69 in a list of the top free apps in the U.S., after consistently ranking in the top 10, according to data from Sensor Tower. Shein is currently at 42, down from 15 last month. PDD's shares that trade in the U.S. have plummeted 22% this month, compared to the Nasdaq's 6% drop. Shein is privately held.

Rival Chinese retailers have subsequently risen to the top of the app store ranks, including Beijing-based wholesaler DHgate, which surged to the No. 2 top free iPhone app in the U.S., and Alibaba's Taobao, which ranked No. 7. Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that viral videos promoting their cheap products have spurred the download frenzy.

A separate analysis by SimilarWeb showed Temu's paid traffic, or search, display and social media advertising that drove visits to its website, has dropped 77% since April 11. Temu's paid traffic previously outpaced nonpaid traffic to its website by 2 1/2 times, Ben Parkes, a consumer goods and retail analyst at Similarweb, said in an interview.

Marketing firm Tinuiti found that 20% of U.S. Google Shopping ad impressions were bought by Temu on April 5. A week later, that number had fallen to zero. By comparison, Shein's impressions remained at 17% on April 12, while 60% of impressions were bought by Amazon.

Representatives from Temu and Shein didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Temu was previously one of Meta's largest advertisers, but it appears to have dramatically scaled back its spending on the platform. As of Wednesday, Temu is running six ads across Meta platforms in the U.S., a review of Meta's ad library shows. Temu is running approximately 27,000 ads across Meta sites and apps globally, particularly in Europe and the U.K.

That could be troublesome for Meta's advertising business, which has gotten a significant boost from the discount retailer. Advertising analyst Brian Wieser at Madison and Wall estimated that more than $7 billion of Meta's $132 billion in ad revenue in 2023 came from China. Meta is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 30.

E-commerce analyst Juozas Kaziukenas said he expects Temu to turn its ads back on in the U.S. at some point, but that the company appears to be shifting its dollars to other markets in the interim.

""It doesn't mean Temu usage has dropped as significantly as the app did,"" Kaziukenas said in an email. ""But it means that new user acquisition is gone.""

U.S. importers are being notified of an increase in canceled sailings by freight ships out of China as ocean carriers try to balance the pullback in orders resulting from President Trump's tariffs and the escalation of tensions in the trade war.

A total of 80 blank, or canceled, sailings out of China have been recorded by freight company HLS Group. It wrote in a recent note to clients that with the trade war between China and the U.S. leading to a demand plummet, carriers have started to suspend or adjust transpacific services.

Major ocean freight alliance ONE has ""suspended until further notice"" a route it had previously been planning to bring back in May, which would include ports of Qingdao, Ningbo, Shanghai, Pusan, Vancouver, and Tacoma. Meanwhile, an existing route is planning to cancel its port call at Wilmington, North Carolina.

The impact of the diminished freight container traffic to North America will be significant for many links in the economy and supply chain, including the ports and logistics companies moving the freight. If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.

The World Trade Organization warned on Wednesday that the outlook for global trade has ""deteriorated sharply"" in the wake of Trump's tariffs plan. JB Hunt shares hit their lowest level since November 2020 after commentary during the trucking company's earnings call about the uncertainty from tariffs.

""We have no way of knowing how significant this drop in orders will be on vessel schedules,"" said Alan Murphy, CEO of Sea-Intelligence. ""There are no models to extrapolate this. What I can tell you is the majority of containers on the vessels servicing the Asia to U.S. trade routes is China. We won't go to zero containers, but we will see a decrease in containers and as a result, in the future, we will see a massive raft of blank sailings announced.""

China accounts for approximately 30% of all U.S. containerized imports (down from 37% in 2018), but accounts for approximately 54% of all U.S. containerized imports from Asia (down from 67% in 2018).

Bruce Chan, director of global logistics & future mobility for Stifel, said the tariff policy has created significant uncertainty with respect to consumer demand, and retailers have been positioning their businesses conservatively with inventory, especially given ""scar tissue"" from the recent overstock after the post-Covid supply chain squeeze from 2021-2022. ""That uncertainty is beginning to manifest in blanked container ship sailings on core eastbound transpacific lanes, in our view, opening the potential for a double-digit decline in inbound containerized imports as early as next month,"" he said.

Booking volumes from the last week of March to first week of April across global and U.S. trade lanes plummeted. There were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. Major product categories from China that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs.

As a result of the decrease in containers, ocean carriers will not only cancel vessels, but also adjust or cancel vessel routes commonly called ""vessel strings,"" such as the ONE service from China to Vancouver and Tacoma. These routes dedicating vessels to move the ocean freight at specific ports take months of planning. The elimination of vessels also impacts U.S. exports bound for Asia and relying on ships traveling in both directions.

Ocean carriers need to move full vessels to generate a return on investment, but it is not in their best interest to use large vessels if they cannot be filled. To ensure vessels are used at full capacity, carriers have a number of ways to alter the vessel strings. Stretching out ship arrivals by canceling sailings is an option for container volume to better match capacity. According to Murphy, 99% of vessel services are weekly and it takes a vessel approximately seven weeks to make a round trip.

""During Covid, ocean carriers parked their vessels for maintenance,"" Murphy said. ""Ocean carriers can also blank (cancel) a sailing, omit vessel strings entirely, use smaller vessels, or slow steam the vessels where they are traveling longer.""

These measures will cut the available vessel capacity for containers, according to Murphy, which helps remaining ships to be filled, with uncertain implications for overall pricing in the ocean freight business. While a decline in sailings could lead to a drop in prices, during Covid, blank sailings were identified by shippers around the world as a reason for container rates that spiked as high as $30,000. In that case, shippers say the ocean carriers canceled sailings for longer than needed.

The global supply chain demand and pricing situation remains fluid and subject to sharp short-term swings tied to tariffs policy. As Chinese trade comes under strain, a key metric in ocean freight rates shows Vietnam surging in early April.

The ""mid-low"" ocean rates, which represent the costs of shipping goods for a larger-sized shipper on a particular ocean route, have jumped by 43% since March 30 for Vietnam. Xeneta calculates the market mid-low and market mid-high segments by looking at the values of the 25 and 75 percentiles of a trade lane rate.

""The fact that the lower end of the market has been rising shows the heat is on,"" said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. He said that is continuing after Trump's decision to pause what he called ""reciprocal"" tariffs on countries other than China for 90 days.

""Shippers large and small all have to pay up for frontloading, as the 'pause' made the pulling forward of freight possible again,"" Sand added.

This demand from U.S. shippers importing goods can be seen in the increase in container shipping spot rates on the Ho Chi Minh City to Los Angeles ports route, jumping by 24% going into April.

According to data compiled by Xeneta for 2025, the spread between China's largest container port, Shanghai, and Vietnam's largest container port, Ho Chi Minh City, has also narrowed per forty-foot equivalent unit (FEU) for shipments to the ports of LA and Long Beach.

Even with increased costs for shippers, they will continue to bring in imports from non-China nations because the situation remains highly unpredictable, Sand said. ""There is every possibility the higher tariffs come into effect 90 days from now or even at an earlier stage,"" he added.

In this article

Wall Street banks just posted their biggest-ever haul from stock trading as the opening months of President Donald Trump's tenure led to upheavals across asset classes — and the need for institutional investors around the world to position themselves for a new regime.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America each notched record equities trading revenue in the first quarter, with the first three producing roughly $4 billion in revenue apiece.

When including Citigroup and Wells Fargo, the six largest U.S. banks put up $16.3 billion in stock trading in the quarter, 33% more than a year earlier and higher than in previous periods of tumult, like the 2020 coronavirus pandemic or the 2008 global financial crisis.

The performance, which helped every bank except Wells Fargo beat expectations for the quarter, was deemed ""spectacular,"" ""extraordinary"" and ""awesome"" by analysts in conference calls over the past week.

It's a twist on the anticipated Trump boom for Wall Street.

Trump's second time in office was supposed to be good for Wall Street's dealmakers, the investment bankers handling billion-dollar acquisitions and high-profile IPO listings. Instead, deal activity has remained tepid, and the biggest beneficiaries so far have been sitting on bank's trading floors.

While equities traders put up the biggest gains during the first quarter, according to their earnings releases, fixed income personnel also saw higher revenue on rising activity in currencies, commodities and bond markets.

""So long as the volatility continues — and there's no reason to believe it's going to stop anytime soon — equities trading desks should remain plenty busy,"" James Shanahan, a bank analyst at Edward Jones, said in a phone interview.

While investment banking has remained muted as corporate leaders put off making strategic decisions amid ongoing uncertainty, professional investors have ""a lot to play for"" as they seek to rack up gains, Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said Friday.  

Booming trading results will help big banks as they set aside potentially billions of dollars for soured loans as the economy weakens further, Shanahan said. JPMorgan executives said Friday that their models assume U.S. unemployment will rise to 5.8% later this year. Unemployment stood at 4.2% in March, according to data from the Labor Department.

The environment leaves regional banks, which mostly lack sizeable trading operations, in a ""tough spot"" amid stagnant loan growth and elevated borrower defaults, Shanahan added.

The first quarter is typically a busy one for trading as investors at hedge funds, pensions and other active managers start their performance cycles anew.

That was especially true this year; hours after his January swearing-in ceremony, Trump said he would soon implement tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The next month, he began escalating trade tensions with China, while also targeting specific industries and products like automobiles and steel.

The dynamic — in which Trump introduced, and then scaled back sweeping tariffs with profound implications for American businesses — reached a fever pitch in early April, around his so-called Liberation Day announcements. That's when markets began making historic moves, as both equities and government bonds whipsawed amid the chaos.

The heightened activity levels could mean that the second quarter is even more profitable for Wall Street's giants than the first.

""We obviously saw significant moves in equity markets as people positioned for a different kind of trade policy during March"" that led to ""higher activity for us in a variety of ways,"" Goldman CEO David Solomon told analysts on Monday.

So far in the second quarter, ""the business is performing very well and clients are very active"" Solomon said.

Wall Street has evolved since the 2008 financial crisis, which consolidated trading and investment banking among fewer, larger firms after Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were wiped out.

Led by folks including Morgan Stanley's Pick — who is credited with overhauling the firm's fixed income business and taking its equities franchise to new heights before he became CEO last year — Wall Street's dominant trading desks are providing ever-faster execution and larger credit lines to professional investors all over the world.

Rather than wagering house money on bets, they have leaned more to facilitating trades and providing leverage for clients, meaning they profit from activity, whether markets go up or down.

""We've been working with clients nonstop,"" Pick said Friday. ""For all of the concerns about what could come down the road in the real economy, the market-making and the ability to transact to clients as they up and down their leverage levels has been very orderly.""

A federal judge found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for ignoring his order barring the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious El Salvador prison.

""The Court ultimately determines that the Government's actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt,"" Judge James Boasberg wrote in a court opinion Wednesday.

""The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions,"" Boasberg wrote. ""None of their responses has been satisfactory.""

Boasberg gave the administration one week to submit a declaration explaining its plan to ""purge"" the contempt finding.

That means ""voluntarily obeying the court order"" by giving the deported people the opportunity to challenge their removal through proper legal proceedings, he wrote.

But if the government decides not to take that step, Boasberg said, it must instead file a declaration identifying the person or people who ""made the decision not to halt the transfer"" of the Venezuelans on March 15 and 16, in spite of the judge's orders.

If declarations are ""unsatisfactory,"" the judge said that he will order sworn witness testimony or depositions conducted by plaintiffs' lawyers. He would then ask the Justice Department to prosecute contempt. If the DOJ declines to do so, or says it cannot, Boasberg will appoint another attorney to take over the prosecution.

The White House plans to seek ""immediate appellate relief,"" communications director Steven Cheung wrote on X after the court opinion.

""The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,"" Cheung wrote.

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement to NBC News that Boasberg is ""rightly laser focused on the return of the individuals sent to the notorious Salvadoran prison with no due process and that also remains our concern.""

Boasberg's opinion is the latest legal development stemming from the Trump administration's efforts to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.

Last month, Trump invoked a wartime law from 1798 known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport a group of Venezuelans who were alleged to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

Five of them, who all deny being gang members, swiftly filed a lawsuit seeking to block their removal from the U.S.

At a hearing soon after, Boasberg learned that flights carrying the Venezuelans may have already taken off, though the attorneys for the government did not share details at that time. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order blocking the removals, telling the government that they must comply with it — even if that meant turning the planes around in midair.

""Despite the Court's written Order and the oral command spelling out what was required for compliance, the Government did not stop the ongoing removal process,"" Boasberg noted in Wednesday's filing.

The Trump administration appealed the order up to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 5-4 ruling earlier this month, the high court sided with the Trump administration in part: It allowed officials to use the Aliens Enemies Act for deportations, but required that the Venezuelans have the chance to bring their cases to court.

Boasberg wrote that that decision ""effectively said that the Constitution flatly prohibits the Government from doing exactly what it did that Saturday, when it secretly loaded people onto planes, kept many of them in the dark about their destination, and raced to spirit them away before they could invoke their due-process rights.""

In this article

Technology stocks dropped Wednesday, led by a 7% plunge in Nvidia, as the chipmaking sector signaled that President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plans could hamper semiconductor demand.

Nvidia revealed in a filing Tuesday that it take a $5.5 billion charge in the first quarter tied to exporting its H20 graphics processing units to China and other countries.The government will also require a license to ship the chips there and other destinations, the company said.

The Nvidia chip was designed specifically for China use to meet U.S. export restrictions barring the sale of advanced artificial intelligence processors during former President Joe Biden's administration. The chips totaled an estimated $12 billion to $15 billion in revenue last year. Advanced Micro Devices echoed similar concerns, saying in a filing Wednesday that it expects a $800 million hit from curbs on its MI308 products.

The disclosures from Nvidia and AMD serve as the first major warning signs that Trump's fierce battle with China could stifle growth for the critical components utilized in the world's largest tech innovations. The administration has made some exemptions for electronics, including semiconductors, but has warned that separate tariffs could come in the future.

Adding to the sour sentiment was a disappointing print from Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML. The company missed order expectations and said tariff restrictions create demand uncertainty, pushing shares down 7%. Equipment makers Applied Materials and Lam Research fell about 5% in sympathy.

Chipmaking stocks fell across the sector, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF declining more than 4%. AMD plummeted about 7%, while Micron Technology, Marvell Technology and Broadcom slipped more than 2% each.

The declines spilled over into the broader market and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which dropped more than 3%. Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft declined around 3% each, while Tesla fell 5%. Alphabet lost more than 2%.

Investors had hoped President Trump's new term in office would usher in a period of strength for the technology sector. That hope helped power the market to new highs in the post-election market rally and sent top tech executives flocking Washington to show their support on Inauguration Day.

But technology stocks have recorded significant market cap losses since the January, whipsawing in the wake of Trump's tariff announcements as global trade war fears and recession concerns mounted. Year to date, Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon have lost about a fifth of their value, while Tesla is down more than 40%.

The ongoing tariff uncertainty and swift changes in policy have created a volatile stretch for global markets. Stocks initially fell on the news, leading the the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks to shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value over two trading days. The turbulence continued as Trump later announced a 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs, sending the Nasdaq Composite to its second-best session ever last week.

While technology stocks have bounced from their lows, megacaps sit off their highs this month. Apple and Meta Platforms are down more than 12% each in April, while Amazon and Tesla have slumped more than 8%. Nvidia is down about 7%.

As tensions escalate across the global financial order, three senior voices from the Bitcoin Policy Institute — Matthew Pines, Zack Shapiro, and Zack Cohen — offer a sobering and strategic forecast: America may soon revalue its gold to buy Bitcoin, fundamentally reshaping global power dynamics.

The United States has long relied on the dollar and U.S. Treasuries as the twin pillars of its economic, fiscal and monetary strategies. But what happens when these instruments lose their luster?

According to the Bitcoin Policy Institute's Head of Policy, Zack Shapiro, the current financial system is entering a historic inflection point. In a recent interview for the Bitcoin Policy Hour, he noted “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that's just a global seismic shock,” going on to say: “We probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.”

And while the changing monetary order, a potential movement from Treasuries as the reserve asset towards Bitcoin, is largely evident for those with eyes to see, the paths that can be taken on that journey are myriad and gold's role is the largest question mark facing the market.

Recent discussions around revaluing U.S. gold holdings — still officially priced at $42.22 per ounce — could unleash nearly $1 trillion in new purchasing power should the U.S. decide to draw upon it. What would the U.S. do with that windfall? If BPI's policy thinkers are right, it might be deployed to acquire a strategic Bitcoin reserve in a budget neutral manner in alignment with the remit of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Executive Order.

Gold Is Ancient. Bitcoin Is Strategic.

Matthew Pines, Executive Director of BPI, frames the choice in stark geoeconomic terms. “In terms of strategic leverage, there's an asymmetric advantage for the United States to having Bitcoin monetize relative to gold,” he noted. Pines went to note that the U.S. and its population owns ~35% of all Bitcoin in circulation — a ratio that gives Washington serious incentive to prefer digital over metallic money.

Gold, despite its historical credibility, is “centralizable, expensive to transport, and incompatible with a 21st-century economy,” said Pines. While central banks continue stacking it as a hedge against the weaponization of Treasuries, its utility as a modern reserve asset remains constrained.

Bitcoin, by contrast, is fast, global, and increasingly liquid — a networked form of monetary energy that sidesteps the geopolitical chokepoints that define traditional finance.

The Post-Dollar World Has Already Begun

The dollar remains dominant — but fragile. Shapiro cited Triffin's Dilemma, noting how the U.S. must increasingly choose between domestic economic goals and the international demands of reserve currency issuance. Sanctions like those imposed on Russia's dollar reserves in 2022 shook global confidence in the neutrality of U.S. assets. Since then, foreign central banks have responded by moving rapidly into gold — and in some cases, Bitcoin.

“The Treasury is becoming less of a neutral reserve asset,” Shapiro said, referencing escalating disorder in the bond markets and the U.S.'s perceived politicization of financial power.

Yet both he and Pines stress that America still has tools — and Bitcoin may be the most potent among them. By shifting reserves into Bitcoin, the U.S. could reduce reliance on debt issuance, secure asymmetric leverage in a digitized world, and act from a position of strength in competition with its geopolitical rivals such as China and Russia.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A National Imperative?

Under the executive order now guiding Trump administration's Bitcoin strategy, departments like Treasury and Commerce are already exploring “budget-neutral” paths to Bitcoin acquisition. This includes:

Pines emphasizes the urgency of institutional execution: “Words matter — especially when they come from the White House,” he noted. “An executive order stating Bitcoin is strategic is itself a global signal.”

However, he also highlighted bureaucratic inertia as a real challenge: “There's a massive difference between the speed at which the White House wants to move and the ability of the federal bureaucracy to follow.”

From Theory to Detonation: Global Fallout of a U.S. Bitcoin Pivot

If America were to follow through on a large-scale acquisition of Bitcoin, the effects would be both immediate and far-reaching.

“Other nation-states will see that they can't be left behind,” said Shapiro. “It would change central bank reserve strategies around the world.”

Global rebalancing would follow. Countries heavily invested in gold or Treasuries would reassess. Hard assets like gold may see diminished demand, while Bitcoin would surge in legitimacy and price. Domestically, such a move would generate massive balance sheet gains for the federal government and re-anchor U.S. dominance in the next monetary era.

Is Bitcoin America's Next Superpower Lever?

Both Shapiro and Pines agree: whatever your view of Triffin's Dilemma or monetary policy history, Bitcoin is now too strategic to ignore.

“Bitcoin is indispensable,” said Shapiro. “Wherever we're going next, it's going to help us get there.”

Whether the United States will truly “dump gold” is yet to be determined. But, to quote the late Charlie Munger: “Show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome.” The incentives, given U.S.-China competition and America's relative dominance with regards to its domestic Bitcoin holdings, suggests an about face on gold could very well be in the cards. 

Investors and policymakers have no-doubt begun running a similar calculus. As Bitcoiners like to say, it's time to embrace the game theory.

Bitcoin Struggles at Resistance as Bearish Divergences Mount

Bitcoin pierced overhead resistance and set a slightly higher local high above $86,000 but failed to hold the level, quickly falling back to the bottom of the daily TBO Cloud. Despite BTC remaining inside the Cloud—a generally bullish zone—momentum appears to be fading. Daily volume has slipped below the 30-day moving average, and although OBV is still trending above its moving average, signaling underlying strength, the price action is showing hesitation.

The daily RSI printed a lower high, suggesting weakening momentum. Meanwhile, two fresh TBT Bearish Divergence signals have appeared on the 4-hour chart, mimicking the bearish setup seen in late April before BTC dropped from $88,000 to $74,000. A repeat of that dramatic move is unlikely, but these warnings point to a possible pullback to the $80,000 range.



Market-Wide Divergences and Weakness in Altcoins Raise Concern

Stablecoin dominance rose slightly and closed above the daily TBO Cloud, with a short-term target at 8.22%. A rise to that level would likely coincide with a broader pullback across the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, defying bearish divergence seen between price and RSI on the daily chart. This divergence suggests eventual weakness, yet BTC.D continues to push higher.

Top 10 Dominance closed below the TBO Cloud but is showing strength through higher lows on RSI. OTHERS.D, on the other hand, is nearing its April 7th low. Even though it printed a higher low on RSI yesterday, the chart remains firmly bearish. TOTAL has maintained its structure inside the TBO Cloud, and OBV continues to trend higher, but two TBT Bearish Divergences on its 4-hour chart mirror the BTC setup and suggest caution.

The broader altcoin market remains vulnerable. OTHERS is still strong bearish, and although OBV is holding key support, the lack of a relief rally—despite falling BVOL7D—indicates how dependent ALTs are on Bitcoin's slow grind upward. Without BTC leading, low-cap coins and OTHERS will likely continue chopping lower.

Altcoin Setups Turning Bearish Amid BTC Uncertainty

SOL continues to hold inside the daily TBO Cloud and above the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, but a pair of recent TBT Bearish Divergences on the 4-hour chart suggest a possible move down to $110. This would also close the open CME gap at $121. AVAX recently printed a bearish divergence cluster, with downside targets around $15 aligning with TBO Support.

OM rallied back to its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level, but remains highly vulnerable to another pullback. HYPE triggered two bearish divergence signals on the 4-hour just below TBO Support, and XMR has climbed back above the daily TBO Cloud after last week's steep drop, showing unexpected resilience.

RENDER is signaling a likely reversal, with bearish divergence and a TBO Close Long in progress on the 4-hour just below resistance. IP followed with its first 4-hour TBO Close Short yesterday, and WIF was rejected at overhead resistance, targeting a move back down to 0.304.

Some Bright Spots Persist, but Caution Is Advised

CORE is a standout performer, now printing a TBO Open Long on the daily chart. Strong OBV and RSI back the bullish continuation, making this a solid DCA Bot candidate. RAY is climbing inside the daily TBO Cloud but faces conflicting signals, with bearish divergence on the 4-hour even as it tests TBO Resistance. GRASS is consolidating tightly; a breakout above local resistance could spark a strong move toward $2.

PENDLE remains bullish overall and is in a TBO Open Long, but weakening volume and flattening OBV raise concerns about a short-term drop to the bottom of the TBO Cloud before another push higher. SPX appears to be retracing to 4-hour TBO Support, and FARTCOIN has now printed three bearish divergence signals below its 4-hour TBO Resistance. Despite strong bullish trends earlier, momentum is waning. A small short produced solid returns, and with BTC looking shaky, FARTCOIN could be vulnerable to a larger move down.

Final Thoughts

The confluence of bearish divergence signals across Bitcoin, TOTAL, and many altcoins is a clear warning that a short-term correction may be underway. BTC's failure to hold above $86,000 and the sharp rise in 4-hour divergence signals point to a potential retest of lower support levels. Altcoins remain fragile and continue to overreact, following Bitcoin's lead due to the Multiple Factor Effect.

Until BTC can reclaim and close above overhead resistance with strong volume, expect volatility and downside risk to dominate the short term.

Market maker and investment firm DWF Labs has bought $25 million in WLFI tokens in a ""strategic private transaction"" with World Liberty Financial, the crypto project backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his family. 

WLFI is the native token of World Liberty Financial, an Ethereum-based decentralized finance platform that aims to provide crypto borrowing and lending services. DeFi is a catchall term that encompasses the wide array of financial applications that utilize cryptocurrencies and operate without centralized middleman.

Dubai-based DWF Labs said it had bought the tokens as it expands into New York City. The firm added that it planned to provide liquidity for World Liberty Financial's new stablecoin, USD1.

Decrypt last month reported that World Liberty Financial had launched USD1. 

""DWF Labs's purchase of WLF tokens underscores its desire to participate in WLFI governance and focus on projects addressing real-world financial needs, as evidenced by the growing demand for institutional-ready stablecoins like USD1,"" DWF Labs said. 

World Liberty Financial co-founder Zak Folkman added in a statement: ""We believe that crypto is going to transform and improve global finance, and stablecoins like USD1 will continue to be fundamental elements in the DeFi technology stack.""

President Trump campaigned to help the crypto industry and has been heavily involved in a number of digital asset ventures. 

Ahead of his inauguration, Trump launched his own Solana meme coin, Official Trump. And in office, he signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve—fulfilling one of his campaign promises—and became the first president to sign a crypto-related bill into law.

Trump's family has been involved in his various digital asset efforts, with Eric Trump initially announcing the launch of World Liberty Financial. Critics have hammered the president for allegedly using his position to personally benefit his crypto initiatives, however, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters.

DWF made headlines last year after the firm fired one of its partners who a woman accused of spiking her drink in an attempt to drug her.

Oops, something went wrong

Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 

Bitcoin was born as a response to institutional failure, a decentralized escape hatch from corruptible centralized finance and a north star of self sovereignty. Bitcoin's true vision was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That phrase is right there in the Bitcoin white paper's title from Satoshi himself.

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Today, Bitcoin is many things:

A store of value

A form of digital gold

A macro asset

But Bitcoin is not electronic cash. It is too volatile for daily use, too slow to scale and too rigid to adapt as a cash equivalent. Somewhere along the way, Bitcoin gave up on being the system, and instead became the signal.

Ethereum, by contrast, might be the one actually delivering on Bitcoin's original promise.

Thanks to Ethereum's programmability, we now have stablecoins, arguably the most successful crypto use case to date. Dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT settle trillions in peer-to-peer value across borders 24/7 with no bank intermediaries. Stablecoins are Bitcoin's white paper come to life, minus the volatility.

Ethereum's scale can be shown through on-chain data.

Stablecoins on Ethereum and its Layer 2s now rival the transaction volume of major credit and debit card networks. In markets where local currencies are unstable or financial access is limited, stablecoins have become lifelines. They are used for remittances, payroll, savings and even commerce.

The irony is that Bitcoin wanted to replace fiat, but it's Ethereum that has quietly made fiat better. It gave the dollar superpowers like composability, programmability and global mobility. And it's doing it without centralized permission.

Here's the kicker: Ethereum's evolution doesn't stop at payments. Once you understand the technology, you realize ETH does everything BTC can do, and so much more.

Where Bitcoin remains focused on scarcity, Ethereum is building infrastructure. The rise of real-world asset tokenization (RWAs) is a perfect example. Treasury bills, private credit and fund shares are now being issued on Ethereum, bringing regulated assets into composable finance. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and other legacy giants aren't launching on Bitcoin; they're building on Ethereum.

Additionally, unlike Bitcoin's inert capital, Ethereum enables native yield through staking, allowing participants to secure the network while earning predictable returns — an increasingly attractive feature for institutions seeking on-chain cash flow.

This isn't to say Bitcoin has failed. It serves a different role: a monetary anchor in the digital world. But its utility is limited. Ethereum, on the other hand, is becoming the global settlement layer for on-chain assets.

While Bitcoin adoption has captured mainstream headlines, Ethereum's fundamentals quietly continue to grow as the platform gains institutional market share. Some metrics to back up Ethereum's growing influence and usage include:

Developer activity

Stablecoin usage

Real-world adoption

Ethereum isn't replacing Bitcoin. But it's fulfilling what Bitcoin started: a decentralized, global financial system with open access and programmable trust — in short, digital cash. Bitcoin sparked the movement. But Ethereum is scaling it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Analyst Predicts Emerging Altcoin Will Outperform XRP In Q2: Best Crypto To Buy?","https://financefeeds.com/analyst-predicts-emerging-altcoin-will-outperform-xrp-in-q2-best-crypto-to-buy/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 15:46:37 GMT","

In a crypto market obsessed with altcoins like XRP, BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is beginning to draw everyone's attention.

Analysts are betting that this new project – which has already raised $4.7 million in presale – might outpace XRP this quarter. 

It's been a crazy few weeks for XRP holders.

Currently trading at $2.08, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency dipped 3% in the last 24 hours, though it's still up 16% over the week.

Despite its established position, XRP seems stuck in a battle between bulls and bears around the critical $2 level – and this battle could drag on for some time. 

Meanwhile, BTCBULL's prospects look a lot clearer.

The project's presale is blowing up right now, with tokens priced at just $0.002465 each.

https://twitter.com/BTCBULL_TOKEN/status/1912445918005129497

Investors are pouring money into the presale in the belief that BTCBULL could be the next big thing. 

But with the team raising the token price in under two days, now is the last chance to get involved at the current rate. 

BTC Bull Token's team makes buying in as simple as possible.

Whether you prefer using crypto, a bank card, or the Best Wallet app, they've got you covered.

Their roadmap looks solid too – a DEX listing is already locked in for when the presale concludes. 

What's the secret behind BTC Bull Token's surging popularity?

It's not just another random altcoin – think of it as Bitcoin's counterpart in ERC-20 form.

Built on Ethereum, BTCBULL is strategically designed to capitalize on Bitcoin's success while offering a reward system that BTC itself doesn't provide.

The core concept is surprisingly simple.

As Bitcoin hits price milestones for the first time – $150K, $200K, and $250K – BTCBULL holders receive actual BTC airdrops.

Plus, with a capped supply of 21 billion tokens (a nod to Bitcoin's supply cap), this symbolic link will appeal to Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide.



But the appeal doesn't stop there. 

BTCBULL also has a burn mechanism that will destroy tokens when Bitcoin reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. 

When you combine this with the attractive staking rewards, estimated at 87% per year, it's easy to see why investors are flocking to the presale. 

Even well-known analysts are getting involved. 

Just this week, Umar Khan from 99Bitcoins released a video predicting that BTCBULL could deliver returns of 10x to 50x after its launch. 

Given XRP's volatile price action, Khan is essentially saying that he believes BTCBULL will outperform it in Q2.

What also sets BTCBULL apart is its position in the market. 

Unlike XRP or most other cryptos, the token doesn't try to compete with Bitcoin; it partners with it.

When was the last time you saw a token that actually rewards you with BTC – the real coin – just for holding?

Most projects don't take this approach, yet BTCBULL does, giving it a unique selling point.



The timing of the project's emergence couldn't be better either.Bitcoin just bounced back above $84,000 after last week's dip, and most traders believe the coin has bottomed out and is ready for another rally in its journey back to January's all-time high.

BTC Bull Token is in a great spot to benefit if this happens.

So, for investors who missed Bitcoin's early days, BTCBULL is like a “second chance” at exponential returns.

Altcoins like XRP might be more established, but their upside is limited, unlike BTCBULL.

Bloomberg's editorial board has warned of a potential financial crisis similar to what happened in 2008/9 happening this year as geopolitical risks rise. 

In an article, the board warned that such a crisis could be triggered by the substantial sums of money held in the debt market. As business and consumer confidence fall and recession risks grow, they argued that lenders may begin demanding more cash collateral.

The board also warned that the US was highly leveraged, with the public debt soaring to over $36.8 trillion. Total corporate debt has jumped to a record high of over $13.7 trillion, while households hold over $18 trillion.

Bloomberg warns that banks and other lenders lack the resources to absorb these potential losses. The concern is that the next financial crisis could be worse than those that occurred during the pandemic and the 2008 financial meltdown.

This warning comes as the U.S. has alienated itself from allies by imposing tariffs. It has even raised tariffs on goods from China to 145%, increasing the risk of a recession. Polymarket traders currently put the odds of a recession this year at 65%.

A recession or a financial crisis would hurt Bitcoin (BTC), altcoins, and the stock market initially as the fear rises. It would also lead to a higher unemployment rate in the economy.

However, history shows these risk assets often perform well after major crises due to Federal Reserve and government interventions. The Fed slashed interest rates to zero during both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. It then implemented quantitative easing, printed money, and injected liquidity into the economy.

In parallel, the federal government provided a $700 billion bailout to banks during the GFC and issued trillions in stimulus checks during the pandemic. These actions helped trigger a strong rally in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.

U.S. indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 entered bull markets after the GFC. Similarly, Bitcoin, altcoins, and equities soared following the COVID-era interventions, before retreating when the Fed began hiking rates in 2022.

UFC president Dana White has officially joined the advisory board of VeChain, a layer-1 blockchain platform focused on real-world use cases. 

White is joining the board alongside Nobel Prize-winning physicist Konstantin Novoselov. The idea behind this is to boost awareness of blockchain technology and help it reach more people around the world.

Dana White is a huge name in sports. He runs the UFC, which is watched by millions around the world, and he also started Power Slap, a slap-fighting league. 

VeChain says White is joining their advisory board to help promote their brand and ideas to a wider audience. “VeChain is an incredible partner for the UFC and Power Slap, and I'm honored to join their advisory board,” White said in a statement. “I'm passionate about technology, and with their products and innovation, I'm looking forward to helping elevate their brand to the next level.”

White is joining another big name on the board: Konstantin Novoselov, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. VeChain says these two bring different strengths. Together, they're combining marketing power and scientific knowledge to make blockchain more useful in real life.

One of the projects White will help support is called VeBetterDAO. It's a platform that rewards people for doing eco-friendly things in the real world. Users can earn special tokens called B3TR for taking part. But just to be clear, VeChain says White will not be getting any of those tokens or VeChain (VET) coins as payment for being an adviser.

VeChain and UFC have already worked together before now. They added small chips to UFC fighter gloves using VeChain's tech. These chips prove the gloves are real and not fake, which helps when the items are sold or auctioned, especially for charity. “The NFC + blockchain combination helps demonstrate the items are authentic,” said VeChain co-founder and CEO Sunny Lu.

VeChain builds tools using blockchain to solve real-world problems, like making products easy to track or proving they're real. The company is also working with the UFC Foundation and other groups, with more news expected soon.

Bitcoin (BTC) and major cryptocurrencies fell over 3% as profit-taking followed Tuesday's rally. 

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano's ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors.

The cryptocurrency market added 8% over 7 days, stabilising at the $2.7 trillion level since Saturday.

FxPro's Alex Kuptsikevich says a move higher could bolster hopes for further gains, but these expectations will “only be confirmed after a solid consolidation above the 200-day moving average, which is now near $2.97 trillion.“

""Bitcoin continues its cautious rise, trading above its 50-day moving average and reaching $85,700. This is an important technical attempt to reverse the downtrend. Interestingly, the 200-day average is quite close, so a second confirmation of a trend change could come quite quickly,” Kuptsikevich said, adding that bitcoin had entered a resistance accumulation zone where the “strength of the initial rebound may fade.”

Solana's SOL is showing strength in a downtrodden market, making it ripe for a move higher if overall conditions improve.

“Solana is recovering faster than many of the major altcoins, trading at its 50-day moving average near $130. A consolidation above this level will open the way to $145, the area of previous peaks. A sustained move above them will signal a break of the downtrend and could lead to a move towards $180,” Kuptsikevich noted.

On a more pessimistic approach, prominent market chartist Peter Brandt is not optimistic about bitcoin setting new highs in the current cycle.

“A trendline violation does NOT signify a transition of trend BTC Sorry,” the trader noted said in an X post in response to sentiment for a bullish rebound.

Trendlines are a subjective price-action analyst method and less dependable than moving averages or key levels. A break, used in tandem with technical analysis, could hint at a change in movement.

 Bitcoin optimism continues to focus on the declining strength of the US dollar amid the trade war with China — and the worst may not be over for the greenback yet. 

Bitcoin (BTC) centered on $84,000 at the April 16 Wall Street open amid hopes that a weak US dollar would fuel a bull market comeback.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD consolidating after a swift comedown from local highs the day prior.

That volatility had accompanied ongoing developments in the US-China trade war, with crypto and risk assets staying sensitive to headlines and statements from parties such as US President Donald Trump.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index traded down 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively, at the time of writing.

Gold remained the standout winner, having set new all-time highs above $3,300 per ounce on the day.

“Unlike gold, BTC has not caught a safe-haven bid,” trading firm QCP Capital summarized in its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers. 

Looking for potential tailwinds, market participants focused on the US dollar's inability to reclaim prior support after sliding precipitously as the trade war took hold.

The US dollar index (DXY) hovered near multiyear lows after rejecting at the psychologically significant 100 mark.

“DXY is dropping at its fastest pace since 2023,” popular trader BitBull told followers in a post on X.

BitBull drew comparisons to BTC price performance from the time, with early 2023 seeing Bitcoin and altcoins emerge from the pit of the 2022 bear market.

“Back then, $BTC had already bottomed (Q4 2022) and went on to rally 200%+ within a year,” he continued.

Andre Dragosch, European head of research at asset management firm Bitwise, meanwhile flagged Goldman Sachs research seeing further DXY downside to come.

“NOTE: US Dollar is still significantly overvalued according to GS,” he commented alongside a Goldman chart of dollar strength versus US growth performance. 

Bitcoin traders eyed various positive chart signals on the day, with these including a potential bottom formation on the 4-hour chart.

“Forming an Inverse Head & Shoulders Pattern on the 4H timeframe, if we manage to hold a Higher Low in the coming days,” popular trader Luca suggested.

Crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe hoped for a fresh retest of resistance, for him one of two key areas of interest.

“Bitcoin is still nicely consolidating between the two levels,” he concluded.

 Mantra released a post-crash statement on its OM token but offered little clarity while confirming buyback and burn plans to support the community. 

Update (April 16, 6:50 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add a comment by Mantra CEO John Mullin.

Troubled decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mantra released an official statement addressing the reasons for a 92% flash crash of its OM token on April 13.

An April 16 announcement titled “Statement of Events: 13 April 2025” reiterates that the crash did not involve any token sales by the project itself, and the Mantra team remains fully functional and continues investigating the incident.

Although Mantra CEO John Mullin previously said that the team was preparing a post-mortem, the new statement offered few new details about the reasons behind the rapid movement of OM tokens to exchanges and the subsequent liquidation cascade.

“The purpose of the announcement was to share an updated analysis on the key factors that caused the price movement and verifiable data about the circulating supply,” Mullin subsequently told Cointelegraph, adding that the investigation is still underway.

In the update, the Mantra team pointed to “significant amounts of OM tokens moved onto exchanges for use as collateral” and ""forced OM position closures"" as the main factors that triggered liquidations, including automatic ones.

“We believe those are the reasons for the event, but we are still looking into the details of how and why the events transpired,” the Mantra CEO told Cointelegraph.

As the investigation unfolds, the Mantra team plans to share a formal post-mortem, Mullin added.

In order to proceed with the investigation, Mantra has teamed up with unspecified blockchain analysts to get insights on the underlying causes of the crash, Mullin told Cointelegraph.

“We have done so, although the details are confidential,” the CEO stated.

Mantra has also been considering hiring a forensic auditor following the April 13 events. According to Mullin, the discussions involved professionals, including the business consultancy firm FTI Consulting, but no decisions have been made so far.

Mullin also told Cointelegraph the Mantra team has about 90 full-time employees, adding:

In the post, Mantra reiterated that there are two types of OM tokens, with one being Ethereum-based (ERC-20) and the other running on Mantra's mainnet.

“The incident almost exclusively involved ERC-20 OM, as ERC-20 OM represents virtually the entire liquid market,” Mantra said in the statement.

Launched in August 2020, the original ERC-20 OM token has a fixed supply of 888.8 million OM, with 99.9% of these tokens being in public circulation as of April 15.

However, Mantra mainnet OM tokens had only 77.5 million in circulation after the Mantra Chain minted an equivalent amount of OM in October 2024.

Additionally, the post mentions a divergence in OM spot prices on OKX and Binance. The discrepancy began around 6:00 pm UTC, around an hour before the OM token's crash, according to CoinGecko.

Among its conclusions, Mantra stated that further information from its exchange partners will “provide more clarity on these events, adding:

The Mantra team confirmed that it is preparing a support plan for OM that includes both a token buyback and a supply burn. No timeline for the rollout of this plan was provided.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, OKX CEO Star Xu called Mantra a “big scandal” in a post published hours following the crash. Mantra CEO Mullin also said Binance is the biggest holder of the OM token, citing Etherscan records.

A Nontoxic Disinfectant That Is Safe for Surfaces and Skin

Hypochlorous acid has a lot of buzz in the beauty industry, but this nontoxic disinfectant has many possible uses.

By Rachel Feltman, Jen Schwartz, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

With everything from bird flu to norovirus making headlines these days, it can feel like the world is just packed with dangerous pathogens we need protection from. What if we could get a hand from an all-natural disinfectant that was more than 100 times more effective than bleach but so gentle and safe that you could spray it into your eyes?

It might sound like the sort of quackery you'd get sold in a shady Facebook group, but such a compound really does exist. It's called hypochlorous acid. And in addition to all of those awesome qualities I just listed, it's also cheap—plus you can make it at home. So why don't we use it for, like, everything?

Here to explain is Jen Schwartz, a senior features editor for Scientific American.

Jen, thanks so much for coming in to chat today.

Jen Schwartz: Thanks for having me.

Feltman: So you wrote a piece about hypochlorous acid, which I feel like I've been seeing everywhere lately. So let's start with the obvious: What is this compound?

Schwartz: So it's so fascinating to me that you say you've been seeing it everywhere because when I had this idea, which really came a few years ago, I thought that no one [laughs] knew about this. But I became aware of it in answering what this thing is: It's a disinfectant, and it is something that is made in our bodies. It is part of how our white blood cells fight infection; they go to, like, a wound that you have and they release biocides, including hypochlorous acid. That just goes and, like, dismantles bad things that you don't want, pathogens, and rips the, you know, cell walls apart and dismantles the DNA.

So it's an extremely effective disinfectant that's made in the body, and then, of course, there is a synthetic version that we can make pretty easily, and that is what we're seeing in all of these products that are used as sanitizers and disinfectants, and now it's really become more pervasive in, like, the skin-care and beauty industry for use on your skin.

Feltman: So what first got you interested in looking into this?

Schwartz: I learned about hypochlorous acid during the early days of COVID, when my dad, who at that point was still working as an ENT doctor—you know, I was like, “My God, Dad, you're, like, hovering six inches, like, over people's noses and throats during, like, acute COVID.” And we were talking, like, what is something more that, you know, people like him in, in health care could use as a tool to protect themselves—in addition, of course, to, like, wearing masks and washing your hands?

And so that's how I learned about this in the first place. And so I was really curious about, you know, how is this being studied as a potential nasal irrigation or nasal spray? Is it safe enough to put on the mucosa? And let's say, like, you are exposed in your day job, right—if you work in health care and there's an emerging [laughs], like, pandemic—is this something that you could spray up your nose once or twice a day? And if you do have viral particles hanging out there, would it kill them on the spot and prevent them from, like, entering your lungs and becoming a full-blown infection?

And so that was, like, the initial sort of question and speculation: “Are we going to potentially see this become useful in this way, as, like, a preventative?” And again, it would just be one more tool that people would have to, like, reduce severity of infection. And it looks like, you know, that has definitely been researched over the past several years. There's not, like, consensus on it. I think that's, like, a really promising potential pathway that people are looking into, and that's something pretty different from how most people are encountering hypochlorous acid right now, which as—is, like, a toner [laughs] in the beauty aisle. So I think it's cool to realize that this thing that you're spraying on your face and using to, like, cut down bacteria on your face could also have really cool medical implications.

Feltman: Yeah, and what specifically about this disinfectant makes it really exciting for all of these different applications?

Schwartz: I think what's so exciting about it is that it is so effective, right? You know, it's at least 100 times more effective at killing really hard-to-kill pathogens and microbes and bacteria and fungi—it's 100 times more effective than the active ingredient in bleach.

Feltman: Wow.

Schwartz: And so it's extremely good at what it does, and yet it's incredibly safe. It is nontoxic to people and animals. It is not bad for the environment. I mean, you can spray this stuff into your eyes; it's, it's used as a cleaner for, like, your eyelids in medical context. So what's so cool about it is that it works so well and yet, even unlike something like alcohol, which we put on our hands all the time to sanitize them—alcohol dries out your skin, it can be very irritating and lead to dermatitis and other things, and hypochlorous acid is, like, really benign in that way. And I think that's what I got so excited about.

Feltman: Yeah. So if this is so great and so, you know, gentle, why isn't it what we use to clean everything?

Schwartz: You know, and that's what I really set out to try to figure out. The most straightforward answer is that it has very little stability ...

Feltman: Mm.

Schwartz: It is not shelf-stable. So the way that it's made, you're going through a process of taking essentially salt and water and then turning it into hypochlorous acid through the process of electrolysis. And so it's, essentially, when you get to that place, it is very sensitive to light, to air, to changes in pH, and that can, you know, sort of go back into becoming just saltwater again, so it becomes completely useless in that case. Or in certain other ways it might, you know, develop more—a higher percentage of it, a higher concentration, would become, like, something like chlorine gas, which, of course, is dangerous.

So the reason it's not sort of everywhere is that it's really hard to, like, manufacture and bottle this thing and keep it exactly what it is and have the conditions be exactly right. And there's been some changes over the past several years where more companies are sort of figuring out that puzzle and making it more available to consumers, as opposed to just something that is used in, like, commercial and industrial cleaning contexts, where there's more control over how that product is managed.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and one of the things you mentioned in your piece is that, especially during the peak pandemic era, there were some countries and, you know, settings and institutions where this was almost being used to sort of fumigate people on their way in and out of shared spaces. What do we know about how effective it actually is in that context?

Schwartz: So I think, in that context, it was pretty much seen, like, maybe it's not that effective to disinfect a person [laughs] in that way. And I think, you know, what, what's really interesting is this is a great product, or it's a great molecule, to be used on surfaces and things like that. But, you know, spraying it in the air in that way, is that really that effective? Not really, especially when we're dealing with infectious, like, respiratory illnesses, where you're looking at things that are airborne or through droplets. And I think, in those cases, the sort of, you know, fogging it everywhere has been proved, like, not that effective. And what you're really trying to do when you fog a room is get, like, even distribution ...

Feltman: Mm.

Schwartz: On all types of surfaces in the room, so I don't think there was much, like—I think during the pandemic we were sort of throwing spaghetti at the wall ...

Feltman: Sure.

Schwartz: And trying all sorts of things, but I don't know that we'll see that going forward.

Feltman: Yeah, makes sense.

So you mentioned that different companies are finding solutions for the instability of this compound, but you also mentioned in your piece that there are a lot of brands marketing hypochlorous acid—like I said, I feel like I've seen it everywhere—that maybe aren't actually solving the stability problem and are maybe ultimately selling people saltwater. Could you talk a little bit more about what consumers should be on the lookout for?

Schwartz: I think what's so fascinating is that this has been used as, you know, something in, like, wound care and medical contexts for a long time, and now you're seeing that product enter a market that is regulated in a completely different way and in a, you know, far less rigorous way. We all know that there's, like, not that much oversight [laughs] when it comes to what people can call things in the beauty industry and how they're marketed.

So I think what's fascinating is there are, like, legitimate cases where we wanna be looking at: “What is this thing really good for?” And I think there are a lot of really promising potential uses for it. I just think right now, when something goes the route of, like, you know, getting made into a product that anyone can really make and bottle and sell, the thing that I get a little—that would make me skeptical are some of the products that have other additives. So if you're putting hypochlorous acid in a bottle and then you're adding, like, essential oils or all sorts of other things, that's gonna really affect the formulation ...

Feltman: Mm.

Schwartz: And its stability. So I think, like, if you want to use this as a toner or facial spray, you know, for treating acne or eczema or something to put in your gym bag to spray your face, like, after the gym, just look for something that is, like, a pure formulation. You don't need all these other additives, and they can actually potentially harm the product.

So I think that's, like, the main thing that I would look out for. And you don't need unnecessary things. Like, it doesn't need to be made out of pink Himalayan sea salt [laughs]. Like, that's just something that's, you know, a distraction from the actual use of the product.

Feltman: And there are also products that allow people to make this on their own, right?

Schwartz: Right. You know, I didn't try any of those products for myself, but I think it's really interesting. There's versions of this, right? You take something that's done in an industrial context, and you shrink it down to, like, a countertop-sized device, and, you know, there's no reason, really, why this shouldn't work. And I think if you're someone who takes, like, the cleaning of your house really seriously or you've just had something like norovirus sweep through your house, could this be a really interesting application? I think so, and I think what's great about it is that, you know, you can't put Clorox bleach everywhere, on all surfaces. With hypochlorous acid there's just a lot more applications, not just in surfaces, where it's not gonna harm it and where it's going to be effective, but also, of course, like, on your skin. So if you have pets and kids, it's not the same concern as spraying bleach everywhere.

Feltman: Have you been using hypochlorous acid yourself?

Schwartz: I have been. I have it with me today [laughs]. One of the things that I love using it for is, I spray it on my phone case ...

Feltman: Mm.

Schwartz: So I do that a lot. I also, like, when I get back from the grocery store, I spray it on, like, my bananas and just leave them on the counter or if I get avocados. I do often spray my face and my hands.

The number one thing that this story sort of informed me about when I was reporting is, like, as with all disinfectants, you have to let them sit for a little bit. And hypochlorous acid on hard, nonporous surfaces still requires, like, 30 to 60 seconds to be, like, really, really effective at killing everything. But if you think about the way that we clean surfaces in our lives or even spray our hands, are you letting something sit on your hands for 60 seconds? Are they saturated? I used to clean my phone with, you know, whatever I could find. But I would spray it on and then sort of immediately wipe it off. And so what I've learned is that however effective your disinfectant is, you also have to be using it in the right way.

Feltman: Mm.

Schwartz: So I've gotten a lot better at, like [laughs], spraying my hands, really soaking them, and then letting them sit for a minute, and then I'll, like, wipe off the rest, and I feel like that wiping action is also really good at physically removing things [laughs] that might be there.

Feltman: Yeah. Thanks so much for coming in to chat about this. It's rare that I see something, like, lauded as, like, a miracle molecule, and then I'm like, “Oh, it turns out it is actually probably good for stuff.” I will probably get this to spray on my face, so thank you [laughs].

Schwartz: [Laughs] Thank you.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to interview a member of the Scientific American team who's been covering science and technology since before the days of the Internet as we know it.

How to Talk about Vaccines in an Era of Scientific Mistrust

Spillover from the politicization of the COVID pandemic has eroded vaccine confidence, but everyday people can play a role in building it back up

By Tara Haelle edited by Lauren J. Young

When Carli Leon heard the news of a child who died in February during the current measles outbreak in West Texas—the first child to die of measles in the U.S. since 2003—her initial reaction was “That could have been my kid.”

Leon, a 42-year-old mother of two in Cleveland, Ohio, had always intended to vaccinate her children. But then, while pregnant with her first child in 2012, a family she nannied for suggested she read a book that claimed to describe the dangers of vaccines. “It just snowballed from there,” Leon recalls. As a soon-to-be first-time mom, Leon says, she was lonely, and the idea that vaccines could injure her kids scared her. She was quickly welcomed into the antivaccine community, where she found a sense of belonging. She began fearing the risks of vaccines more than the risks of diseases she had never seen—precisely because vaccination had made them so rare.

“I wasn't stupid,” she says. “I was just getting brainwashed.”

Fears about vaccines have been around since the first one was developed against smallpox in the late 1700s, but vaccine hesitancy has risen in recent years. Now ongoing measles outbreaks reveal the growing threat it poses to public health. Researchers are learning what contributes to vaccine concerns and how people can effectively address them.

Many factors that are now driving vaccine hesitancy have been around for centuries, such as uneasiness with injecting a foreign substance into a healthy body and the impossible expectations for vaccines to be “100 percent safe,” says Alison Buttenheim, a professor of nursing and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “What's different now,” she says, “is the double whammy of the politicization of the pandemic and COVID vaccine and now the new [federal] administration.”

Before COVID, vaccine hesitancy mostly clustered in certain groups, but the pandemic's barrage of misinformation amplified questions and doubts about vaccines. “A lot of people had no clue how toxic the [vaccine misinformation] environment was,” says Heidi Larson, who studies vaccine hesitancy at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “People who were taking vaccines for granted got exposed [to misinformation], and now there's no turning back.”

Missed wellness appointments for children during the pandemic contributed to the recent national dip in childhood immunizations, but another factor was the spillover from COVID vaccine concerns. Multiple studies have documented the effect of COVID vaccine hesitancy on childhood immunization rates, including a reduced willingness among parents to vaccinate against measles.

“Certainly we're seeing more hesitancy across the board,” says Nathan Boonstra, a pediatrician at Blank Children's Hospital in Des Moines, Iowa, and chair of the state's immunization coalition. Historically vaccination has had bipartisan support, and Boonstra has been frustrated as it has become increasingly politically polarized. “I'm worried that identity will strengthen, and we're going to see more hesitancy from people who align politically in a certain direction.”

The problem is not confined to the U.S. A 2023 UNICEF report found childhood vaccine confidence declined during the pandemic in 52 out of 55 countries studied, and other countries are seeing similar political polarization around vaccines.

“The biggest driver of the decline [globally] was 18- to 34-year-olds, an age cohort that felt they had to compromise their lives the most for something that wasn't affecting them as badly,” Larson says. But that age group is also most likely to make vaccination decisions for their children in the coming years.

The current spread of measles—with more than 700 cases across 24 states—is an alarming reminder of the high stakes around falling vaccination rates, says Paul Offit, an infectious diseases physician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

“The outbreak happened because a critical percentage of parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children because they're scared of vaccines,” Offit says. He adds that a large part of that fear is a result of the decades-long advocacy against vaccines from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the new secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

In the weeks since taking the helm of the HHS, Kennedy has made several moves to stymie vaccine confidence, including canceling the Food and Drug Administration's advisory committee meeting to determine next year's flu vaccine, suggesting he will replace key vaccine advisors and postponing the next Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee meeting on vaccines. Recently, the National Institutes of Health—an agency overseen by the HHS—announced it will terminate dozens of grants for vaccine hesitancy research. “[Kennedy] believes there is a poison being given to children in this country that is causing chronic disease, and that poison is vaccines,” Offit says. “It doesn't matter how many studies are done to show he's wrong.”

In response to inquiries sent to Kennedy, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said, “We can confirm the NIH is adjusting its funding priorities to better serve the American people, which includes a reduction in funding for vaccine hesitancy research.” Hilliard also directed Scientific American to Kennedy's Fox News opinion piece about the current measles outbreak, where he notes the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine's effectiveness in prevention but also promotes vitamin A as a treatment. (Several children in West Texas are now receiving treatment for vitamin A toxicity.)

Shortly after publishing the op-ed, Kennedy made false or unsupported statements about measles and the measles vaccine during a Fox Nation interview. Offit also drew attention to Kennedy repeatedly stating that “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” even though a population needs high, uniform levels of immunity—as high as 95 percent—to prevent the spread of measles because it's very contagious.

After a second child with measles died this month, Kennedy wrote on social media, “The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”

In the response to Scientific American, the HHS's Hilliard highlighted “ongoing research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines” as a priority. Daniel Salmon, a vaccine safety researcher at Johns Hopkins University, is waiting to see how that pans out. Vaccine safety research has historically “been underfunded, slow and not very responsive to public concerns,” he says. “I've long argued for the need for more ongoing vaccine safety science resources, but it's got to be good science—robust, objective, rigorous.” Salmon, however, is nervous about how Kennedy might define high-quality vaccine safety science. In March federal officials announced the CDC—which is under the HHS—will conduct a study on vaccines and autism. Reportedly this investigation will be led by a widely discredited researcher who has published antivaccine papers and was disciplined for practicing medicine without a license.

Salmon says that subtle changes in how people talk about vaccine safety can help rebuild trust. For instance, he suggests stating that “vaccines are very safe” instead of broadly saying that “vaccines are safe.” This can prevent mistrust when someone learns about extremely rare but possible adverse effects of vaccines. “Then explain that adverse reactions are either mild and transient or very rare,” Salmon says. “People can handle the truth.”

Leon recalls two pivotal moments that eventually led her to vaccinate her daughters. The first was seeing her antivaccine friends misinterpret study findings on vaccines for pertussis, or whooping cough—helping her to truly understand “cherry-picking” of results or statements in papers to support already held beliefs. The second moment was after her cesarean delivery, when a friend asked her, “Why don't you trust the science behind vaccines, but you trust the science of surgeons who perform that procedure?”

Her friend “just kept asking me very valid, logical questions,” Leon says. “There was no animosity.”

That approach is similar to motivational interviewing, a technique that University of Colorado vaccine hesitancy researcher Sean O'Leary says can be very effective. “The basic concept is having a conversation in such a way that a person makes a health behavior change because they now understand why that change fits with their own internal motivations,” he says.

O'Leary also emphasizes the importance of reminding people that “the vast majority of parents are vaccinating their kids according to the recommended schedule,” he says. “Refusing vaccines is still an outlier behavior.” A small amount of outlying behavior still endangers the larger community, however, which is why experts agree that a key strategy in building vaccine confidence is to mobilize and engage those who do vaccinate, reinforcing those social norms.

“It's really more about just having good conversations, becoming a trusted messenger.” —Sean O'Leary, vaccine hesitancy researcher, University of Colorado





Buttenheim suggests people pay attention to state legislative bills about vaccines, get to know their state legislators and “learn how to have productive conversations about difficult topics with people you love.” But, she adds, have realistic expectations. “Beliefs and identity are tightly interwoven, so changing beliefs may require a painful—or impossible—shift in identity,” she says.

When engaging in or observing conversations online, Boonstra encourages people to do so “in good faith.” “You want them to see that you're presenting a good, logical, compassionate argument for vaccines,” he says. “It's never going to happen in the moment. You might change their thinking over time.”

It took several months of conversations with her friend before Leon came around. What changed her mind wasn't being bombarded with links from online arguments or “people telling [me] I was abusing my child”—an accusation that made her dig in her heels. O'Leary also advises avoiding arguments, which only “put people off. It's really more about just having good conversations, becoming a trusted messenger,” he says.

Voices for Vaccines, a parent-led organization that works to increase vaccine confidence, has tool kits for talking about vaccines and courses on becoming a trusted messenger. Salmon recommends the online tool Let's Talk Shots for vaccine information based on people's specific concerns.

Not everyone may change their mind about vaccines, but some, like Leon, eventually do so with time. “What works is people asking questions and being relatively patient,” Leon says. “I'm very thankful for people who helped me and stuck with me.”

Metrics details

The axion is a hypothetical fundamental particle that is conjectured to correspond to the coherent oscillation of the θ field in quantum chromodynamics1,2. Its existence would solve multiple fundamental questions, including the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics and dark matter, but the axion has never been detected. Electrodynamics of condensed-matter systems can also give rise to a similar θ, so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize the topology of materials3,4,5. Coherent oscillation of θ in condensed matter has been proposed to lead to physics directly analogous to the high-energy axion particle—the dynamical axion quasiparticle (DAQ)6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Here we report the observation of the DAQ in MnBi2Te4. By combining a two-dimensional electronic device with ultrafast pump–probe optics, we observe a coherent oscillation of θ at about 44 gigahertz, which is uniquely induced by its out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. This represents direct evidence for the presence of the DAQ, which in two-dimensional MnBi2Te4 is found to arise from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of the Berry curvature. The DAQ also has implications in light–matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics24, as it might lead to axion polaritons and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization6,15,16,17,18,19,20. Finally, the DAQ could be used to detect axion particles21,22,23. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the millielectronvolt regime, which has so far been poorly explored.

a, Time evolution of out-of-phase magnon. c,\(\widehat{z}\) projection of the out-of-phase magnon, which resembles the antiferromagnetic amplitude mode. b,d, Same as panels (a,c) but for in-phase magnon, which features an oscillation of net magnetization along \(\widehat{z}\). e, We followed the method established in ref. 53 (see detailed discussion in Methods.2). A monolayer WSe2 was stacked on top of MnBi2Te4, which breaks the layer degeneracy, allowing us to selectively probe the top layer information53. Pump-probe Kerr rotation under normal incidence was performed on this heterostructure. The pump laser launches the magnons. The probe Kerr rotation measures the out-of-plane magnetization Mz of the top layer preferentially because of the WSe2. f,g, Pump-induced ΔKerr data and FFT at different B∥.

a, The DAQ manifests as a coherent oscillation of the magnetoelectric coupling, which requires us to measure α(t) with fs time-resolution. This was achieved by combining ultrafast pump-probe optics with 2D electronic devices. We built a dual-gated 6L MnBi2Te4 device (no WSe2). The probe beam combined with the gate-applied Ez measures α, whereas the pump beam excites the magnons. By varying the delay time t, we can measure α(t) with fs time-resolution. Experimentally, this was achieved by connecting two lock-in amplifiers. An optical chopper modulated the pump laser at frequency ω1 = 1000 Hz. A functional generator modulated the gate Ez at frequency ω2 = 0.7 Hz. The signal collected by the balanced photodiode detector was first fed into a lock-in at the chopper frequency ω1 = 1000 Hz and then into the second lock-in at the Ez frequency ω2 = 0.7 Hz.

The indifference of pump light polarization suggests excitation mechanism is laser heating induced coherent oscillation of spins30. e, Coherent oscillation of Δα as a function of pump wavelength.

a, Schematics for the magnetoelectric coupling (\(\alpha =\frac{{M}_{z}}{{E}_{z}}\)). b, Maintext Fig. 4b shows the measured α as a function of the charge density n. By taking a derivative of this data, we get \(\frac{d\alpha }{dn}\) as a function of n. c, Measured α as a function of in-plane magnetic field B∥. d, Schematics for the layer Hall effect. An out-of-plane electric field Ez induces an anomalous Hall effect (finite σxy) in 6L MnBi2Te4. e,Ez induced σxy as a function of carrier density n. This Ez induced σxy directly measures \(\frac{d{\mathcal{D}}}{dn}\) (\({\mathcal{D}}\) is the Berry curvature real space dipole), which is marked in the right axis. f,Ez induced σxy as a function of B∥.

a, Out-of-plane magnetization as function of out-of-plane magnetic field B⊥ for bulk MnBi2Te4 measured by SQUID. With increasing B⊥, the magnetic order changes from the layered antiferromagnetic state to a spin-flop state. b, In the spin-flop state at B⊥ = 6 T, we measured both the Kerr rotation and the Mz, from which we determined the value of γ. c, In the antiferromagnetic ground state at B⊥ = 0 T, 6L MnBi2Te4 features an electric field induced magnetization. The magneto-electric coupling α is given by \(\alpha =\gamma \frac{dKerr}{d{E}_{z}}\). Therefore, by using the γ determined in the spin-flop state, we converted α of the antiferromagnetic state to the unit of \(\frac{{e}^{2}}{2h}\). In this method, we needed to assume that the spin flop state at B⊥ = 6 T and the antiferromagnetic state at B⊥ = 0 T have the same γ. This is an approximation.

a, First-principles band structures of 6L MnBi2Te4 with the Mn 3d orbitals highlighted. b, Calculated αzz from the spin and orbital contributions. The total αzz is the sum of the two contributions. c, Comparison of θ and Txx, which are the trace part and traceless part of αii, respectively (normalized by e2/2h).

a,d, In the even-layer MnBi2Te4, the antiferromagnetic order couples to the Dirac surface states, generating large Berry curvature on the top and bottom surfaces. We study how the Berry curvature responds upon exciting the out-of-phase or the in-phase magnon. b,e, Calculated Berry curvature sum of the top and bottom surfaces at different spin angles during the magnon oscillation under the frozen magnon approximation. The grey area (i.e., the difference of Berry curvature from top and bottom surfaces) is the Berry curvature real space dipole \({\mathcal{D}}\) (\({\mathcal{D}}=\alpha \)). c,f, Calculated θ at different spin angles during the magnon oscillation.

The strength of DAQ is measured by the change of θ per change of the antiferromagnetic order parameter L, \(\frac{\delta \theta }{\delta L}\)6. In 2D even-layer MnBi2Te4, the top and bottom surface state wavefunction can overlap and hybridize. This hybridization gap competes with with magnetism induced Zeeman gap, which leads to a large but non-quantized θ. We theoretically study the \(\frac{\delta \theta }{\delta L}\) by calculating θ as a function of L for different thicknesses. a,b, Wavefunction hybridization for 6SL and 14SL. c, Calculated θ vs. AFM order Lz for different thicknesses. d, δθ/δLz as a function of thickness.

a, The Kerr effect scheme: a dark matter axion resonantly excite an axion polariton inside the DAQ material under an external B∥ field (B∥ = 5 T). The axion polariton is essentially a coherent oscillation of θ(ω), where \(\omega =\sqrt{{m}_{{\rm{DAQ}}}^{2}+{b}^{2}}\). By applying an out-of-plane electric field Ez, such a coherent oscillation of θ(ω) will lead to an oscillating magnetization Mz(ω) = θ(ω)Ez. We propose to use MOKE with to measure this oscillating magnetization. b, Dark matter detection sensitivity (gaγ) as a function of the axion mass using the Kerr scheme (see details in Methods.6).

Metrics details

Despite the continuing progress in integrated optical frequency comb technology1, compact sources of short, bright pulses in the mid-infrared wavelength range from 3 to 12 μm so far remain beyond reach. The state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse emitters in the mid-infrared are complex, bulky and inefficient systems based on the downconversion of near-infrared or visible pulsed laser sources. Here we show a purely DC-driven semiconductor laser chip that generates 1-ps solitons at the centre wavelength of 8.3 μm at GHz repetition rates. The soliton generation scheme is akin to that of passive nonlinear Kerr resonators2. It relies on a fast bistability in active nonlinear laser resonators, unlike traditional passive mode-locking, which relies on saturable absorbers3, or active mode-locking by gain modulation in semiconductor lasers4. Monolithic integration of all components—drive laser, active ring resonator, coupler and pump filter—enables turnkey generation of bright solitons that remain robust for hours of continuous operation without active stabilization. Such devices can be readily produced at industrial laser foundries using standard fabrication protocols. Our work unifies the physics of active and passive microresonator frequency combs while simultaneously establishing a technology for nonlinear integrated photonics in the mid-infrared5.

Metrics details

Clonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses1,2,3,4. Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot1,2,3,5,6,7. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration8, reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans.

The trial between the US Federal Trade Commission and Meta began this week—and the future of the company is at stake. The FTC wants Meta to sell off two prized assets, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that it acquired them illegally to suppress competition. Today on the show, senior writer Paresh Dave joins host Zoë Schiffer to discuss what we know right now about the government's case—and what we learned when Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're talking about the FTC versus Meta trial. The US Federal Trade Commission is alleging that Meta illegally acquired Instagram and WhatsApp in an effort to suppress competition, and it wants to force Meta to spin off those assets into separate entities. Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg took the stand to defend his company. We're going to get into it today. I'm joined by Paresh Dave, senior writer at WIRED, to talk about the trial. Paresh, welcome to Uncanny Valley.

Paresh Dave: Hey. Thanks, Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: Paresh, before we get started, what's the big story here?

Paresh Dave: The FTC is trying to get Facebook to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram. That's huge.

Zoë Schiffer: That's a big deal. Let's start with what the FTC is actually arguing here, because this is something you and I have talked about in recent days. What's the theory of the case?

Paresh Dave: It's a couple of things. One, that Facebook has a long-standing monopoly on providing what's known in the FTC's parlance as personal social networking services in the US. We all know Facebook is a social media platform, but what kind of social media platform is it? In the FTC's view, it competes with Snapchat and this little-known thing called MiWi that are about connecting with friends and family. In the FTC's argument, TikTok, YouTube, all these other social media services we know of are not competitors to Facebook because those are about watching creators, not really about connecting with family and friends. One, the FTC has to establish that Facebook has this monopoly on personal social networking services, and the judge has to go along with that being the right market here. And then two, the argument is that Facebook made these acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp over a decade ago, and that the acquisitions harmed competition, being they were meant to take out competitors in this space of personal social networking services in the US. Consumers and advertisers are worse off as a result, that there's more ads that consumers are seeing. Worse advertising services. Consumers have less privacy because if there was more competition, Facebook wouldn't be able to get away with taking as much of our data. Issues like that are why the FTC say that this is a trial worth pursuing.

Zoë Schiffer: I laughed when you were talking about it only because the definition of that market seems a little bit absurd to me. The idea that TikTok isn't a competitor seems like something maybe only the FTC believes.

Paresh Dave: It does, but the FTC points to these emails from early Facebook days, right after Mark Zuckerberg created it, where he says Facebook is about connecting with family and friends. The argument being that Facebook kind of changed and evolved because it didn't have competition. And that's fuzzy, too, because we also know that Facebook copied a lot of what other companies did, but that's now for the judge to decide what the right market definition is. He was skeptical early on when this case was first filed by the FTC, and the FTC had to amend it. But if we land on this personal social networking services in the US, then Facebook commands 80 percent of that market, in the FTC's view.

Zoë Schiffer: Interesting. And what is Meta's argument? What's its pushback to the FTC's case?

Paresh Dave: Well, the first one is what we just talked about. The FTC is defining this market too narrowly, and Facebook faces tons of competition, including from TikTok in particular, and that when TikTok went down back in January as a result of the TikTok ban and the Biden-Trump transition, and there was that 12- to 14-hour period where TikTok was gone, a lot of TikTok users migrated to Facebook, is the argument. And so, Facebook is a substitute, and therefore they are competitors. Another argument is that consumers aren't actually worse off, that Instagram and WhatsApp would not have been what they are today without Meta's help, that they were these small startups with very few employees. Facebook showered them with millions of dollars a year, potentially to the tune of well over billions of dollars now, and that these services could not have thrived to the point that they are today with billions of users. And that the email in which Zuckerberg says that Facebook is about connecting with friends and family, that these acquisitions were about taking out competition, that those are all irrelevant because intent doesn't matter. What matters is whether the market has less competition, and Facebook's argument is the market doesn't have less competition, that there's very much all this competition.

Zoë Schiffer: And we are expecting Instagram founder, Kevin Systrom, to testify at some point, right?

Paresh Dave: Yeah. He's on the witness list, as are some of the venture capitalists involved that supported Instagram and WhatsApp early on.

Zoë Schiffer: We know that Mark Zuckerberg was trying to really do, it seemed, everything in his power to make sure this trial did not happen. He was reportedly trying to make a last-minute deal with President Trump, and he's been cozying up to Trump in recent months. What has that looked like?

Paresh Dave: You could imagine he of course wants to make a deal, because we're talking about two important assets for Facebook. Imagine losing that. He's trying to do whatever he can to, one, just save face and not have to have his dirty laundry aired at a big trial, but also save these two pieces of his empire. Zuckerberg, we've seen him relax Facebook and Meta policies that Republicans have criticized. He got personally involved in settling this lawsuit that Trump had filed against the company after it had banned his account back in 2021. And then Meta, which hadn't donated to Trump's first inauguration fund, did donate to Trump's second inauguration fund back in January. He's made all these overtures to try to warm this relationship, and they met a few times in recent months, but it doesn't seem like any deal was reached since the trial began.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. And even that lawsuit settlement … I've seen it described as a frivolous lawsuit. In some ways, you could categorize that as a campaign donation of sorts. That's really helpful context. We are going to take a short break, and we'll be right back. Yesterday was day one of the trial. The FTC gave its opening remarks and so did the company, and then the star witness, Mark Zuckerberg, took the stand. Let's start with what we learned from that testimony.

Paresh Dave: The government has begun its questioning of Mark Zuckerberg, and a lot of this case potentially hinges on what Zuckerberg wrote in emails and memos many, many years ago. And the government has been trying to get Zuckerberg to say that Facebook was meant to be about connecting friends and family, and that Facebook made these acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram to take out competitors, that they were freaking out because the world was moving to apps, and Facebook's apps kind of sucked. People didn't want to use them. They were buggy, and Facebook was losing out in areas like photo sharing that Instagram was just starting to really not dominate, but really taking off. And then WhatsApp was doing great in messaging, and Facebook's messaging plan was kind of all over the place. And so they needed these acquisitions. They took out competitors so they didn't have to build things themselves. And then there's this one email in which Zuckerberg says it's better to buy than compete. And so, the FTC is trying to really pin down Zuckerberg on some of these emails and what his thinking was. That was sort of day one.

Zoë Schiffer: That was Mark Zuckerberg's testimony. He's probably going to be called up again. Who else could be called up as a witness? What should we expect as the trial continues in the coming weeks?

Paresh Dave: The exact schedule isn't public, but we expect executives from competitors, such as Google, YouTube, antitrust experts, professors, to talk about that personal social networking services market. And even, I think, a big appearance could be former Facebook executive, Sheryl Sandberg.

Zoë Schiffer: I would be curious for her specifically to take the stand. I feel like this is kind of beside the point from the anticompetitive allegations, but Mark Zuckerberg has, well, in an effort, I think to ingratiate himself to Trump, rolled back a lot of the DEI efforts that Sheryl Sandberg kind of touted as core parts of her platform when she was at the company. And they've made a big show of still being friendly, but I would expect inside maybe Sheryl feels a bit different about Mark than she used to.

Paresh Dave: And I'm sure she's been involved with the months of prep that Meta has reportedly been engaged in for this trial. You could expect that they will all be on the same page here.

Zoë Schiffer: Right. Right. What happens if Meta is successful here, if Meta wins?

Paresh Dave: Well, it kind of is that nothing changes. If Meta wins, they get to keep WhatsApp and Instagram. They don't have to sell them off. Does it really send a message that the FTC should sort of not pursue actions like this where they try to unwind acquisitions from super long ago? Probably not, because the FTC doesn't usually pursue cases like this anyway, so it's sort of the status quo continues. And for startups, maybe not so great because Meta is going to be as dominant as ever.

Zoë Schiffer: What happens if the FTC wins?

Paresh Dave: That's the big one. There would be a second trial to determine remedies. What are the penalties that Meta should face? Should they be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp? Should they be blocked from doing similar acquisitions in the future? Should they be forced to share data with startups or other competitors to increase competition in the social media market? Those are all possible remedies, and the judge would basically decide what to order at a second trial.

Zoë Schiffer: It could be a while before we see anything happen with Instagram and WhatsApp even if Meta does lose.

Paresh Dave: Exactly. And add in appeals if Meta loses. Certainly, they would appeal. If the FTC loses, unclear if they would appeal, but could be years more.

Zoë Schiffer: What stands out to you in all of this? You've reported on Big Tech for a long time. There've been various attempts to break up companies in the past. I'm curious. What's the big top-line information for you right now?

Paresh Dave: To me, it kind of underscores how important it is for the FTC and the DOJ, the Department of Justice, which are the two big antitrust regulators in the US at the federal level. It sort of underscores how important it is for them to review these deals before they are finalized and consummated. I know predicting the future isn't easy. It's a tough job for regulators to balance innovation and competition and what the future is going to look like, but there's plenty of antitrust experts who believe both are possible so that we're not in this position again where we're talking about deals from 13 years ago, 11 years ago. Imagine how hard it is for a company to plan into the future if the government all of a sudden can come in and say, ""You need to break up these acquisitions that you did so long ago."" And then on top of that, how fast the tech industry moves. If the FTC's view of the world is to believe so many startups over the last decade could have existed or thrive that never did, it is just unimaginable in some ways. We need to get better at reviewing these deals ahead of time.

Zoë Schiffer: I think that's really smart. And it's also true that Meta has done a lot to integrate the backends of these apps. It says it's to make it easier for people to talk between the different apps or view content between the different apps, but it also could have been a strategy to make unwinding these acquisitions incredibly difficult on a technical level.

Paresh Dave: Absolutely. The timing when some of those moves were first announced was viewed as kind of suspicious because it was right around when these investigations into Meta and these cases started getting filed against Big Tech companies.

Zoë Schiffer: We're going to take one more short break. And when we come back, we'll tell you what to check out on WIRED.com this week.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer, WIRED's director of business and industry. I'm joined today by WIRED senior writer Paresh Dave. Before we go, Paresh, can you tell our listeners about what they have to read on WIRED.com today other than the stories we mentioned in this episode already?

Paresh Dave: Yes. Smishing Triad, the scam group stealing the world's riches.

Zoë Schiffer: Is Smishing a phishing variant?

Paresh Dave: It's a combination of phishing with SMS. Smishing, yes.

Zoë Schiffer: Smishing. Got it, got it, got it.

Paresh Dave: I'm sure we've all gotten those text messages about, ""You got to pay this toll road fee,"" or some parcel can't be delivered properly. Very annoying. I still get them all the time. I don't know why our phones can't stop this, but this story by our colleague, Matt Burgess, talks about how a lot of these messages, which are called sort of smishing messages, originate from this group of cyber criminals that is actually constantly improving their scamming software. The cybersecurity does not have the upper hand here. And my takeaway was we are going to get more and more of these messages before it gets better. And this article is part of a WIRED series, Guide to the Most Dangerous Hackers You've Never Heard Of. And this is dangerous, right? There are people who type in their credit card numbers in reply to these text messages and get all their money stolen. It's not great.

Zoë Schiffer: I feel like after I started at WIRED, I started getting messages purporting to be from company executives asking me to input personal information, which was well timed because I had just started a new job. I was like, “I don't know if they text me.” But no.

Paresh Dave: Maybe it was our cybersecurity team testing us. I don't know. I had that too.

Zoë Schiffer: They do that from time to time.

Paresh Dave: And what about you, Zoë? What are you recommending this week?

Zoë Schiffer: Well, in addition to your wonderful prewrite about the trial, which everyone should read and gives people kind of a good overview of what we should expect, we also published a piece just this morning by Caroline Haskins, another writer on the business desk at WIRED, about a New Mexico man who faces federal charges for allegedly setting fire to a Tesla showroom. This is part of the Tesla protest indictments that are happening. Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Trump and Elon Musk have all called for the people who are engaged in violent acts against Tesla property to be charged with really, really serious crimes. And this is the second time that we know of that the FBI terrorism investigators have gotten involved in an investigation tied to the kind of public backlash against Elon Musk and Tesla in particular. Bondi said that the man in question would be going to prison for 20 years or more, even though he hasn't yet been convicted. We have a lot of detail on the allegations in the case, things that we found in the arrest warrant, and it's a really good kind of overview of what's happening on that. Paresh, thank you so much for joining me today.

Paresh Dave: Thanks for having me.

Zoë Schiffer: That's our show for today. We'll link to all the stories we spoke about in the show notes. Make sure to check out Thursday's episode of Uncanny Valley, which is all about surveillance technology, protests, and how to safely navigate physical and online spaces during this moment.

Over the past decade, platforms like Airbnb and Turo have made it simple for people to earn extra cash by renting out their spare bedrooms or cars—but what about a pair of jeans from Zara or a lawn mower that's been catching dust?

It turns out, there's a market for that stuff too.

Recently, a number of online services have begun to normalize peer-to-peer rentals of lower-ticket items, proving to young people that a limited run with their T-shirts, Bluetooth speakers, or chain saws—not just the nonexistent fourth bedrooms in their nonexistent three-story houses—might be of value to internet strangers, too. These apps target Gen Z and millennials, appealing to people cutting down on overconsumption, accustomed to on-demand delivery services, or just looking for a new revenue stream—power users can make up to $36,000 a year.

Pickle, a peer-to-peer clothing rental app, currently lists 200,000 items, including everything from a $100 Goldbergh Pascale headband that can be rented for $30 to a Cult Gaia dress—$898 to buy, $100 to rent. Typical customers are in their mid- to late-twenties, and the company partners with students on college campuses, which CEO and cofounder Brian McMahon calls “the perfect ecosystem” for this model to thrive. One of the app's particularly millennial-and-Gen-Z-friendly features is its door-to-door delivery service (offered in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami) which is “like DoorDash for clothes,” McMahon says.

“That's why the company's called Pickle. If you're in a pickle, you could still get something at the last minute.” He says business goes especially well on weekends. “Plans come up, and people are like, ‘I need something.'”

According to Arun Sundararajan, professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and author of The Sharing Economy, rental platforms for clothes and household items emerged between 2011 and 2013, around the same time as those for home and car rentals took off. But “they didn't attract venture capital in the same way that the automobile and home rental platforms did, or the way that Uber and Lyft and the others did,” he says. That's partially just because there's a lot more money to be made from a car or a house.

Still, Pickle says it has tripled its number of monthly active users year over year and in March announced it had raised $12 million in Series A funding.

Sundararajan says the popularity of these apps represents a shift toward more responsible consumerism and a decline in the fixation on owning things. “I think Instagram had a lot to do with this. People who grew up seeing other people's vacations on Instagram are more wired to think of value as coming not from what you own but what you experience,” he says. “They're more likely to say, ‘Well, why should I buy this if I can just sort of get it, experience it, and then give it back?'”

Beccah Erickson, a 33-year-old product designer living in Brooklyn, has both listed and rented through Pickle. While she's had success as a customer—she rented a seashell-shaped statement purse for a wedding last summer—finding takers for her own items has been more of a struggle. She's had two Pickle users come over to her place to try on a dress, but both ultimately declined to rent it because of the fit. She feels the platform's demographic runs disproportionately thin.

“In New York a lot of the people listing stuff are of a certain age and size,” she says, adding that it could be “harder” for people who wear larger sizes to find items. Pickle tells WIRED it is working to address this issue by partnering with “creators, influencers, and tastemakers across a wider range of body types and aesthetics.”

Erickson's own wedding is coming up, and she's considering renting her bridal accessories, primarily in an effort to make environmentally conscious choices. “When I buy something new it's very considered and I've wanted it for a long time, so I use rentals for more of the fun items or one-off use cases,” she says. “I definitely like the kind of circular fashion aspect of it.” She says she hasn't encountered any negative stigma surrounding her choice to rent instead of buy, which she attributes to the popularity of non-peer-to-peer rental platforms like Rent the Runway.

The financial burden of attending weddings is also what drew fellow Brooklyn resident Jane Kim, 35, to Pickle. “I don't want to have to buy another sand-colored dress,” says Kim, who has been a bridesmaid at multiple friends' weddings. “I've already spent $600 on beige-sand dresses.” She rents out her own clothes as well and makes around $200 a month on the platform.

While Pickle's selection heavily features high fashion, the platform welcomes any in-demand item, regardless of its price point or brand, including low-cost pieces from brands like Urban Outfitters and Edikted. The highest earning “lenders”—users who list their items for rent—earned more than $3,000 monthly in 2024. Pickle takes a 20 percent cut of each transaction.

Pickle plans to expand its scope of inventory, first to men's clothing and eventually beyond the clothing and accessory space.

Yoodlize, a Utah-based app that operates near three college campuses, allows users to rent party supplies (bounce houses, tables and chairs), tools (tile cutters, really tall ladders), electronics (cameras, PA systems, karaoke machines), and outdoor sporting equipment like paddleboards.

“We do get a pretty wide age distribution, but we feel like we're building this for the Gen X, Gen Z, millennials,” says Jason Fairbourne, Yoodlize's CEO and founder. “Our biggest demographic are still in college or in high school at this moment. So we're trying to build for the future.”

The average rental transaction on Yoodlize is $50, and its top users make $10,000 to $15,000 a year. The delivery mechanism is determined by the buyer and seller on a case-by-case basis. Yoodlize tacks a 10 percent fee on both the buyer and seller side of the transaction.

By reducing the demand for products that spend most of their lives taking up space, the peer-to-peer rental model appeals to both environmental and economic concerns. “Why does every house have a lawnmower? Why does everybody own this $600 machine that you rarely use?” Fairbourne says.

Similar platforms include BabyQuip, catered to baby items, KitSplit, which specializes in electronics, and Fat Llama, where you can rent anything from construction machinery to your wedding's selfie station backdrop.

Both Yoodlize and Pickle hope to build a robust nationwide user base and want to shift cultural norms around consumption, so even those without tight budgets feel inclined to rent rather than buy.

“Sometimes it is kind of a pain,” Kim says. Once, a courier rang her door bell at 1 am to return an item she rented out through Pickle when the app estimated that it would be returned by 8 pm. “There have been times where I'm like, this isn't worth 40 bucks that I'm making.” But some environmentally conscious users might tolerate inconvenience if it means combatting overconsumption: “It's nice that it makes me feel less guilty about the things I already own,” says Kim.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump's Tariffs Could Hit You in an Unexpected Place: Your Vinyl Collection","https://www.wired.com/story/trumps-tariffs-could-hit-you-in-an-unexpected-place-your-vinyl-collection/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 19:00:23 GMT","

As the chaotic rollout of President Donald Trump's tariffs last week rattled the nerves of companies across nearly every industry in America and around the globe, one small business owner in the San Francisco Bay Area was trying to figure out if he could finagle his way through a loophole.

Eric Mueller of the punk rock record label Pirates Press was wondering whether he could classify his company's records—which include colored vinyl releases by bands like Rancid, the Slackers, and Cock Sparrer—as “informational material.” Doing so would allow the records to be imported from overseas pressing plants without incurring a tariff under a little-known law.

More than anything Mueller is hoping to find peace of mind. “The volatility is insane,” he says. “We had a couple dozen shipments leave in the past few days, and we're trying to figure out what we're supposed to bill people!”

The Trump administration's erratic on-again, off-again approach to tariffs is seeding general confusion throughout the record industry. Manufacturers and brokers, mom-and-pop and otherwise, are aligned in recognizing that any additional costs incurred by tariffs will ultimately be passed onto consumers. Even a 10 percent increase incurred by Trump's (as of this moment) revised, across-the-board tariffs could make a significant dent in an industry already negatively impacted by inflation and rising costs. Recent industry estimates suggest that the proposed tariffs could jack up costs by 24 percent and could lead to more production being offshored. Mueller estimates that a new vinyl record may retail for $30 to $40, up from $15 to $25 just a few years ago.

“Look at the math: Peoples' incomes haven't gone up by that much,” he says. “The industry is definitely receding. Factories are struggling. If the cost of records goes up, it's not a good thing. It's not going to help anybody.”

But the industry's potential, label-saving exception comes from the Berman Amendment, which provides exemptions to “informational materials” like books, films, tapes, CDs, and other media containing material protected under the First Amendment, regardless of their country of origin. Passed by Congress in 1988 and authored by Democratic Representative Howard Berman, the amendment was one of the earliest obstructions in lawmakers' attempts to ban TikTok, with a Washington Post headline calling it “an obscure hurdle.”

“What this exemption does,” Mueller explains, “is make sure there's still a free flow of information.”

A representative of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade organization representing the US music industry, tentatively confirms that the “current understanding” is that imports of records are excluded from Trump's tariffs.

For the record industry, that's good news. Despite the uptick in homegrown manufacturing over the past decade, which has followed from the resurgent popularity of vinyl records themselves, a great many of the albums stocking shelves of record stores are manufactured abroad. Czech-based conglomerate GZ Media is the largest record presser in the world, churning out about 70 million records a year. Under the current Berman Amendment carve-outs, all of those records could be imported Stateside without being impacted by massive tariffs. But that doesn't mean the US vinyl industry is out of the woods. (A spokesperson for GZ declined to speak to WIRED, saying that the company has “decided not to comment on topics related to politics or tariffs.”)

“There's no tariff paid on importing a completed record, but there are tariffs paid bringing in the materials,” explains Michael Greig Thomas, director of the Athens, Georgia, vinyl manufacturer Echo Base. Actual, US-based vinyl companies stand to face hefty increases, importing raw materials essential to the manufacturing process: paper products from Canada, aluminum discs used in stamping the records (called lacquers) from Japan, and so on. Most essential of all, of course, is the actual vinyl.

The bulk of record manufacturers, in the US and elsewhere, source polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from Thailand. Petrochemical companies like NeoTech Composite and the Plastic and Chemicals Public Company (a subsidiary of the Siam Cement Group Corporation) supply the overwhelming majority. The Trump administration had originally threatened Thailand with a substantial 36 percent tariff, which would naturally raise costs for US manufacturers.

Certain specialized industrial equipment used in the processes (boilers that heat the PVC pellets, chillers to control temperature) also tend to be manufactured and serviced from abroad. Steven Walker, owner of mom-and-pop manufacturer 33 Grooves Records, is worried that repairs could soon become exceedingly costly. “Everything is Asian or European,” he says. “My machines were made in Hong Kong. And if I have to get any parts sourced from China, it's pretty scary.” (As of this writing, Chinese imports have been hit with a whopping 125 percent import tariff.)

There's an absurd irony here, which is perhaps not all that shocking given the overwhelming erraticism of Trump's economic schemes. Because the import and export of vinyl records is exempted from tariffs, US brokers can still get their product pressed abroad in Central Europe and shipped back Stateside, with little in the way of additional cost beyond the usual duties. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar US-based manufacturers face potential increases in their bottom line, as they have little option but to import their raw materials from across the globe. “It's a consistent problem that has stifled the vinyl record-pressing industry in the US,” says Echo Base's Thomas. “The bigger companies are kind of like an oligarchy, and most of those companies are external to the US.”

Another major problem is advocacy. So far, the Trump administration's approach to tariffs has benefited bigger businesses. The White House seemingly plucks a number out of the air, and then representatives from across different industries line up to wheedle the number down. Vinyl record manufacturing is a billion-dollar business, supporting over 1,500 jobs nationwide. But it is still, as Thomas put it, something of a “cottage industry.” It certainly doesn't necessarily have the kind of presidential pull enjoyed by tech companies and banks. “There are some industries that are going to be better represented by lobbies,” Thomas says. “There's a really big concern that our voices are not going to be heard. Not everyone knows the most expedient way to speak to their local representative and get things moving up the chain.”

The looming threat of a broader economic recession also figures into industry-wide anxieties threatening not just record manufacturers and retailers but trickling down to labels and artists.

“It's only going to hurt the industry in the grand scheme of things,” Mueller says. “The alternative to buying a record is not paying to support artists and just continuing to stream records, where the artists earn a fraction of the cost.”

Beyond increasing prices, both for manufacturers and the end-consumer crate digging at their local record shop, the feeling of economic uneasiness can breed hostility.

Dave Eck, who runs Waxy Poodle Record in Wisconsin, says Trump's spiked trade rhetoric has impacted his relationships as much as the actual policies. Eck conducts a lot of business in Canada, which the president has decried as “nasty” and repeatedly threatened to annex as America's 51st state. It's a tense situation, which has fostered anti-American sentiment north of the border. Where a “Made in USA” label on a record was once a mark of quality, now it suggests something different. “All my vendors up there don't like me anymore, because I'm American,” Eck says. “I'm having a harder time getting my product turned around, because the whole feeling in Canada right now is not to support us.”

Of course there are, at some stops in the supply chain, a few Trump loyalists. Eck recalls a cardboard box salesman who recently encouraged him to bone up on some of Donald Trump's negotiating tactics. He laughs: “He said I'll understand better if I read The Art of the Deal!”

OpenAI announced on Wednesday the launch of o3 and o4-mini, new AI reasoning models designed to pause and work through questions before responding.

The company calls o3 its most advanced reasoning model ever, outperforming the company's previous models on tests measuring math, coding, reasoning, science, and visual understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, o4-mini offers what OpenAI says is a competitive trade-off between price, speed, and performance — three factors developers often consider when choosing an AI model to power their applications.

Unlike previous reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini can generate responses using tools in ChatGPT such as web browsing, Python code execution, image processing, and image generation. Starting today, the models, plus a variant of o4-mini called “o4-mini-high” that spends more time crafting answers to improve its reliability, are available for subscribers to OpenAI's Pro, Plus, and Team plans.

The new models are part of OpenAI's effort to beat out Google, Meta, xAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek in the cutthroat global AI race. While OpenAI was first to release an AI reasoning model, o1, competitors quickly followed with versions of their own that match or exceed the performance of OpenAI's lineup. In fact, reasoning models have begun to dominate the field as AI labs look to eke more performance out of their systems. 

O3 nearly wasn't released in ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman signaled in February that the company intended to devote more resources to a sophisticated alternative that incorporated o3's technology. But competitive pressure seemingly spurred OpenAI to reverse course in the end.

OpenAI says that o3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench verified (without custom scaffolding), a test measuring coding abilities, scoring 69.1%. The o4-mini model achieves similar performance, scoring 68.1%. OpenAI's next best model, o3-mini, scored 49.3% on the test, while Claude 3.7 Sonnet scored 62.3%.

OpenAI claims that o3 and o4-mini are its first models that can “think with images.” In practice, users can upload images to ChatGPT, such as whiteboard sketches or diagrams from PDFs, and the models will analyze the images during their “chain-of-thought” phase before answering. Thanks to this newfound ability, o3 and o4-mini can understand blurry and low-quality images and can perform tasks such as zooming or rotating images as they reason.

Beyond image-processing capabilities, o3 and o4-mini can run and execute Python code directly in your browser via ChatGPT's Canvas feature, and search the web when asked about current events.

In addition to ChatGPT, all three models — o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high — will be available via OpenAI's developer-facing endpoints, the Chat Completions API and Responses API, allowing engineers to build applications with the company's models at usage-based rates. 

OpenAI is charging developers a relatively low price for o3, given its improved performance, at $10 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the Lord of the Rings series) and $40 per million output tokens. For o4-mini, OpenAI is charging the same as o3-mini, $1.10 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output tokens.

In the coming weeks, OpenAI says it plans to release o3-pro, a version of o3 that uses more computing resources to produce its answers, exclusively for ChatGPT Pro subscribers.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has indicated o3 and o4-mini may be its last stand-alone AI reasoning models in ChatGPT before GPT-5, a model that the company has said will unify traditional models like GPT-4.1 with its reasoning models.

AMD says that the U.S. government's license control requirement for exporting AI chips to China and certain other countries may have a material impact on its earnings.

If AMD doesn't successfully obtain a license, the company could be on the hook for roughly $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves charges, it said in a filing with the SEC on Wednesday. According to AMD, the new export rules apply to the company's MI308 GPUs.

“On April 15, 2025, [AMD] completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the [U.S.] government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries,” AMD wrote in the filing. “The [export control] applies to [AMD's] MI308 products. The company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted.”

AMD's shares were down around 6% in early morning trading on Wednesday.

The U.S.'s newly imposed export controls impact a number of chipmakers, including AMD's chief rival Nvidia. In a filing on Tuesday, Nvidia said it anticipates charges of $5.5 billion related to the export controls in the first quarter ending April 27.

Multiple government officials have been calling for stronger export controls on U.S.-built GPUs. Allowing China-based companies to obtain these chips, in particular AI companies, would threaten the U.S.'s dominance in AI as well as its national security, they argue.

In a statement provided to Reuters yesterday, a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said that the license requirement is in service of “the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security.”

Conservative critics have long accused the State Department's Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub of helping to censor the American right.



The only office within the US State Department that monitors foreign disinformation is to be eliminated, according to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, confirming reporting by MIT Technology Review.

The Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub is a small office in the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy that tracks and counters foreign disinformation campaigns. 

In shutting R/FIMI, the department's controversial acting undersecretary, Darren Beattie, is delivering a major win to conservative critics who have alleged that it censors conservative voices. Created at the end of 2024, it was reorganized from the Global Engagement Center (GEC), a larger office with a similar mission that had long been criticized by conservatives who claimed that, despite its international mission, it was censoring American conservatives. In 2023, Elon Musk called the center the “worst offender in US government censorship [and] media manipulation” and a “threat to our democracy.” 

The culling of the office leaves the State Department without a way to actively counter the increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns from foreign governments like those of Russia, Iran, and China. 

Shortly after publication, employees at R/FIMI received an email, inviting them to an 11:15AM meeting with Beattie, where employees were told that the office and their jobs have been eliminated.

Then, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed our reporting in a blog post in The Federalist, which had sued GEC last year alleging that it had infringed on its freedom of speech. “It is my pleasure to announce the State Department is taking a crucial step toward keeping the president's promise to liberate American speech by abolishing forever the body formerly known as the Global Engagement Center (GEC),” he wrote. And he told Benz, “We ended government-sponsored censorship in the United States through the State Department.”  

For years, conservative voices both in and out of government have accused Big Tech of censoring conservative views—and they often charged GEC with enabling such censorship. 

GEC had its roots as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC), created by an Obama-era executive order, but shifted its mission to fight propaganda and disinformation from foreign governments and terrorist organizations in 2016, becoming the Global Engagement Center. It was always explicitly focused on the international information space, but some of the organizations that it funded also did work in the United States. It shut down last December after a measure to reauthorize its $61 million budget was blocked by Republicans in Congress, who accused it of helping Big Tech censor American conservative voices. 

R/FIMI had a similar goal to fight foreign disinformation, but it was smaller: the newly created office had a $51.9 million budget, and a small staff that, by mid-April, was down to just 40 employees, from 125 at GEC. In a Wednesday morning meeting, those employees were told that they would  be put on administrative leave and terminated within 30 days. 

With the change in administrations, R/FIMI had never really gotten off the ground. Beattie, a controversial pick for undersecretary—he was fired as a speechwriter during the first Trump administration for attending a white nationalism conference, has suggested that the FBI organized the January 6 attack on Congress, and has said that it's not worth defending Taiwan from China—had instructed the few remaining staff to be “pencils down,” one State Department official told me, meaning to pause in their work. 

The administration's executive order on “countering censorship and restoring freedom of speech” reads like a summary of conservative accusations against GEC:

“Under the guise of combatting “misinformation,” “disinformation,” and “malinformation,” the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government's preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.  Government censorship of speech is intolerable in a free society.”



In 2023, The Daily Wire, founded by conservative media personality Ben Shapiro, joined The Federalist in suing GEC for allegedly infringing on the company's first amendment rights by funding two non-profit organizations, the London-based Global Disinformation Index and New York-based NewsGuard, that had labeled The Daily Wire as “unreliable,” “risky,” and/or (per GDI), susceptible to foreign disinformation. Those projects were not funded by GEC. The lawsuit alleged that this amounted to censorship by “starving them of advertising revenue and reducing the circulation of their reporting and speech,” the lawsuit continued. 

Elon Musk may have run tech companies, but building technology for government is an entirely different beast.

In 2022, the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana named GEC among the federal agencies that, they alleged, were pressuring social networks to censor conservative views. Though the case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which found no First Amendment violations, a lower court had already removed GEC's name from the list of defendants, ruling there was “no evidence” that GEC's communications with the social media platforms had gone beyond “educating the platforms on ‘tools and techniques used by foreign actors.'”

The GEC—and now R/FIMI—was targeted as part of a wider campaign to shut down groups accused of being “weaponized” against conservatives. 

Conservative critics railing against what they have alternatively called a disinformation- or censorship- industrial complex have also taken aim at the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Stanford Internet Observatory, a prominent research group that conducted widely cited research on the flows of disinformation during elections. 

CISA's former director, Chris Krebs, was personally targeted in an April 9 White House memo, while in response to the criticism and millions of dollars in legal fees, Stanford University shuttered the Stanford Internet Observatory ahead of the 2024 presidential elections.  

But this targeting comes at a time when foreign disinformation campaigns—especially by Russia, China, and Iran—have become increasingly sophisticated. 

According to one estimate, Russia spends $1.5 billion per year on foreign influence campaigns. In 2022, the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, that country's primary foreign propaganda arm, had a $1.26 billion budget. And a 2015 estimate suggests that China spent up to $10 billion per year on media targeting non-Chinese foreigners—a figure that has almost certainly grown.

In September 2024, the Justice Department indicted two employees of RT, a Russian state-owned propaganda agency, in a $10 million scheme to create propaganda aimed at influencing US audiences through a media company that has since been identified as the conservative Tenet Media. 

The GEC was one effort to counter such campaigns. Some of its recent projects have included developing AI models to detect memes and deepfakes and exposing Russian propaganda efforts to influence Latin American public opinion against the war in Ukraine. 

By law, the Office of Public Diplomacy has to provide Congress with 15-day advance notice of any intent to reassign any funding allocated by Congress over $1 million. Congress then has time to respond, ask questions, and challenge the decisions—though to judge from its record with other unilateral executive-branch decisions to gut government agencies, it is unlikely to do so. 

We have reached out to the State Department for comment. 

This story was updated at 11:55 to note that R/FIMI employees have confirmed that the office closed. This story was updated at 12:37 to include confirmation about R/FIMI's shutdown from Marco Rubio.  

Federal scientists warn that Americans could feel the effects of the new administration's devastating cuts for decades to come.

YouTuber SSD tests reveals problems all round on two-year-old TLC drives.

You may not know it, but SSDs will lose data after a period of time if they are simply left unplugged, which can be a serious threat to your data if you store backups or precious files on unplugged SSDs. A year-two update on the how long can SSDs store data unpowered video series is another reminder about the importance of regularly refreshing your backups with a bit of juice. The tests consist of storing data on an SSD and then leaving it unplugged for years to see the impact on the stored data.

As a reminder, an SSD's endurance rating is calculated based on how long it can store data if left unplugged after a certain amount of data has been written, hence the importance of this testing.

TechTuber HTWingNut is back with a report on his modest experiment involving a quartet of SATA SSDs. The key finding was that the two-year-old, well-worn drive exhibited noticeable performance degradation and was affected by a handful of corrupt files. These are signs that this particular SSD was on its way to silicon heaven. HTWingNut's video is an update on an episode from a year earlier, and further updates are promised.

The four tested 'Leven JS-600' branded SSDs are basically bog-standard no-name units. HTWingNut says they are all TLC SSDs of 128GB capacity and rated to withstand 60 TB of written data. Every drive has 100GB of files containing random data, with hash values for all the content provided for later verification.

The two 'Fresh' samples have barely been used; perhaps only the 100GB data set was put on there and verified, and that's it. Meanwhile, the 'Worn' drives have been subjected to 280 terabytes of written data churn, much more than their rated 60 Terabytes Written (TBW) endurance rating..

If you watch the previous year-one video, you will have seen there were no issues with either 'Worn' or 'Fresh' drives. However, time has now taken its toll. Let's take a look at the year-two samples in turn.

The data on this SSD, which hadn't been used or powered up for two years, was 100% good on initial inspection. All the data hashes verified, but it was noted that the verification time took a smidgen longer than two years previously. HD Sentinel tests also showed good, consistent performance for a SATA SSD.

Digging deeper, all isn't well, though. Firing up Crystal Disk Info, HTWingNut noted that this SSD had a Hardware ECC Recovered value of over 400. In other words, the disk's error correction had to step in to fix hundreds of data-based parity bits.

Seeing these errors means ""the SSD is on its way out,"" according to HTWingNut. Indeed, if there is anything iffy about your data storage integrity, it is at least a warning. However, the errors could also have something to do with the drive being left unpowered for two years.



As the worn SSD's data was being verified, there were already signs of performance degradation. The hashing audit eventually revealed that four files were corrupt (hash not matching). Looking at the elapsed time, it was observed that this operation astonishingly took over 4x longer, up from 10 minutes and 3 seconds to 42 minutes and 43 seconds.

Further investigations in HD Sentinel showed that three out of 10,000 sectors were bad and performance was 'spiky.' Returning to Crystal Disk Info, things look even worse. HTWingNut notes that the uncorrectable sectors count went from 0 to 12 on this drive, and the hardware ECC recovered value went from 11,745 before to 201,273 after tests on the day.

In summary, the year-one fresh and well-worn drives had no issues. However, the year-two heavily worn SSD had file corruption and performance was poor. The so-called fresh drive was still good, but ECC figures still raised concern. Come back in late 2025 for the next update from HTWingNut.

We also want to say this is a very small test sample, highlighted out of our interest in the topic rather than for its hard empirical data. I have also experienced SSD data loss after leaving a Mini PC unpowered for just six months or so at my pied-à-terre in Taiwan. On return, Windows refused to boot or be repaired, but a reformat and reinstall seemed to return everything to normal.

AMD's MI308 chips are now subject to export licenses.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The U.S. recently issued fresh restrictions on AI chip exports to China and other countries, further reducing the maximum allowable performance that manufacturers like Nvidia and AMD can deliver to their customers in the affected regions. Because of this, AMD reported in an SEC filing that it might suffer “charges of up to approximately $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.”The U.S. government has been taking steps to limit Beijing's access to America's most advanced chips to ensure the U.S. will retain its edge in artificial intelligence and prevent its East Asian rival from outpacing it. Because of this, both AMD and Nvidia have created AI GPUs specifically designed to meet the federal government's restrictions. However, the White House updated its limitations recently, making the Nvidia H20 and AMD MI308 ineligible for export without a license.“On April 15, 2025, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the “Company”) completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the United States government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries…,” the company said in its SEC filing. “The Export Control applies to the Company's MI308 products. The Company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted.”AMD isn't the only one taking a substantial cut thanks to expanded export controls. Nvidia has also been hit massively, with the company expecting to make a $5.5 billion write-off with its H20 GPUs. The U.S. Department of Commerce said (via Reuters) that it's enacting these requirements to act on “the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security.”This new restriction will make it harder for Chinese companies to acquire the chips they need to train their AI models. Nevertheless, it's been proven that these bans and sanctions have largely been ineffective. We've already seen some examples of Chinese businessmen importing sanctioned Nvidia H200 GPUs, and it's widely reported that you can get these advanced chips into China by using an intermediary located in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Singapore and Malaysia are making moves to reduce the leakage of AI chips into China, but we won't know how effective their moves will be in interdicting the massive black market demand.

HighPoint Technologies has announced a new lineup of PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 x16 adapters featuring MCIO (Mini Cool Edge IO) and SlimSAS (Serial Attached SCSI) connectors, aimed at expanding the I/O capabilities of modern workstations and servers. These adapters improve GPU scalability and unlock high-bandwidth NVMe storage configurations on platforms where PCIe lanes are limited or require efficient redistribution.

The newly launched adapter series includes the PCIe Gen 5 x16 Rocket 1628A and PCIe Gen 4 x16 Rocket 1528D, each providing up to four MCIO x4 or SlimSAS x4 channels. This makes it possible to split a single PCIe x16 slot into multiple high-speed connections, which is ideal for connecting multiple NVMe SSDs, GPUs, or other devices without sacrificing performance.

HighPoint's PCIe Gen 5 adapters, in particular, seem to be a compelling option for AI workloads, GPU-heavy setups, and enterprise-grade storage solutions. MCIO connectors — a fairly new standard designed for high-density PCIe connectivity — position these adapters for future-proofed deployment in data centers and high-performance desktop environments.



Each adapter is said to be designed with minimal signal loss in mind, using advanced PCB layouts and high-quality components to maintain signal integrity at Gen 5 speeds. The Gen 4 SlimSAS variants target platforms that haven't yet moved to Gen 5 but still need high-throughput options for storage expansion.

HighPoint is positioning these cards as cost-effective and flexible, particularly for system builders and prosumers looking to maximize the utility of existing PCIe slots. While primarily aimed at OEMs and enterprise users, enthusiasts working with compact systems or unconventional GPU/storage layouts may also benefit from these adapters' modularity.

Last year, HighPoint made headlines by launching its SSD7540 RAID card, a PCIe Gen 4 x16 adapter capable of delivering transfer speeds up to 56 GB/s. That card featured eight M.2 NVMe slots and targeted high-performance storage arrays for data-intensive workloads.. The new MCIO and SlimSAS adapters build on this legacy by offering even more flexible connectivity options for modern systems, especially as Gen 5 adoption accelerates.

Though pricing hasn't been announced, the new MCIO and SlimSAS x16 adapters will be available through HighPoint's distribution channels soon. As more Gen 5-capable motherboards and processors enter the market, these innovative adapter solutions will become increasingly relevant for balancing bandwidth-hungry components in dense systems.

Anal cancer is an uncommon condition, accounting for only 1%-2% of all gastrointestinal cancers. However, its occurrence has been increasing by 2%-3% annually over the past decade. The most prevalent type is anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which makes up more than 90 percent of anal cancer cases. Standard treatment options for SCC of the anal canal include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and, in some cases, surgery. Outcomes related to treatment, survival rates, and quality of life depend on the disease stage and tumor location.

Anal cancer is a rare disease that affects women more frequently than men, primarily due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Risk factors for anal cancer include female sex, smoking, anoreceptive sex, Black race, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, organ transplantation, active HPV infection, immunosuppression (with a correlation with low T-cell counts) and men having sex with men. SCC is the most common histological type, while other very rare neoplasms of the anal canal include adenocarcinomas, melanomas, sarcomas, and neuroendocrine tumors.

Learn more about the epidemiology of anal cancer.

While some patients with anal cancer do report a sensation of a rectal mass, this occurs in only about 30% of cases. The most common presenting symptoms are anal or pelvic pain and anal bleeding, which occur in approximately half of patients. Other symptoms include local wetness, irritation, tissue prolapse, incontinence, and obstipation. Some patients may even be asymptomatic, particularly those with anal intraepithelial neoplasia. Some patients may also present with anal warts due to an HPV genotype that typically causes anogenital warts.

Learn more about anal cancer clinical presentation.

HPV vaccination is most effective when administered before exposure to the virus, as it helps prevent anal cancer. Since the vaccine does not treat existing HPV infections or precancerous lesions, early vaccination is essential. Anal cancer is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV and is more common in certain high-risk groups. Although the vaccine may still offer some benefits after sexual activity begins, its effectiveness decreases if the individual has already been exposed to HPV, limiting its protective impact.

Learn more about HPV vaccination and cancer protection.

The recommended primary screening method for detecting anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in individuals with HIV is anal cytology. Similar to a Pap smear for cervical cancer screening, anal cytology effectively identifies these precursor lesions to anal cancer. It serves as a non-invasive initial test that can help determine the need for further evaluation, such as high-resolution anoscopy. Digital rectal examination can detect palpable masses or early invasive cancers but lacks the sensitivity to identify anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. While MRI is useful for assessing advanced malignancies, it is not appropriate for routine screening. Colonoscopy, on the other hand, is primarily used for detecting colorectal lesions rather than anal precancers.

Learn more about anal cancer workup.

The 5-year survival rate for anal SCC ranges from 60%-80%, depending on factors such as tumor stage and treatment response. The most important prognostic factor is the tumor stage according to the TNM classification (extent of the tumor [T], extent of spread to the lymph nodes [N], and presence of metastasis [M]). The standard treatment for anal SCC is concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which has significantly improved survival outcomes. The TN stage and tumor location are the deciding factors for the dose of radiation. Responsiveness to chemoradiotherapy is typically measured by repeated imaging.

In this interview, CellVoyant founder and CEO Rafael Carazo Salas explores how AI, live-cell imaging, and stem cell technologies are converging to transform cell therapy development. He shares insights on the challenges of scaling living therapies, the role of predictive AI in clinical trials, and how spinning a biotech company out of academia can drive meaningful impact in the real world.

The inspiration for CellVoyant really stemmed from a moment of clarity – what I like to call our eureka moment. As a Professor at the University of Bristol, my research focused on combining cutting-edge imaging technologies with computational data analysis to understand and design cells with enhanced functions.

Over time, it became increasingly clear that if we could train AI models to analyze and interpret cellular behavior, we could radically transform how we develop cell-based therapies.

In essence, CellVoyant is the bridge between academic insight and practical impact. Our vision is to make it possible to monitor and to predict cell behaviour – to see the future of cells - at scale and use that foresight to transform how we develop therapies.

It starts with live-cell imaging. We capture continuous, high-resolution data on how stem cells grow, move, and undergo changes like cell differentiation in real-time. This gives us a dynamic view of cellular behavior that static snapshots can't provide.

Then, we apply AI, leveraging powerful proprietary AI models. Our models analyze these rich datasets to identify subtle patterns that might be invisible to the human eye. Crucially, we use AI to predict how a cell will behave in the future so that we can select and design better cells from the very beginning.

These therapies hold immense promise, but moving from lab-scale development to large-scale manufacturing is incredibly complex. Cells are living, dynamic entities, and even the smallest environmental changes - temperature, pH, nutrient availability – can impact their behavior and viability. That makes consistent, high-quality production extremely difficult.

Batch failures are unfortunately common, and when you're working with expensive cell culture media and other materials, the costs add up quickly. Each failed batch not only represents a direct financial loss but also sets back timelines and puts pressure on already limited development and manufacturing capacity.

The key to making cell therapies truly scalable and accessible lies in using predictive, data-driven approaches. If we can use AI to understand better and control cell behavior early on, we can improve consistency, reduce waste, and build smarter, more resilient manufacturing systems.

It's about shifting the paradigm from reactive to proactive, end-to-end optimized processes because only then can we truly bring these therapies to more patients faster and at a significantly lower cost.

Traditionally, much of cell therapy development has relied on static snapshots of cells or time-consuming, trial-and-error approaches. But cells are dynamic, different from one another, and ever-changing.

By combining live-cell imaging with CellVoyant's proprietary data and AI, we can develop models that continuously monitor, interpret and understand how cells' behavior evolves in real-time. These models can predict cells' future, what type they're likely to become, how functional they will be, and whether they could be suitable for therapy.

Cells can carry out complex, sophisticated functions that no conventional drug could ever deliver. By making cell therapies predictively, scalable, and accessible, CellVoyant's vision is to enable the cell therapy industry to deliver its full-fledged promise and, quite simply, revolutionize biotech and medicine as we know them.

AI has the power to transform how we run clinical trials and support scientists every step of the way. Much like how Google Maps provides navigation and enables the correct travel route in real-time, AI, alongside real-time imaging, provides actionable insights that can help improve and accelerate the development of medicines throughout the clinical trial pipeline.

By step-changing our capacity to assess and prognosticate cell quality, we can understand how best to manipulate stem cells efficiently and cost-effectively while minimizing the risk of failed clinical trials and significantly reducing scientists' manual workflow.

When it comes to safety assessments, AI will be able to combine drug and patient data, to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from a cell therapy treatment in a clinical trial and help predict side effects.

Overall, we see AI as a tool to de-risk, de-cost, and potentially accelerate clinical trials, ensuring they can be run as efficiently and effectively as possible.

What excites me most is that cell therapies have the potential to support millions of people by developing treatments for diseases that are currently untreatable, such as dementia.

We are already witnessing clinical success with CAR-T therapies for blood cancer, such as in the UK, with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently approving lisocabtagene maraleucel for lymphoma patients.

We are also seeing groundbreaking developments for other conditions. For example, patients with wet age-related macular degeneration received a treatment derived from stell cells and reported regaining enough vision to be able to read.

What's important now is ensuring these therapies are affordable and accessible for all. They are often prohibitively expensive, putting them out of reach for the very people who need them most.

Some key barriers to overcome include meeting stringent regulations and the significant time required to develop, manufacture, test, and approve cell therapy candidates.  

As previously mentioned, AI could help completely redefine how we tackle these barriers by helping scientists work faster, at lower cost, and with unprecedented predictive power.

For instance, it will help streamline and iteratively improve R&D through optimized automation and development workflows.

When it comes to regulation, it will allow cell therapy developers to ensure compliance and traceability by tracking and organizing vast amounts of data. It will also reduce the time needed for regulatory submissions, testing, and approval, which can be incredibly time-consuming.

I spun CellVoyant out of the University of Bristol in 2021, and it was amazing that I could take inspiration from an idea that my research group had been working on and explore its big-picture commercial applications.

The experience of spinning out of a university is so valuable because it bridges the transition between researching and exploring a scientific idea and seeing how it can work in the real world. The University bet on the ideas I wanted to explore and gave me the freedom to explore and develop them fully.

Universities in the UK do a good job of supporting innovation. They have the connections and mechanisms in place to help a startup access investors, talent, and more. In particular, Bristol has a thriving biotech ecosystem and punches above its weight in scientific talent.

As a whole, UK universities ask for a significant stake from the outset in a spinout, which contrasts with the approach of the US. This can be a challenge and make spinouts seem much less appealing to investors. Though there are many things to improve on that front, and it's an intense ongoing conversation, things are gradually and increasingly changing for the better.

AI-first companies are revolutionizing the drug discovery landscape, and the approval of the first AI-driven drug design (AIDD) is something that many of us eagerly await to demonstrate how this new way of developing medicines can ultimately bring tangible results.

The trend I am most focused on is how the financial and investment landscapes evolve in response to the current geopolitical tectonic shifts we are witnessing in 2025. These changes will inevitably bring opportunities to redefine where talent is directed, where investments are made, and, ultimately, how best to steer the industry going forward.

Take the leap and do it! It is a big responsibility and requires a lot of energy, but it is thrilling to see your ideas come to life.

I'd urge you to learn from your peers and founders of similar companies, who, in my experience, have been generous in sharing their successes and failures.

While it may seem like the unknown, remember that you are well-placed to meet the challenge and can apply your wealth of experience as an academic, just in a different way.

Rafael is the founder and CEO of CellVoyant, an AI-first biotechnology company with a mission to accelerate cell therapy development with the power of AI.

He is also Professor and Chair of Biomedical Sciences at the School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine in the University of Bristol, formerly at the University of Cambridge.

It's an interesting time to be a U.S. Soccer fan.

While the men's national team is under immense pressure with the 2026 World Cup around the corner, the women's national team is in a period of transition and experimentation under Emma Hayes.

Let's check in on the biggest storylines in U.S. Soccer with FOX Sports' soccer reporters Doug McIntyre and Laken Litman:

1. The draw for the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup took place on Thursday and the United States men's national team was drawn into Group D with Haiti, Trinidad & Tobago and Saudi Arabia. Which team do you think will give the U.S. the most trouble and why? 

Doug: The quick answer is Saudi Arabia. A six-time World Cup participant, the Saudis held the U.S. to a scoreless tie in their final tune-up for Qatar 2022, then stunned Lionel Messi and Argentina in their opener at the main event – the only team to beat the eventual champs. At No. 58, FIFA ranks the Saudis ahead of Haiti (83) and T&T (100). The Green Falcons are also a less familiar opponent for the USMNT, and therefore trickier. But Haiti has given the Americans fits at recent Gold Cups past, and defeating even a relatively weak Soca Warriors side is never a sure thing – a fact that no U.S. supporter needs to be reminded of.

2. Reports out of Germany suggest Gio Reyna's time with Borussia Dortmund might finally be coming to an end this summer. Where would you like to see the 22-year-old midfielder playing ahead of the 2026 World Cup? What is his level?

Doug: France or Spain. Reyna allegedly turned down Marseille to sign on loan for Premier League Nottingham Forest last year. Wrong decision if true. That's exactly the sort of place a player like him could thrive. Right now, I think Reyna is capable of winning a starting job with a mid-table La Liga team. That's the key. At 22, he needs to do something he's never done in his career, play 90 minutes every week. Returning to MLS would be better than Reyna's current situation at Dortmund, for which he's been an unused sub in five straight Bundesliga games.

Reyna's potential has been obvious since he became, at 17, the youngest American ever to play in the UEFA Champions League. That was more than five years ago now. I still think Reyna has time to figure things out and become a consistent, two-way contributor for club and country before the 2026 World Cup. The clock is ticking, though. 

3. Fresh off of getting called up by the USMNT for the Concacaf Nations League in March, Brian White scored a club-record four goals for the Vancouver Whitecaps in their 5-1 over Austin FC on Saturday. Do you expect him to be part of the Gold Cup roster in June? Why or why not?

Doug: It's a numbers game. Folarin Balogun is back playing for Monaco following shoulder surgery, so he'll be there for sure. Same for Ricardo Pepi if he's healthy. Patrick Agyemang started the USMNT's most recent match over both White and Josh Sargent, and he scored the Americans' only goal in the 2-1 loss to Canada. So those are probably Mauricio Pochettino's three picks at striker if everyone's healthy. 

Of course, everyone isn't always healthy. The Gold Cup could come too soon for Pepi, who has been ruled out for the rest of PSV's season following knee surgery. Could that open the door for White? It's possible that Pochettino now prefers the 29-year-old MLS lifer to Sargent, who has yet to score in three U.S. starts since the Argentine coach took over last October. But White will also have to beat out Haji Wright, who has four goals in his last five games for Coventry City in England's second tier. I think White probably just misses out given the competition ahead of him.

4. The Phallon Tullis-Joyce fan club gained a handful of new members over the weekend after her incredible double-save for Manchester United in the FA Cup on Sunday. Just a week prior, she had a strong showing in a shutout win against Brazil. Is it too soon to call her the favorite to replace Alyssa Naeher on the USWNT?

Laken: I think it is too soon because Emma Hayes is still very much in the roster experimentation period. Everything regarding the USWNT is centered around the 2027 World Cup, and qualifying for that tournament isn't until November 2026. So Hayes has plenty of time, even though she'd probably rather have Alyssa Naeher's successor already in place.

Having said that, there is no question that Phallon Tullis-Joyce raised her USWNT profile in the last camp. She had a clean sheet and made six big saves in her first cap for the U.S. in the first match against Brazil. She appeared confident in goal, was aggressive coming off her line and made an impression on the team in her first ever start.

But Hayes has not ruled anybody out of the competition. Jane Campbell, Mandy McGlynn and Tullis-Joyce have been called into the past two camps, but it wouldn't be sensible to exclude Casey Murphy, Claudia Dickey or Angelina Anderson at this point in time. As far as Tullis-Joyce is concerned, however, Hayes needs to see more from her. She's only been involved in three camps and is still getting acclimated to the environment. Hayes commented that the goalkeeper is more quiet and introverted and it takes time to build trust and connections with new teammates. Tullis-Joyce made a case for herself, but it's still too early to say she's the frontrunner.

5. Who else in the USWNT player pool has helped their case during this period of experimentation for Emma Hayes and Co.?

Laken: Alyssa Thompson. The 20-year-old forward has taken another step, according to Hayes, after the past camp which featured two matches against Brazil. Thompson has been featured much more since returning to the fold last fall, which included scoring her first goal against Iceland last October. More recently, Thompson started both games vs. Brazil and was involved in two impressive goals. She was a bright spot in the attack and showed how much she's grown since coming into the senior team when she was only 17 years old.

Hayes commented on Thompson's growth during the April camp, explaining that the staff has been working with her for the past six months on her decision making, positioning and how to be a world-class 1v1 specialist. With only Trinity Rodman of the famed ‘Triple Espresso' available for selection recently, Thompson has a huge opportunity to ingrain herself further into Hayes' plans. Plus, she's been performing consistently for an undefeated Angel City where over the weekend, she scored a goal and had an assist in a 3-1 win over the Houston Dash, and became the second youngest player in NWSL history to reach 10 goals and 10 assists.

NWSL

Two-time World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist Carli Lloyd will soon be inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame, and she is not downplaying the moment.

“I never imagined something like this would happen,” Lloyd said Tuesday, a little more than two weeks before her May 3 induction at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas. Behind her hung a U.S. women's national team jersey with the No. 316 — her number of appearances in her nearly two decades with the team.

“My career was not one that was meant to go the way that it went, and I was never really the next best thing, but I just grinded away,” she said. “So to be inducted into the Hall of Fame along with so many other greats is a dream come true. I am incredibly honored. And I was honored every single time I put the uniform on — an amazing thing to be able to represent my country and continue to pave the way and pay it forward to the next generation.”

A native of Medford, N.J., Lloyd's passion for soccer started at 5 years old. Throughout her decorated career, Lloyd said she constantly reinvented herself. She began as an attacking center midfielder out of college, shifted to defending midfield, then returned to midfield — playing both left and right — before ultimately transforming into a striker late in her career.

One of the most decorated players of her generation, she cemented her legacy with a hat trick in the 2015 World Cup final against Japan that delivered the U.S. its first title in 16 years — and set them up to go back-to-back in 2019.

“I love the journey of that World Cup because where the team started and where we ended up was two totally different feelings,” she said. “I was thinking I was a horrible soccer player and couldn't play, and my confidence was low, and all of these things all of a sudden in a tournament, having to snap out of it.”

And snap out of it she did. Lloyd earned the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player and the Silver Boot as the No. 2 goal scorer of that year. She was also named FIFA Women's World Player of the Year in 2016 and 2017.

Lloyd is also remembered for scoring the winning goal in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing against Brazil in the 96th minute of extra time, helping the USWNT collect its third Olympic gold medal. Lloyd went on to win another at the 2012 London Games, adding a bronze medal in Tokyo in 2021.

“The evolution of the national team, for me, was twofold. I joined during a pivotal moment — right after the 1999ers and the '04 Olympic team had fought for guaranteed contracts, health benefits, and pregnancy leave. At the time, I didn't fully grasp the history behind those battles,” she said.

Lloyd says 2015 was the perfect moment to catapult the USWNT.

“Looking back, I do wish I were younger and playing in this era,” Lloyd said. “The game has exploded — more investment, more support, more competition. We did our part. Now it's their turn.”

Lloyd retired from professional soccer in 2021 after finishing her career with her hometown club, Sky Blue FC, later NJ/NY Gotham FC. Over 11 seasons in the U.S., she also played first-division soccer for the Atlanta Beat, the Western New York Flash and the Houston Dash. She spent a season with Manchester City in the Women's Super League, winning the English Women's FA Cup title in 2017.

Still, the December visit from fellow New Jersey soccer player Alexi Lalas, during which he told her she was going to be a Hall of Famer, caught her off guard. Lloyd was surprised to find out she would be a first-ballot inductee — even if others weren't.

“I was really thrown off guard when Alexi Lalas showed up at my house, although I was kind of questioning it, but I had the distraction of our daughter just basically, kind of being born,” she said. “I know that I'll probably get emotional when I am standing up there receiving my jacket and saying a few words, but I'm just super happy that I can be there, be part of it again, be honored amongst an unbelievable group of people, and have my family there as well.”

Lloyd was selected from a group of finalists that also included Yael Averbuch, Lori Chalupny, Stephanie Cox, Cat Whitehill and Amy Rodriguez, among others. She and Nick Rimando were elected via player ballot, while Chris Armas and Mary Harvey were selected by the veteran ballot and former MLS executive Mark Abbott earned his spot through the builder ballot.

“I never played for the money, I never played it for the fame,” she said when asked about her full circle moment receiving her spot at the Hall of Fame. “I never played for glory. I played purely for the love of the game. And I think that that's where some kids get it a little bit wrong; they see all the glitz and the glamor and what you get from winning, but it starts with love.”

 Megan Rapinoe

 is an icon of women's soccer and sports in America, and one of the most accomplished players in                             United States Soccer

 history.    

Rapinoe is one of the pioneers of soccer in the USA, leading arguably the greatest generation of talent the USWNT has seen during her 17-year career with the national team.

The Redding, California native scored a remarkable 63 goals in 203 caps for the senior women's team, leading the Stars and Stripes to two FIFA Women's World Cups (2015, 2019) and a Gold Medal at the 2012 London Summer Olympic Games.

She replicated the same success in her club career, winning titles in France and the United States after starring at the University of Portland. After bouncing around the United States for a few years, Rapinoe made the jump abroad to join Lyon, where she led the European powerhouse to a league and cup double.

Rapinoe spent the last ten years of her career with OL Reign of the NWSL back in the US, winning the NWSL shield three times (2014, 2015, 2022). The midfielder managed 52 goals in 121 appearances for Reign, earning the Best FIFA Women's Player and Ballon d'Or Féminin honors in 2019 after her second World Cup conquest with the USWNT.

The 39-year-old retired from the game in 2023, but has continued her influence on sport and culture in the United States. Both during her playing career and after, Rapinoe has been a strong advocate for a number of social issues, including equal pay for female athletes, LGBTQ+ rights and the Black Lives Matter movement.

Rapinoe's iconic No. 15 jersey became a staple around the country during her heyday, with millions of US soccer fans showing their support for the women's team with the iconic strip.

But why did the soccer legend choose to don the rather non-traditional number for her playing career?

Unfortunately, Rapinoe's story about how she started wearing No. 15 is far from storybook. As the USWNT icon told GQ in an interview in August 2024, the number was simply given to her in her early days with the national team, as there were few options for the up-and-coming star to choose from.

""That's just what got given to me on the national team. There's only so many numbers available, because so many people have been there, and it's all based on caps. At the time I was coming in, Kate Markgraf was going out. I had a couple of other, kind of 25, 26, 27 numbers for my first couple of caps, and then she was on her way out so [15] was really one of the only numbers that became available.

Seven was gone, I like seven. Three was gone. Ten was gone. I think 11 was gone, so I was just like, whatever. Then it just kind of became mine.""

Despite the hesitation at first, Rapinoe is happy she made her mark with No. 15 and made it her own, also admitting she was never attached to a specific number before.

""My favorite number, seven, was taken when I went to college. So I wore three. I wore three in high school too for basketball. I don't even know why. I can't remember why. I never really wore a number that had a ton of significance. But I ended up loving number 15 a lot. I feel like I left my mark, made it my own.""

It's an interesting time to be a U.S. Soccer fan.

While the men's national team is under immense pressure with the 2026 World Cup around the corner, the women's national team is in a period of transition and experimentation under Emma Hayes.

Let's check in on the biggest storylines in U.S. Soccer with FOX Sports' soccer reporters Doug McIntyre and Laken Litman:

Despite recent performances, the U.S. Men's National Team is brimming with young talent, with the likes of AC Milan's Christian Pulisic, Juventus' Weston McKennie, and AFC Bournemouth's Tyler Adams leading the way. 

But with the aforementioned trio already well-established members of the senior team at the age of 26, they are essentially old heads compared to some of the next generation beginning to make themselves known. Among this next wave of potential stars are two players who Adams recently singled out as ones to watch.

“I think there's a bunch of young players,” Adams said on the 'Men In Blazers' podcast when asked about which starlets stand out as ones to watch. “Brian Gutierrez, who was in camp, was a player that impressed me a lot. 

Meanwhile, USMNT midfielder Malik Tillman has publicly committed to remaining with Dutch side PSV for the upcoming Eredivisie season.

“He's obviously at Chicago now with Gregg Berhalter. And I think that's going to help him develop a lot. 

“We have a player here in Bournemouth, Matai [Akinmboni], who I think is unbelievable [and] to have a young American here is pretty special to see watching him, I didn't know too much about him coming from D.C., but as I've watched him, he's a lefty, a center back, and he has all the qualities to play in the National Team at the highest level. So I'll be excited to see how he progresses.”

21-year-old midfielder Gutierrez may be young, but he's already amassed an impressive 133 appearances for the Chicago Fire's first team since making his debut in 2020. Now led by former USMNT head coach Berhalter, Gutierrez has continued to play a vital starting role for Chicago, even being named captain for the first time as a professional - although a leg injury, suspension, and international duty have limited him to just four league appearances so far this season.

Listen to our All Out Soccer podcast on both Apple and Spotify.

Recently, Gutierrez also broke into Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT roster, making two appearances in January during their friendly wins against Venezuela and Costa Rica while also serving as a backup at the recent CONCACAF Nations League Finals.

As for Adams' Premier League teammate Akinmboni, the 18-year-old is yet to make his debut, having only joined from D.C. in January. A regular on the bench for head coach Andoni Iraola, the youngster recently told the team's website, “I grew up watching the Premier League, so playing at Vitality Stadium would be a special moment for me.”

While yet to make his senior team debut, Akinmboni has played for the USMNT's Under-20s, for whom he made his debut in November. 

Whenever Iraola deems Akinmboni ready, he'll line up alongside Adams in a Bournemouth side fighting for European soccer next season. Currently eighth in the Premier League, they are six points behind sixth-placed Chelsea in the Europa League qualification spot and seven behind Manchester City in the fifth and final Champions League position with six games to go.","{'href': 'https://www.themirror.com', 'title': 'The Mirror US'}","soccer"

Los Millonarios are looking to prove they're Argentina's finest - and the kings of South America

Marcelo Gallardo's men will march to the U.S. this summer on a mission to prove they're South America's finest at the Club World Cup.

One of two Argentine teams competing, River will look to show the world what Argentine football is all about. Led by La Albiceleste veterans Marcos Acuna, Franco Armani, German Pezzella, Lucas Martinez Quarta and Gonzalo Montiel - scorer of the penalty kick that helped his country lift the World Cup in 2022 - River will pair experience with a bit of youth. 

As 38-time domestic league champions - their last title came in 2023 - River exude excellence when it comes to the Argentine game. And that means they will give every opponent something to worry about, from Group E to - potentially - the knockouts. One of six CONMEBOL teams in total in this tournament, watch out for Los Millonarios.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will be played in 12 stadiums in 11 U.S. cities, from the opener on June 14 until the final on July 13. In the U.S., fans can stream or watch matches on DAZN or TNT. Leading up to kickoff, GOAL will provide scouting reports on each of the 32 participating teams in the expanded field.

Next up is River Plate with a look at key players to watch, and expectations for the Argentine side at the tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

If you thought Liga MX's Club León would accept FIFA's decision to disqualify them from the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup quietly and without a fight, think again.

Club León's dreams of competing in the inaugural, new-look Club World Cup seemingly came to an end after FIFA disqualified the side because it's owned by Grupo Pachuca, the same organization that owns fellow Liga MX side and 2025 Club World Cup participant, CF Pachuca.

León filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) as a last ditch effort to keep their place in the competition. FIFA must wait for CAS's ruling to appoint a replacement club, but soccer's governing body is already making public plans to find said replacement. 

FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that if CAS rules in their favor, the plan is for LAFC and Club América to play a playoff match to decide who fills León's vacant spot. 

The public statements didn't sit well with León's manager Eduardo Berizzo, who in the aftermath of his team's loss to Cruz Azul in Liga MX, took time out of his post-match press conference to unleash on FIFA and Infantino.

LA FIFA NO ES INTEGRA. TIENE INTERES OCULTOS.Durisima respuesta de Eduardo Berizzo a las declaraciones del presidente de Fifa, Infantiles. pic.twitter.com/grFq8MIXmr

""I won't discover anything describing the leaders of an organization that's totally under suspicion of irregularities. I though they were [Infantino's comments on possible replacement clubs] reckless, unnecessary and convenient,"" Berizzo said. ""FIFA's president can't express himself on possible replacements without waiting for CAS's ruling, his words carry a lot of weight.

""If the world was the way I'd want it to, people like that [Infantino] wouldn't lead organizations like this one [FIFA]. FIFA must prove it's an organization with integrity and it's not. In the past it hasn't been,"" Berizzo added. 

Berizzo also questioned the decision to disqualify León, the playoff proposal and even Inter Miami's induction into the tournament. 

""Makes it seem like there's an arrangement, hidden interests to determine which teams go, which teams don't go, why teams go, why teams don't go,"" Berizzo said. ""Whilst there's no clarity, transparency, they [FIFA] will always continue to be under suspicion.""

On the impending CAS ruling, Berizzo made a point to say, ""Hopefully CAS won't be conditioned by opinions like the president's [Infantino] that are totally out of place. A person with integrity would've waited for CAS's ruling."" 

León's manager concluded his attack on FIFA saying, ""We live in football [soccer], in organizations and institutions that instead of representing transparency and being an example to citizens, they always make us be more suspicious and they make us feel small. In a sport [soccer] where everyone should feel backed and feel proud to be a part of it, sometimes it makes you want to run away.""

The wait is on to find out what CAS's ruling will be.

Two sites, in Oklahoma City and Norman, have been included in FIFA's expanded list of potential Team Base Camps in preparation for the World Cup, which takes place in North America in June and July 2026.

Officials chose Oklahoma City's professional soccer training facility, located in the Adventure District, and the University of Oklahoma's athletic complexes as eligible training sites. 

“These world-class venues offer top-tier amenities that meet FIFA's rigorous standards to host national teams in the summer of 2026,” officials said in a news release.

There are also other locations across Oklahoma that are considering to bid to be Team Base Camps before national teams make their final decision later this year.

“Serving as a home away from home for participating teams to train, rest and prepare for matches, Team Base Camps are critically important to the event's success. The newly released edition of FIFA's Team Base Camp Brochure includes 62 locations across the United States, Canada and Mexico. Potential Team Base Camp sites for the 2026 tournament have undergone an extensive approval process with FIFA, based on the training facilities, local amenities and ease of access to one or more of the 16 host cities across North America,” officials said in a news release.

“Though we know it is ultimately out of our control whether a national team selects metro OKC as a Team Base Camp, just the fact that we could be considered is a testament to our growth as a community, our rising profile in international sports, and our commitment to soccer.  Our city hosts the Women's College World Series, the world's greatest basketball team, and will stage seven Olympic events in 2028.  We are also making a major commitment to soccer through MAPS 4 and prioritize our relationship with the sport. I commend everyone involved in this effort for their collaborative work behind the scenes to establish this potential opportunity, and I can assure any national team that they will find OKC to be a fantastic host in 2026,” Holt said.

“The Oklahoma Sooners are thrilled to open our doors and be included among the sites considered to host national teams for the World Cup. Our state is home to high-performance soccer facilities and a strong and growing fanbase. We're incredibly thankful for the opportunity to support some of the world's best squads as they compete on the largest stage in all of international soccer.”

FIFA are in advanced talks with venues in Las Vegas to host the draw for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, The Athletic reports.

The draw is expected to take place later in December this year to determine the group stage line-ups and set the pathway for the eagerly anticipated tournament.

FIFA consider Las Vegas a top choice and are keen to lock it down – a sentiment shared by several host city officials, who see it as an ideal place to engage with commercial partners.

FIFA have their eye on a number of venues, including the MGM Grand Garden Arena, The Sphere, and T-Mobile Arena.

However, conflicts with concerts, sporting events, and conventions like Amazon's AWS re:Invent and the National Finals Rodeo could throw a wrench into their plans.

A return to Las Vegas will be nostalgic for FIFA, having held the draw for the 1994 World Cup in Sin City – which was also the last time the United States hosted the showpiece tournament.

That event was graced by special appearances from Dick Clark, Robin Williams, Stevie Wonder, and even a video message from former US president Bill Clinton.

While a return to Las Vegas would be a dream scenario for FIFA, they're not putting all their eggs in that particular basket.

Reports suggest that Washington DC is being lined up as a backup option, especially if it makes it easier for President Donald Trump to participate.

The World Cup has been a major talking point for Trump, and he has frequently lavished praise on President Gianni Infantino so he could make an appearance either in person or via a video message.

There has even been internal discussion within FIFA about possibly staging a more modest version of the event in DC, maybe even in the White House.

Cities like Monterrey and Vancouver initially threw their hats in the ring as potential hosts for the World Cup draw.

However, FIFA, who are considering expanding the World Cup even further, have ruled them out of consideration.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Band celebrate the occasion with song remix and short film that blends their unique sound with the culture of European football

Iconic band LINKIN PARK will headline the UEFA Champions League final Kick Off Show on May 31 at the Munich Football Arena, announcing a performance that will feature both past and present hits.

""With our new album and ongoing tour, we've been overwhelmed by the fans' energy and excitement,"" the band said. ""We can't wait to share that same energy and excitement at the UEFA Champions League final Kick Off Show presented by Pepsi. This marks a totally new experience for us as a band, and we're excited to share some of our favourite songs from the past and present, with the thousands in the crowd and millions watching around the world.""

To celebrate the collaboration with UEFA for the Kick Off Show, the band recorded an electrifying remix and short film that blends their unique sound with the culture of European football. The track incorporates the recognizable riffs of their platinum hit “Numb” with sounds inspired by UEFA Champions League football - “the strike of leather, the whistle of a free kick, the sounds of the most passionate fans in the world.”

""When we first thought about the track that we made for this event ... it's really all about the football,"" LINKIN PARK singer and producer Mike Shinoda said. ""We had a bunch of references of past musicians, producers and artists who have made things which are special for a sport, so we wanted to take that inspiration and put our spin on it and do something made from the sounds of football.

“So, the track that we made is essentially the sounds of football, done in a LINKIN PARK way. All the things that it's built on are sounds of the foot hitting the ball, the sound of the ball hitting the net, the sounds of the fans stomping in the seats. These were the things that when we've been to football matches, struck us as being the powerful musical elements when being there.""

LINKIN PARK recently made a triumphant return to the spotlight with the release of From Zero, their first new music in seven years. The album hit the top of the charts across the globe and features hits such as “Heavy Is The Crown” and “The Emptiness Machine,” which was the biggest rock song of 2024, with more than 250 million streams.

According to Billboard, LINKIN PARK was the only rock band to cross 2 billion streams in 2024. The momentum continues this year with their new single “Up From The Bottom,” taken from their upcoming From Zero (Deluxe Edition) release, which will be available on May 16. 

Meanwhile, the band continues their From Zero World Tour, picking up next in Austin, Texas on April 26, winding across sold-out stadiums in Europe for the summer, and culminating in South America this fall.

The Champions League final will kick off at 3 p.m. ET on May 31. Pre-game, fans can watch the Kick Off Show via local broadcasters and through the official UEFA YouTube channel.

“We are proud to announce that one of the most influential rock bands of the 21st century will be headlining this year's UEFA Champions League final Kick Off Show presented by Pepsi,” said Eric Melis, VP of Global Brand Marketing, Pepsi at PepsiCo. “This marks our ninth year bringing together millions of viewers from around the world, with LINKIN PARK sure to put on a show like no other, live from the Munich Football Arena in Germany.

“We're delighted to be working with a group of artists who live by our ‘Thirsty For More' philosophy, reflecting the same spirit of innovation and boldness that Pepsi embodies - and we can't wait to see how fans react to this unmissable show.”

The band's connection to soccer extends to America, as well. Bassist Dave Farrell is massive LAFC fan, and hailed the impact that Argentine icon Lionel Messi has had on MLS and the game in the U.S.

“Growing up, playing soccer in the USA was always a thing that people did as kids, and I think soccer has always been a bigger sport than people give it credit for internationally,"" he said. ""We just never had a professional league until the MLS was formed. From that point on, the game has grown more and more and with Messi now coming, it's offered a different focus and lens globally on what's going on here.

""There is so much room and upside for U.S. soccer to grow and I think having a generational talent playing here makes that so much more readily available and visible. Now, with the World Cup coming to the USA, Canada and Mexico, it's another opportunity for us to keep putting positive steps forward. We can get our U.S. national team solid and we're hoping for a good 2026.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

A lot has changed on the ATP Tour since Bjorn Borg officially retired from professional tennis in 1993.  

Borg won 11 Grand Slam titles in his career, with all of those victories coming at either Roland Garros or Wimbledon.

In more recent years, Borg has been captained at the Laver Cup, but has now handed over his role to Yannick Noah. 

After spending time with the best ATP players in today's game, Bjorg has explained what has changed in tennis over the years.

Bjorg first retired in 1983, before attempting to make a comeback eight years later to little success.

When interviewed on television network RTVE, Borg was asked about how much tennis has changed since he left the sport. 

In his response to this question, Borg mentioned the big three of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer as an example of how much harder players hit the ball today.

The Swede also suggested that if he was on the ATP Tour in this era he would have to change the way that he played.

“They hit the ball so much harder than we did in my time,” said Borg. “Look at the players today like Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and other players. They hit the ball so much harder. Physically we were in good shape too but the way tennis is played today is so different.

“I think if I was playing today I would have to change my way to play and I would because if you love tennis and sport you would change because all style in 70's and 80's you cannot compare to Djokovic, Federer and Nadal. 

“You cannot. But if I was playing today I would have to change the way I was thinking and the style I was playing to the style today.”

One of the other players who has impressed Borg is Carlos Alcaraz, having made Laver Cup history under his captaincy last year.

Alcaraz is often compared to his compatriot Nadal, with the pair alongside one another for the latter's retirement tournament at the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga last year.

Nadal is a 22-time Grand Slam champion, with a record 14 of those coming at Roland Garros, but Borg has predicted Alcaraz to at least match his idol.

“I believe that Alcaraz will achieve the same or more than Nadal,” said Borg. “He has the right mentality and can play on all surfaces. With a bit of luck, he will be the king of tennis.”

Dominic Thiem is very impressed by two of the ATP's rising stars.

The Austrian brought an end to his tennis career in 2024 after a persistent wrist injury prevented him from returning to his best form.

At his best, Thiem reached number three in the world and beat Alexander Zverev in five sets to win the 2020 US Open.

Now a retired player, Thiem is watching from the sidelines and he is enjoying seeing the progress of two young players on the ATP Tour.

Thiem attended the ongoing Munich Open where he was interviewed by the ATP Tour's website.

During the conversation, the 31-year-old commented on the younger generation, led by Carlos Alcaraz and World number one Jannik Sinner.

and identified Joao Fonseca and Miami Open winner Jakub Mensik as two players he enjoys watching and thinks have a bright future in the sport.

“Mensik and Fonseca are amazing. I love to watch them,” Thiem said. “They already made it. There is no question they are really going to be at the top.

“Mensik won Miami, Fonseca already won Buenos Aires. They are already at the top, and now it's really interesting to see players like Diego and Justin Engel because they are still a little bit lower ranked.

“Mensik and Fonseca, I could watch them every week on the TV, but it's also interesting to watch somebody for the first time.”

The tennis world bid an emotional farewell to Thiem when he played the final match of his career in October 2024.

He entered his home tournament of the Vienna Open, losing in straight sets to Luciano Darderi and saying goodbye to tennis.

Six months on, Thiem explained how his retirement is going and shared what he misses most about playing tennis.

“I'm enjoying retirement. It's nice,” he said. “I'm completely in a different department now, with my company, with renewable energy, but of course I'll always remain in tennis, and I love the sport.

“It's really nice to see a tournament from a different perspective, and I'm enjoying it a lot. I miss the feeling after a great victory or after a tournament victory,” he said. “Those are the moments which are priceless, and also are never going to come back.

“The feeling is unbelievable, but I really don't miss all the work to actually come to those moments. To be in the position for those winning feelings, it's a very long and very hard road. I know what it takes and I'm not missing that part at all, so it's a good combination.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Carlos Alcaraz has changed his mind over whether he can break Rafael Nadal's record at the French Open","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/carlos-alcaraz-has-changed-his-mind-over-whether-he-can-break-rafael-nadals-record-at-the-french-open/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Being Spanish, the comparisons between Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal will likely exist until the end of time. 

Alcaraz is the new world number two in the ATP world rankings, and he hopes to close down Jannik Sinner at the top in the coming months. 

The 21-year-old will accept this as a challenge, and it would certainly be helpful if he could get a few more points on the board before the Italian star returns from his three-month ban at the Italian Open next month. 

Yesterday, Alcaraz beat American novice Ethan Quinn in his first match at the Barcelona, and he will be hoping to add this title to the Monte Carlo Masters crown he added to his mantlepiece over the weekend. 

At some point in the future, there will surely be a court named after Nadal given his unrivalled exploits at Roland Garros as a player who proved an immovable object when he was on the court. 

Nadal collected 14 of his 23 Grand Slam titles at the French Open and on the clay, he really did prove to be a master of his trade across a number of years. 

Given that Alcaraz and Nadal will constantly be compared, the youngster has now changed his mind on whether or not he can match the legendary Roland Garros figure, after initially suggesting he might be able to break his record. 

He told Marca: “Yes. What Rafa has done on clay is the greatest in sports and not just in tennis. Winning 14 Roland Garros, 11 times in Monte Carlo, eight in a row, that's incredible. Only people who aren't from this world are capable of doing it.”

Alcaraz has one title to his name at the French Open and after a couple more tournaments on the clay, he will soon be switching his focus to the first defence of his title at a tournament that he will look to become dominant at. 

Last year, Alcaraz was asked who he thought would be the number one player in the world at the end of 2024 and he named Sinner, who currently sits way ahead of the field. 

Now, he's been asked the question again for this year and he's remained somewhat more coy with Alcaraz now in the battle himself to become the world's best-ranked player. 

He said: “That's a good question. I don't know. I think we're in a good fight. Jannik is ahead, but that's what I said. I try to focus on what's really important, and for me, it's not the ranking. We're trying to take the emphasis off winning. 

“The most important thing is to enjoy it, and if I lose, to leave the court saying that I'm on the right path, that I did well, and that I enjoyed it. From there, move forward.”

Alcaraz is next in action tomorrow when he faces Laslo Djere and it looks extremely likely that he will claim another title in Barcelona when the weekend comes around. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The Georgia Tech star, who made a splash at Wimbledon in 2023, is bouncing back

Sometimes, when his game feels off, Christopher Eubanks watches his own highlights on YouTube. Some of the videos he searches for are from the summer of 2023, when his tennis game peaked at the perfect time and place. He usually chooses his match against Stefanos Tsitsipas, the fifth best player in the world.

On his screen, playing on Wimbledon's Centre Court, Eubanks is on fire. His serve clocks in at a blistering 129 mph, and he rushes the net constantly, pouncing on his opponent's off-balanced returns. Four hours into the match, in the fifth set, instead of hitting a conservative second serve in play, he hits a 121 mph ace on the center line that freezes Tsitsipas still. Eubanks looks at his coaches in the stands, raises his eyebrows, and laughs.

In the clip, Eubanks is 47th in the world, but his play at Wimbledon is beating the best. After another long rally, he stretches his six-foot-seven frame to place a backhand drop shot just out of Tsitsipas's reach. Eubanks now turns to the onlookers, already on their feet, and waves his arms up and down, sending them into a frenzy.

To finally win the match, he smashes a forehand past Tsitsipas. Eubanks's hands are on his head and his mouth wide open as he takes in another drowning standing ovation from the crowd. “Wimbledon was such a blur,” Eubanks says, watching the highlights. “I was hardly thinking about anything, just my opponent. I was so focused that I can't remember a lot of it.”

Eubanks, who grew up playing on the courts of the South Fulton Tennis Center, announced himself at Wimbledon in 2023. His string of upset wins was impressive, but the reckless abandonment he played with, plus the shock on his face after every win, made him a crowd favorite. His run ended in the quarterfinals, the furthest an American man had gone at the tournament since 2017, and his ranking jumped to number 29 in the world, a career high.

But since that summer on grass, Eubanks hasn't been back on tennis's biggest stages. The old adage “You're only as good as your last game” rings particularly true for professional tennis: One bad day in the office punishes players' ranking, which determines everything from the tournaments they play to the sponsorships they get. A bad year can sink their career. In 2024, Eubanks lost in the first or second round of all four Grand Slams, including a first-round exit at Wimbledon. A year and a half later, his ranking sits at 104th in the world, forcing him to play grueling qualifying tournaments at major events to make the main draw.

At 28, Eubanks's window to rediscover his Wimbledon form is narrowing. His story begins and continues in Atlanta, where he trains in search of the confidence that has made him a world-class tennis player, if only for a moment.

● ● ●

When Georgia Tech head coach Kenny Thorne showed up to a practice at the South Fulton Tennis Center, he saw a unicorn.

Already at a lanky six feet, seven inches, a 17-year-old Eubanks hit with Donald Young Jr., a fellow Atlantan and, at the time, an established pro on the tennis circuit. Eubanks stumbled over himself at times trying to reach Young's returns, but he would find his feet to hit a smooth one-handed backhand. His whip of a forehand sprayed across the court, with only so-so accuracy. Thorne knew that if Eubanks could develop a reliable winning forehand and a powerful serve, he could be one of the best players in the country.

For Thorne and most college coaches, Eubanks came out of nowhere. He was a late bloomer, who only popped up on Georgia Tech's radar when he nearly beat a program commit at the 2013 USTA Southern Championships a few weeks before Thorne's visit to South Fulton. Thorne offered Eubanks a spot on Georgia Tech's team days after he saw him hit with Young.

Unlike many of his college and pro peers, Eubanks is a product of the tennis centers in Atlanta's public parks rather than those at country clubs or private tennis academies. His dad, Mark, and his older brother, Mark Jr., picked up tennis as a hobby because southwest Atlanta has so many accessible spots to play.

Eubanks's first memories of tennis, and life, are at Burdett Tennis Center in College Park. When he was four years old, his dad gave him a racket and a tennis ball and told him to go beat the wall. He played in his first tennis tournament at the South Fulton Tennis Center when he was eight. Eubanks lost in a close match in the final, which was enough for his dad to see his potential. “My parents were super busy, with my dad working at Delta and my mom at a bank, but our lives became tennis,” Eubanks says. “So I went to school and then played tennis for hours after.”

Around this time, a golden age of junior tennis was happening in south Atlanta. Young (formerly the number one junior tennis player in the world), Taylor Townsend (currently the third best female doubles player in the world), and Zack Kennedy (who later rivaled Eubanks in college) all grew up in the area. (Several years later, a certain Coco Gauff also developed her game in south Atlanta.)

“When they were eight years old, Zack and Eubanks would be the only Black players at some tournaments, so our families connected,” says Sam Kennedy, Zack's dad and coach. “We all started to hit together, and we just latched onto one another, because that's what it took.”

Mark Eubanks and Kennedy were self-taught in tennis, and the dads worked together to impart good form and a strong mental game to their sons. “Chris's dad is very disciplined, and his son was the same,” Kennedy says. “Chris was a calm kid, which made him a great learner for tennis, soaking up everything like a sponge.”

Even with a childhood dedicated to tennis, Eubanks still experienced growing pains. He was a good junior player but felt he was behind the other juniors who had better training. He played closely with Zack and other strong players but lost matches when doubt crept in. By the time Eubanks got to Westlake High School, Zack played ahead of him on the varsity tennis team. Another hurdle was his height. “He got so tall and skinny at 13, 14, that his head couldn't tell his arms what to do fast enough,” Kennedy says.

In the car on the way to school in the fall of his sophomore year, Eubanks remembers his dad telling him it was time to look at tennis as all or nothing. “He decided that I would start going to South Fulton and train with Donald and the Youngs,” Eubanks says. “There was no warning but also no argument. I felt I wasn't good enough, but the opportunity was undeniable.”

Eubanks idolized Young, whom many expected to quickly become a top pro player. His parents ran the South Fulton Tennis Center, and when Eubanks joined their tutelage in the fall of 2011, Young was preparing to play tournaments on the pro tour as a 22-year-old. Over a few months of daily lessons, Eubanks's game improved quickly, and in May 2012, Young offered to bring Eubanks on tour with him.

They traveled all over the world that summer, with Eubanks as Young's hitting partner. “Donald was like my big brother during that trip, and he constantly told me that I was good enough, which was something I really needed to hear,” says Eubanks. “Like, this was a guy who looked like me, from the same side of town, who was always telling me I could do it.”

While Eubanks was in Europe, he missed a crucial summer tennis season for recruiting, when college coaches scout and extend offers to talented high schoolers. But when he returned to practice at Westlake for his junior season, he beat Zack for the first time.

● ● ●

After Eubanks received his offer to Georgia Tech, the decision for his tennis future again was made for him. “My dad told me that I was going to Georgia Tech,” Eubanks says. “Tech made the most sense with it being home, plus I could still practice with Donald. I think I would have made the same decision.”

That decision, ultimately, panned out well for Eubanks. After developing a serve and refining his forehand, he became one of the best players in Georgia Tech tennis history. In three years in the program, he became a two-time All-American and earned Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year twice. He excelled in singles, reaching 90 career wins, which ties him fifth all-time at Georgia Tech.

In 2017, he entered the main draw at the Atlanta Open and won his first two professional matches. His performance resulted in a wild card entry to the U.S. Open, where he lost in the first round. As he approached his senior year at Georgia Tech, Eubanks had proved to himself that he was ready to turn professional. This time, he made the decision himself, without consulting his family or coaches.

Going pro is easier said than done. Although Eubanks had traveled with Young throughout high school, he was now on his own. He spent the first four years of his career fluctuating between 150th and 230th in the world, playing many small events on tour to find his footing and trying to reach Grand Slams by qualifying. By 2021, his major achievements were a tournament win at an ATP Challenger event in Knoxville and a 2020 U.S. Open doubles quarterfinal appearance. “I always thought it was a matter of time before the results came, but they didn't,” Eubanks says. “I wasn't thinking about quitting per se, but I began to feel like I was losing time.”

His breakthrough came in 2022, off the court. Eubanks saw his fellow Atlantan Taylor Townsend commentating for the Tennis Channel for Women's Tennis Association (WTA) events that she didn't play in. Eubanks loved to talk about tennis with other pros and thought commentating might be fun. His agent reached out to the Tennis Channel to see if there was an opportunity for him to play a similar role. His first match as an announcer was at the 2022 edition of the Knoxville ATP Challenger, the same tournament he had won the year before.

Announcing felt natural for Eubanks and brought an unexpected benefit. In the booth, he couldn't surf highlights. It forced him to watch matches start to finish, and he started to pick up on the attitudes and patterns that led to success. “Everything seemed so glaringly obvious,” Eubanks says. “I could see myself in a lot of the guys who lost close matches, so if I focused on the little things, I could beat them.”

Eubanks put together the pieces of his puzzle in 2023. In March, he reached the quarterfinals of the Miami Open and lost a close match to the world number three, Daniil Medvedev. For the first time in his career, Eubanks cracked the top 100, debuting at 85. But at the start of the summer grass season, Eubanks was upset in the first round of a small tournament called the Surbiton Challenger.

He texted a friend, Grand Slam champion Kim Clijsters, that “grass is the stupidest surface to play tennis on.” Eubanks was surprised that Clijsters would admit she also struggled on grass, and she told him to move on the court more, which should help him get his feet underneath him for both his body and mind.

It was what he needed to hear. He won his first ATP Tour title on the grass courts in Mallorca, Spain, on a Saturday, and started qualifiers for Wimbledon on Monday. After the tour win, he started to trust his game. “I was like, I can't win Mallorca and not get to the first round,” Eubanks says. “Then, once I was in the round, I really just wanted to play on grass as much as I could. After each win, I just thought, Who's next?”

His confidence was so high that you'd forget this was his Wimbledon debut. Next was Cameron Norrie, the 12th best player in the world and number one Brit, backed by his home crowd. To open the second-round match, Eubanks hit a pair of aces, then a smashing forehand winner. He played a nerveless match that dispatched Norrie in four sets. In the third round, Eubanks took care of Australian Christopher O'Connell in straight sets. You know what happened to Tsitsipas in the fourth round.

For the quarterfinal, Eubanks matched with Medvedev again. Eubanks felt prepared after their Miami matchup and by commentating on a few of his matches earlier that spring. After losing the first set 4–6, Eubanks's serve became unstoppable, his play at the net impeccable. Eubanks won the second and third sets in a dominating fashion: 6–1 and 6–4. Medvedev had made only six errors up to that point, but Eubanks was still playing him off the court.

With the fourth set tied at 6–6, Eubanks's serve faltered, and Medvedev evened the match. Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the eight matches he had played in two weeks; Eubanks looked exhausted and lost the final set 6–1.

This winter, Eubanks hibernated at the Byers Tennis Complex, an indoor facility on Georgia Tech's campus. Other than a year living in Florida, Eubanks has always stayed in Atlanta, recently moving to an apartment on the Beltline to be closer to where he trains. He's back in the lab, running through very specific match scenarios with his coaches to mentally prepare.

After his Wimbledon run, Eubanks has struggled to replicate the same form. On the court, he earned spots on Team USA rosters for the 2024 Davis Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics, but with middling results. On the tour, Eubanks lost in the first round of many tournaments, including Wimbledon. Off the court, though, Eubanks has appeared more and more in the commentary booth. He now serves as an analyst and on-court reporter with ESPN at Grand Slams, most recently at the U.S. and Australian Opens, after he exited those tournaments.

“He can articulate tennis better than almost anyone, and you know, it's important he does it as a Black man,” Sam Kennedy says. Many of the junior players Kennedy coaches at South Fulton look up to Eubanks and tune in to ESPN to watch the hometown hero commentate. “But the coach in me knows that you can't replicate Wimbledon unless you're ‘all in' one thing.”

Eubanks is careful to balance commitments while recognizing that analyzing tennis unlocked something different at Wimbledon. “I really think commentating has helped me personally,” Eubanks says. “But I'm a tennis player first, and commentating should still just be an opportunity.”

Recently, there have been signs that Eubanks is ascending again. In November 2024, he won the ATP Challenger in Knoxville, the same tournament that precipitated his success at Wimbledon. Eubanks is confident that his prior up-and-down year made him stronger, and he hopes to get back to where he was as a player, and potentially better than before.

In his Beltline apartment, he watches his Wimbledon matches more and more. “It's cool to see how I served that day and my great shots, but it's not necessarily to reminisce,” he says. “I want to do everything to get back to that level. I'm trying to remember how I felt.”

IMG will continue to work with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) in handling the U.S. and international media rights to the US Open.

IMG worked with USTA on its recent deal for ESPN to remain the home of the US Open in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean through 2037. The 2024 edition of the tennis tournament was seen by more than 175 million people in 200-plus territories across 60 channels.

“IMG has been an integral part of the US Open's growth, ensuring that it reaches core fans and new audiences across the world through innovative local and regional media distribution partnerships,” said Kirsten Corio, chief commercial officer at USTA. “We are thrilled to extend the relationship with IMG to together bring the most spectacular sports and entertainment event to the world for many more years to come.”

Ed Mallaburn, senior VP of sports management at IMG, added, “The US Open has grown into one of the world's most engaging and exciting sporting events, capturing the attention of audiences of all ages, spanning far beyond tennis and sports fans. The USTA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible on-site and on-screen, and we couldn't be prouder to continue to support such a bold and innovative rights holder. The sport of tennis needs to leverage its unique assets in an ever-changing ecosystem, and this year's revamped mixed doubles event is a perfect example of how the USTA is doing this.”

	In addition to being the host of The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon is a prolific pitchman, starring in ads for State Farm, Pepsi and Capital One, among others. He will put that experience front and center in his latest primetime unscripted show for NBC.


	Fallon created and will host and executive produce On Brand With Jimmy Fallon, a competition series that “follows what happens when Jimmy Fallon starts a premier marketing agency and fills it with the most creative, clever, and competitive go-getters he can find,” according to the show's description.

	Former Netflix and Uber marketing head (and current Real Housewives of Beverly Hills castmember) Bozoma Saint John will also be part of On Brand, serving as chief marketing officer of the agency in the show. A host of national brands — Captain Morgan, Dunkin', KitchenAid, Marshalls, Pillsbury, Samsung, Sonic, Southwest and Therabody — will be part of the show as well, serving as the agency's clients and (of course) getting a good deal of screen time.


	“I love branding, I love marketing, I love the world of advertising, and I think there are a lot of people out there who do as well,” said Fallon. “This show lets the audience and our contestants get a peek behind the curtain of how campaigns for some of the biggest brands come together and what goes into making them. It's exciting.” 


	Each episode will see the On Brand Agency (which reinforces the show's title; branding!) working with one of the aforementioned brand on a major campaign that may involve commercials, jingles, in-person experiences or merchandise. Fallon, Saint John and a representative from the brand will choose the best ideas, which then go on to become real-world campaigns.


	After a final assignment, the winner will receive a cash prize and be “provided the experience of changing the cultural landscape.”


	Sony Pictures TV's B17 Entertainment and Universal Television Alternative Studio produce On Brand in association with Fallon's Electric Hot Dog copmany. Fallon executive produces with Brien Meagher, Rhett Bachner, Pip Wells and Kelly Powers. CAA's media and entertainment partnerships division partnered with NBCUniversal to bring brands to the show.

Senior Editor, Latin


Selena Gomez will receive the 2025 Woman of the Year award at the annual Billboard Latin Women in Music event, Billboard and Telemundo announced on Wednesday (April 16). The two-hour special, set to be held Miami, will air April 24 exclusively on Telemundo. 


	The Woman of the Year award is presented to a female artist who has demonstrated exceptional success, leadership and cultural influence in the music industry and beyond. Previous Women of the Year honorees at Latin Women in Music include Shakira and Karol G. 

	











	A global powerhouse, Gomez has had a fruitful career as a recording artist. On the Billboard charts, the 32-year-old star has had presence across genres, including a total of 42 entries on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, including her first No. 1 hit, “Lose You to Love Me” (2019). On the Hot Latin Songs chart, her featured role on DJ Snake's “Taki Taki,” alongside Ozuna and Cardi B, debuted at No. 1 on the tally in October 2018, where it ruled for 13 weeks. Since, she's achieved three additional top 10 hits on the multimetric ranking, including “Baila Conmigo,” her collaboration with Rauw Alejandro, which soared to a No. 4 peak in 2021 and topped the Latin Airplay chart for a week.

	The Texas-born artist of Mexican descent further expanded her reach in Latin music with her first-ever Spanish-language project, Revelación. The EP, released four years ago, debuted at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart, making history as the first album by a female artist to achieve the feat since Shakira's El Dorado. It also scored her a Grammy nomination for best Latin pop album. Most recently, Gomez entered the top five on Hot Latin Songs thanks to “Ojos Tristes” with Benny Blanco and The Marías. The song, a reimagination of the '80s classic “El Muchacho de los Ojos Tristes,” is part of Gomez and Blanco's collaborative album, I Said I Love You First.


	Beyond her career in music, Gomez — also an award-winning actress, producer and business mogul — has become a leading voice for mental health and social justice issues that impact underrepresented communities. She was Woman of the Year at the 2017 Billboard Women in Music.


	Gomez joins this year's previously announced honorees, including Anitta (Vanguard Award), Belinda (Evolution Award), Celia Cruz (Legend Award), Chiquis (Impact Award), Ha*Ash (Unbreakable Award), Natti Natasha Unstoppable Artist), and Olga Tañón (Lifetime Achievement Award).

The two groups are aiming to raise $1 million to protect HIV care around the globe.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



	The Elton John AIDS Foundation and Brandi Carlile‘s Looking Out Foundation announced a new initiative on Wednesday (April 16) to address what they call an urgent global humanitarian crisis caused by recent drastic cuts to HIV/AIDS funding in the U.S. The emergency initiative “Who Believes in Angels?” campaign — named in honor of the duo's recent joint album of the same name — will bring communities together to raise funds for John's long-running AIDS Foundation and its Rocket Response Fund to continue their lifesaving work around the globe.

	“Without prompt action, decades of progress in the global fight against HIV could be reversed, creating a global health crisis that we have both the power and the tools to prevent,” John said in a statement about the urgent need to raise funds in the wake of the Trump administration's termination of USAID support for such efforts. “Our mission is more important than ever – we refuse to leave anyone behind – and I'm so fortunate that Brandi is not only a wonderful collaborator and artist, but a dear friend who shares my vision of a world where HIV care is prioritized and protected.”

	According to the statement, the Rocket Response Fund will direct resources to open shuttered clinics, restore access to essential medications and maintain prevention services to ensure that people around the world can get the HIV care they need.


The Hill reported this week that the deep cuts enacted by Health and Human Services (HHS) Sec. Robert F. Kennedy to the nation's public health workforce as part of Trump's drastic cuts to the government workforce threaten to undo decades of working combating HIV, as well as potentially delaying upcoming scientific advances. Kennedy's plans to reduce HHS staffing by 20% will effectively zero-out a number of divisions within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


	Hit especially hard are offices focused on HIV/AIDS, including the firing of the entire staff of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy, as well as the lay-off of one-quarter of the  Global Health Center Division of Global HIV and TB, as well as the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention. In addition, five branches of the CDC's HIV prevention division were entirely eliminated, including the research, surveillance and prevention communication branches. 

	











	Hit particularly hard were grants for HIV research focused on transgender, Black and Latino individuals — who've been disproportionately impacted by the epidemic — in what the Hill said was likely tied to the Trump team's efforts to eliminate what they deem diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in federal agencies. The Hill noted that before being named as HHS secretary, Kennedy publicly questioned whether the HIV virus causes AIDS and promoted the unsubstantiated belief that AIDS could be caused by the recreational drug known as “poppers,” which is popular in the gay community; the CDC and World Health Organization have long acknowledged that if left untreated HIV can lead to AIDS.


	“It was a lifelong dream come true for me to come together with my hero and friend Elton John to make our album Who Believes In Angels? and now, we're excited to announce that our foundations are also partnering to make our music mean even more,” said Carlile in a statement. “Elton's activism and work with the Elton John AIDS Foundation was what led me to Elton before I even heard a note of his music. It's an incredible honor to launch this partnership and raise funds for the life-saving work of the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the Rocket Response Fund at a time when support is needed the most.”


	The announcement noted that international funding has been crucial to reducing new HIV transmission and deaths worldwide. But with a number of countries joining the U.S. in considering aid cuts the Lancet HIV projected that — based on data from 26 countries — up to 10.8 million additional HIV cases and 2.9 million HIV-related deaths could occur by 2030 if international support dries up. 

	











	Donations to the campaign — which the Looking Out Foundation will match dollar-for-dollar through Friday morning (April 18) — can be made here.

Six months after Steel won Young Thug's stunning release, Diddy is adding the well-regarded lawyer to his defense team.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



With his sex trafficking and racketeering trial looming next month, Sean “Diddy” Combs has beefed up his legal team by hiring Brian Steel – the veteran Atlanta defense attorney who won Young Thug's release from prison last year.


	In a motion filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, Steel requested to be admitted as one of Combs' lawyers ahead of the upcoming trial, which is currently set to go to jury selection on May 5. Such approval is necessary for out-of-state lawyers to practice in new courts.

	The move marks a significant addition to the team representing Combs, the once-powerful rap mogul now charged with abusing women for decades. Steel will join Marc Agnifilo, a former federal prosecutor and longtime criminal defense attorney who has previously repped Martin Shkreli and Keith Raniere, and his law partner Teny Geragos.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Steel made headlines with his recent work defending Young Thug (Jeffery Williams), who faced a slew of felony charges in Georgia over allegations that his “YSL” rap collective was actually a violent street gang that had wrought havoc on Atlanta. The attorney often took center stage during that case, which captivated the music industry for more than two years.


	A well-regarded defense attorney for years in Atlanta, Steel is known for his unique demeanor in the courtroom – polite, calm and scrupulous, but also relentless. Case in point: In June, he accused the judge overseeing Thug's trial of holding an illegal secret meeting with prosecutors and a key witness. When the judge demanded to know how he'd learned of the meeting, Steel refused to answer so steadfastly that he was eventually held in contempt and ordered into custody. Weeks later, that judge was removed from the case over the incident and Steel was later cleared of any wrongdoing.


	In some ways, the case facing Combs is similar to the one leveled against Thug. Both were charged with violating RICO laws (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations), accused of serving as the bosses of large criminal organizations. But Thug's case was centered on accusations that his group committed drug dealing, carjackings and an alleged drive-by shooting; Combs is accused of using his fame and his sprawling business empire to sexually abuse numerous women and then keep them silent.


	Differences aside, Combs is no doubt hoping for a similar result to the one Steel secured for Thug.


	After botched testimony from a state's witness in October sparked talk of a mistrial, prosecutors began reaching plea deals with multiple defendants. But Steel and Thug refused to take one, instead opting to simply plead guilty and hope the judge would set him free on probation rather than the 25 years the district attorney was seeking.


	That gamble paid off: After sentencing Thug to only 15 years probation with no time to be served in prison, the judge urged the Grammy-winning rapper to use his platform to set a good example for young people in the future: “Good luck to you. And there better be no violations.”


	Since he was indicted in September, Combs' legal team has seen several shakeups. He hired Alexandra Shapiro, an well-known appellate specialist, in October. Anthony L. Ricco, another prominent New York defense attorney, withdrew from the case in February for undisclosed reasons.

EXCLUSIVE: In her first TV series starring role, Lindsay Lohan is set to headline and executive produce Count My Lies, a drama in development at Hulu. The project, based on the recently published novel by Sophie Stava, comes from former This Is Us executive producers/co-showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger as well as 20th Television where the duo and their The Walk-Up Company are under an overall deal.


	In Count My Lies, written by Aptaker and Berger, when compulsive liar Sloane Caraway fibs her way into a nanny position for the gorgeous and charismatic Violet and Jay Lockhart, it seems she's finally landed her dream job. But little does Sloane know, she's just entered a household brimming with secrets that are about to explode — with potentially catastrophic consequences for all.

			Watch on Deadline		







	This would mark Aptaker and Berger's third series for the Disney streamer following Love, Victor and How I Met Your Father, both through 20th TV where they have been for 13 years.


	Lohan has an even longer history at Disney. Her first five movies — theatrical and TV ones — were all at the company: The Parent Trap (1998), ABC's Life-Size (2000), Disney Channel's Get a Clue (2002), Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (February 2004). Her biggest American TV series role to date was also at Disney, a four-episode arc on ABC's Ugly Betty, which was produced by ABC Studios, now part of 20th Television.


	She recently returned to the Walt Disney Studios for the upcoming Freakier Friday sequel, in theaters on August 8. Lohan, who starred in the Netflix 2025 holiday movie Our Little Secret, is repped by IAG, Dave Feldman and Vision PR.


Count My Lies is Stava's debut novel. Published by Scout Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, on March 4, it was the GMA Book Club pick for March. She is repped by CAA and Elisabeth Weed at The Book Group.


	Aptaker and Berger served as executive producers and co-showrunners alongside creator Dan Fogelman on 20th Television's hit NBC drama series This is Us. They also developed and executive produced the HIMYM spinoff series, How I Met Your Father, and were creators and executive producers of Love, Victor. Aptaker and Berger are repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

EXCLUSIVE: Oscar-nominated actor Michael Shannon is set to play iconic coach Bill Parcells in the Skydance Sports untitled football drama about former player John Tuggle, who was given the title “Mr. Irrelevant” after being the last pick of the last round of the 1983 NFL Draft. Superman star David Corenswet will play Tuggle with Isabel May also on board.


Jonathan Levine is directing, with Emmy-nominated writer Nick Santora is penning the script.


	The film will be produced by Skydance Sports, with Levine producing with Gillian Bohrer from Megamix along with Santora from his Blackjack Films banner. It will tell the inspiring and heartfelt true story of Tuggle, drafted by the New York Giants, and his enduring impact on his team and teammates. Parcells was the Hall of Fame coach of the Giants at this time. He's considered one of the greatest coaches of his era, winning two Super Bowls with the Giants, but also played a large part in the team taking a chance on Tuggle.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“Mr. Irrelevant” started in 1976 with the drafting of USC receiver Paul Salata, launching a series of events that have come to be known as Irrelevant Week. A handful of players in that draft position have gone on to success, but Brock Purdy has given the moniker a face-lift since he took over starting duties for the San Francisco 49ers, leading them to the Super Bowl after the 2023 season.


	While Tuggle's story is much different then Purdy's, it touches on the notes that make for an ideal movie to add to Skydance Sports' slate.


	Shannon is no stranger to playing real-life legends, having recently portrayed country singer George Jones in the Showtime limited series George & Tammy. The series also starred Jessica Chastain and earned both Emmy nominations for their performances. He is also set to play President James Garfield in the Netflix limited series Death by Lightning. 


	He is repped by CAA and Range Media Partners.

Britney Spears shared a new photo of her younger son, Jayden Federline, in an April 15 Instagram post and fans think he's the spitting image of his megastar mom.

In the hazy, sunlit image, the 18-year-old mugs for the camera in a black tank top and a backwards baseball cap. Spears captioned the post with white doves, upside down smiley faces, and swords, adding the emojis in groups of threes.

A post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)

Her son's playful, wide-eyed stare in the snap made several members of a Britney Spears fan forum on Reddit nostalgic.

One compared the gamer to his mother when she was near his age, writing, “He has her 2001 face.”

Another chimed in, “He's always been identical to her.”

A third Reddit poster said of Spears and her son, “Yep! They're the twinsss.”

The post comes 12 days after Spears called Federline and his older brother, 19-year-old Preston, “incredibly sweet and charming” in the caption of a video of the younger brother playing the piano.

With the announcement that “Wicked” director Jon M. Chu will be at the helm of a musical biopic about the “Gimme More” singer, rumors began swirling about who will play the princess of pop.

Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, and Millie Bobby Brown's names were thrown into the mix, according to E! Online, but Chu squashed the speculation with a March 23 X post.

“None of this is true,” he wrote, before adding that he has “not had one conversation about casting this movie yet.”

Chu, known for his box office smash “Crazy Rich Asians” which featured the first all-Asian cast in a major Hollywood film in 25 years, is teaming with developer Marc Platt on the project.

As for Brown, a 2025 Rolling Stone report says the “Stranger Things” star expressed she “would love nothing more” than to be a part of Spears' story, and called the star “an absolute icon.”

On November 11, 2024, People reported the “Crossroads” star spent some time with Federline at her Los Angeles home when he returned for a visit after making a big move to Hawaii around May 2023 with his brother and father.

The report says Spears fully supported the move, and quoted an inside source as saying, “Britney has always faithfully supported her children and wants them to be happy.”

The source also said of the visit with her son “spending time together has made her happy.”

Now that season 3 of “The White Lotus” has finished airing, Patrick Schwarzenegger gets honest about what it was like auditioning and bringing his character Saxon Ratliff to life on set. Plus, he details who he bonded with while filming the show in Thailand, and which costar gave him great acting advice.

This article contains some spoilers.

At a recent SAG-AFTRA Foundation screening in Manhattan for actors in the Screen Actors Guild union, Schwarzenegger, 31, got candid about the process of making the HBO series. First came the invitation to audition via self-tape for a show called “The Secret Garden.” The actor told the crowd that once he saw the name Mike White as the writer and director on the casting breakdown, he knew immediately that it was “The White Lotus.”

He only received three audition scenes for the role of Saxon – not a full episode script – and a short description of the character: “A finance bro who is a flirt.” Schwarzenegger knew he had to make the character his own, since all he had in the instructions was just “a sliver of what the character is.” One of those three audition scenes was from the first episode of season 3, where Saxon lies in bed next to his brother Lochlan and talks about how hot their sister Piper is. He called the scene “nuts,” prompting a laugh from the audience. 

In order to immediately give viewers what he thought was the right vibe for Saxon, Schwarzenegger stated that he “eye-f***ed the camera in the first five seconds” of his self-tape audition. He did his best to make the character a “horny, flirty guy” and the camera someone he wanted. His choices obviously paid off.

Another audition scene he had to perform was from Season 3 Episode 6, where Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood) calls his character “soulless” while they sit next to one another. He called it a “big power shift” for his character as his ego gets destroyed. He went on to say that he usually becomes the most proud of those nerve-wracking scenes that can initially make him uncomfortable as an actor. 

According to Schwarzenegger, he was already flying to Thailand two to three weeks after the booking the role. His first day of filming involved a scene at the pool in season 3's first episode. A clip from that scene made the rounds on social media because of the way he adjusts himself after getting out of the pool. “It was my idea to adjust myself,” he told the group of actors, and director Mike White laughed at the moment. Thinking it was a perfect move for Saxon, White left it in the episode.

A post shared by @classicues

It was also Schwarzenegger's idea for his character to sleep naked in his hotel room, no matter who was near, like his brother. He explained that because Saxon is such a dominant, hypermasculine guy, he wants to control the room, and doesn't care if others might be uncomfortable with his nudity.

Schwarzenegger shared another memory that White had to pull him aside during filming because of a problem with his walking. He comically did a Mike White impersonation and repeated the note he was given on set that day: “You don't look rich. You gotta walk ‘richer.' Aren't you rich in real life?” The audience laughed, as did Schwarzenegger, who walked around the stage in that moment. Apparently his costar Parker Posey, an actor's actor and always a fan favorite, had then asked, “Which part of his body does he lead with?” which made Schwarzenegger laugh.

It's no doubt that cast members bond on a film or TV set, away from home for long periods of time. “The White Lotus” was no exception, as Schwarzenegger explained there was a lot of immediate family bonding with his costars. “We did everything together,” he said, adding that he especially connected with his TV siblings Sam Nivola and Sarah Catherine Hook and ate all meals with them for seven months in Thailand. One day, White had asked Schwarzenegger if he wanted to get dinner, but Schwarzenegger told him, “I'm getting dinner with my family.”

Because of this closeness with his coworkers, he stated that he got emotional at the end of filming his scenes. “I was surprised at how maybe emotional it was, or how much I actually rooted for specific characters and myself. You feel like you know these people.” The cast also watched the finale together, which Schwarzenegger said made him tear up. 

A post shared by Patrick Schwarzenegger (@patrickschwarzenegger)

The last question from the moderator was about the best acting advice Schwarzenegger has ever received. Besides a self-tape tip from his brother-in-law Chris Pratt, Schwarzenegger remembered what his costar Walton Goggins told him on his second day of filming. Schwarzenegger had asked the “Fallout” and “Justified” star if he ever gets nervous. After a pause, Goggins simply responded, “Yeah,” before seriously saying with a poke, “But I never f***ing question my process and that I'm the one for this role.” Schwarzenegger told the audience about his own self-doubts, but that Goggins' confidence boost will continue to stay in his mind.

Highlights from the Q&A can be seen on SAG-AFTRA's YouTube page here.

Demi Moore can clearly remember the moment she realized she would lose the Best Actress Oscar to Mikey Madison. Moore, who led “The Substance,” lost to the “Anora” actress during the 2025 Oscars. In a new interview, Moore shared that she knew during the commercial break before the award was announced that she was not favored by the Academy.

“I leaned over and whispered to my manager, ‘I think it's going to Mikey,'” Moore told Time. “I don't know why I knew, but I did. I was so centered and calm. I didn't feel gutted. I didn't feel any of those kinds of things. I just trusted, and am in trust of, whatever is going to unfold.”

Moore had previously won the best lead actress prizes at the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice Awards, and SAG Awards. However, “Anora” had already landed the Oscars for best editing, original screenplay, and director awards prior to Madison getting Best Actress (the feature went on to also win Best Picture). 

Moore took to Instagram the day after the Academy Awards to applaud Madison's win and also thank her “The Substance” team. At the time, Moore said that she couldn't wait to see what Madison will do next in her career.

“As this awards season comes to a close, I'm so overwhelmed with gratitude for this journey,” Moore wrote at the time. “It's been the ride of a lifetime and we're just getting started! So grateful for my team, my fellow nominees, and everyone who has made this experience so full of joy and light… And a huge congratulations to Mikey Madison — can't wait to see what you do next.”

Moore also reflected on her own career of being labeled a “popcorn actress” to IndieWire, saying, “What I've come to realize is that nobody can throw you under the bus unless you've thrown yourself under the bus. People can't appreciate you unless you appreciate yourself. When you hold and value yourself for all that you are, as you are in whatever moment that is, then the rest of the world will follow. It doesn't go the other way around. I just wasn't ready yet to hold all that I am until this very moment.”

Neil Young's efforts to secure American citizenship were repeatedly hindered by Donald Trump‘s first administration, according to Daryl Hannah. 


	“They tried every trick in the book to mess him up, and made him keep coming back to be re-interviewed and re-interviewed,” said Hannah, who's been married to Young since 2018, in a new interview with the BBC. “It's ridiculous [because] he's been living in America and paying taxes here since he was in his 20s.”


	A representative for the White House did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Young was born in Toronto, crossed the U.S. border illegally in a Pontiac hearse in 1966, and spent much of his early career — including stints in Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young — working without papers. He eventually secured a green card in 1970, and finally got around to applying for full citizenship nearly five decades later. 


	But the process was not easy. While Hannah's comments are the first time anyone's suggested the White House allegedly interfered with the process, Young revealed in 2019 that his application was being delayed because of a “good morale character” clause. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	At the time, Young wrote on his website, “I have been told that I must do another test, due to my use of marijuana and how some people who smoke it have exhibited a problem.” He went on to cite an addition Trump's first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, made to the “good morale character” by-laws, cautioning that “certain marijuana related activities” could impact efforts to attain citizenship.


	Young went on to quip, “I sincerely hope I have exhibited good moral character and will be able to vote my conscience on Donald J. Trump and his fellow American candidates, (as yet un-named).”


	Despite the hiccup, Young was eventually successful, attaining his citizenship in January 2020. He celebrated with a photo of him registering to vote as a Democrat, captioned, “I'm happy to report I'm in!”

	But Trump's return to the White House, and his extreme crackdown on immigration — including the detainment and deportation of valid visa and green card holders — has instilled some new fears into Young. He's set to tour Europe this year, and has expressed concern that he could face issues upon returning to the U.S. because of his frequent criticism of Trump. 

	











	Hannah, however, is hopeful he won't face any issues, saying, “They've been detaining people who have green cards or visas — which is hideous and horrifying — but they have not, so far, been refusing to let American citizens back in the country, so I don't think that's going to happen.”

	Earlier today, the Who announced that they were parting ways with drummer Zak Starkey after three decades. Rumors swirled that the group were unhappy with his performance last month when they played a pair of Teenage Cancer Trust charity shows at London's Royal Albert Hall. In his first public statement since the group let him go, Starkey confirms this is indeed the case.


	“I'm very proud of my near thirty years with The Who,” Starkey tells Rolling Stone in a written statement. “Filling the shoes of my Godfather, ‘uncle Keith' has been the biggest honor and I remain their biggest fan. They've been like family to me. In January, I suffered a serious medical emergency with blood clots in my right bass drum calf. This is now completely healed and does not affect my drumming or running.”


	He continues: “After playing those songs with the band for so many decades, I'm surprised and saddened anyone would have an issue with my performance that night, but what can you do? I plan to take some much needed time off with my family, and focus on the release of Domino Bones by Mantra Of The Cosmos with Noel Gallagher in May and finishing my autobiography written solely by me. Twenty-nine years at any job is a good old run, and I wish them the best.”

	











	Starkey first entered the Who's orbit in 1994 when he backed Roger Daltrey on an American tour. Two years later, he joined the Who when the surviving members reunited for a tour celebrating their 1973 LP Quadrophenia.


			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“There were certain things that had to be in there, certain fills that had to be exactly the same because they are so Quadrophenia, if you know what I mean,” Starkey told Modern Drummer in 2006. “They are memorable fills. There aren't memorable parts, though, because everything Keith played kept changing. If you listen to ‘The Real Me,' you're not quite playing the same thing every time, ever. Every bar comes around again, but what he played was never the exact same thing.”

	The Who don't have a tour on the books, but they are playing a pair of shows in Italy in late July. They have yet to announce who will replace Starkey behind the kit at those gigs. One likely candidate is Scott Devours, who has been in Daltrey's solo band since 2009. He also toured with the Who in 2013 when Starkey was suffering from a tendon problem.

	Another possible pick is journeyman drummer Simon Phillips. He was Pete Townshend's go-to drummer on his Eighties solo albums and live shows, and he played in the Who on their 1989 reunion tour. When Starkey was unable to make a Who gig in 2000 due to his commitments with Johnny Marr and the Healers, Philips returned to the group for a single night. Townshend remains a huge admirer of his work and has recently expressed interest in working with him again.


	In a 2024 interview with Mojo, Townshend said that Daltrey was in charge of putting the Who's backing band together, and that he “wasn't 100% happy” with his picks. “I'd get Simon Phillips on drums and Pino Palladino on bass, and I'd dig ‘Rabbit' [keyboardist John Bundrick] out of his bed,” Townshend said. “And I'd get some fabulous shredding guitar player… but the problem is, they'd all be far, far superior musicians to me.”

Donald Trump's deportation agenda has drawn its focus around Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man the administration illegally shipped to an infamous torture prison in El Salvador — an action they admitted was a mistake, citing an “administrative error.” The Supreme Court has since ruled that the administration must bring him back to America, but Trump, his officials, and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele have indicated this won't be happening.


	Trump's team has since been arguing against the idea that they should have to follow due process and obey the courts, with Vice President J.D. Vance suggesting Tuesday night that the law and the courts should be secondary to ridding the nation of undocumented immigrants. Trump Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said Tuesday night that “under the due process that these Democrats so venerate for illegal invaders, it is legally impermissible for him to have one more minute in this country.”


	This is false, as are many of the other points Trump and his officials are making in support of their sending a man with no criminal record to a brutal prison in a nation that a federal judge had prohibited the United States from sending him to. Here are some of the biggest claims the administration are making about Abrego Garcia, and the reality of his case:

	











	“He's an MS-13 gang member classified as a terrorist that was removed from this country,” Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, said this morning on Fox News. “We got rid of a dangerous person, an El Salvador national, who was returned to the country of El Salvador — so he's home.”


	The Trump administration has repeatedly referred to Abrego Garcia as a dangerous criminal — but Abrego Garcia has never been charged with a crime, in the United States or El Salvador, a fact that his attorneys have repeatedly attested to in court filings. 


	The Trump administration and their supporters have presented no evidence in court or elsewhere to substantiate the claim that Abrego Garcia is, as Homan put it, a “public safety threat.”

	Trump officials have repeatedly described Abrego Garcia as a gang member, particularly a member of MS-13. J.D. Vance even called him a “convicted MS-13 gang member.”

	











	There is no actual evidence of this. 


	According to court documents, Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador around 2011 — at the age of 16 — after several years of Barrio 18 gang members having “stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents” into paying extortions to the gang in order to protect the family's pupusa business. 


	Garcia entered the U.S. without documentation, and he moved to Maryland to live with his brother, who had also fled threats from Barrio 18. In 2016, he met his now-wife, a U.S. citizen. In 2019, Abrego Garcia, who worked in construction, was arrested alongside three other men while soliciting work outside of Home Depot. The arresting officers accused Abrego Garcia of being a gang member and pressed him and the other men arrested to give up information on other gang members during interrogation. They later transferred him into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, where deportation proceedings were initiated.  


	In order to justify the detention and potential deportation, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted a Gang Field Interview Sheet (GFIS) to immigration court. According to Abrego Garcia's petition last month, the GFIS police submitted explained that “the only reason to believe Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was a gang member was that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique.” The “Western” clique of MS-13 “operates in Brentwood, Long Island, in New York, a state that Plaintiff Abrego Garcia has never lived in,” the petition read.

	The Trump administration has insisted that because two immigration judges denied Abrego Garcia bail during his 2019 detention and asylum proceedings, he is an adjudicated member of MS-13. An immigration judge ultimately ruled that Abrego Garcia — who has consistently denied any gang affiliation — had provided “credible responses to the questions asked,” that his “testimony was internally consistent, externally consistent with his asylum application and other documents, and appeared free of embellishment,” and that “he provided substantial documentation buttressing his claims” of persecution in El Salvador by Barrio 18, which continued to harass members of his family who fled to Guatemala. 


	The judge imposed a “withholding from removal” order, which prohibited his deportation to El Salvador.

	











	Trump classified MS-13 and other Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations through an executive order signed in January. The designation has been treated by the Trump administration as a one-stop shop to label any undesirable as a “terrorist” by accusing them of having gang affiliations. 


	Once again, Abrego Garcia has never been charged or convicted of a crime, gang-related or otherwise, but that hasn't stopped the Trump administration from describing him as an international terror suspect. 


	On Monday, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin directly compared Abrego Garcia to Osama bin Laden during an interview on Fox News. “The media would love for you to believe that [Kilmar Abrego Garcia] is a media darling, that he's just a Maryland father,” she said. “Well, Osama bin Laden was also a father and yet he wasn't a good guy, and they're actually both terrorists.” 


	In a filing submitted to the U.S. District Court for Maryland that same day, DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara wrote that Abrego Garcia's withholding from removal is invalid “because of his membership in MS-13, which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization.” 


	The government has never charged or convicted Abrego Garcia of any activity related to MS-13, nor have they offered any real proof that he was a member. Nevertheless, the Trump administration is calling him a terrorist.


	The Trump administration has characterized Abrego Garcia's deportation as justified, despite the lack of due process. “He was not mistakenly sent to El Salvador,” Stephen Miller said on Monday. “This was the right person sent to the right place.”


	In the 2019 court order granting Abrego Garcia protection from removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Judge David Jones noted that his request would have been subject to “mandatory denial” if it was proven that he had “participated in the persecution of others, has been convicted of a particularly serious crime, has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside of the U.S., or is a danger to U.S. national security.”


	DHS presented no evidence that would support such an accusation. 


	Despite the rhetoric from Miller and other top officials, the Trump administration has acknowledged in court filings that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported to El Salvador, chalking the mistake up to an “administrative error.”

	











	The courts have reviewed the evidence — or lack thereof — against Abrego Garcia, as well as the government's own admission that his deportation was a mistake, and instructed them to take steps to bring him back. 


	In a rare 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that a lower court had “properly” required “the government to ‘facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.” 


	The justices added that while the lower court had also required the Trump administration to “effectuate” such a return, the “scope of the term ‘effectuate' in the District Court's order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court's authority.” 


	The Trump administration has seized on this semantic concession — one with little actual effect on the court's opinion — to claim victory, alleging the Supreme Court ruled in their favor. On Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters in the Oval Office that the administration would only intervene to return Abrego Garcia if and when the Salvadoran government decides to give him up. Miller, meanwhile, argued that facilitating his return to the United States would be akin to “kidnapping” a citizen of El Salvador.


	Bondi's DOJ claimed in a statement last week: “As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs. By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.” 


	This is very clearly not the court's intent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the administration was essentially asking the court to grant them permission to “leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,” and that the “only argument the government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.” 


	Sotomayor noted that the federal government regularly works with other countries to “facilitate” the return of a migrant or alien to the United States for the purpose of adjudicating immigration proceedings. “The government's argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,” she wrote. 

	











	The Trump administration has implied that it doesn't have any legal right to bring Abrego Garcia back. J.D. Vance wrote that it would be tantamount to “invad[ing] El Salvador” to retrieve him.

	The Trump administration literally entered into a contractual financial agreement regarding the treatment and holding of Abrego Garcia and the hundreds of other prisoners sent to prison in El Salvador alongside him. While the Trump administration is now claiming its agreement with El Salvador is “classified” and may be a “State Secret,” as conservative writer Andrew McCarthy explained in a piece for the National Review earlier this week, Abrego Garcia remains in “constructive custody” of the U.S. government. The administration should be fully able to comply with the Supreme Court's order to bring him back. 


	There's also the fact that it's highly unlikely Bukele would put up any resistance if Trump actually pushed him to give up Abrego Garcia — given the U.S. is paying his country millions to imprison people. “I miss you already, President T,” the Salvadoran president wrote after leaving the White House on Monday.

Follow:


            The Internal Revenue Service is making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, according to two sources familiar with the matter, which would be an extraordinary step of retaliation as the Trump administration seeks to turn up pressure on the university that has defied its demands to change its hiring and other practices.
    


            A final decision on rescinding the university's tax exemption is expected soon, the sources said.
    


            The administration already has blocked more than $2 billion in funding from the nation's oldest university, which is fighting the White House's policy demands, citing the constitutional right of private universities to determine their own teaching practices.
    


            President Donald Trump in recent days raised the idea of punishing the Ivy League university for not complying with what the administration has sought to portray as a campaign to fight antisemitism.
    


            “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?' Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.
    


            An attorney for Harvard didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a bureau, for comment.
    


Gary Shapley, whom Trump this week picked as acting IRS commissioner, has the authority to rescind the tax exemption under federal law. Doing so typically comes after the agency has made a determination that an organization has violated the rules that govern tax exemptions for not-for-profit entities.
    


            Not-for-profit organizations that benefit from the tax exemption can lose it if they violate a number of rules, including for political activity.
    


            But a rescission would be a rare move by the IRS.
    


            In the 1980s, the agency revoked the tax exemption of a Christian college that the IRS determined had used a racially discriminatory admissions policy.
    


            R. William Snyder, accounting and taxes professor at George Mason University's Costello College of Business, told CNN, “To my knowledge, this is the first time an administration has tried something like this.”
    


            Snyder added: “The whole purpose of higher education is to educate the masses. Just because they educate in a way that you don't like, is that grounds to terminate their tax-exempt status? I'd say no.”
    


            It's unclear whether the IRS is considering such a move for other universities.
    


            The Trump administration has threatened numerous colleges across the US with funding cuts if changes in school policy weren't made, and Harvard's resistance appears to mark the first time an elite university has rebuked the White House over those demands.
    


            Trump on Truth Social on Wednesday escalated his attacks on the school, calling it a “joke” and saying it should no longer receive federal funds.

            US Sen. Chris Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador Wednesday that he was unable to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia in the maximum-security mega-prison where he is being held.
    


            Instead, the Democrat announced he met with the Salvadoran vice president and vowed to “keep pressing” for answers and the man's release.
    


            “There will be more members of Congress coming,” Van Hollen said in an emotional media availability. “This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, so it cannot continue.”
    


            The March deportation of Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, has become a flashpoint in the fight over the Trump administration's hardline deportation push. The administration conceded in court filings that it had mistakenly deported the father of three to El Salvador last month as part of its recent deportation flights to the Central American nation, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.
    


            Van Hollen said he specifically asked Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa if he could meet with Abrego Garcia or at least speak with him over the phone or via video conferencing. Again, Van Hollen said the request was denied.
    


            Pressed on whether he had concerns about the man's health, Van Hollen said: “I don't know about his health status which is why I wanted to meet with him directly.”

What to know about Abrego Garcia's deportation case



            The senator's trip swiftly drew the ire of the White House.
    


            Communications director Steven Cheung called Van Hollen “a complete disgrace” and the Office of Communications accused the senator in a statement of a lack of concern regarding crimes they say were committed by undocumented immigrants against his constituents. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes in the United States.
    


            While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error.
    


            In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. US officials have alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward.
    


            The Wednesday meeting, Van Hollen said, started with a “point of agreement” that the countries should work together to “crack down” on gangs like MS-13. However, he said the case of Abrego Garcia “does not have to do with MS-13.”
    


            Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return, White House officials have argued it's up to El Salvador whether to do so. The Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele made clear during an Oval Office meeting earlier this week that the Maryland man wouldn't be returned to the US.
    


            Bukele said during the meeting that while he has the power to release Abrego Garcia, he wasn't willing to do so.
    


            Officials in the Oval Office meeting, including President Donald Trump, made no effort to ask for his cooperation in the matter.
    


            Van Hollen said Wednesday that the Salvadoran vice president had echoed comments made by Bukele at the White House that El Salvador “can't smuggle” Abrego Garcia to the US.
    


            “I said I am not asking him to smuggle Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States, I am simply asking him to open the door of CECOT and let this innocent man walk out,” the senator said.

‘The Great Moose Migration' is inspiring mega-fans to slow down and follow the unlikely hit Swedish TV show.

Before Swedish slow TV hit “The Great Moose Migration” began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals so she doesn't miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.

“Sleep? Forget it. I don't sleep,” she said.

Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called “ Den stora älgvandringen ” in Swedish, and sometimes translated as “The Great Elk Trek” in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.

The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.

From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the Ångerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.

Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.

“I feel relaxed, but at the same time I'm like, ‘Oh, there's a moose. Oh, what if there's a moose? I can't go to the toilet!'” said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.










“The Great Moose Migration” is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.

The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a “ fish doorbell ” on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.

Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jönköping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.

“It became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,” she said. “But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.”

As an expert and a fan of “The Great Moose Migration,” Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.

“This is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,” she said.





The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for “The Great Moose Migration.”

“Everyone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,” he said.

The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.

The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT's control room in Umeå, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.

SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.

Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as “King of the Forest.” A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).

Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.

“We actually don't see it very often. You often see it when you're out driving maybe once or twice in your life,” Erhag said. “I think that's one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone's living room.”

Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.

“You can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,” she said.





After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.

The push alert hits SVT's app — “Första älgarna i bild!” which translates to “First moose on camera!” — as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.

”I would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: ‘Go on! Yes, you can do it!'” Malmgren said.

Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible. Some viewers on Tuesday posted photos of their dogs and cats staring at their televisions, enthralled by the moose on the screen.

“I was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, ‘What, you saw moose in the city?' And I was like, ‘No, it's on the TV,'” Garp Liljefors said ahead of Tuesday's showing.

Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.

“When someone asks me, ‘What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it's the great migration,'” she said. “They know.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D.-Md., discusses the debt ceiling stalemate and President Biden's re-election bid as scrutiny over his age soars. 

FIRST ON FOX: Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen drew wide rebuke for his sudden trip to El Salvador, during which he hopes to bring back deported Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Garcia is currently imprisoned in the South American country – and President Nayib Bukele indicated it would be ""preposterous"" to try to send him back to the U.S.

Van Hollen made waves Wednesday morning when he posted a selfie-video before flying to San Salvador, and calling the goal of his ""mission"" to let both countries' governments know he won't stop fighting until Garcia returns to Maryland.

Rep. Andy Harris, the lone Republican in the Old Line State's delegation, slammed Van Hollen and contrasted the situation with Rachel Morin – who was murdered by an illegal immigrant found guilty Monday in Bel Air.

BONDI DEFIANT, SAYS ABREGO GARCIA WILL STAY IN EL SALVADOR: ‘END OF THE STORY'

""The most striking… double standard, is that Rachel Morin, who was a constituent of mine, was brutally murdered by an illegal alien from El Salvador,"" Harris said.

""And Chris Van Hollen is not spending much time on that issue, but he's taking time to go to El Salvador to bring back a citizen of El Salvador to the United States who had entered the country illegally and which an immigration court… found evidence that he was an MS-13 gang member.""

Van Hollen did release a print statement after Morin's killer was convicted, saying he was grateful to law enforcement and calling for ""meaningful action"" to reform ""our broken immigration system.""

""We can do this while also supporting our immigrant communities and respecting the rights of individuals who are here legally – I am committed to doing both, and I will continue pressing my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move forward on this issue,"" Van Hollen said.

DOJ INDICATES TRUMP ADMIN NOT OBLIGATED TO RETURN MAN DEPORTED TO EL SALVADOR, PUSHING BACK ON JUDICIARY

White House communications director Steven Cheung mocked Van Hollen ""and his bedwetting friends"" for showing ""more concern and sympathy for an illegal MS-13 gang member than victims of horrific migrant crimes.""

Van Hollen previously had a mixed voting record on the illegal immigration issue.

He voted against the Laken Riley Act in January and publicly objected to the first Trump administration deporting two Salvadoran men in 2017 who were scholastic soccer stars.

""Shame on President Trump for tearing apart hardworking immigrant families. We should be focused on MS-13, not scholarship winners,"" he said.

Harris said efforts to ""repatriate"" Garcia to Maryland are also factually misguided.

""This gentleman has already been repatriated – back to El Salvador; the country of his citizenship. That is where he belongs.""

""Rachel Morin, in fact, was a Maryland woman; This gentleman is not a Maryland man,"" he said, in reference to how Garcia has been described in the press. ""We should probably worry about our own citizens before we worry about citizens of other countries.""

Harris also lamented expending taxpayer funds for the trip, ""to bring a citizen of a foreign country who entered America illegally back into the United States.""

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., took criticisms a step further, suggesting Van Hollen may be ""flirting with treason"" and saying Garcia is already ""home, in El Salvador.""

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also cited Morin's murder in their rebuke of Van Hollen, claiming he has done more to bring ""a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker and illegal alien back to Maryland"" than he has to advocate for victims of gang violence.

Van Hollen's stance did receive one prominent Maryland defender, with Gov. Wes Moore telling Fox News Digital, ""We can be pro-public safety and pro-Constitution at the same time.""

""We support Sen. Chris Van Hollen's efforts to check on his health and safety and bring peace of mind to Kilmar's family in Maryland – his wife, their 5-year-old child, and his two stepchildren, all who are U.S. citizens.""

""Despite a unanimous Supreme Court decision, Trump is refusing to return Kilmar and is now even threatening to deport U.S. citizens to El Salvador.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection appears to be contradicting President Donald Trump's comments on the daily revenue generated by his latest slate of tariffs.

The agency said in a statement to CNBC on Monday, ""Since April 5, CBP has collected over $500 million under the new reciprocal tariffs, contributing to more than $21 billion in total tariff revenue from 15 presidential trade actions implemented since Jan 20, 2025.""

The update comes after a 10-hour glitch in the finance system prevented U.S. importers from inputting a code that would have exempted freight that was already on the water from being subject to the higher duties.

""Even during the brief glitch, CBP's average $250 million/day revenue stream remained uninterrupted,"" CBP said in its statement.

Trump has repeatedly said the United States is taking in $2 billion per day from tariffs, including revenues directly resulting from his so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

The most recent data released Monday by the Treasury Department shows the department's daily statement of total deposits listed under ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" as $305 million. All tariffs are collected by U.S. Customs at the point of entry.

In early April, the Trump administration imposed steep tariffs on dozens of countries. Hours later, it temporarily lowered most tariff rates to a universal 10%, except for tariffs on China, which it ratcheted up. Meanwhile, the administration maintained sector-specific tariffs on the automotive industry and is expected to announced new trade policies for the pharmaceutical industry.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains under pressure as macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on its price action. After making a strong bounce from the local bottom near $75,000 on April 7 and 9, analysts are beginning to question whether BTC could be gearing up for a reversal of the downward trend that's persisted since the start of the year.

For some, like the veteran trader Peter Brandt, this trendline is nothing but hopium. As he noted in his X post,

Others, however, see more reason for cautious optimism. Analyst Kevin Svenson highlighted a possible weekly RSI breakout, pointing out that “Once confirmed, weekly RSI breakout signals have proven to be among the most reliable macro breakout indicators.” 

Ultimately, price is driven by supply and demand—and while both sides of the equation are beginning to show subtle signs of recovery, they are yet to reach the levels needed for a proper breakout. Furthermore, the bulls must cut through a dense sell wall near $86,000 to confirm the reversal. 

Bitcoin demand — Are there early signs of recovery?

According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin's apparent demand — measured by the 30-day net difference between exchange inflows and outflows — is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained dip into negative territory.

However, the analysts caution against prematurely declaring a trend reversal. Looking back to the 2021 cycle peak, similar conditions occurred: demand remained low or negative for months, prices temporarily stabilized or rebounded, and true structural recovery only followed extended consolidation. 

This current uptick in demand may simply mark a pause in selling pressure—not a definitive bottom sign. Time and confirmation are still needed to confirm a shifting momentum.

From a trader's perspective, the apparent demand metric does not look optimistic just yet. Bitcoin daily trade volumes currently hover around 30,000 BTC (spot) and 400,000 BTC (derivatives), according to CryptoQuant. This is, respectively, 6x and 3x less compared to the June-July 2021 period that preceded the last bull run of the 2019-2022 cycle. Despite hopeful comparisons of the current price dip to that period, current volume dynamics suggest a more subdued trader appetite.

Institutional investors confirm the low demand trend. Since April 3, the spot BTC ETFs have recorded continuous outflows totaling over $870 million, with the first modest inflow not occurring until April 15. Despite this, trading volumes remain relatively high — only 18% below the 30-day average — indicating that some investor appetite for Bitcoin persists.

Bitcoin supply — Will liquidity return?

On the supply side, liquidity remains weak. According to Glassnode's recent report, the realized cap growth has slowed to 0.80% per month (from 0.83% previously). This points to a continued lack of meaningful new capital entering the Bitcoin network and, as Glassnode notes, “remains well below typical bull market thresholds.”

Furthermore, the BTC balance on exchanges — often used to gauge available sell-side liquidity — has dropped to just 2.6 million BTC, the lowest level since November 2018.

Yet, on a broader macroeconomic level, some analysts see reasons for cautious hope. Independent market analyst Michael van de Poppe pointed out the quickly rising M2 Supply, which, with a certain lag (here 12 weeks), has often influenced Bitcoin price in the past.



Even if bullish momentum and demand returns, Bitcoin will need to clear a critical resistance zone between $86,300 and $86,500, as shown on CoinGlass' liquidity heatmap, which maps dense clusters of buy and sell orders at different levels.

Alphractal adds another layer of insight through its Alpha Price Chart, which incorporates realized cap, average cap, and onchain sentiment — and comes to the same conclusion. According to the chart, BTC must decisively break above $86,300 to restore short-term bullish sentiment. If the price weakens again, support levels lie at $73,900 and $64,700.

Overall, calling a trend reversal at this stage may be premature. Liquidity remains thin, macroeconomic headwinds persist, and investors remain cautious. Still, Bitcoin's resilience above $80,000 signals strong support from long-term holders. A decisive breakout above $86,300 could shift market sentiment—and, in a best-case scenario, ignite a new rally. For such a move to be meaningful, however, it must be backed by spot market volume, not just leverage-driven activity.

Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 50% over the past year, eroding investor confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, crypto analysts suggest that ETH's fortunes might be about to turn.

Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), ETH has not significantly benefited from the bullish developments of 2024. While the approval of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) opened the floodgates for institutional capital to flow into the top digital asset, ETH ETFs have failed to generate the same level of interest.

Moreover, ETH's underperformance relative to BTC has only deepened. Crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared the following two-week ETH/BTC chart showing how ETH has consistently broken through key high time-frame support levels against BTC over the past few years.

Currently, ETH is trading at levels not seen since 2020 relative to BTC. According to the analyst, the final major ETH/BTC support lies around 0.016 – nearly 20% below the current level of 0.019.

On a more optimistic note, fellow analyst Ted pointed out that ETH may be breaking out of a downward-sloping trendline on the two-hour chart. He commented:

Global markets are gaining some strength, so expect Ethereum to hold the $1,550-$1,600 level. For now, I'm hoping for a breakout above and close above $1,670 for a rally towards $2K.

Similarly, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH appears poised to break out from an ascending triangle pattern on the weekly time frame. According to him, ETH is currently trading at the bottom of the structure and could be setting up to test the top of the formation around $3,600.

For the uninitiated, the ascending triangle is a continuation pattern that forms when price makes higher lows while facing resistance at a horizontal level, eventually creating a triangle shape. It signals building buying pressure, and a breakout above the resistance line often leads to a strong upward move.

While the analysts above point to a potential bullish reversal for ETH, crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that over 368,000 ETH has been sent to exchanges since the beginning of the month. A rise in exchange reserves for a digital asset is typically bearish news, as it indicates that holders may be looking to sell their assets in the near-term. 

Additionally, even if ETH has already bottomed for this market cycle, it still faces strong resistance around the $2,300 mark. At press time, ETH trades at $1,612, down 2.7% over the past 24 hours.

Securities Lawsuit","https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20250416dc66448/game-of-silks-nft-investors-have-opportunity-to-lead-game-of-silks-inc-securities-lawsuit","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 18:36:00 GMT","

PR Newswire

NEW YORK, April 16, 2025

NEW YORK, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ --



 



Why: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Game of Silks non-fungible tokens (""NFTs""), including Silks Avatar NFTs, Silks Horse NFTs, and Silks Land NFTs, and who were damaged thereby, of the important April 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

So what: If you purchased Game of Silks NFTs you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

What to do next: To join the Game of Silks class action, go to  https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, Game of Silks created a metaverse  game that brought real-life horse racing to the blockchain, allowing users to invest in virtual versions of real racehorses and earn money based on the real-world performance of those horses. The complaint further alleges that the Game of Silks NFTs, which were first sold beginning in April 2022, are securities as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act""), and as such required registration statements, which were never filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Game of Silks violated the Securities Act by selling and soliciting the sale of unregistered Game of Silks NFT securities.

Further, the complaint also alleges that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions in connection with the sale of the Game of Silks NFTs, including failing to disclose critical financial information about Game of Silks' business model and sustainability.

To join the Game of Silks class action, go to  https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

In an eleventh-hour scramble before a key contract was set to expire on Tuesday night, the United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency renewed its funding for the longtime software-vulnerability-tracking project known as the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program. Managed by the nonprofit research-and-development group MITRE, the CVE Program is a linchpin of global cybersecurity—providing critical data and services for digital defense and research.

The CVE Program is governed by a board that sets an agenda and priorities for MITRE to carry out using CISA's funding. A CISA spokesperson said on Wednesday that the contract with MITRE is being extended for 11 months. “The CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA,” they said in a statement. “Last night, CISA executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services. We appreciate our partners' and stakeholders' patience.”

MITRE's vice president and director of the Center for Securing the Homeland, Yosry Barsoum, said in a statement on Wednesday that “CISA identified incremental funding to keep the Programs operational.” With the clock ticking down before this decision came out, though, some members of the CVE Program's board announced a plan to transition the project into a new nonprofit entity called the CVE Foundation.

“Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a US government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract. While this structure has supported the program's growth, it has also raised long-standing concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor,” the Foundation wrote in a statement. “This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025, letter from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the US government does not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for this possibility.”

It is unclear who from the current CVE board is affiliated with the new initiative other than Kent Landfield, a longtime cybersecurity industry member who was quoted in the CVE Foundation statement. The CVE Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment.

CISA did not respond to questions from WIRED about why the fate of the CVE Program contract had been in question and whether it was related to recent budget cuts sweeping the federal government as mandated by the Trump administration.

Researchers and cybersecurity professionals were relieved on Wednesday that the CVE Program hadn't suddenly ceased to exist as the result of unprecedented instability in US federal funding. And many observers expressed cautious optimism that the incident could ultimately make the CVE Program more resilient if it transitions to be an independent entity that isn't reliant on funding from any one government or other single source.

“The CVE Program is critical, and it's in everyone's interest that it succeed,"" says Patrick Garrity, a security researcher at VulnCheck. “Nearly every organization and every security tool is dependent on this information, and it's not just the US. It's consumed globally. So it's really, really important that it continues to be a community-provided service, and we need to figure out what to do about this, because losing it would be a risk to everyone.”

Federal procurement records indicate that it costs in the tens of millions of dollars per contract to run the CVE Program. But in the scheme of the losses that can occur from a single cyberattack exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, experts tell WIRED, the operational costs seem negligible versus the benefit to US defense alone.

Despite CISA's last-minute funding, the future of the CVE Program is still unclear for the long term. As one source, who requested anonymity because they are a federal contractor, put it: “It's all so stupid and dangerous.”

The United States Tennis Association has been working with IMG on its broadcast rights since 2011.

Sports marketing heavyweight agency IMG has extended and expanded its media rights tie-up with the United States Tennis Association (USTA) in a multi-year deal.

Under the deal, IMG will represent and advise the USTA on domestic and international media rights covering the annual US Open hard-court grand slam tournament in New York.


                        The gold standard of business intelligence.
                    


                            Find out more
                            





Overall, the US tennis body has been working with IMG since 2011 on increasing its international rights revenues and fan growth. The last deal between the two parties began in 2017 and runs through to the end of this year's US Open in September (that tie-up specifically excludes the Americas).

In terms of current media rights agreements covering the New York event, sports broadcasting heavyweight ESPN covers the tournament across the US, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean, via a long-term contract running through the 2037 edition starting next year (this domestic element represents the expansion part of this latest deal).

Other notable broadcasters set to cover this year's championships include heavyweight Sky (UK, Italy, Germany), Warner Bros. Discovery across Europe as a whole, BeIN Sports across the Middle East and North Africa, and Eclat in 15 Asian territories.

In terms of its tennis rights stable, IMG also has media rights deals in place with top-tier properties such as the men's ATP and women's WTA global tours, as well as other grand slam tournaments at Wimbledon (UK) and Roland-Garros (France).

Overall, tennis is one of the sports the agency is most established. It also owns two top-tier events on both the ATP and WTA, in Madrid and Miami, although it was reported last week that the agency is close to selling the rights to those two tournaments to a group led by Endeavor chief executive and co-founder Ari Emanuel.

Ed Mallaburn, senior vice president of sports management at IMG, has said: ""The US Open has grown into one of the world's most engaging and exciting sporting events, capturing the attention of audiences of all ages, spanning far beyond tennis and sports fans. The USTA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible onsite and onscreen, and we couldn't be prouder to continue to support such a bold and innovative rightsholder.""

Kirsten Corio, the USTA's chief commercial officer, added: ""IMG has been an integral part of the US Open's growth, ensuring that it reaches core fans and new audiences across the world through innovative local and regional media distribution partnerships. We are thrilled to extend the relationship with IMG.""

This year's US Open – including the week of qualifying before the main tournament – will run between August 18 and September 7.

	Plot details are being kept under wraps, but the film is described as a broad party comedy adventure that transports the film's protagonists to a long-forgotten, magical island rooted in Philippine mythology.


	Joel Crawford (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, The Croods 2) will direct and write the project with Januel Mercado. Crawford's longtime collaborator Mark Swift will produce. The duo were previously nominated for a slew of awards, including the Oscar, for their critically acclaimed Puss in Boots sequel, which played in theaters in 2022.

	











Forgotten Island marks Mercado's first full directing credit after getting a co-directing credit on Puss in Boots 2. He was also head of story for Crawford's The Croods 2.

	Led by Margie Cohn, DreamWorks Animation has been on a winning streak between such films as The Bad Guys and The Wild Robot. The studio's upcoming slate also includes a live-action remake of How to Train Your Dragon — a screening of the summer film at CinemaCon was a highlight of the show earlier this month — The Bad Guys 2, Gabby's Dollhouse: The Movie, Shrek 5 and the live-action How to Train Your Dragon 2.

	We have a cause of death for former Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Gossip Girl star Michelle Trachtenberg. 


	Following a review of laboratory test results, it was determined that Trachtenberg died naturally as a result of complications from diabetes mellitus, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner told Deadline in a statement. 


	Trachtenberg was found unresponsive in her midtown Manhattan apartment on February 26. Paramedics pronounced her dead at the scene. No foul was suspected. She was 39.

	The coroner's office initially said her cause of death would remain undetermined because the family had requested that no autopsy be conducted because of religious reasons. The medical examiner's office would automatically do an autopsy if foul play or criminality was suspected, but there was none, so the office did not overrule the family's decision. Following the lab test results, the medical examiner's office amended the cause of death.

	Trachtenberg was a lifelong actor who made her television debut in commercials at age 3 before landing a recurring role as Lily Montgomery on the long-running soap opera All My Children. She gained further recognition while starring in Nickelodeon's The Adventures of Pete & Pete and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for her role in Discovery children's series Truth or Scare before landing her breakout feature lead as Harriet M. Welsch in the 1996 Paramount film Harriet the Spy, based on the classic children's novel.


	Trachtenberg joined Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the cult WB fantasy series' fifth season in 2000 as Dawn Summers, the younger sister to Sarah Michelle Gellar's Buffy. She went on to appear in the 2004 cult comedy EuroTrip and Disney sports drama Ice Princess. In 2008, she joined the cast of Gossip Girl as Georgina Sparks, the manipulative and unpredictable troublemaker who frequently threw the lives of the Upper East Side elite into chaos. Around that same time, she also starred opposite Zac Efron and Matthew Perry in Warner Bros' comedy 17 Again.


	Her most recent television work included guest appearances on series such as House, Weeds, NCIS: Los Angeles, and Sleepy Hollow. She also lent her voice to animated projects, including Robot Chicken, most recently reprising in Max's Gossip Girl sequel series in 2023.

			By Justin Kroll, Mike Fleming Jr 


EXCLUSIVE: To no one's surprise, David O. Russell's film about legendary coach and broadcaster John Madden is lining up another all-star ensemble as Deadline is hearing John Mulaney, Kathryn Hahn and Sienna Miller are all in talks to join Madden for Amazon MGM Studios. 


	They join Nicolas Cage, who will portray the iconic sports figure, and Christian Bale, who will play the late Raiders owner Al Davis. When deals close, Mulaney will play Trip Hawkins, who founded EA Sports and was a driving force in behind the Madden NFL video games; Hahn will play Madden's wife, Virginia; and Miller will play Davis' wife, Carol. Russell is directing with Escape Artists' Todd Black producing.

	











	Amazon MGM Studios had no comment.

	Production is set to start next month in Atlanta with Russell directing from a script he wrote, following an earlier version by Cambron Clark. Black is producing through his Escape Artists banner along with partners Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch, and Jonathan Shukat alongside Russell and Matthew Budman. Escape Artists' David Bloomfield will executive produce.


	The film is about the unlikely path that took Madden from Super Bowl-winning Oakland Raiders head coach to the brains and brand behind Madden NFL. That paved the way for his rise to become arguably the greatest broadcaster the NFL has ever seen.

	Oscar-nominated director Russell's films always have drawn high-profile talent, and this one is no different. For Bale, this marks the fourth time the two have worked together, having collaborated on Amsterdam, American Hustle and The Fighter, which won Bale his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.


	As for Mulaney, this marks one of the bigger acting roles for the multi-talented host, comedian and writer who has been on a roll as of late because of his hit Netflix talk show Everyone's Live with John Mulaney. The three-time Emmy winner's show has been a hit since premiering in March, but this role will give Mulaney a real opportunity to show his range as an actor and add another checkmark to his long list of accomplishments.


	Hahn has been busy lately with back-to-back hit TV series starting with her Disney+ and Marvel series Agatha All Along, which has played well since it premiered in the fall. She can be seen in the Apple TV+ series The Studio, which has earned her rave reviews since its premiere last month.

	











	Miller is no stranger to working with top-tier directors including Clint Eastwood, Bennett Miller and most recently Kevin Costner on his western epic Horizon: An American Saga. She also recently played herself on the final season of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm. 


	Mulaney is repped by WME and attorney Isaac Dunham; Hahn is repped by Gersh and Lighthouse Management and Media; and Miller is repped by WME, United Agents and LBI Entertainment.

“We are all Icelanders!”

So proclaimed Jerry (David Patrick Kelly) in the “Cooper's Dream” episode of the original “Twin Peaks” back in 1990. Like much in writer/director David Lynch's life and art, it was both exaggeration and truth.

Exhibit A: At Reykjavik's vibrant Stockfish Film Festival on April 10, a panel titled “David Lynch and Surrealism in Film and Shorts” celebrated the work and worldview of the late auteur, who died January 16 at age 78. The nonprofit Stockfish fest focused its dynamic 11th edition on filmmaking issues relevant to the always-cool city at the top of the world, Reykjavik, as well as highlights of global cinema, and, in a centerpiece of the 10-day festival, a Lynch-a-thon that brought out Icelandic cineastes.

The celebration at Reykjavik's cozy arthouse theater BioParadis — translated from Icelandic as “Cinema Paradise” — was, to use a phrase the “Mulholland Drive” director loved, a gas. The event began with a showing of the doc “David Lynch: The Art Life” (2016), followed by screenings of his proto-stylistic shorts from the late 1960s and early '70s, from “The Alphabet” (1968) starring Lynch's first wife, Peggy, to “The Amputee” (1974), shot by “Blue Velvet” and “Eraserhead” DP Frederick Elmes and starring Catherine E. Coulson, later the “Twin Peaks” Log Lady.

A panel discussion followed, as did an unveiling of an in-memoriam bust (complete with dramatic swoop of well-coiffed hair) by Icelandic artist Klaudia Karolina Kaczmarek.

Panelists included longtime producing veteran Sigurjón Sighvatsson (“Basquiat,” “Brothers”), an executive producer of “Wild at Heart”; Stockfish guest of honor Floria Sigismondi, an esteemed music video director (for David Bowie, The White Stripes, and Björk; the film “The Runaways”); and Icelandic screenwriter and poet Sjon.

“David made the surreal real, and that's why he appeals to so many people — what we normally wouldn't see because it's too surreal, he made relatable,” said Sighvatsson. “His trajectories, unique as they were, somehow always fell away and put us all on his wavelength.”

Said Sjon, “When I first saw ‘Eraserhead,' I remember coming out of the theater with some friends and saying, ‘Seeing this film will change us.' The most recent time I saw it, I showed it to my teenagers because I wanted something artistic to happen to them. Maybe because I was watching it with my family, I realized that ‘Eraserhead' is a story about a family — it's about a man not ready to be a father, his complicated relationship with his in-laws, his terror at having a child, his horrible job in a horrible industrial place. There is something about the simplicity of Lynch's plots that's so compelling. He sort of tricks us into joining him.”

 










“And after seeing ‘Eraserhead,' the kids are doing OK, don't worry!” Sjon added.

Sigismondi noted that she felt Lynch's audiences and characters share a sense of knowing full well the strange terrain they're in, and then reacting to it as if the strangeness were perfectly normal.

“In ‘Wild at Heart,' when Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern's characters are driving at night and see a car crash, they stop with a kind of eerie feeling between them, but in the way that Lynch does, the scene also has a bit of humor,” said Sigismondi. “Then, Sherilyn Fenn's character comes out of the wreck scratching her head, all confused, and Lynch lingers on this moment — and in that mixture of dark comedy and strangeness, we get the sense that the characters know there's something going on, maybe even knowing it before it happens. That's one way Lynch guides us through this foreboding that we, and his characters, know is imminent.”

“That was one of his many strengths — if you think about how incredibly odd or uncomfortable or surreal the things he brought to the screen were, he packaged it in a way that it kind of popped for so many people,” added Sigismondi.

 










But Lynch's stories' mysteries — going back to his work at art schools in Washington, D.C., Boston, and finally the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where his paintings, multimedia artworks, and short films began — have an inevitability that Sjon described as an anchor in Lynch's work.

“It was interesting to watch his short films before this panel, because in these works we saw that the mystery of things, whatever it is, is already there — the possibility of it is always at the ready,” said Sjon. “One of my favorite scenes in a Lynch film is the ‘Lost Highway' party scene when the mystery man [played by Robert Blake] starts talking to the main character [played by Bill Pullman] and asks him to call his own house, where the mystery man somehow also is. We witness at that moment the breaking down of time and space, the blurring of reality and dreaming, in a very simple context. Everything's normal up to the point when the man says, ‘Call this number.' We realize the mystery was there in the reality, always ready to happen.”

Sigismondi made the connection between that inevitability aspect to Lynch's stories and his practice of Transcendental Meditation, which she discovered through his 2006 book “Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.” (Lynch had been a devotee of the technique since the early 1970s and started the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace in 2005.)

 










“Lynch never liked to explain what he was doing, in any of his artistic expressions,” said Sigismondi. “His films were simultaneously plot-driven and also, of course, deeply dreamlike — such a great melding. In his meditation advice, he would often talk about going deep within yourself, then going into the ‘unified field' to bring ideas back, and how when we're all in that mental space, it's like the collective consciousness. ‘Bringing things back' could mean something different to everyone; we all have our own interpretations. It didn't necessarily mean creativity. He never felt a need to lay it all out.”

Afterward, appreciating the Lynch bust in the lobby of the BioParadis, the panelists noted that for all of Lynch's surrealist non sequiturs, opaque dark visions, explosions of violence, and deadpan moments that warp Americana norms, what stood out most for them was the director's humanity, and endless curiosity about his fellow humans.

“‘The Straight Story,' from 1999, is an important Lynch film in that regard,” said Sjon. “There, he allowed us to really see his human heart absolutely naked and beating, and this is the heart that is at the center of all of his films, no matter how dark they may become. Angelo Badalamenti's lush scores were also vital for him in that way, too, … [helping to] underline that humanity as much as it does the mystery.”

 










“People often miss the humanity in David's work — they jump to the surrealism,” said Sighvatsson. “But one of my favorite scenes of his is the final scene in ‘Wild at Heart,' when Sailor is running after Lulu. Talk about romantic! You hardly ever hear the words ‘David Lynch' and ‘romantic' together, but even the short films shown here had that in them to a degree.”

“In his meditation videos and social media posts, and in life, Lynch was so articulate about very complicated things, and so willing to share his insights,” said Sigismondi.

Lynch — who visited Reykjavik in 2009 at the invitation of Sighvatsson and the Icelandic TM Foundation to teach a (very well-attended) meditation class for free — may have riffed on Iceland in “Twin Peaks,” but he and the Land of Fire and Ice had a special connection.

When asked by an audience member at the end of the panel what advice they had for Icelandic filmmakers, Sighvatsson's was as straightforward as a serving of pie and coffee: “Be more like Lynch.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:rollingstone.com","Fyre Fest 2 Postponed, Obviously","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/fyre-festival-2-postponed-1235314323/","Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:36:46 GMT","


	Shocking absolutely no one: Fyre Festival 2 is not happening.


	Organizers for the fest announced that it had been “postponed” in a message sent to ticket holders Wednesday, April 16, per ABC News. 


	“The event has been postponed and a new date will be announced,” the message read. “We have issued you a refund. Once the new date is announced, at that time, you can repurchase if it works for your schedule.”


	The exact reasons for the postponement are unclear, and a rep for the fest did not immediately return a request for comment. Fyre Fest 2 was supposed to take place May 30 to June 2 on Isla Mujeres in Mexico, with tickets going on sale in February (despite pushback from local officials).


	The sequel to the disastrous 2017 festival — which landed founder and organizer Billy McFarland in prison on fraud charges — was set to offer attendees “boundary-pushing excursions by day” and “intimate beach-side performances at night.” The lineup was set to feature “international and local talent,” but no artists were ever announced.

	McFarland previously pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the disastrous first Fyre Festival and was released from prison in 2022 after serving less than four years.


	Unfazed by his punishment, McFarland announced Fyre Fest 2 in August 2023, putting tickets on sale to gullible festivalgoers before he even detailed the date, location, or lineup. “Guys, this is your chance to get in,” McFarland said at the end of the clip. “This is everything I've been working towards — let's fucking go.”


	The 2023 sequel did not happen, obviously. Then, earlier this year, McFarland reemerged with vague plans for a 2025 Fyre Fest 2, this time with a date and potential locations in Mexico: Isla Mujeres — whose tourist board denied the fest was happening there, and Playa Del Carmen, whose government also said that no Fyre Fest 2 was planned. 


	Yet, tickets again went on sale, with “Ignite” and “Fuego” packages ranging from $1,100 to $5,000 (neither provided airfare or accommodations; “There are dozens of hotels and many rental villas available in Playa Del Carmen,” organizers suggested), while the “Phoenix” package was priced at $25,000.

	McFarland claimed that the event had 1,800 confirmed guests and that its lineup would feature rappers, DJs, pilots, creators, and athletes, but did not share who would actually be attending.


	“I'm sure many people think I'm crazy for doing this again,” McFarland said at the time. “But I feel I'd be crazy not to do it again. After years of reflection and now thoughtful planning, the new team and I have amazing plans for Fyre 2.”
