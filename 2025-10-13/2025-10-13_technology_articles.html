Speaking on TechCrunch's StrictlyVC Download podcast earlier this year, Industry Ventures founder and CEO Hans Swildens said that tech buyout funds now account for 25% of all liquidity in the entire venture ecosystem — “a huge chunk of liquidity,” he said. Swildens explained that venture managers are being forced to adapt their approach. “Just going out and seeing companies, putting them in your fund and then waiting for an IPO or strategic M&A exit probably won't work anymore,” he said in the podcast interview. At the time — in April — he noted that at least five major venture funds had hired full-time staff dedicated to manufacturing non-traditional exits, including secondary transactions, continuation funds, and buyouts. Industry Ventures says it has made more than 1,000 investments, has stakes in more than 700 venture firms, and that it boasts an internal rate of return of 18%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pilot electric ferry service between Seattle and nearby Tacoma could debut next summer to serve the surge of World Cup tourists expected in the region — but questions about funding, ferry terminal locations and total costs remain unanswered. Pierce County leaders, whose jurisdiction includes Tacoma, are hoping the hydroplane ferry would boost tourism and provide a scenic connection to the city 35 miles south of Seattle — one that lasts well beyond the World Cup kickoff in June. “This is an example of a legacy that we can leave this region that will promote tourism, promote economic development and promote movement around Puget Sound,” said Ryan Mello, executive of Pierce County, in a recent pitch to Port of Tacoma officials. Along with additional funding needed to set sail, the project must find ferry landing sites with parking and boarding ramps that meet accessibility needs and install charging facilities. Who pays for and owns the shore-side infrastructure depends on where it's located, Baublits said. But there were also concerns about affordability for passengers. “It is very luxurious inside one of these [ferries],” said Commissioner Kristin Ang. It's a big opportunity, and we need to give it the time necessary in order to be successful,” said Dennis Joyce, director of investments for Tacoma Venture Fund (TVF), a venture capital firm. The ferry trip will take about 50-55 minutes each way, which is longer than driving between the cities on Interstate 5, though freeway traffic is a wildcard. There are other efforts underway to deploy electric-powered vessels in Western Washington: David Tyler, Artemis co-founder and managing director for North America, declined to share details on where vessels for the Tacoma-area project would be built, what they would cost, and when they would be available, saying via email that was “currently commercially sensitive information.” Tyler said that additional manufacturing locations beyond the Seattle site would be “announced soon.” Microsoft's mission: empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more.

Then ideally it's an opaque value from that point on This is a very good point I'd never realised! I'm not sure how you get around it, though, as if that program can even find a credential and decrypt a file, if it runs as the user then everything else can go find that credential as well. Elevator wants to close, another one is coming (oh! Some complete idiot is trying to turn left onto the street I'm leaving and waving me to turn left in front of them.

Or I can just wait and see what happens. [2] I could go out of my way and turn right. Or I can just wait and see what happens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Nevada state regulators have accused Elon Musk's Boring Co. of violating environmental regulations nearly 800 times in the last two years as it digs a sprawling tunnel network beneath Las Vegas for its Tesla-powered “people mover.” The company's alleged violations include starting to dig without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling muck from its trucks, according to a new document obtained by City Cast Las Vegas and ProPublica. The Sept. 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws. Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement. The letter also accuses the company of failing to hire an independent environmental manager to regularly inspect its construction sites. But regulators knocked down the total penalty to $242,800. “Given the extraordinary number of violations, NDEP has decided to exercise its discretion to reduce the penalty to two $5,000 violations per permit, which it believes offers a reasonable penalty that will still serve to deter future non-compliance conduct,” regulators wrote in the letter. Payment of the penalty isn't required until after the dispute resolution process is complete, a state spokesperson said. In the past, Musk has espoused paying penalties rather than waiting for approvals as a way of doing business. ​​“Environmental regulations are, in my view, largely terrible,” he said at an event with the libertarian Cato Institute last year. “You have to get permission in advance, as opposed to, say, paying a penalty if you do something wrong, which I think would be much more effective.” Boring uses a machine known as Prufrock to dig the 12-foot-diameter tunnels, applying chemical accelerants as part of the process. For each foot the company bores, it removes about 6 cubic yards of soil along with any groundwater, according to a company document prepared for state environmental officials. Because it is privately funded and receives no federal money, the project is exempt from many exhaustive governmental vetting and environmental analysis requirements. But it is required to obtain state permits to ensure the waste does not contaminate the environment or local water sources. Last year, the company successfully lobbied to be exempted from holding a county “amusement and transportation system” permit, arguing instead for an oversight plan that removed multiple layers of inspection. The company was fined more than $112,000 by Nevada's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in late 2023 after workers complained of “ankle-deep” water in the tunnels, muck spills and burns. Just last month, a construction worker suffered a “crush injury” after being pinned between two 4,000-foot pipes, according to police records. Firefighters used a crane to extract him from the tunnel opening. As an example, LVCVA CEO Steve Hill cited the delayed opening of a Loop station by local officials who were concerned that fire safety requirements weren't adequate. “We wouldn't have given approvals if we determined things weren't the way they ought to be and what it needs to be for public safety reasons,” Gibson said, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Asked for a response to the new proposed fines, an LVCVA spokesperson said, “We won't be participating in this story.” “Not if they're recommitting almost the exact violation,” Leffel said. Leffel questioned whether a $250,000 penalty would be significant enough to change operations at The Boring Co., which was valued at $7 billion in 2023. Studies show that fines that don't put a significant dent in a company's profit don't deter companies from future violations, Leffel said. A state spokesperson disagreed that regulators aren't keeping the public safe and said the agency believes its penalties will deter “future non-compliance.” If this launch goes according to plan, SpaceX plans to roll out a new iteration of the megarocket in early 2026. Elon Musk's newly inaugurated space city was handed control over a piece of Boca Chica beach. SpaceX is tasked with five national security missions worth a total of $714 million. Newly unsealed testimony marks the first time direct Chinese investment in the company has been disclosed, raising new questions about foreign ownership interests in one of America's most important military contractors.</p>

According to a blog post published by Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), which spearheaded the efforts, they have managed to overcome a major challenge that hampered the development and adoption of this kind of non-volatile memory. The researchers claim that their spin–orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) is a true next-gen breakthrough as it offers ~1ns switching speeds, and data retention exceeding 10 years, among its multitude of attractions. We've covered the same team's earlier advances in building a SOT-MRAM array chip (Jan 2024) but much progress has been made since then. Specifically, the team managed to stabilize the rare beta-phase of Tungsten, which is crucial for increased performance – and will be even more important for eventual mass production of SOT-MRAM devices. Last year, we noted that NYCU's SOT-MRAM was capable of latencies up to 10ns. Now it has been improved to ~1ns, rivaling SRAM, reveals testing of a 64kb array the scientists built. For further context, that is slightly faster than DRAM (DDR5 has latency around 14ms) and considerably faster than 3D TLC NAND (which has read latencies between 50 and 100 microseconds). Don't forget, though, that this new SOT-MRAM brings the benefits of non-volatility. Other trumpeted advances delivered by the latest SOT-MRAM device demo were: With TSMC scientists among the collaborators, it isn't surprising to hear that these new SOT-MRAM devices are being designed for large-scale integration under existing semiconductor industry-compatible processes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the high-stakes, hyper-accelerated world of artificial intelligence (AI), one company has stood as the undisputed king and sole purveyor of computational picks and shovels in a digital gold rush: Nvidia. For years, Nvidia's combination of powerful GPUs and its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform has created a nearly unbreachable moat, making it the default choice for anyone serious about training large-scale AI models. This deal isn't just another hardware order; it's a strategic realignment. AMD will supply its Instinct MI-series GPUs for OpenAI's foundational model training, and perhaps more importantly, OpenAI will gain deep access to AMD's open-source software stack. As always, we'll close with my Product of the Week, a new embedded processor from AMD that will have broad implications for a variety of markets and machines. For decades, the company has fought a two-front war against giants. In the GPU market, it has constantly battled Nvidia for a distant second place. AMD's comeback against Intel was driven by its revolutionary chiplet architecture in Zen-based processors. While Intel struggled with its monolithic chip designs, AMD cleverly combined smaller, high-yield chiplets into a single, powerful processor. This approach proved to be more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing AMD to leapfrog Intel in performance in both the consumer and, critically, the data center markets. Nvidia's CUDA platform is the very definition of a “sticky” ecosystem. It's a proprietary software layer that allows developers to harness the parallel processing power of Nvidia GPUs. This software moat was so powerful that even if AMD produced a competitive GPU, the immense effort required for developers to switch from CUDA made it a non-starter. AMD's counter-strategy to CUDA is ROCm (Radeon Open Compute platform), an open-source software stack. For a small developer, the benefits of CUDA's maturity are compelling. It creates vendor lock-in, limits customization, and places your entire operational future in the hands of a single supplier. This is where AMD's open-source approach becomes a strategic masterstroke. It allows them to fine-tune the hardware and software stack for maximum efficiency, a critical factor when training models that cost tens of millions of dollars in compute time. This AMD deal is a powerful indicator that, in the long term, the largest AI players will inevitably favor open platforms that offer flexibility and prevent them from being held hostage by a single, powerful partner. AMD's partnership with OpenAI puts immense pressure on the in-progress Nvidia-OpenAI negotiations for their next-generation infrastructure, as Nvidia must now contend with a viable and arguably more flexible alternative. Massive success often breeds complacency, and there are whispers in Silicon Valley that Nvidia's overwhelming market dominance has made it difficult to work with. This “Nvidia tax” has become a significant pain point for its largest customers. By offering comparable (and in some cases, superior in memory capacity) hardware with a more attractive total cost of ownership (TCO) and an open software model, AMD is making a compelling case to every major cloud provider and AI company tired of writing blank checks to Nvidia. The AMD-OpenAI deal could not come at a more critical time. In this environment, securing long-term contracts with foundational customers like OpenAI is paramount — a strategic land grab to lock down market share before the inevitable, eventual softening of the current AI hype cycle. Looking ahead, AMD's next move will likely be to replicate this strategy aggressively. Expect to see it announce deeper partnerships with other major AI labs and cloud providers, leveraging the OpenAI deal as the ultimate validation of its platform. This deal introduces real competition, threatens Nvidia's astronomical profit margins, and signals a fundamental shift towards a more open, collaborative, and ultimately, more innovative future for the entire field of artificial intelligence. A precision robotic arm positions a high-performance chip, reflecting AMD's role in powering industrial automation, medical imaging, and enterprise infrastructure with its EPYC Embedded 9000 processors. In a world captivated by consumer gadgets and flashy AI chatbots, it's easy to overlook the foundational technologies that actually make the modern world run. This week's standout product isn't something you'll unbox at home, but its impact will be felt everywhere from the factory floor to the operating room. At their core, the EPYC Embedded 9000 chips are built on AMD's cutting-edge Zen 5 architecture, but they are tuned for a very different mission than their consumer-facing cousins. These processors are engineered to deliver maximum computational power with minimal energy consumption and heat output. That efficiency is critical for devices that operate 24/7 in rugged, often space-constrained environments — think of the controller for a robotic arm on an assembly line or the imaging computer inside an MRI machine. Industrial customers operate on timelines that stretch for a decade or more. This long-term view is bolstered by the platform's incredible flexibility and future-proofing. With expansive connectivity, including Wi-Fi 6E, PCIe Gen 5, and a suite of high-speed I/O, system architects can design a platform today that is ready for the technologies of tomorrow. That scalability highlights AMD's key competitive advantage: its partnership-driven ecosystem. AMD isn't trying to build every industrial machine itself. Companies in industrial automation, medical technology, and enterprise networking can take the EPYC Embedded 9000 series and build highly customized solutions tailored to their specific markets. This collaborative model fosters innovation and allows AMD's technology to penetrate markets far more effectively than a closed, top-down approach ever could. In smart factories, these processors will power the machine vision systems that inspect products with superhuman speed and accuracy. The images featured in this article were created with ChatGPT AI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Salesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market. Salesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month. The company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026. Slack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions. Salesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026. This latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Last week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte's 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. As of October 14, 2025, it's no longer a secure operating system to keep using, as Microsoft will not issue further updates. That doesn't mean you won't be able to use it anymore, but like it or not, you'll need to upgrade eventually. If you have a Windows PC from the past five years or so, you can probably upgrade to Windows 11 without new hardware. But for anyone coming from an older PC, this might be a good opportunity to buy a new laptop. Read our guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop. If it's been a while since you've shopped around for a Windows laptop, the Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) might be the biggest surprise to you. It runs on a Qualcomm-powered ARM processor, making it every bit as efficient and long-lasting as a MacBook. It's really the battery life here, though, that will feel legitimately surprising if you're coming from an old Windows laptop or a desktop. I waited a long time for a Windows machine like this Surface Laptop, which came out in 2024—something that could truly compete with the MacBook Air. The Snapdragon X2 Elite chip was just announced, but we likely won't see an update to the Surface Laptop for another five or six months, making this a solid purchase. One caveat: You might come across the Surface Laptop 13, which came out in 2025, and is cheaper. If it's been a while since you've paid attention to advances in the Windows laptop ecosystem, the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review) will probably come as a shocker. Despite regularly costing somewhere between $750 and $1,000, depending on the discount, the Dell 14 Plus comes with an astounding 32 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. In the past, you would have paid handsomely for those kinds of specs. It's especially impressive if you factor in the high-resolution screen and 90-Hz refresh rate. Just pay attention to the price, knowing that it's frequently been discounted to at least $650 (make sure you double-check the specs before you buy). It's over a full pound lighter than most of the other laptops on this list, and is even a half-pound lighter than the MacBook Air. It really does feel incredibly light in your hands, which makes it an ideal laptop for students or anyone taking their work on the go. That extra pound is noticeable if you're carrying it around in your bag all day. On top of that, it gets you great battery life, thanks to the Snapdragon X Plus, as well as a solid OLED display. Similar to the Dell 14 Plus, you may be impressed by just how much laptop you get for just $600 or $700. No, the Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't have premium components or a high-end design, but it still delivers. That's a killer price on this budget laptop. With graphics options up to an RTX 5070 and the Core Ultra 285H onboard, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 was impressively powerful in my testing. The OLED display on my review unit was glorious, but there's an even sharper and brighter tandem OLED option available, too. But if you're a designer, video editor, or user of any heavy GPU-based application, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 is a great Windows laptop for you. Perhaps more than any other company, Razer has been refining the idea of the ultimate gaming laptop ever since its founding. The Razer Blade 16 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) certainly feels like a crown jewel in its lineup. It's thinner than ever, wholeheartedly embraces OLED, and features the best graphics options possible, up to and including the Nvidia RTX 5090. As you might guess, however, the Razer Blade 16 is incredibly expensive. Fortunately, you can currently buy the starting configuration for $500 off, bringing the price down to $1,800, which comes with one terabyte of storage and an RTX 5060. Windows laptops haven't always been known for being lookers. This thing is absolutely gorgeous—and not in a way that tries to specifically mimic the MacBook. It's also remarkably thin, has an expansive touchpad, and a sharp OLED display. The only problem is that the Zenbook S 16 is quite expensive, and prices haven't dropped like I hoped they would. For a smaller model, check out the Zenbook S 14, which is very similar, except it uses an Intel chip instead. It's a true 2-in-1 laptop that has a 360-degree hinge that lets you rotate the screen all the way around. For the uninitiated, Framework has created a fully accessible and self-upgradeable system for its computers, much of which is completely tool-less. If you're coming from an old desktop PC and like the upgradeable nature of your tower, the Framework Laptop can fill that void. I love that it can work just as well for PC gamers as it does on a detachable 2-in-1 like the Surface Pro. The Microsoft laptop (6/10, WIRED Review) has never been so good, either. With the Snapdragon X Plus or Elite inside, battery life and performance are both great, important for a device that needs to be both a portable tablet and a full PC. A smaller version came out earlier this year, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review), and it's more affordable. Either way, though, you'll need to buy an appropriate Type Cover Keyboard to unlock the full capabilities of the Surface Pro. It breaks down into three major categories though. Beyond the Start Menu, just about every app will have a different visual flair, with rounded corners and a streamlined aesthetic. While you can still do you could do in Windows 10, expect things like Settings, Notifications, and System Tray to all feel different. You'll even find a new Widgets tray that can be activated over on the left side of the Taskbar. Hardware requirements: This is where most of the frustration around Windows 11 stems from. Performance features: There are tons of new features in Windows 11 that help Windows play nicer with accessories and third-party software. One of my favorite examples is HDR support. Speaking of games, Windows 11 has features like Game Mode, DirectStorage, and optimizations for windowed games, all of which make for a faster, smoother PC gaming experience. What to Look for in a Windows Laptop You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this. A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price. Here's a list of important specs to consider: They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible. Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage. Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate, and panel type here. Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size. Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Asus ROG Flow Z13 for $2,170: One of the most unique Windows devices ever made, this gaming 2-in-1 will impress you with just how powerful it is, despite its form factor. Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $1,300: I really like this uniquely-sized 15.3-inch laptop, though I have avoided recommending it very often due to its price. Framework Laptop 12 for $549: This adorable little laptop is the perfect option for students and tinkerers, offering tons of upgradability in a small, affordable package. Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 16 2-in-1 for $698: You won't find many 16-inch laptops at this price, which is what makes this worthy of mention. Asus Vivobook Pro 15 for $1,500: Content creation-focused laptops tend to be really expensive, which is why I'm glad the Vivobook Pro 15 exists. It has solid specs, an OLED panel, and an RTX 4050 GPU inside to speed up creative applications and workflows. Acer Swift 16 AI for $800: This is one of those laptops that has dramatically increased in value with its recent price drop.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn't the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur. I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips. We both knew that wasn't the real reason, though. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon. It puts players in charge of a city's roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. “RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me. A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance. The first assembly language, created in the 1940s by Kathleen Booth (though she has not always gotten her due, surprise surprise), hardly resembled language. To tell the machine to perform an operation—say, “0,0111” in machine code—you'd instead employ a series of letters and symbols, which a new piece of software, called an assembler, would translate into binary. Soon, the commands got human-­friendlier mnemonics like “MOV.” To know assembly was to know the CPU itself—what it could do and, even more, what it couldn't. A chip's physical design, how the circuits connecting the logic gates of AND and XOR are actually laid, defines how it works. Its functions are pretty basic, breaking down instructions into elementary steps: Fetch something from memory and put it in a temporary cubby, known as a register. Perform some operations, like comparing two values, or adding them. As chips advanced, new dialects of assembly evolved. If you want to read the leaked source code of the Furby, you'll need fluency in 6502. Learning the language of one chip—say, Intel's x86—and then moving to Arm is like studying Arabic in Beirut and then trying to get by in Tunis or Khartoum. I learned x86 assembly in college as a refugee from math. Where my classmates seemed to enjoy the drab incantations of Java, I loved the logic game that was assembly. It was easy to fail, but to fail in ways that were explainable if you looked at the circuits and registers. How masterful I felt coding in the simple commands of this not-quite-language; how fragile I knew that mastery to be. To say, put these bytes there—no, there, at that register, in those capacitors. It's true that there's no longer much point in using assembly in the day-to-day work of coding. High-level languages are so efficient that their abstraction is almost always preferable. Even assembly's inventor moved on to other ventures; one of Booth's final papers, in the 1990s, used neural networks to match seals with their barks. He's been dabbling in home automation recently—lights, temperature sensors, sound systems, and the like, coded on Raspberry Pis using Python, which he initially found “quite off-putting,” he told me. But even on that tiny processor, it gets the job done just fine. Then along comes something like DeepSeek to remind you that humans can still communicate better with our hardware. Earlier this year, the Chinese company that made these incredibly efficient AI models upended the narrative that AI advancement can come only from more chips and more energy. DeepSeek's engineers reached into the subfloor of Nvidia's chips, commanding each individual machine to compress data from 32 bits to 8 bits—sacrificing precision for efficiency—at precisely the right moments. I was similarly taken when, in 2023, researchers at DeepMind taught a machine x86 assembly, then asked it to improve on the long-standing sort() function in C. The AI made strange, unintuitive choices, performing odd jumps between registers, and in the end cut precisely one step. But happening countless times a day, now that the new algorithm has been officially adopted. To me, it was a reminder that we humans created these machines, and even as they appear to spiral into complexity beyond our comprehension, they remain under our command. We can always make them work better. It was like what Sawyer said when he recounted his recent Raspberry Pi–enabled home coding experiment. It was probably just his imagination, but the display had been a little laggy, he thought.
