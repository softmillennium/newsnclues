                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conspiracy theorists are once again accusing NFL officials of aiding the Chiefs after Kansas City went unpenalized in Sunday's win over the Detroit Lions. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wisely went no huddle on the next play to deny replay officials and Lions coach Dan Campbell the chance to review the catch, which was good enough for 13 yards and helped to set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to Hollywood Brown. 'This catch by Travis Kelce should have been ruled an incomplete catch with how it hits the ground,' Rate the Refs wrote on X. 'Chiefs hurry and snap the ball before it can be reviewed.' This catch by Travis Kelce should have been ruled an incomplete catch with how it hits the ground. Chiefs hurry and snap the ball before it can be reviewed pic.twitter.com/7VEjkO2Aji 'Well it's the chiefs and a prime time game, so officials dare not make the correct call,' wrote on conspiratorial critic on X. But not everyone agreed with that assessment. Namely, NBC rules analyst Terry McAulay said it was, indeed, a catch. Kelce appeared to get away with a holding penalty on a fourth-quarter screen pass to Brashard Smith in the fourth quarter. Mahomes found Brown for another touchdown a few plays later. 🚨🚨WOW🚨🚨The refs missed a holding penalty on #Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce on this play — setting up Kansas City with a touchdown.😳😳😳Detroit was not happy with the no-call.There have been ZERO penalties called on Kansas City tonight. Despite this looking really cool, Terry McAulay explains why Jared Goff was lined up illegally and why this touchdown was taken off the board. Refs also took a Lions touchdown off the board in the first quarter due to an illegal motion call against Detroit quarterback Jared Goff. With Goff split wide, running back David Montgomery received the direct shotgun snap before throwing back to his quarterback, who managed to fight his way into the end zone with a helpful block from St. Brown. Unfortunately for Goff, he committed a penalty on the play by failing to first establishing himself in the backfield before motion out wide. What officials may have missed on the play was Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones lining up in the neutral zone. Then there was a roughing-the-passer call against the Lions' Aiden Hutchinson, which led some Chiefs haters to accuse Mahomes of flopping on the play. Many other, though, called it a 'clear roughing the passer' penalty. NFL fans have long suspected the Chiefs are benefitting from friendly officiating in an attempt to boost league television ratings. Those suspicions only grew in 2023 when Kelce began dating Taylor Swift, who helped to popularize the league among her army of fans. Statistics don't necessarily back up these claims of poor officiating, but on Sunday in Kansas City, the Chiefs did avoid a single penalty flag as they improved to 3-3 for the season. 'KC with zero penalties is hilarious,' a Lions fan added. 'NFL isn't even hiding it...false starts, holding and blocks in the back all-over.' As another fan put it: 'When they overturned the first td we all knew what was going to happen.' And as Kelce told ESPN after the win, that remained a theme for Kansas City throughout the week. 'Penalties and turnovers are going to ruin you in this league,' Kelce said. 'It was a bit embarrassing seeing how many flags we had last week. It was a huge focal point this week.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Writer-director Jas Summers made his directorial debut in the new Hulu film Stay. It follows Kiara (Megalyn Echikunwoke), a PhD author, and Miles (Mo McRae), a former MMA fighter, as they face the end of their marriage. To survive, they must conquer darkness with love. Horror Geek Life spoke with Summers about navigating the supernatural thriller. HGL: Where did the idea for Stay come from? Jas Summers: The idea came from wanting to tell a really interesting love story and then putting it in a genre I never thought a love story would be in; I'd never seen one, so putting those two worlds together was kind of the start of the idea. Jas Summers: It took shape over many drafts, the first draft was that idea, and I wanted to add in the spirituality idea, the voodoo element, and building out that way. So it was during the script writing process, for sure. HGL: There are some great visual moments from start to finish. When you were mapping out the film, did you have an idea how you wanted the film to look visually, or did that evolve during the filming process? Once we got cinematographer John Rosario on board, we started talking about the emotion of the film, the characters, that time period in their life, and how it would look. I had a strong idea of what I wanted, but it evolved as more creatives came on board. HGL: It goes without saying that everything you're describing is not an easy process, time and money being the big issues. What were the biggest challenges for you in making this film? Some of the stuff in the film was tough; characters had to switch out of being in the same scene to being in a different scene with different hair, makeup, wardrobe, all that stuff made it very challenging to get all those particular scenes done on that day. To me, I don't know how everyone else feels who's watching it, but it's a little bit of an action film, fight scenes, horror, we had a lot of genres, and for a first-time filmmaker to attempt that was a lot. HGL: You have two actors, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Mo McRae, carrying the film. What was it like working with them, collaborating on this project? I had seen Mo's work in American Skin; he had the right humanity but also the right presence and power to play Miles. We ended up having lunch, and I didn't get a good feel. We talked about the movie, and he said he wanted to star in it but also produce it, which I said would be amazing. He brought in his producing team, and they were very helpful, brought in a lot of ideas. He suggested Megalyn to me, and you've seen the film; she is just awe-inspiring and a force of nature. They were both collaborative; if I had an idea, they would say, “Okay, let's try this, see if we can make it better, take it to another level.” As a director, that was great. HGL: Looking back at the film now, what do you take away from this experience, both personally and professionally? More experience on set, communication, the lessons of professionalism, the lessons of being grateful, being thankful to everyone who was contributing to the project, from crafts to the AD, everyone who played a role in helping me get this film made, and appreciating that and not taking it for granted.

Melanie Virdell wasn't known to wake up early when she lived in the Spanaway area of Pierce County, but on a cold February morning about 13 years ago, she was up with her son, 18-year-old Christopher Virdell. Christopher and Melanie Virdell had breakfast together after she made him a bowl of oatmeal on Feb. 9, 2012. She told The News Tribune earlier this month that as he got ready to leave for work at Safeway, he had been texting a friend on his phone. She watched Christopher grab his jacket and start running to the door.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Confirmed by NASA—the mysterious rocks on Mars could contain the clearest signs of extraterrestrial life yet NASA could have found signs of life on Mars, but there's something wrong. It's true there's still no definite confirmation about this remarkable news, but Perseverance rover's findings are the most promising until now and could answer one of the most ancient questions of humanity: Was there life on the Red Planet once? The Perseverance rover, which reached Mars in 2021, is exploring an area called Jezero Crater. Billion years ago, this place was home to a huge lake with rivers. Then, in 2024, the rover found a very special rock called ‘'Cheyava Falls'' and when scientists analyzed it they saw organic molecules (compounds that on Earth are related to life), ancient water signs, and curious mineral patterns in the shape of spots that could have been an ideal environment for microorganisms to exist. The organic molecules do not always mean there has been life, sometimes they are formed due to natural chemical processes. In these places, the Perseverance discovered minerals called vivianite and greigite. On Earth, this type of chemical reaction is used by many microorganisms to obtain energy. Scientific Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist at Texas A&M University, said the team was amazed when they first analyzed the rocks. Tice added that while some chemical reactions can occur naturally, they usually require very high temperatures. But there's no evidence of heat in these samples — which means life could be the more likely explanation. Only in advanced laboratories can they confirm whether the rocks' chemical signatures truly point to ancient life. NASA and ESA (European Spatial Agency) were thinking about a collaborative mission to do it, called Sample Retrieval Lander, to take the samples back about the year 2033. However, there's something that makes it difficult: U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning major cuts to NASA's budget, which could delay or even cancel the mission entirely. All of this could finally answer whether the possible biosignatures (signs of life) found on Mars are biological or purely geological. Until then, Perseverance continues to explore, sending back images and data from the Martian surface. Every rock it studies brings us one step closer to understanding whether the red planet was once alive. The question that has fascinated humans for centuries — “Are we alone?” — might finally have an answer buried in the dust of Mars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Voyager 1 carries the Golden Record, which contains evidence of human life. What if they find it after we are long gone? Voyager 1 has been drifting in space for nearly 50 years. Voyager 1 continues to send back data from deep space and will reach one light day in November 2026 - a point light takes one day to reach from our planet. Voyager 1 is carrying a "Golden Record", filled with messages and images from humans and of other things that exist on Earth. The idea is to let any extraterrestrial life that encounters Voyager to know about Earth and the kind of life and objects that live here. In 1977, it was added to the spacecraft with the assumption that anyone who finds it might want to contact humans. The record comes with instructions on how to play it and how to locate Earth's position in the universe. But what if the contact happens after Earth is long gone, or it is still here, but life as we know it today no longer exists? In the event Voyager 1 and the Golden Record come across alien life after we are no longer here, it becomes a time capsule. With human voices and other sounds, it will be the only surviving proof of life on Earth that once was. This would be a scenario similar to Mars, except in this case, another civilisation would also be sure that life once flourished on Earth. Carl Sagan noted that the "spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilisations in interstellar space." However, the biggest takeaway would be that if Earthlings could launch "this bottle into the cosmic ocean", it says "something very hopeful about life on this planet."</p>
