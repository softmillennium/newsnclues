                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team is looking for a win to round out October. Friday's outing against Ecuador resulted in a 1-1 draw, as veteran striker Enner Valencia outmaneuvered Chris Richards to open the scoring in the first half before Folarin Balogun rescued a draw with his second-half finish. Stream Los Angeles News for free, 24/7, wherever you are. Ecuador did not have stars Moises Caicedo and Piero Hincapie, though the U.S. also is dealing with injury issues as Christian Pulisic, among others, was not deemed fit enough to start. There is hope that Pulisic and Co. can get in some minutes, though starting left-back Antonee Robinson will not play again, despite being called up, due to an ongoing knee issue. 25 in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Ecuador. Unlike Ecuador, Australia doesn't have many notable names at top clubs, but there are some promising young players hoping to take that next step. The U.S. and Australia have only met three times, all in international friendlies. The game will be broadcast in English on TNT. NBC's Universo will carry the game in Spanish. U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino brought in more familiar faces than the September squad that received criticism, though the overall quality is still lacking due to injuries and other omissions. ü´°26 players have been called into camp for upcoming matches against Ecuador and Australia! The Socceroos, as aforementioned, don't have any bonafide names. Goalie Maty Ryan has experience with notable European clubs, while left-back Jordy Bos, center-back Alessandro Circati and winger Nestory Irankunda are the nation's most promising talents currently.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Commerce City, CO ‚Äì The U.S. Men's National Team will host Australia for a friendly tomorrow at DICK's Sporting Goods Park. The Yanks are coming off a meh 1-1 result against Ecuador last Friday. The fanbase continues to be underwhelmed going into a home World Cup next summer. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players are preaching progress. ‚ÄúThere were opportunities for us to be ruthless. We can just brush up on the defensive mistakes, continue to create and be more clinical, we'll be a strong side,‚Äù said forward Florian Balogun of the Ecuador game. Three center backs has given them more defensive cover but there are questions about depth at the position outside of Chris Richards. Veteran glue guy Cristian Roldan likes it: ‚ÄúIt suits our team overall as well. Three center backs, even a center back playing at right back, building in a three, allowing our midfielders to step a little bit higher and get our two 10s in the pockets, it suits us a whole lot better. ‚ÄúThat allows the two center mids to be more aggressive, even man oriented. In a four, you have one guy further up the field. They'll look to build out of the back and go at a more defensive Australia, who will look to counter attack. How the USMNT balances playing on the front foot against deferential opponents while ramping up for going toe-to-toe with bigger nations they will meet in a knockout game continues to be a question. Poch has worried the fanbase in a few ways. Communication and creating a culture has been one of those. He was hired late in the process after U.S. Soccer chose to part ways with Gregg Berhalter. There was also the factor that the Yanks qualified automatically as hosts and did not have an intense Concacaf qualification process. He's created an environment so quickly that doesn't create certainty for anyone. Aaronson: ‚ÄúThere's more of a seriousness because it's right around the corner. We don't have many camps left. We have to treat every friendly like it's a real game. We've done a good job training the mentality of these friendlies. It's good to be a little bit more chill. It's been a great time learning under him. I'm looking forward to keep it growing.‚Äù Brendan Aaronson on his brother Paxten:It's a bonus being able to see him here, and he got to show me around. I can tell that Denver is an amazing city.I'm really happy for him. I think it's a huge step in his life. Roldan: ‚ÄúIn all seriousness, we're here to play against two tough sides. Guys were able to do as they please but with structure, being home at a good time,‚Äù he said avoiding saying whether the guys went golfing or not. To close things out, Pochettino said that Christian Pulisic has reacted well with the ankle injury. They will evaluate him tomorrow to see if what his availability is. Antonee Robinson has been in training but will be unavailable for the game with a knee injury. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic during a training session with the USMNT. COMMERCE CITY, Colorado ‚Äî U.S. star Christian Pulisic trained Monday with the national team and is available for selection for Tuesday's friendly against Australia. Coach Mauricio Pochettino told the English-language TNT broadcast last week that Pulisic had some swelling in his ankle after training. The AC Milan attacker, who has six goals and two assists across all competitions for Milan this season, did not look limited in his outing against Ecuador. ‚ÄúChristian participated in the training session, the reaction after 20 minutes of playing (on Friday) was good,‚Äù Pochettino said at Monday's pregame news conference. While Pulisic could play a role against Australia, Pochettino ruled out left back Antonee Robinson. Robinson did not play against Ecuador because of the knee injury that forced him to have surgery this offseason. Robinson has played a limited role for Fulham early this season and said last week that coming into the camp, ‚Äúthere hasn't really been a specific conversation about how many minutes I'm going to play this trip, if any.‚Äù Right now, it looks like it will be the latter, with Robinson getting a chance to be back around the group and the coaching staff, but not yet at the level to contribute on the field. ‚ÄúAntonee from (the) beginning of camp (had) some small issues in his knee, a little bit of pain,‚Äù Pochettino said. Hope that it's not an important thing, but he'll go back to his club in a normal way there (and hopefully will be) training and competing.‚Äù The USMNT's Monday training session took place in blustery, 50-degree conditions just outside Denver. Multiple players, including Pulisic and Weston McKennie, wore winter hats at the start of training. The conditions are completely different,‚Äù Pochettino said shortly after training. Considering those factors, Pochettino said that he'd make lineup changes for the game against Australia. ‚ÄúFor sure, there are going to be changes, and maybe change the shape.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cape Verde have become the second smallest nation to qualify for the FIFA World Cup after beating Eswatini 3-0 to book their place at next year's tournament. Goals from Dailon Livramento and Willy Semedo either side of half-time saw the team close on the historic accomplishment. A third goal from defender Stopira in second half stoppage time sealed the 3-0 victory to start celebrations at their national stadium. Apito final e o Est√°dio Nacional de Cabo Verde vai ao rubro ü§©ü§©#sporttvportugal #Qualifica√ß√£oMundial2026 #CaboVerde pic.twitter.com/tcVbhvmW5a The nation had been part of Portugal until it declared independence back in 1975. Cape Verde had not been a member of FIFA until 1982 and first attempted to qualify for the World Cup back in 2002. The team, coached by Bubista, have qualified after finishing top of their group with seven wins, two draws and one defeat. Cape Verde had spurned a chance to seal qualification last week after drawing 3-3 against Libya, but got over the line with victory on Monday. Cape Verde had shown improvement in recent years by qualifying for the African Cup of Nations on four occasions. Despite reaching the World Cup, they failed to qualify for the upcoming African Cup of Nations later this year. The expansion ensured nine direct qualification spots for African nations, marking an increase from five previously. Cape Verde are the third nation assured of making their World Cup debuts next year, with Uzbekistan and Jordan also qualifying for the first time. Cameroon now face a wait to see whether they will participate in Africa's World Cup play-offs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House planners have been increasingly focused on securing airspace over stadiums. The Trump administration is moving to fortify U.S. skies against potential drone threats ahead of next summer's World Cup and other marquee mega-events, casting the technology as necessary both to bolster security and to help outpace foreign competition for aviation technology. The funding will further insert the White House into a controversial debate over which law enforcement officials should be able to intercept or disable drones. Currently only federal agencies can do so, and a House bill that would extend that capacity to local police appears stalled. The administration is exploring contingency plans that would allow the Justice Department to temporarily authorize state and local officials to take down rogue drones in the event that Congress fails to act. They have an amazing potential for both good and ill,‚Äù Seb Gorka, the National Security Council's senior director for counterterrorism, has said. In August, Gorka joined Giuliani to meet with representatives of the local-organizing committees in the 11 American cities that will host World Cup matches. Drones have become ‚Äúa key part‚Äù of planning by the White House task force, said Giuliani. ‚ÄúLet's use the World Cup as the urgency, right?‚Äù said Giuliani, whose task force was formed in coordination with the National Security Council, DHS and Department of Justice and now meets daily to align federal and local security efforts. ‚ÄúIn nine months, World Cup games are going to kick off, and there's no pushing that back. States and territories will soon receive guidance on how to apply for drone-security funds. ‚ÄúThere will be a certain minimal amount that's available for every state, whether or not they host World Cup games or America 250 events,‚Äù Giuliani said. Under current federal rules, only the Justice and Homeland Security Departments have the authority to take down or intercept unmanned aircraft in unauthorized locations or otherwise considered a threat. ‚ÄúDHS, FBI, the FAA, and the state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement partners who will partner with them during the FIFA World Cup matches must be equipped with the resources and legal frameworks necessary to mitigate drone threats across all venues where airspace security risks are identified,‚Äù FIFA Chief Safety and Security Officer G.B. Jones told a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month. That concern has prompted competing efforts in state capitals and on Capitol Hill to clarify lines of responsibility between governmental authorities. In September, more than 30 governors urged Congress to pass legislation granting states the same drone mitigation powers as federal agencies. In June, Trump signed executive orders to enhance airspace security, accelerate domestic drone innovation and expand commercial operations. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has described drones as part of a ‚Äúweapons-technology revolution,‚Äù has warned that they ‚Äúare being used to smuggle deadly drugs, target our infrastructure and spy on U.S. defenses.‚Äù</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And if that is altogether too much excitement for the start of another working week, I'll tell you now there's reason to be buzzing. We've got some big World Cup qualifiers ahead of us as the men's international break finally kicks into gear then come Wednesday it's the second round of games in the Women's Champions League. A 1-1 draw with Ecuador might not seem much to write home about on paper, but for starters it is worth bearing in mind that Friday's opponents have just finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying and have some of the best defensive talent in the sport. When Enner Valencia gave them a 24th minute lead in Austin, La Tri could well have expected to hold on. A 1-1 draw was no less than the USMNT deserved and although this is the sort of bar so low you might stumble over it, you could not argue with Tony Meola's assessment on Call It What You Want that this was the team's best game under Pochettino. This seems like a team who is starting to coalesce around the back three that Pochettino introduced in the second half of a defeat to South Korea in September. It seems to fit personnel who were there -- Chris Richards and Timothy Weah have looked particularly adept -- and those who are yet to join up with the group. Imagine the damage that Antonee Robinson might do down the left with a little more support behind him and Sergino Dest across from him. Already you can see experimentation with the base template too, Weston McKennie drifting into midfield from a nominal role as the right-sided attacking midfielder while Weah dangerously attacked space infield from right wing back. Crucial to making a 3-4-2-1 work to its fullest is a center forward who can do a bit of everything, attacking the number 10 position when his support forwards drift wide and stretching the defense with runs in behind. In Balogun the USA got that on Friday night, as Chuck Booth explains: He really could slot into this system quite elegantly. And now there is time to bed that system in. It is easy to see what the vision might be from here out. The US should beat Australia in Denver on Tuesday night. From there on, Pochettino can hope to get even more of his best players together in November and March, testing them out against high grade South American and potentially European opponents such that the hosts are raring to go come the summer. Whether that actually transpires is still a pretty open question. At least now though, they appear to have the building blocks. While the hosts can think about how they might want to line up next summer there are plenty of other nations with work to do if they are to even play in the World Cup. The expanded 48-team structure might have afforded more opportunities for European qualifiers but the smaller groups in UEFA competitions have thrown the door open to a bit more variance, meaning that, for instance, there is real jeopardy for Germany on their trip to Northern Ireland. Having already been surprised once in Slovakia they can ill afford a defeat in Belfast if they want to avoid the playoffs by finishing first. The stakes are similarly high for Belgium, who face Wales on Monday with both sides battling to just catch up with Group J leaders North Macedonia, on whom they hold a game in hand. Lose in Cardiff and what is left of the Belgian golden generation would be facing a very tricky trip to Kazakhstan in November. Italy too will be fearing what comes with dropped points when they host Israel in Udine. Avoiding defeat would have Gennaro Gattuso's team set fare for a top two berth that has seemed in doubt at some stages of the cycle, but realistically only nine points from nine will give them a chance of overhauling Norway. As ever, though, it is Africa that promises to deliver the greatest drama on the final days of its first phase. Meanwhile by far the most populous nation in the continent -- and one of its great footballing powers -- has an almighty struggle on its hands. Nigeria must beat Benin by two goals to have even a chance of a top two finish in Group C, something which may be enough for them to reach the second round qualifiers. To make matters worse, Nigeria's journey to Uyo after a win in Lesotho was delayed by a cracked windscreen on their plane, leading to a grim 20 hours of disrupted flights and long waits. Meanwhile in Asia, Qatar must make home advantage pay as they take on the United Arab Emirates in Al Rayyan knowing a defeat could well see them eliminated from the tournament they hosted in 2022. ‚öñÔ∏è Winners and losers: Friday certainly proved to be a successful game for Balogun but what of McKennie and even Matt Turner? üëÄ Games to watch: Right across the planet there is plenty at stake in pursuit of places at next summer's World Cup. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tournament favorites: Who has a realistic chance of winning it all in North America? üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø Selection dilemmas for the Three Lions: England are doing very nicely indeed but, with qualification just one win away, can they continue to excel without Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden? ‚òÄÔ∏è Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it helps fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team may have hit some unwanted low points during Mauricio Pochettino's divisive tenure, but the Argentine certainly has the backing of striker Folarin Balgoun. Pochettino followed that setback on home soil up with an underwhelming pair of friendlies against South Korea and Japan last month before overseeing a much-improved display against Ecuador on Friday night. However, that heralded clash still resulted in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Balogun scored USMNT's equalizer after falling behind to Enner Valencia's first-half strike in a performance which Pochettino took time to praise.

I feel like the confidence we have in Poch is obviously showing.‚Äù Defender Tim Ream wasn't quite so emphatic. In response to a question about whether Pochettino's principles were finally seeping into the squad, he shrugged: ‚ÄúUm, yeah, I think so.‚Äù Ream acknowledged that ‚Äúit was always going to take a little bit of time for their ideas to really take hold with the entire group‚Äù while adding: ‚ÄúYou saw the energy that we played with. ‚ÄúGuys have been trying to play with that energy, but I think it's also marrying the tactical ideas and the strategy with playing with energy and the aggressiveness. On top of lauding his manager, Balogun also highlighted the impact a fervent home crowd had on him and his teammates. Crowds during the U.S.-staged Gold Cup were worryingly low. It was a sellout crowd for the final in Houston, yet most of the 70,000 in attendance in Texas were rooting for Mexico rather than the home nation. ‚ÄúI would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,‚Äù Pochettino sighed. The 20,000 at the Q2 Stadium in Austin to watch Friday's 1‚Äì1 draw with Ecuador offered a hint that Pochettino's pleas had been heard. ‚ÄúI think they don't realize how much we as players rely on their support. It's always nice when we can play at an amazing stadium like today with the home crowd supporting us and cheering us on.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe ended up getting the goal thanks to them,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúIt's always great having that turn up.‚Äù Grey Whitebloom is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roman Weidenfeller may have retired from professional soccer in 2018, but even years after hanging up the gloves, his connection with Borussia Dortmund remains untouched. In an exclusive interview with Bolavip, the 45-year-old discusses his current role with the European giants, among many other topics. ‚ÄúI am very thankful to have this kind of job as a brand ambassador for Borussia Dortmund,‚Äù Weidenfeller tells Bolavip. ‚ÄúI played 16 years for Borussia Dortmund, and I am now on the marketing side and see the world through different eyes. Now as a club ambassador, Weidenfeller remains a symbol of the Black and Yellow as Dortmund increase their footprint in the United States. We've had a lot of success and support from the United States. We have a big community in Mexico. There are crazy, Black and Yellow fans. Roman Weidenfeller continues to represent Borussia Dortmund as a club ambassador. Winner of back-to-back Bundesliga titles (2010/11, 2011/12) and two German Cups (2012, 2017) during his 16-year stint at the club, Weidenfeller will always feel the love from Dortmund fans wherever he goes. In the U.S., many of those fans were inevitably thrilled to see one of their own donning the Black and Yellow when Christian Pulisic played for the first team from 2016 to 2019. Weidenfeller watched Pulisic make his way up from the academy, and has nothing but great memories about those years. ‚ÄúLook, I first met him when he was a kid and joined Borussia Dortmund. It was the first time he came to a professional team to train and I saw how talented he was. He's a great player,‚Äù Weidenfeller remembers about Pulisic, who went on to play for Chelsea before joining his current team, AC Milan. A young Christian Pulisic in action for Borussia Dortmund. Just recently, he won the Champions League, which I didn't win (laughs). So I have a lot of respect for Christian. He is one of the best American soccer players. He has had a great career, and I hope that in the future, he will be healthy enough and can stay in sports for a long time.‚Äú Even though he joked about not winning a Champions League like Pulisic did, Weidenfeller can take pride in boasting the most coveted accolade for a soccer player: a World Cup medal. In 2014, he was a member of the German national team that made it all the way to the promised land in Brazil, making indelible history in a country that lives and breathes soccer. Needless to say, that achievement has been defining for Weidenfeller's legacy. ‚ÄúOf course, the Champions League cup is big. I can't imagine how we could have organized this team to have won the World Cup in Brazil. ‚ÄúEveryone was smiling and saying ‚Äòyes, of course we want to win.' We were the first team from Europe to win (a World Cup) in South America. Of course, it's not easy with the climate, with Brazil, and all the other countries, but we had the idea to win and we were completely focused on winning that tournament. And in the end, we won it! They organized with me and together we had great success.‚Äú Perhaps the most memorable triumph from Germany‚Äòs World Cup campaign was the semifinal victory over Brazil. While the hosts were seen as strong candidates to win the title, Weidenfeller watched how his teammates put seven past the five-time world champs, in a blowout win that continues to make noise. ‚ÄúWhen we started the game against Brazil, nobody could imagine how it would go and how we could organize and win 7-1. After that, Brazil was struggling a little bit. ‚ÄúWe did not have smiles on our faces. We won this game and were very respectful and we waited to celebrate until our colleagues from Brazil left the pitch. And after they went into the dressing rooms, we celebrated. While the 7-1 win over Brazil may be one of, if not the first game that comes to mind when thinking about Germany's 2014 World Cup win, their campaign also included wins against Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Germany started their journey with a commanding 4-0 victory over Portugal and ended it with a dramatic, hard-fought 1-0 win in extra time against Argentina in the final. But look, just recently when I met some kids and youth players, everybody asked me, ‚ÄòDid you even play against Ronaldo?' And they couldn't believe it, you know. And yeah, it made me proud and I'm very thankful to have had the chance to play in big football matches. So‚Ä¶yeah, of course, both guys are amazing to play against.‚Äú His record against CR7 includes an epic win in the 2013 Champions League semifinals, when Dortmund upset Real Madrid to make the final at Wembley. Roman Weidenfeller against Cristiano Ronaldo during a Champions League match. ‚ÄúI had the chance to play against Ronaldo a lot more than Messi,‚Äù Weidenfeller says. ‚ÄúAnd of course, when Ronaldo saw me, you know what happened. So it was always a challenge and it was always amazing to have had these chances to play against him.‚Äù Speaking of Messi, Weidenfeller also credits the Argentine star's move to MLS side Inter Miami for boosting soccer's awareness and popularity in the United States. ‚ÄúI mean, Lionel Messi is a big brand in soccer. ‚ÄúAnd now everybody is watching soccer in Miami. ‚ÄúSo Messi, and also Marco Reus, support the MLS. It's amazing for these guys and it's amazing for the MLS to have this support from these guys and in the end, they make this league very popular around the world.‚Äú While Messi may take most of the limelight, Weidenfeller is also paying close attention to Marco Reus‚Äò performance in the league. A Dortmund legend just like him, the midfielder took his talents to MLS in 2024 after 12 years with the Black and Yellow, spending six of them alongside the goalkeeper. ‚ÄúWhen I met Marco for the first time when he joined Borussia Dortmund, he was a big, big player, but he is now a big brand too. He's very humble,‚Äù Weidenfeller says of Reus, whom he hopes to welcome back to Dortmund one day. But first, he wants his former teammate to continue shining in MLS. ‚ÄúI'm looking forward to seeing Marco when he comes back. ‚ÄúFor Borussia Dortmund as a brand, it is good. He's very spectacular and powerful here in the MLS. And it's good for our brand, Borussia Dortmund.‚Äú Apart from Reus or Pulisic, Weidenfeller has played with countless superstars who donned the Borussia Dortmund uniform. The goalkeeper captained teams that included the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Mats Hummels, and Mario Gotze, among many others. Therefore, it's hard for him to name just one teammate who stood out. ‚ÄúBut also in my time, in my career and as a captain, a lot of young players joined us. (Jadon) Sancho, (Ousmane) Demb√©l√©, (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang, so many guys. Not in my career, but (Erling) Haaland and (Jude) Bellingham also (played for Dortmund). And he joined us as a young player. ‚Ä¶ So I'm looking, not forward, I'm looking straight back to have this chance to join this moment with these great players. ‚ÄúAnd in the end, looking back, it was always a great time. And it's nice to have had the chance to play with and make friends with these guys. And always have the chance to call them or see each other on the pitch when we play against each other. All about the Champions League trophy: Dimensions, materials, history and more ‚ÄúSports have the power, and especially soccer, to create a different lifestyle, a different life, and sport has the power in your whole world and in your whole life. It's not important what language you speak. It's not important what your religion is. And sports have the power to create something special. There are guys who study at university or make a school team and then there are other guys who come from a small town. And we always created a good time together.‚Äú Besides teaming up with other stars throughout his successful career, Weidenfeller also worked under world-renowned managers. Again, choosing just one of them may not be easy. Still, J√ºrgen Klopp and Joachim L√∂w deserve special mentions. ‚ÄúI learned a lot from each manager. And the player knows he has to work harder than ever before. But it's safe to say Klopp was particularly influential in his career, coaching the Dortmund team that won multiple domestic titles and made the Champions League final in 2013, putting many players on the map. ‚ÄúLook, listen, J√ºrgen is not only the head coach, he's not only a manager, he's like our father. And he treats us like we are family, you know? He was always very strict and charismatic, but in the end, smart and human, you know?,‚Äù Weidenfeller adds, reflecting on his time under Klopp. After making a name for himself at Borussia Dortmund, Klopp went on to find even more success at the helm of Liverpool. Now the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull, he appears to be done with coaching, at least for the foreseeable. Still, Dortmund fans obviously hope to see Klopp back at the club someday. ‚ÄúI saw him at an event in Hamburg, Germany. But also hopefully (see him) in Germany and at Dortmund‚Ä¶ I support J√ºrgen Klopp, you know, as a person. And I can imagine he doesn't want to have the pressure of the whole day, like a manager or head coach,‚Äù Weidenfeller says. Roman Weidenfeller greets fans after a game. While Klopp and other legends who also shaped Borussia Dortmund's history have moved on, Roman Weidenfeller remains a steadfast pillar of the club, serving in a new capacity. A match made in heaven, his journey with the team began in 2002 and continues to thrive beyond his playing days. Retirement has not diminished his bond with the Black and Yellow, proving that some connections truly do last forever.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. As U.S. Soccer's managing director of administration, and vice president of events, respectively, Tom King and John Terry (not that John Terry) are primarily responsible for those answers. "The relationship side of it is so important," King told ESPN. "In some ways, it can be almost a sales job where you've got a chance of getting an opponent, and you just chase that down like the last bus at night until you get 'em closed." For King, that could mean waking up at 3 a.m. to call colleagues in Europe. Terry works in tandem to find an appropriate venue. Ideally, they try to secure the best possible opponents for the USMNT and USWNT, in addition to extended and youth national teams, while placing games all over the United States. But the hoops they must jump through can make it difficult. One of his guiding questions is: "How do we spread our national team and get as many people watching as possible?" U.S. Soccer's decision-makers took ESPN behind the scenes to answer how -- and why -- opponents get scheduled, why venues get selected and how that affects ticket prices. - Predicting the USMNT's 2026 World Cup strikers - Pochettino's USMNT squad comes into focus - Alex Morgan aims to match USWNT success in business U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino have their own wish lists for opponents that they communicate regularly to U.S. Soccer officials. From there, King evaluates who is available and begins his sales pitch to other federations, and Terry works on finding the right venue. U.S. Soccer considers a handful of factors in selecting hosts for games, from the climate and the city's historical fan support, to quality of hotels and training facilities and broadcast constraints -- including for the opponent. Scheduling the USWNT against another top-10 team in the world like Brazil at the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium, as U.S. Soccer did in April, might be a risk worth taking, for example, but a game against lower-tier Portugal makes more sense at an 18,000-seat stadium. The stadium requirements can be as granular as needing a venue with four locker rooms for a four-team SheBelieves Cup event, for example. Sometimes, a venue operator is only interested in hosting a game if the opponent is appealing enough. It means venues are more likely to be available, and it allows U.S. Soccer to better promote the game. Crisis management, however, is part of their jobs, and sometimes U.S. Soccer works for months on plans that never come to fruition. So, everything that had been done for the previous 10 months goes out the window, and you start from scratch again." Other times, the venue is what needs to change. The U.S. women's national team will end 2025 with a pair of games against Italy in soccer-specific stadiums in Florida, but the original plan for the international window called for a different European opponent in a baseball stadium 2,500 miles away. The baseball season would be over by late November, and U.S. Soccer would have time to lay grass over the baseball infield. The roof solved any fear around bad weather; then the opponent's schedule changed for an official competition, and they were unavailable to play a friendly in November and December. Thus, the grand idea of a unique event in Seattle, where the USWNT has not played since 2017, was dead. Each contract for a friendly match is unique, but they all start with what the opponent needs, King said. Other visiting teams might agree to get a stipend or ask to have certain expenses covered for a delegation of 30-50 people. We don't have multiple layers of approval to court a certain team." Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford is a perfect case study for how a myriad of factors can lead to what looks like a result antithetical to the federation's desire to spread out games. The USMNT just played there in June, in addition to their high-profile game against Germany two years ago. Cost is a factor in all scheduling, of course. MLS stadiums (which generally seat around 20,000 people) might cost around $200,000 to rent, while larger NFL stadiums could range from around $500,000 to roughly $1 million for a game, Terry said. Bigger markets are also more expensive because everything costs more, from utilities to turn on the lights to wages for security, ticket scanners, and every other stadium worker. Only about half of NFL stadiums have grass fields, which is the preferred surface for the U.S. national teams and most opponents. Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China. Cost is only part of the equation for any game, Terry said. Which explains how the USMNT ended up hosting four-time World Cup champion Germany in East Hartford in October 2023. U.S. Soccer officials had no doubt that the game would be in great demand among fans no matter where they played it. The problem was finding a place to play. Germany was keen to play on the East Coast for more favorable travel and for a better kickoff time back home, Terry said. U.S. Soccer staff looked everywhere on the East Coast for a grass field in a large stadium on a Saturday in October, the heart of the American football season, and couldn't find one. UConn football, Pratt & Whitney Stadium's primary tenant, happened to have a bye week preceded by a road game on the date of the eventual game. Driven by the anomaly of the COVID-19 pandemic, Exploria Stadium (as it was called then) hosted five straight USWNT games in January and February 2021. The USMNT played there between those games and returned in March of each of the next two years for official matches. Rising ticket prices have become endemic across the sports and entertainment industries. Soccer -- with high-profile events including next year's Men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- is not immune. While CONMEBOL's Copa America last year and FIFA's Club World Cup this summer -- both hosted in the United States -- sparked controversy and sparse crowds due to high ticket prices, U.S. Soccer has no influence on setting prices for those games. He said that the starting price for a U.S. national team game is often cheaper than that of an MLS game or a soccer game run by other promoters in the same city. Those numbers vary greatly by city, event and ticket tier, but a U.S. Soccer ticket is typically 25-30% cheaper than tickets for the home team in that same venue, a federation spokesperson said. For a start, the resale market -- which neither U.S. Soccer nor event organizers control -- is where prices balloon. A front-row seat to the USMNT vs. Ecuador friendly in Austin last week cost as low as $84 before fees (which can add up quickly) roughly a week before the game. Dynamic pricing, which means costs fluctuate based on demand, is also a factor. The starting price for a ticket to the USWNT's game against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium this month was $45, Terry said. But the 11,500-seat stadium has sold out every Kansas City Current NWSL game to date, and high demand for the uniquely small venue choice means that current prices trend higher. Terry said that U.S. Soccer's pricing model rewards fans who purchase early, and he argues U.S. Soccer games are "more accessible than many other sporting entities in this country." "We've always believed soccer should be for everyone," American Outlaws co-founder Justin Brunken said in July. "This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers -- cost -- and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing and support together." Still, that partnership is limited to American Outlaws members and not the wider public. U.S. Soccer is experimenting with free parking for everyone at this month's USWNT game in Hartford. The federation worked with sponsor Coca-Cola for discounted concessions earlier this year at a men's national team game in Nashville. USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino believes his side need to be more "clinical" after their 1-1 draw against Ecuador. U.S. Soccer doesn't have a home stadium where the federation can control food and beverage or parking costs, which leaves those prices to be set by the venue. At the USWNT's game in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this year, U.S. Soccer spent nearly $38,000 to offset concession costs and create a $2 menu for hot dogs, popcorn, nachos and water. The idea came based on direct feedback from U.S. Soccer's Fan Council, which was established in 2018 as a bridge of communication between fans and the federation. The five members of the Fan Council attend as many national team games as possible and gather fan feedback on-site both informally and formally, in addition to the input they get from fans online. They identify common themes that they then bring to U.S. Soccer in quarterly in-person meetings and monthly virtual meetings. "I can say that over the past year, we've seen some really exciting, tangible changes that reflect fan feedback." Stephen said that fans communicated a desire for better concession prices after experiencing them at a game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, which is known for its affordable food and beverages as low as $2. Stephen said that communication around gameday from the federation has improved in simple ways, like a "Know Before You Go" website page detailing parking and other logistics. "The future's looking very bright for future council members and fans in general, because U.S. Soccer is very actively engaging, and they're very interested in what fans are feeling for the matchday experience." Scheduling strong, diverse opponents -- especially from Europe -- is increasingly a challenge for U.S. Soccer. European men's opponents are available for friendlies in March and June next year ahead of the World Cup, but those windows are not replicated in the three years that follow. Of the 10 international windows between now and the 2027 Women's World Cup, six of them are being utilized by UEFA for World Cup qualifying and playoffs, in addition to more Nations League programming. The USWNT won't be able to schedule a European opponent in 2026 until next October, and even then, they won't be able to play teams participating in the World Cup qualifying playoffs. King said he already has "feelers" out to six potential European teams for that window. The need for the four-time World Cup champion USWNT to play strong teams, along with the Europe's crowded official schedule, has led to the U.S. women more frequently playing Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea as opponents in recent years. Among U.S. Soccer's solutions for scheduling challenges is collaboration with Mexico's federation, the FMF, which gives those visiting teams two different high-quality opponents in relatively close locations. (Mexico frequently "hosts" games in the U.S., which creates its own challenges to find four venues in a week). Four days after Ecuador plays the USMNT in Austin this month, Ecuador will play Mexico in Guadalajara. New Zealand's women's team will play Mexico twice before traveling to Kansas City for a game against the USWNT this month. There are also venue challenges that go beyond cost and location. An overtly pro-Korean crowd for a recent USMNT friendly at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, was the latest reminder of that. "The cool part about the United States is that we have people from all over the world who live here, and regardless of what jersey they wear when they come to one of our games, they're in our ecosystem, and they might be a future coach," Terry said. And so, I think it's on us to figure out: How can we be in service to them? It's an opportunity to connect with a lot of people and bring them under our umbrella. There is one important addendum: That entire approach of spreading out games applies to friendly matches. "The flip side of that is, for an official game -- a Nations League qualifier or World Cup qualifier -- we're doing the complete opposite," King said. For those official matches, winning -- and qualifying -- trumps all, which helps explain why Columbus, Ohio, has hosted multiple USMNT vs. Mexico World Cup qualifying games in February, the dead of winter. King said the federation worked with former USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter in the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle "to make sure that the guiding principle on that was putting our team in the best possible light to win by having a raucous home crowd." The USMNT has dealt with stifling heat and flooded fields for road qualifying games across Concacaf. "It wasn't a surprise for us to play on a Saturday at noon in Azteca Stadium in June [against Mexico for World Cup qualifying]," King said. But at the same time, how can we put our players in the best possible environment to win, when the majority of them are playing in northern climates, whether that's MLS teams or in Europe? It's also not uncommon for us to go to Honduras and play midweek at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. U.S. Soccer's meticulous planning is not the norm everywhere. "The further out that we can get these games on the books is just a huge source of satisfaction with regards to knowing what we're doing, knowing where we're going from a commercial standpoint. King said that U.S. Soccer intentionally has not scheduled June's men's games yet so that they can book an opponent in reaction to December's World Cup Draw.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A European nation who have lost every single World Cup qualifier, could have a better chance of qualifying for the tournament if they suffer another defeat to Romania. Placed in Group H in World Cup qualifying, San Marino, whose team is predominantly semi-professional, have lost all seven of their fixtures - conceding 32 and scoring just one. Romania are third in the group, three points behind Bosnia and Herzegovina with one game remaining. Romania finishing second in Group H would see them qualify for the World Cup play-offs, where there will be a total of 16 teams. 12 will be second-placed teams, with a further four spots going to the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League group winners who have not already qualified. Incredibly, San Marino did win their Nations League group in 2024/25 - topping group D1 in League D with seven points from four games against Gibraltar and Liechenstein. That earned the minnows promotion to League C but also gives them a genuine outside chance of a historic World Cup appearance in the United States. This feat would not be particularly difficult for San Marino, who have been on the receiving end of many thrashings over the years. They would then be set for two play-off matches against higher-ranked teams from the divisions above, where two wins would see them qualify for the tournament in North America next year. Because of UEFA's system, San Marino may also sneak into the play-offs if Sweden or Northern Ireland finish in the top two of their groups as they too were Nations League group winners. However, a Bosnia win against Romania on 15 November could crush San Marino's dreams. Josh is a sports journalist who specialises in football and WWE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Keane admits that Manchester United should be "pretty ashamed" of their decision to pull out of the FA Cup in 2000 when they were defending champions - instead choosing to play in the Club World Cup. They instead chose to to play in the inaugural World Team Championship, now known as the Club World Cup. Chelsea went on to win the competition, beating Aston Villa in the final at Wembley. Sir Alex Ferguson's side would only win one of their three games in the eight-team Club World Championship in Brazil - finishing third in Group B behind Mexican side Necaxa and eventual runners-up Vasco da Gama. Keane's comments began with Gary Neville saying on The Stick to Football podcast: "I think one thing that was definitely better back in the day was the FA Cup. That was magic when we were playing." How mad was that, your team pulling out of the FA Cup." United claimed it was an opportunity "to compete for the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions" - even if they did fail to bring the trophy home. It didn't stop their ultimate goal of retaining their Premier League title, which they did by 18 points. Ferguson claimed at the time: "We can't go for them all. We're in a no-win situation here. The criticism we would have received if we hadn't gone [to Brazil] would have been unthinkable ‚Äì and that's a Scotsman speaking."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colombia and Argentina were the first nations to book their spots in the final four, making for an enticing all-South American matchup and guaranteeing CONMEBOL representation in the final on 19 October. The Colombians came through a thrilling quarter-final clash by winning 3-2 against Spain, the top-ranked men's senior side and reigning Olympic champions. Up stepped Neyser, Millonarios' talismanic striker, to equalise before securing his hat-trick with an 89th minute winner to send Colombia through.

In the other quarter-final, record champions Argentina dispatched Mexico 2-0 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Mart√≠nez Pr√°danos. Soon after the restart, Mateo Silvetti pounced on a loose ball to slot home to double the Argentine advantage. Mexico had no answer and ended the affair with nine men, after Diego Ochoa and Tahiel Jim√©nez were given their marching orders. The semi-final lineup was set in stone on Sunday (12 October), as Africa's remaining representatives Morocco will meet 2013 champions France in Valpara√≠so. This is the first time since 2015 that a side from Africa has reached the semi-finals, since Mali and Senegal. Morocco will meet France, who, after a dramatic round of 16 victory against Japan, had a more comfortable passage into the final four by defeating Norway 2-1. A first-half brace from 19-year-old Sa√Ømon Bouabr√© put Les Bleus in cruise control, and from then on it was about maintaining that grip. Rasmus Holten's 83rd minute goal proved to be no more than a consolation, as Norway suffered their first defeat of the tournament at the expense of France's progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The international break is frustrating because you want to see your club in action ‚Äì but the consolation is that you do get some interesting quotes from players when they speak to the media in their home country, usually in a less guarded way than how they speak to the English media. It turns out that goes for managers too ‚Äì they are always very cautious in pressers, but more relaxed in their native language, speaking outside the direct context of a game. Enzo Maresca has been back in Italy speaking about his summer success with Chelsea at the Club World Cup. This is my second season at the club, but we'd never won in the last minute at home before. The reaction that led to the sending off was instinctive, but maybe it was worth it,‚Äù the coach said of his sending off against Liverpool last weekend. ‚ÄúWe're talking about one of the biggest clubs in the world, one that has struggled in recent years for various reasons,‚Äù Maresca continued in quotes translated by Football Italia. Beating Liverpool was huge ‚Äì certainly one on Maresca's biggest results so far. It was a classic situation: Everyone had PSG as favourites,‚Äù the manager said. There were several injuries, but it was worth it and I wouldn't change anything given the result. Your email address will not be published. Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 13 ‚Äì Rights group Fossil Free Football has criticised FIFA for ‚Äúclimate change complicity‚Äù after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said it could be too hot to stage the World Cup in summer. In a statement, Fossil Free Football said that ‚Äúinstead of fighting to hold on to a climate safe for summer football as we have always known it, FIFA has actively contributed to the global heating that ensures it is no longer possible. The 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia could face a similar rejig. However, this summer's major tournaments ‚Äì the expanded 32-team Club World Cup in the United States and Euro 2025 in Switzerland ‚Äì proved that climate change is affecting football worldwide with high temperatures heavily affecting matches. FIFA is also considering expanding the Club World Cup from 32 teams to 48 teams and staging the finals, from 2029 onwards, on a biannual basis, even if the tournament is not yet financially stable. Saudi Arabia's SURJ invested $1 billion in streaming platform DAZN which acquired the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup for $1 billion. FIFA claimed to have generated more than $2 billion from the tournament. At the same time, FIFA signed up Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, as its leading partner last year. Fossil Free Football said: ‚ÄúIt's time for FIFA to stop actively making this crisis worse. This means breaking its ties to Aramco and other polluters and reversing the expansionist agenda opposed by almost everyone in football.‚Äù The actions of the fossil fuel industry and their allies now threaten to take summer World Cups from us, an iconic part of being a fan in this part of the world.</p>
