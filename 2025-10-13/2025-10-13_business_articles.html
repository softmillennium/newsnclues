                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stock futures were little changed on Monday night, following a winning session in which the major averages recovered a chunk of their losses suffered at the end of last week. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by just 36 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures hovered just above the flatline. The broad market index also clawed back more than half of Friday's steep decline. The Dow had its best day since Sept. 11, broke a five-day losing streak and recovered two-thirds of Friday's losses. The moves came after a Truth Social post from President Donald Trump eased investor worries about growing trade tensions between China and the U.S. "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine," Trump's Sunday post said. That sent tech stocks such as Oracle, AMD and Nvidia up broadly, leading the market higher. "Trade policy remains a key driver for US financial markets this year, and last week saw a sharp re-escalation in tensions between the US and China," Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. However, the history of Trump-Xi negotiations suggests that escalation is often followed by tactical truces, and rare earth minerals versus shipping fees could ultimately seal a deal." Investors on Tuesday will look to keep this momentum going, as major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are set to report third-quarter earnings. Friday's sell-off may have had silver lining: it may have delayed the bull market peak, according to Leuthold Group chief investment officer Doug Ramsey. "If this cycle is fated to end with anything loosely resembling a traditional topping process, then the eventual bull market peak has been pushed out at least a couple more months. Still, Ramsey noted he sees troubling trends in this market, including a recently steep drop in S&P 500 cyclical stocks relative to defensive names. "Such action is troubling; although, our best guess is that the final bull market peak will not occur until the warnings from our traditional bellwethers have become more pronounced." Goldman Sachs announced Monday that it agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank. The bank will pay $665 million in cash for Industry Ventures and up to an additional $300 million based on the firm's performance through 2030. "Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world," CEO David Solomon said in the release. Stock futures were little changed after a big rally on Wall Street during the cash session. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by just 19 points.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday that artificial intelligence could become a larger part of global GDP as the technology spreads across industries. Tan said the current global GDP sits around $110 trillion, with 30% of that figure "valued from industries related to knowledge-based, technology-intensive." "And you put in generative AI, you create intelligence in a lot of other aspects of society," Tan continued. "That 30% say will grow to 40% of all GDP. If AI grows and becomes responsible for a larger piece of global GDP as Tan predicts, it would be a boon to the nascent tech sector and all the industries it relies on. Broadcom makes chips and networking equipment and has been a huge beneficiary of the AI boom as hyperscalers buy up its products. Broadcom and OpenAI announced their official partnership on Monday, saying they would jointly build and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators. Broadcom shares surged in response to the news, up 9.88% by market close. Broadcom and OpenAI's deal is the latest in a slew of pricey partnerships among key Big Tech players related to AI. Tan said OpenAI is "one of those few players in the forefront of creating foundation models," and noted that even as a private company, the ChatGPT maker is worth about $500 billion. According to Tan, Broadcom's "hard-nosed" approach to business doesn't keep the company from looking several years in the future "at this phenomenon, this wave called generative AI." Broadcom is tight-lipped about its customers, but said earlier this year it was developing new AI chips with three large cloud customers. Management announced last month it had secured $10 billion in chip orders from a fourth unnamed client. Tan told Cramer that Broadcom is working closely with "about seven players," four of which he defined as "real customers," or ones "who have given us production purchase orders at scale." "We feel very good about it," Tan said of Broadcom's partnerships. "Because each of these guys need a lot of compute capacity for them to basically play in this game and eventually win this game of creating the best foundation model in the world."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an interview with The New York Times published on Friday, Benioff appeared eager for President Donald Trump to send federal troops to his company's hometown, inserting himself into a national debate about whether the president should call the National Guard into various Democrat-led cities that Trump has maligned. Benioff subsequently softened his comments, writing on X on Sunday that safety is "first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders." In posts on his social network X on Sunday, he said it would be "the only solution at this point," and that "nothing else has or will work." Musk still has big business in and around San Francisco. His artificial intelligence startup xAI, which owns X, has a sizable office in the city, and his brain computer interface company, Neuralink, recently leased a large property in South San Francisco. Tesla relocated to Texas, but the automaker's engineering headquarters remains in Palo Alto, just south of San Francisco. Musk's call for U.S. troops came in response to social media posts by Tom Wolf, who describes himself as a "a formerly homeless recovering addict in San Francisco," and an "advocate for addiction recovery." "If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away," Wolf wrote. Musk shared Wolf's post to his more than 227 million listed followers on X. Neither Benioff nor Musk immediately responded to requests for comment. CNBC also reached out to Tesla, xAI and Salesforce for comment but did not hear back. Local officials loudly opposed the idea of bringing in federal troops. Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco's district attorney, wrote on X after the Benioff interview that, "I can't be silent any longer." Jenkins accused Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of turning "so-called public safety and immigration enforcement into a form of government sponsored violence against U.S. citizens, families, and ethnic groups," and said that if anyone is using excessive force or illegally harassing residents, "I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day." San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who defeated incumbent London Breed in November in part by promising to clean up San Francisco's streets, wrote on X on Sunday that "crime is down 30% and tent encampments are at an all-time low." He didn't directly address Benioff or Dreamforce, but noted that tens of thousand of people are coming to the city for activities including concerts and Fleet Week, and that public safety is critical. In Benioff's follow-up comments after his interview with the Times, the Salesforce CEO praised Lurie's efforts to increase police hiring and retain law enforcement. Dreamforce, which launched in 2003, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Thursday. Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on X that "We don't need the National Guard," but he used his post to go after a frequent local target for techies: Chesa Boudin and progressives. Boudin was district attorney in San Francisco until 2022, when he was removed in a recall election after critics railed against what they viewed as his unwillingness to prosecute violent criminals. "We need new judges who are not hardcore Chesa Boudin-style activists who work to keep drug dealers out of jail even though the police, the district attorney and the people of SF want them locked up," he wrote.

Amazon Web Services has hired Chet Kapoor, the former CEO of DataStax, as its new vice president of security services and observability, according to an internal email obtained by Business Insider. Kapoor will report directly to AWS CEO Matt Garman, who announced the move in a companywide email on Monday. Kapoor will work alongside AWS CISO Amy Herzog. Garman said Kapoor will lead efforts to strengthen AWS's security offerings as the company expands its AI business. The hire underscores AWS's push to tighten security around its AI products. At DataStax, Kapoor oversaw Astra DB, a database built on the open-source Apache Cassandra project, and spearheaded its integration with real-time AI capabilities, Garman said in the email. In the past year, the company has lost some executives, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while adding others, such as former Microsoft exec Julia White as marketing chief.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank. Goldman is paying $665 million in cash and equity, and up to $300 million more based on the firm's future performance through 2030, the bank said. Goldman Sachs is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, part of the self-identified "growth engine" of the investment bank. By identifying and making bets on startups, the venture capital firm can help Goldman create a pipeline of investments for its wealthy clients, as well as provide solutions to tech entrepreneurs. San Francisco-based Industry Ventures has helped pioneer aspects of the American VC market since its founding 25 years ago, according to Goldman CEO David Solomon. "Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world," Solomon said in the release. "By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers," said Hans Swildens, founder and CEO of Industry Ventures. Industry Ventures has made more than 1,000 investments and said its annual performance was an internal rate of return of 18%. The bank said it expects that all 45 employees of the venture firm will join Goldman. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. While that might be one of the more expensive grocery runs a Costco shopper might make, it is one that could realistically happen. There are two ways to buy bars and coins from the wholesale club: online and in-store at certain warehouses. The first step — step zero, if you will — is to get a Costco membership, since precious metals are exclusively available to members. The basic Gold Star membership gives you access, but if you're planning to spend several thousand dollars on gold and silver, it might make sense to spring for the executive upgrade. For the additional $65, executive members get 2% rewards on most purchases, including precious metals. (Executive members can also shop early at the warehouse, but that's another story.) Gold, silver, and platinum are listed on Costco.com on a precious metals page in the jewelry and watches category. (The items were previously listed under sports memorabilia and collectibles, which made them a bit harder for the casual buyer to track down.) When products are priced at or near the commodity market's "spot" price, they can sell out extremely quickly. Silver also tends to sell out quickly and follows a similar pricing pattern. In fact, silver's market rally of nearly 80% this year so far has outpaced gold's 56% increase. Plus, silver's lower unit price — it's at an all-time high of $52 per ounce — means more options for shoppers who are curious about buying metals but don't want to fork over the price of a well-used car just yet. Costco has responded to fluctuations in demand by limiting the quantities of a particular item a member is allowed to purchase in one transaction and over a 24-hour period. Once an online purchase is completed, Costco estimates about three to five days for delivery, typically via UPS or FedEx. Same-day grocery orders must be placed separately, via Instacart. Precious metals are also occasionally available at some warehouses — if you know where to look. Sometimes it's easier to spot: the store will put a large sign near the entrance encouraging arriving shoppers to check out seasonal or specialty bars. The jewelry case also has a stack of paper forms that shoppers must fill out with the item SKU and quantity they wish to purchase. Voila — they now own a small slab of expensive metal. There are three last things Costco shoppers should note. Although Costco stands behind everything it sells, precious metals are excluded from the company's unusually generous return policy. It also will not adjust the price of gold, silver, or platinum after purchase. The second thing is that it generally does not make mathematical sense to finance gold or silver purchases with credit card debt or other interest-bearing payment options. While some metals buyers use credit cards in order to take advantage of rewards schemes, it's widely understood that any balance should be promptly paid off with cash, since interest charges can offset any card points or increase in the metal's value. Lastly, some gold and silver buyers have found that selling metals can be harder than buying them (at least at the prices they would prefer). Coin shops are not likely to offer the full spot price for gold or silver, since they need to leave room to make a profit when they sell the metal. Selling without a strategy can have unexpected costs.</p>

Tiffany Ng, a 24-year-old tech and culture writer based in New York, was too attached to her iPhone, so she did what humans do when trying to tame an unruly beast. Ng felt she was spending too much time staring at her little screen and wanted an escape. Over 40% of American adults — and 62% of those under 30 — say they are on their phones "almost constantly," according to a Pew Research survey conducted in late 2023. Most Americans, including 81% of adults under 30, believe they use their phone too much, a 2022 Gallup survey found. Ng's desire to turn the supercomputer in her pocket into a makeshift landline is also one that's shared by other zoomers and millennials. Some Americans are going full Luddite, giving up smartphones altogether in favor of so-called dumb phones, while some parents are easing their kids into technology by opting for classic landlines instead of iPhones. There are also plenty of people who want a break from their screens but aren't quite ready or able to ditch the conveniences of modern technology altogether. So instead of giving up their smartphones, some young people are creating setups that mimic landlines — by chaining their phone to the wall or creating a wall mount to "hang up the phone" rather than carry it with them all the time. Yalda Uhls, a research psychologist and the founding CEO of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers at UCLA, said studies have shown that creating physical distance between yourself and your phone can make a big difference. "If it's separate from you, that's the only time people stop really thinking about their phone." Maddie DeVico, a 31-year-old who works in sales for a software company in Denver, said she was feeling overwhelmed by her reliance on technology and trapped by the constant need to respond to messages quickly. So she took some leftover clay and made her own phone docking station. "And I just noticed this mental freeness that came with disconnecting. She said her screen time went down by three hours each day. Her friends learned that they were no longer going to get an immediate text back from her, and she even started leaving the phone in its dock when she left the house. She suddenly had more time to do other things, like cooking and crafting. She started spending more time in her garden just looking at bugs. "I was so shocked with the amount of stress that left my body. When her friends come over for dinner, she also has them keep their phones away from the table, and as a result, she said they're having more meaningful discussions about personal topics. After she posted about the phone dock on TikTok, she racked up nearly a million views and heard from hundreds of others about how they, too, are trying to bring back hanging up the phone. "I think we're just really genuinely trying to go back to living simpler without the chaos and without all the distractions," she said. Uhls, the UCLA researcher who often works with members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, said young people are acutely aware of how much time they spend on their phones, and often make efforts to spend less time on them. She said even though they spend a lot of time on social media, they recognize that it's not particularly deep or fulfilling. Some Gen Zers are so desperate for connection that they've embraced the Luddite movement. At an anti-technology rally in New York City last month, dozens of young people put Apple on a mock trial and smashed iPhones. Chaining her phone to a wall was one of several experiments Ng has done as part of her newsletter, Cyber Celibate, which she uses to explore our relationship with technology. She's also printed out her TikTok "For You" page to read like a newspaper and sent carrier pigeons instead of texts. For the chain to the wall experiment, Ng gave her phone a full charge, unplugged it, and then put it on its leash by making creative use of a chain link belt. She was committed to leaving it there, even when she left the house, and not giving it another charge for a full week. The first couple of days, Ng said she would look forward to going home and being able to scroll on her phone. But when she finally opened her special media feed, that excitement was met with the "very anti-climactic experience of looking at pictures of Alix Earle," an influencer. "I don't want to sound overdramatic, but toward the end, it really felt like I was reentering real life in a way," Ng said. Ng said she thinks Gen Z is pining for simpler technology and simpler times (she recently was delighted to learn what dial-up internet was). While the experiment lasted a week, she still continues to actively leave her phone in another room, or even leave it behind when she gets out of the house, somewhere close by. Catherine Goetze is the creator of CatGPT, an online media brand focused on AI education. The millennial content creator worked in tech before amassing hundreds of thousands of followers with helpful videos intended to make AI more accessible. So a couple of years ago, she bought an old rotary phone and some special parts and turned it into a Bluetooth device connected to her cellphone. She could also make calls by simply picking up the phone and dialing. This summer, when she posted a video showing off the landline phone she'd been using for years, her comments were full of people saying they needed one too. She said she thinks the orders are from a mix of millennials who are nostalgic for the landlines of their past, and zoomers who don't remember having a landline but are just as nostalgic and apt to romanticize that time, as evidenced by the resurgence in shows like "Friends" and Y2K fashion. Goetze said she doesn't think most people want to live in a world without modern technology, but rather one where they are using that technology mindfully, rather than being used by it.</p>

If you think your burger, burrito, or cold brew already costs too much, brace yourself — restaurant groups say they would have to raise prices by 30% just to stay profitable amid rising costs. In a new survey from the restaurant management software company Toast, nearly half of restaurant operators said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation, tariffs, and labor costs continue to climb. The National Restaurant Association estimates that to maintain a modest 5% profit margin, the average restaurant would need to raise prices by 30.3% — a move many owners fear would scare customers away. Business Insider reported in September that grocery prices have sharply increased in recent months, reaching their highest level since August 2022, and inflation now exceeds the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The price hikes are tied to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy, which a Yale economist told Business Insider in April is expected to cost the average consumer about $3,800 this year — and that was before Trump renewed trade tensions with China on Friday, announcing a new round of tariffs on the country's imports. "While tariffs can be enacted with a pen stroke, it takes years to rewire global supply chains," John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at connected supply chain platform e2open, told Business Insider in May. Not only are their own food and labor costs higher, but consumers are also pulling back on spending, dining out less, and seeking promotional deals when they do. National Restaurant Association President & CEO Michelle Korsmo said in an August statement that operators are reluctant to raise prices because it makes consumers even less likely to dine out, further jeopardizing the industry, but they "may have no choice" given their increasing costs.</p>

In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. All they did was outsmart some "predatory" automated trading bots. In the dog-eat-dog Wild West of crypto trading, it was fair game, not fraud. That's what defense attorneys for Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are set to argue when the brothers' criminal case heads to trial in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday. If convicted of the conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges against them, the brothers — both highly educated in math and computer sciences — face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count. Prosecutors say the pair's 12-second Ethereum blockchain theft in April 2023 was "meticulously planned" over at least three months, right down to their online searches for "how to wash crypto" and "top crypto lawyers." "Money launder statue of limitations," prosecutors say they searched at one point, misspelling statute. The brothers, prosecutors allege, used "bait transactions" to find three victim traders and study their trading habits. They then "lured" the victims' trading bots into a carefully set, fast-acting trap. Prosecutors say they exploited a software "vulnerability" that let them quickly glimpse their prey's private transaction information and "tamper" with the purchase in a classic bait-and-switch. Instead of generating an anticipated windfall, the victims found that their $25 million had purchased a pile of effectively worthless, illiquid junk crypto. "In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency." The brothers' lawyers have told prosecutors that they are not interested in even considering taking a plea, prosecutors revealed at a hearing on Thursday. Instead, the defense is set to push back hard against the prosecution's allegations, at trial, before a jury. "There's no central authority" governing the Ethereum blockchain, Patrick Looby, who represents the elder brother, James, told US District Court Judge Jessica G. L Clarke during oral arguments in June. Instead, economic incentives guide parties' behavior," Looby argued. Prosecutors, he said, are alleging conduct that the government has never sought to criminalize, he argued, including taking advantage of a software vulnerability or using a crypto transaction as "bait." And for that reason as well, there's no alleged intent to defraud," he told the judge. The so-called victims "made very risky bets on a strategy that didn't pay out," he added. "Before this indictment, no Ethereum user would have understood that thwarting a predatory attempt by 'bots' engaged in market manipulation could lead to criminal charges," they wrote. "No court has ever applied these statutes to similar transactions," they argued. "And the Peraire-Buenos had no reason to know that their alleged conduct may be considered unlawful." Prospective jurors will be told on Tuesday that the trial may run into the first week of November.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This week, America will get an off-brand clue of how the economy is faring as earnings season heats up. However, a trio of economists said it won't replace key data that isn't being published during the government shutdown. "If the shutdown continues, private data and earnings calls offer useful clues — especially around company performance relative to expectations," Gregory Daco, EY's chief economist, said. "But they're no substitute for broader and more consistent government data." "There's a little bit of a guessing game around how much of this is unique to the company, how much of this is unique to the sector, how much of this is the polish and spin that inevitably accompanies talking to investors," he said. Terrazas said the government has vetted and transparent methodologies for its data — people can visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to find a whole page on calculations. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said bank CEOs are prone to saying in earnings calls that the consumer is doing well, but that has some caveats: consumers still need to buy necessities, and some are having a harder time than others. That means these calls may not capture the full picture of consumer spending. "Earnings calls will help to give us color, " Hamrick said, "but it doesn't give us that fully fleshed out view that things like the CPI and the monthly employment situation read." The Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday that the consumer price index inflation report will be released on October 24 instead of its originally planned date of October 15. The September data is also needed for Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment. It helps the Federal Reserve make its interest rate decisions, helps economists understand changes to the labor force, wage growth, and unemployment, and helps job seekers identify industries that are hiring more than others. "It's like air traffic control for the economy," Daco said. "Planes can't land safely without FAA staff — and businesses can't make sound investment or hiring decisions in a data fog.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madagascar's administration, which has in recent weeks come under heavy fire, recently spoke about an attempted coup, as the youth-led protest in the country continues to gain ground. This has led the presidency to speculate on a potential coup, after a military unit referred to as CAPSAT instructed its troops to disregard any orders from the government and support the protesters. According to CAPSAT officials, who are based on the outskirts of Antananarivo, the country's capital, they have command over all security activities and will coordinate all military branches. As reported by Reuters, General Demosthene Pikulas, who had previously served as head of the military academy, was named army chief. Another unit within the country's paramilitary gendarmerie, which had, prior to Sunday, assisted the police in tackling the protests, had also followed in CAPSAT's footsteps, deciding to disregard government instructions. "All use of force and any improper behaviour towards our fellow citizens are prohibited, as the gendarmerie is a force meant to protect people and not to defend the interests of a few individuals," the Intervention Forces of the National Gendarmerie said in a statement broadcast on Real TV. Madagascar has been ravaged by weeks of protests that began over water and electricity shortages but have since escalated into a severe political crisis. As dissatisfaction with poverty, corruption, and unemployment grew, the demonstrations, dubbed the Gen Z movement, swiftly spread to neighboring cities. To ease tensions, President Andry Rajoelina dismissed his administration on September 29 and named General Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo as prime minister on October 6. However, demonstrators rejected the decision, claiming that it did not address their concerns. A curfew has been imposed in numerous towns, and some international flights, including Air France, have been suspended owing to security concerns. Protesters continue to call for the president's resignation and improved government services.
