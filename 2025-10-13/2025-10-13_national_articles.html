Check out the die-hard Steelers fans reactions to Aaron Rodgers' being their new quarterback. Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin took a shot at Cleveland Browns general manager Andrew Berry on Monday over the decision to trade Joe Flacco to a team within their division. Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin shouts in the first half of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns in Pittsburgh, Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025. "To be honest, it was shocking to me," Tomlin said of the trade, via Pro Football Talk. "Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us, because it doesn't make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening starter to a divisional opponent that's hurting in that area. Cleveland Browns managing and principal partner Jimmy Haslam, left, and executive vice president, football operations and general manager Andrew Berry, middle, and executive vice president, partner JW Johnson watch during training camp at CrossCountry Mortgage Campus on July 28, 2025. Tomlin went on to praise Flacco's savviness as he gets more ingrained into the Bengals' offense. His performance in that game gave fans and experts the expectation that he would help the Bengals on Sunday. Flacco had 219 passing yards and two touchdown passes, but the Packers came out on top 27-18.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on mounting concerns as the shutdown continues on 'Special Report.' The contests featured a grand total of two fights. And the now lengthy shutdown sparked two extraordinary verbal brawls in the halls of Congress between lawmakers. NHL referees Gord Dwyer and Mitch Dunning worked the Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins tilt Wednesday night in DC. Perhaps the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms could have summoned Dwyer and Dunning up to Capitol Hill to dole out a few ten-minute misconducts beforehand. hollered House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said Democrats, led in the House by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are putting health care access at risk by refusing the GOP's federal funding plan. Tempers exploded as Lawler lay in wait outside the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for a shutdown smackdown after Jeffries concluded his now-daily press conference. yelled an animated Jeffries at Lawler, jabbing his index finger toward his colleague's chest but never poking him. "So just keep your mouth shut!" There were multiple rounds of vocal fisticuffs between Members and Congressional leaders. And Lawler was nearby, serving as "fourth man in." "This is absurd," seethed an exasperated Johnson. "Do you want me to answer the question?" "You're not actually answering the question," countered Gallego. The multiple rounds of brawls in the halls between lawmakers were nearly unprecedented in Congress. The shutdown smackdowns featured arguments about health care. Lawler waved around legislation focused on the Democrats' push during the shutdown: a package to extend Obamacare subsidies. "If you believe in it so much!" Yours truly asked Johnson about Lawler confronting Jeffries and his decision to step out of the Speaker's Office to engage Kelly and Gallego. "Are you concerned and is it incumbent upon you as the Speaker to try to lower this temperature?" Johnson added that the contretemps "concerns me." But I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff. And so is it better for them to be physically separated right now? Lawmakers aren't the only ones raging. Thousands of federal workers are fuming at the shutdown. The administration is now firing federal workers. "Right now, many families are paying the price for political gridlock that they didn't cause," said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley. Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., represents 44,000 federal employees in her district near Washington, DC. She notes that Maryland has lost 15,000 federal jobs since President Trump took office in January. "I believe that (the firings) are not only unethical and immoral, but illegal for him to be RIF-ing people during a shutdown. There's no new authority granted to the President or OMB during a shutdown," said Elfreth. "I don't believe in negotiating by threat. It also shows that I think they have the weaker hand and that they're losing the PR battle nationally to resort to threats." While the shutdown is the main event, the undercard is a fight between Democrats and Johnson over Grijalva to succeed her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. The elder Grijalva died in March after a battle with cancer. We don't have an office," said Grijalva "So it's very much second-class citizen feeling for me." Democrats have tried on multiple occasions to compel the House to swear-in Grijalva during brief, pro forma sessions where the body gavels in and gavels out after just a few seconds. "Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles," shouted Gallego at Johnson during their confrontation in the corridor. Speaker Mike Johnson is canceling House votes for a third straight week in a bid to put pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer during the government shutdown. But Grijalva wrote to the Speaker last week demanding the House swear her in immediately. And the House still hasn't sworn her in. Circumstances were different this spring when the House GOP majority dwindled to a net seat of one. Republicans needed as many votes as they could muster to pass parliamentary frameworks for the Big, Beautiful Bill. Johnson swore-in Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., a day after they won special elections. "These guys worked hard and they earned the position," said Johnson when he met with them back in April. "These gentlemen are going to come in and help us deliver the America First agenda." Johnson noted that swearing-in Fine and Patronis made "the margin a little more comfortable" for House Republicans. So Johnson is keeping the House out of session for now. House Democrats are returning to Capitol Hill this week to make a point of Johnson keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. Regardless, pouring everyone back into the Capitol would likely trigger the Congressional equivalent of a line brawl. There are unwritten rules about hockey fights. You don't sucker punch someone. You don't knee your opponent. In hockey, both sides warm up on their own side of the red line before the game and between periods. Violation of that code might trigger a big brawl. Lawmakers from both sides seemingly left their own side of the rink to pick fights with the other side. Gallego and Kelly outside the Speaker's Office. But lawmakers are apparently ignoring these unwritten rules. The government shutdown soon enters its third week and everyone is dropping their gloves.

Wichita police are asking for the public's help identifying a woman reportedly taken by force early Sunday morning — an incident that has left neighbors uneasy. Authorities posted photos and surveillance footage showing the woman last seen around 2 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 12, in the 1400 block of North Volutsia, between Grove and Hillside. Investigators said they have pursued multiple leads throughout the day and thanked the community for its support. "We've worked throughout the day on this investigation, following up on numerous leads, and we appreciate the public's help," the department shared in a post on X. Police said they are considering all possibilities and have enlisted help from regional and federal agencies. The 20-second clip shows a woman being dragged away from the front door as she screams for help. Surveillance footage released by Wichita police shows a woman being pulled away from a front door as she screams for help early Sunday morning in the 1400 block of North Volutsia. The footage appears to have been captured by a residential security camera, according to authorities, a common feature in the neighborhood. Investigators enhanced the video's audio to reduce background noise, hoping someone might recognize the woman's voice. Police urged residents to review the footage carefully and contact detectives at 316-268-4407 with any information. "Your assistance is vital in helping us ensure her safety," the department wrote on Facebook. Wichita police are asking for the public's help identifying a woman seen in this video, reportedly taken by force early Sunday. One resident, who recently returned from visiting family in Mexico, said the situation has her worried for young women in the area. But, always, I believe there have always been kidnappings," she told KAKE News, adding that she had never seen anything like this happen in her neighborhood. As of Monday afternoon, police reported no significant updates. Investigators told Fox News Digital that they are continuing to analyze the video frame by frame, looking for any details that could help identify the people involved.

Penn State Nittany Lions athletic director Pat Kraft made the decision to fire head football coach James Franklin, and he told reporters on Monday that it wasn't just the three-game losing streak that led to the decision. Franklin's departure is a shock to college football, as the leader in the locker room since 2014 parts ways with the Nittany Lions, who will have a whopping $50 million buyout to pay him. Kraft said he was "looking at everything" after Penn State's loss to Northwestern, 22-21, on Saturday. Penn State athletic director Pat Kraft gives head football coach James Franklin a big hug following a 33-24 win over Indiana at Beaver Stadium Saturday, Oct. 28, 2023, in State College, Pa. (IMAGN) "I felt after sitting down Saturday and looking at everything, at where we were in terms of the best interest of the athletes and where the program was going that we had to make the hard decision," Kraft told reporters, via Sports Illustrated. This is a Penn State program that was ranked No. They went 3-0 to begin, but have been in a free fall since. It came to a head against an unranked Northwestern team, as fans' chants to fire Franklin roared even louder than they were when Oregon went into Beaver Stadium and handed them their first loss. Kraft and Franklin have had a longstanding friendship as well as a professional relationship, making his firing hard on many levels. "James Franklin is a good friend who has always carried himself with dignity, and represented Penn State with absolute class," Kraft explained. "We are all fortunate to have had James Franklin to lead this program for more than a decade and we wish nothing but the best for him and his family." The Nittany Lions will be led by Terry Smith, Franklin's assistant coach, who has been named the interim head coach. Franklin took over as Penn State's head coach before the 2014 season after leading Vanderbilt for three seasons in the same role. He was in his 12th season at Penn State, having brought the team to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season. They will head into a matchup with Iowa next week, but the schedule gets much harder from there. 7 Indiana on Nov. 8, and four or more losses would keep them out of the College Football Playoff for this season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>North Carolina state House Speaker Destin Hall, R-Caldwell, left, speaks while state Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham, listens during a news conference at the North Carolina Legislative Building in Raleigh, N.C., Sept. 11, 2025 (AP Photo/Gary D. Robertson, File) RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Republican legislative leaders announced plans Monday to vote next week on redrawing the state's U.S. House district map, taking up President Donald Trump's call to secure more GOP seats nationwide and resist rival moves by Democrats. Davis won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points, so shifting slightly portions of the district covering more than 20 northeastern counties could help a Republican candidate in a strong GOP year. But it could weaken districts held by GOP incumbents. The state's top Republican legislators said their planned action follows Trump's “call urging legislatures across the country to take action to nullify Democrat redistricting efforts.” Davis wasn't mentioned by name in their news release. Trump has won North Carolina's electoral votes all three times that he's been on the presidential ballot. But state House Democratic leader Robert Reives said Monday his GOP colleagues “are stealing a congressional district in order to shield themselves from accountability at the ballot box.” California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own redistricting plan aimed at helping their party win five additional seats, a plan needing voter approval in November to be implemented. And lawmakers in Republican-led Missouri have approved revised U.S. House districts intended to help Republicans pick up an additional seat there. Other states also are considering redistricting, including Republican-led Indiana and Kansas. Some North Carolina GOP lawmakers focused complaints Monday on California Gov. “Picking up where Texas left off, we will hold votes in our October session to redraw North Carolina's congressional map to ensure Gavin Newsom doesn't decide the congressional majority,” Senate leader Phil Berger said. Responding on X, Newsom called Berger “another lap dog Republican” and accused the GOP of “rigging elections and trying to cover it up with lies.” North Carolina lawmakers already had planned for a multiday session starting Oct. 20. Republicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers and redistricting plans aren't subject to Democratic Gov. Addressing voters, Stein said in a statement that “shameless politicians are abusing their power to take away yours” with a redraw. An intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid. A Democratic takeover could impede Trump's agenda and lead to investigations of his actions, as occurred during his first term in office. If and how North Carolina legislators create a more favorable redraw may depend on pending litigation filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters challenging several current congressional districts, including the one represented by Davis, one of three Black representatives from North Carolina. The plaintiffs accuse Republican lawmakers of racially discriminating against Black voters by splitting or packing their voting blocs to help GOP candidates win. The trial ended in July without an immediate ruling. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party. Opponents have filed lawsuits alleging Texas' latest redistricting unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of minority residents and that Missouri's mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the state constitution. Meanwhile, Utah's Republican-led Legislature recently endorsed an altered congressional map — though in response to a court order, not Trump's demands.</p>

(AP) — Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family who was convicted in the hired killing of her former son-in-law, was sentenced Monday to life in prison for her role in the 2014 murder-for-hire of Daniel Markel. A prominent Florida State University law professor, Markel was locked in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife, Adelson's daughter, when he was gunned down in 2014 at his home in Tallahassee. Adelson, 75, was found guilty last month of first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation after a weekslong trial. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murder charge, with an additional 30 years for the other two counts, to be served consecutively. In an emotional statement ahead of the sentencing in a Tallahassee courtroom, Adelson swore she was innocent and cast her trial as a miscarriage of justice, overseen by a jury she said was unduly swayed by years of negative media coverage. But I am an innocent woman convicted of this terrible crime without evidence,” Adelson said. ▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel. Circuit Judge Stephen Everett interrupted Adelson multiple times, warning her the statements showed what he termed an “utter lack of remorse” for the crime. Shackled and dressed in a purple jail jumpsuit, Adelson stood attentively while Everett handed down the sentence. “You certainly can choose to deny your involvement and maintain innocence. The case had captivated people in Florida for more than a decade amid sordid details of a messy divorce, tensions with wealthy in-laws and custody fights leading to the killing. Adelson was the fifth person sentenced for what prosecutors say was a plot to kill Markel. Among those already serving a life sentence for the killing is Adelson's son, Charles Adelson. Defense attorneys insisted the state didn't have sufficient evidence to link the aging grandmother to the murder plot, instead emphasizing the roles played by others and casting suspicion on two of Adelson's adult children. Wendi Adelson denied involvement in the killing and has not been charged.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Education building is seen in Washington, Nov. 18, 2024. Layne Morrison, left, of Washington, and Courtney Creek, of Silver Spring, Md., who were let go from their jobs with the Education Department and a USAID funded grant respectively, hold signs about the looming government shutdown, Tuesday, Sept. 30, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, during a rally with former federal employees. WASHINGTON (AP) — A new round of layoffs at the Education Department is depleting an agency that was hit hard in the Trump administration's previous mass firings, threatening new disruption to the nation's students and schools in areas from special education to civil rights enforcement to after-school programs. The layoffs would cut the agency's workforce by nearly a fifth and leave it reduced to less than half its size when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. The cuts play into Trump's broader plan to shut down the Education Department and parcel its operations to other agencies. American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union that represents more than 2,700 department workers, said information from employees indicates cuts will decimate many offices within the agency. All but a handful of top officials are being fired at the office that implements the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that ensures millions of students with disabilities get support from their schools, the union said. Unknown numbers are being fired at the Office for Civil Rights, which investigates complaints of discrimination at the nation's schools and universities. Without staff overseeing funding for high-poverty schools or special education, schools may face delays in receiving reimbursement from the federal government, said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for the American Association of School Administrators. The Education Department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office. After the new layoffs, it would be down to fewer than 2,000. Earlier layoffs in March had roughly halved the department, but some employees were hired back after officials decided they had cut too deep. The new layoffs drew condemnation from a range of education organizations. Although states design their own competitions to distribute federal funding for after-school programs, a small team of federal officials provided guidance and support “that is absolutely essential,” said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance. “Firing that team is shocking, devastating, utterly without any basis, and it threatens to cause lasting harm,” Grant said in a statement. If upheld, the cuts will make it impossible for the government to fulfill its duties carrying out special education laws, according to a statement from the National Association of State Directors of Special Education. Neas, who helped lead the office under former President Joe Biden, said families rely on those teams to make sure states and schools are following complex disability laws. One prominent example dates to Trump's first term, when the special education office determined that Texas had illegally placed a cap on the number of students who could receive special education services in each district. “As a result, tens of thousands of children in Texas now can access the education support that they need, whereas before they couldn't,” Neas said. The government's latest layoffs are being challenged in court by the American Federation of Government Employees and other national labor unions. Their suit, filed in San Francisco, said the government's budgeting and personnel offices overstepped their authority by ordering agencies to carry out layoffs in response to the shutdown. It said the unions could not prove they were harmed by the layoffs because employees would not actually be separated for another 30 to 60 days after receiving notice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A New Jersey county that could play a decisive role in the next month's statewide elections will be reprinting its general election ballots after the Republican National Committee successfully argued that a ballot redesign unlawfully favored Democrats. The dispute began late last month when Democratic County Clerk James Hogan replaced Gloucester County's legally required party-column ballot format, where each political party's candidates appear under a single vertical heading, with an office-block layout that grouped all candidates for each race together, regardless of party. On Friday, a state appellate court ruled that Hogan's layout violated the law and ordered reprints of ballots in time for early voting later this month. The appellate court said those concerns were unsupported by evidence and ordered new, column-style ballots for in-person voting. “Defendants point to nothing in these provisions that would afford a county clerk any discretion to depart from that format.” The move was especially controversial because Gloucester is one of several swing counties in New Jersey that have trended more Republican in recent years. Of the state's 21 counties, 18 saw double-digit point swings toward President Donald Trump between 2020 and 2024. Only Burlington, Gloucester, and Cape May saw single-digit shifts, but those were still in Trump's favor. The design change could have limited Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli's influence in Gloucester County, where two competitive state Assembly seats and control of the county government are also on the line this year. Last month, Telsey ruled that the clerk's design violated state law but declined to order a reprint. Telsey did, however, order the county to reimburse Republicans $26,007 for campaign materials affected by the illegal ballot design. The “court made clear they cannot ignore state election law.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From Seattle to Baltimore, many Americans were celebrating Monday as Indigenous Peoples Day, determined to see it as a triumph of perseverance over centuries marked by trauma. Some states and cities have for decades now made the second Monday in October about honoring Native Americans alongside the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, for whom the federal holiday was declared in 1937. And President Joe Biden signed a declaration recognizing both days. President Donald Trump, keeping a vow he made in April, reversed that last week, pledging “to reclaim his extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue from the left-wing arsonists who have sought to destroy his name and dishonor his memory.” But some advocates say his posture is hardly unique among previous presidents, and they won't be dissuaded from seeking to build consensus for tribal goals. This is the first year Indigenous Peoples Day has state recognition in Montana, after a decade-long campaign in the state that is home to 12 federally recognized tribes. Democratic State Sen. Shane Morigeau, a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes who sponsored the legislation, framed it not as a holiday that would eliminate Columbus Day, but as a day of “inclusivity, healing and bringing people together.” “It's just not an us-versus-them type of day. It's a day that brings everyone together,” Morigeau said. What matters is that both Native and non-Native people can go to an event or do some self-reflection or even “go down to the river and go fishing for the day,” Morigeau said. People take a ferry after they attend a sunrise gathering during Indigenous Peoples Day on Alcatraz Island on Monday, Oct. 13, 2025, in San Francisco. Trump's proclamation lambastes this as the villainizing of a “true American hero.” “Outrageously, in recent years, Christopher Columbus has been a prime target of a vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage,” Trump's proclamation reads. Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project, said it's Trump who is making this a culture war, when the day should be about learning all aspects of history around Columbus. “If Trump wants to celebrate the good things about Christopher Columbus then let him. But also tell the truth about him and let us also celebrate Indigenous peoples' accomplishments,” said Iron Eyes, who is of the Lakota Sioux Nation. “We don't teach that in America's schools.” The National Congress of American Indians found it profoundly troubling when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced last month that the soldiers who killed more than 250 men, women and children in the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre would retain their military honors after a review launched under the Biden administration. Hegseth called it part of his effort to root out “woke” thinking. Iron Eyes, who lives on Pine Ridge, called it hurtful. “We have kids who pay attention,” Iron Eyes said.

(Andrew Harnik/Pool via AP) This has only reinvigorated the Lakota People's Law Project's campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the Wounded Knee military medals, he said. In September, Trump's Education Department redirected nearly $500 million in federal funding from schools serving large contingents of Hispanic students, promising the money instead for historically Black colleges and tribal colleges. This could double federal funding to roughly $108 million across the United States for tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs. There are 35 accredited TCUS with over 90 campuses across 15 states, most of which are in Indian Country, according to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. The consortium lauded the funds as “progress toward fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations” while also noting that it could raise more obstacles for students at non-TCU schools. Tribal appropriations were initially included in the Trump administration's efforts to claw back federal spending that it sees as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. “To have that kind of alignment with this administration is a good thing in spite of all the other rhetoric. Truly more so than anything else, I think, from a micro aspect, Indian Country really is dependent on bipartisan efforts to to make sure our issues aren't overlooked and forgotten,” Wright said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿ On Monday, after weeks of nervous anticipation and growing expectations, it finally appeared possible — though not quite guaranteed — that the brutal two-year war in Gaza is over. Hamas freed the 20 living Israeli hostages it was still holding from the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in exchange for Israel releasing around 1,700 Palestinian prisoners. Whether that is true remains to be seen. Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. The fate of the hostages also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Belgium to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's U.N. General Assembly. This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. If the deal actually being implemented resembles at all what was first announced by Trump at the beginning of this month, Israel will keep a troop presence in Gaza and the capability to periodically launch future strikes against militants there. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The seemingly impossible dilemmas faced by the Netanyahu government turned out not to be dilemmas at all. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future. It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024, that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. Commanders weakened safeguards meant to protect noncombatants. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by Joe Biden's administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq. Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments. In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. When it comes to crushing a counterinsurgency, you don't have to “clear, hold, build.” You can just crush. This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — an era in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year. But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. Correction, October 13, 5:20 pm ET: A previous version of this story misstated the year of the October 7 attacks. An expert on political violence offers warnings — and some hope. We've made tremendous progress against famine — but hunger hasn't disappeared. And five other questions about the deal, answered. The NYC mayoral candidate's new proposal spotlights a flaw in progressive thought. Trump is checking off his enemies list.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump played diplomat and stand-up comedian during his speech at the Knesset, where he celebrated the release of all living hostages from Gaza. Speaking before the Israeli legislature on Monday, Trump offered a series of off-the-cuff remarks and jokes about corruption scandals, the handsome features of Israel Defense Forces soldiers, his billionaire funders, and his daughter's marriage. “Midnight Hammer — boy, that's a great name for what we did,” he said, smiling. Gesturing toward IDF personnel in attendance, Trump called the soldiers “central casting” for their good looks. “Let's put 'em in a movie,” Trump said. While praising Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his leadership during wartime, Trump unexpectedly called on Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon “Bibi.” “Hey, I have an idea — Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?” Trump said to massive applause. But I happen to like this gentleman right over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.” Netanyahu is facing three criminal charges for corruption by Israeli courts on allegations that he received illicit gifts. However, veiled behind Trump's expressions of support for the Jewish state was an undercurrent of political realism as he fluctuated between optimism and grim warning. I'm always gonna be with you,” Trump said before walking that promise back. “I guess maybe something could happen to change my mind — somebody that's really stupid gets into office and wants to do really bad things, but that's about it,” he continued. Another subject of Trump's comments was Miriam Adelson, the Israeli American billionaire who worked with her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, to advocate Israeli interests to the president and contributed massively to his 2024 campaign. Sixty billion in the bank […] and she loves Israel,” Trump said after asking Adelson to stand up. Trump reflected on Adelson's husband's constant requests for meetings, recalling, “He'd call up [and say] ‘Can I come over and see you?' and I'd say ‘Sheldon, I'm the president of the United States, it doesn't work that way.' What do you love more, the United States or Israel?' While thanking Kushner for his role in finalizing the peace deal, Trump said his son-in-law “loves [Israel] so much that my own daughter converted.” “And Bibi, you do know this was not in the cards for me.” “If they're not happy, we have a big story, right? Trump did not stay long in Israel, leaving the Knesset and getting on a plane to Egypt. Trump will co-chair a “Summit for Peace” with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi in Sharm El-Sheikh on Monday, with a press conference scheduled for noon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rescuers in western Alaska are working to find missing residents and help those displaced after ferocious, hurricane-force wind gusts from what once was Typhoon Halong tore through remote, coastal communities, unleashed record-breaking storm surge and shoved homes completely off their foundations. Three people are missing in Kwigillingok and at least 18 people have been rescued in the village after the powerful storm, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday evening. Another 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk and authorities were working to confirm reports of additional missing individuals there, the department said. The sparsely populated villages are more than 400 miles southwest of Anchorage. “Both communities experienced strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations,” Alaska State Troopers said. Search efforts were expected to continue overnight as conditions allowed, with help from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and the US Coast Guard, according to the public safety department. The storm generated wind gusts 100 mph or more in western Alaska Sunday, akin to the gusts Category 1 or 2 hurricanes are capable of. Wind gusts hit 107 mph in Kusilvak while nearby Toksook Bay recorded a gust of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service. These winds also drove dangerous storm surge, pushing feet of water onto land, which triggered major flooding in coastal areas. It was no longer tropical by the time it entered the Bering Sea this weekend, but that did not eliminate its power. “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. The initial declaration, issued on Thursday, addressed damage in western Alaska caused by another powerful coastal storm earlier in the week that brought extensive flooding. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said he has “been in frequent conversations with Acting FEMA Director David Richardson, and also in contact with local, tribal and state officials, including the Governor, and with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.” “FEMA is in direct contact with state and local officials and has an incident management team traveling to Alaska as we speak with a FEMA search-and-rescue group pre-positioned in Washington on standby. According to FEMA, the government shutdown is not impacting the agency's response to this emergency,” Sullivan said in a statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>JPMorgan Chase on Monday announced a massive investment plan that places a substantial bet on industries it thinks are critical to the United States' economic security. As part of the decade-long initiative, the bank said it's investing $10 billion in select companies that are primarily based in the United States and do business in one of four key areas: supply chain resilience, energy independence, defense and strategic technologies like AI and quantum computing. The plan aims to facilitate $1.5 trillion in investments over 10 years. JPMorgan had previously aimed at delivering $1 trillion in investments to these initiatives. “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” said CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement. The announcement comes as President Donald Trump revived a trade war between the US and China on Friday, with Trump threatening to impose new triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports. However, on Sunday, the Trump administration appeared to soften its tone, and markets were set to rebound Monday. But the renewed tensions demonstrated how a major investment in companies aimed at US self-reliance could pay off in a new era of tariffs, trade wars and standoffs. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy. America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said. The initiative will help ensure reliable access to critical medicines, minerals, defense capabilities, and energy and microchips to power AI, Dimon said. Rising tensions around the world, particularly with China, have challenged America's ability to secure all of those crucial needs. JPMorgan will hire an unspecified number of additional bankers and other investment staffers to execute its investment strategy, and it will create an external council to help guide it, the bank said. Shares of JPMorganChase (JPM) rose more than 1% in premarket trading. “Hopefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges,” Dimon said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced at least the sixth investigation into Tesla vehicles using the company's “Full Self Driving” (FSD), or other driver assist features. This probe covers dozens of dangerous driving incidents, including blowing through red lights, driving in the wrong lane of traffic, and three accidents that resulted in five injuries. But there's relatively little NHTSA, or any federal regulator, can do to regulate the new features Tesla introduces amid its ambitious plans to fill the country with self-driving cars and “robotaxis.” American laws aren't equipped to deal with the fast-moving ambitions of CEO Elon Musk, and Washington doesn't seem in a hurry to regulate his company. NHTSA already had several probes into Tesla's self-driving tech, including into incidents that resulted in fatal crashes, for both its FSD and less advanced driver assistance feature called “Autopilot.” But many of those investigations began years ago and are still ongoing, even as more and more Teslas with FSD and Autopilot hit American roads. “I call it regulatory whack-a-mole,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor of law and engineering and an affiliated scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. “This process takes a very long time. This is the first step in multiple steps required for an actual recall. It's a regulatory process that isn't necessarily well aligned with the technological time frame.” The United States has what's known as a self-certification regime. NHTSA creates specific standards and automakers then self-certify, or “promise that their vehicles or systems comply with those specific standards,” Smith said. And NHTSA does not have specific standards for the performance of many advanced driver assistance systems,” he said. But Smith added that problem is not simply cars with driver assistance features, but with all cars on the road. “We are all real-world guinea pigs in the century long experiment introducing two-ton vehicles that travel at speed faster than we can comprehend,” he said. NHTSA could set higher safety standards for vehicles, Smith said. But its ability to test vehicles and features before they are allowed on the road is limited by law and regulation. Smith said that change isn't going to be made any time soon. He said they are more likely to blame the drivers than demand greater regulation. Musk is betting the future of Tesla on technology like self-driving. But despite names like “full self-driving” and “autopilot,” the company admits that owners using those features need to be behind the wheel, ready to take over. But Musk also promises the service will soon have no employees behind the wheel, as well as a true self-driving “Cybercab” with no brake, accelerator or steering wheel. Tesla did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The company has insisted that its cars using self-driving technology are safer than human drivers. “There's great, great concern that humans, simply as a matter of psychology and physiology, are going to lose attention if they are doing nothing but watching, while their cars are doing everything else,” Smith said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Attorney General Letitia James, long known for targeting mortgage and bank fraud, now finds herself accused of the very type of deception she once prosecuted. James, who built her career in part by exposing forged deeds and false loan applications in state court, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on one count each of bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions. Over the past six years, James's office has charged numerous defendants with falsifying documents to obtain mortgages and mislead banks. In one June 2019 Brooklyn case, prosecutors accused a couple of submitting fake pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements to secure multiple loans. A July 2021 Harlem and Long Island case charged developer Joseph Makhani with forging deeds and falsifying records to get bank financing for properties he didn't own outright. And in a Queens case this year, the first under New York's new deed-theft statute, her office accused two men of using forged property transfers to obtain a $552,500 mortgage. All those cases revolved around a familiar theme: lying or misleading lenders for personal gain. The check on all of this is that a grand jury — seated in Virginia, not exactly a hotbed of conservatism — found probable cause to indict.” “Despite what Letitia James and her people are saying, it's not an uncommon set of facts,” he said. The idea that this is just weaponization doesn't square with reality.” Prosecutors say she never used the property herself and instead rented it out, benefiting from a lower interest rate and higher seller credit that would not have been available for an investment loan. The indictment, signed by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, accuses James of committing “intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.” Halligan, a former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, was appointed in the Eastern District of Virginia after Trump fired U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to bring charges against James based on the available evidence. If convicted, James faces a maximum of 30 years in prison on each count and a fine of up to $1 million — penalties heightened by Congress during the 1990s savings and loan crisis. Still, the dollar amount at issue is small, and experts note that federal prosecutors almost never pursue mortgage-fraud cases under $500,000. Only 38 people nationwide were sentenced for federal mortgage fraud last year, most involving large-scale schemes and sums. James accused Trump of inflating his assets to secure favorable financing and insurance terms. After New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in favor of James's civil case against Trump in February last year, James announced that Trump is “finally facing accountability for his lying, cheating, and staggering fraud. Because no matter how big, rich, or powerful you think you are, no one is above the law.” In August, an intermediate-level state court tossed out the full fine against Trump, though it maintained Engoron's finding that the company likely overvalued its assets. At the arraignment of former FBI Director James Comey last week, Comey's lawyer told the court he intends to file motions to dismiss that case on two grounds: that Halligan was unlawfully appointed and that her prosecution was vindictive and selective in violation of the Constitution. James's defense team has not yet said whether it will take the same approach. But her attorney Lowell suggested such motions could be forthcoming, vowing to “fight these charges in every process allowed in the law” and warning that “this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.” Cameron said that while selective-prosecution claims are often raised in politically charged cases, they seldom succeed. “The Supreme Court has set a high bar when it comes to claims of vindictive or selective prosecution,” he said. If Lowell pursues a dismissal motion, it will likely hinge on the same arguments surfacing in the Comey case: that Halligan, a Trump ally with no prior experience as a leading prosecutor, improperly weaponized her office against the president's adversaries. Comey's attorneys are also seeking to challenge the legality of Halligan's appointment. Earlier this year, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a close Trump ally, conducted his own review of real estate filings involving political opponents of the president. Within weeks, James's attorney Lowell issued a detailed rebuttal, accusing Pulte of selectively highlighting one document while ignoring others that clearly named the niece as the intended occupant. Lowell, who also represented Hunter Biden during his federal firearms violation and tax evasion cases, said the referral “collapsed under basic fact-checking” once the full transaction file was reviewed. Federal prosecutors declined to act on Pulte's referral for that property. Nonetheless, the current indictment introduces one new piece of evidence: a homeowner's insurance application that allegedly identified the 2020 house as “owner-occupied” instead of a rental.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE — Devin Talbott, founder of the Maryland-based investment firm Enlightenment Capital and chairman of voting machine giant Hart InterCivic, is under scrutiny for his extensive political donations to Democratic candidates while leading a major U.S. election technology company, a combination raising questions about potential conflicts of interest in the U.S. voting system. Talbott's firm invests heavily in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology sectors. As chairman of Hart InterCivic, he also plays a central role in shaping the company's operations and the voting systems it supplies to states nationwide. Federal Election Commission records show Talbott has given tens of thousands of dollars to campaigns for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Jon Tester, while also donating to the Democratic National Committee and the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. Talbott is the son of Strobe Talbott, who served as deputy secretary of state under President Bill Clinton after holding senior roles focused on the former Soviet republics. During his tenure, Brookings employed Igor Danchenko, who worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and was identified as a key source for the Steele dossier about alleged links between President Donald Trump and Russia. Those connections have led some critics to argue that Devin Talbott's political and business roles fit within a broader Democratic establishment network. Talbott's dual role as a political donor and chairman of a voting technology firm has drawn scrutiny from some election oversight advocates. The company is considered one of the “big three” election technology vendors in the United States, alongside Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, which recently was purchased by a new firm called Liberty Vote. Dominion became a flashpoint in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when false claims about its software and alleged ties to foreign actors fueled widespread conspiracy theories. After years of litigation, Dominion secured massive settlements, $787.5 million from Fox News and $67 million from Newsmax, tied to those baseless allegations. The company has maintained its systems are secure and reliable. By comparison, Hart InterCivic has largely avoided the national spotlight, though it has faced its own share of technical controversies. In 2018, the Texas secretary of state issued a statewide advisory after reports that Hart's eSlate voting machines were changing voters' straight-ticket selections or omitting certain races altogether during early voting. State corporate filings in Texas list Talbott as Hart InterCivic's chairman and director. Capital, founded by former Bain & Co. and Blackstone Group executives, made what it described as a “strategic investment” in Hart. principals, including managing director and Hart board member Jeff Bohl, were revealed to be major donors to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. The company said Enlightenment Capital is one of several investors in Hart and that day-to-day operations and product development are handled by a professional management team. They also noted that Hart executives are prohibited from making political donations, adding that the company's technology undergoes extensive testing by independent laboratories before being certified by the Election Assistance Commission and individual states. The commission, chaired by a Trump-nominated official who has served since 2019, oversees certification for voting systems nationwide. Hart officials emphasized that certification and oversight are conducted independently of any company ownership. The firm's advisory board has included retired military and national security officials, giving it deep reach into federal contracting circles. Election policy analysts say Talbott's case highlights a broader gap: private vendors that supply voting systems are not required to disclose the political activities or affiliations of their owners and executives.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Dutch government has taken control of Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing as a global fight brews over technology intellectual property, especially around semiconductors. The government said late on Sunday that it has intervened in Dutch-headquartered Nexperia, which manufactures chips for cars and consumer electronics. It cited worries about the possible transfer of technology to Nexperia's Chinese parent company, Wingtech. Amsterdam invoked never-before-used powers under a Dutch law known as the “Availability of Goods Act.” The decision led to a 10% fall in Wingtech's shares in Shanghai Monday. The Dutch government will not take ownership of Nexperia, but it will now have the power to reverse or block management decisions it considers harmful. US President Donald Trump is ratcheting up pressure on Chinese tech firms as part of a broader trade war that saw him threaten 100% tariffs on China's exports last week. Wingtech had already been placed on the US “entity list” in December 2024 for its alleged role “in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.” Nexperia, which is 100%-owned by Wingtech, said at the time that it would comply with the US rules, though it said its operations were kept at arm's length from its Chinese parent. Wingtech also alleged that non-Chinese Nexperia executives had tried to forcibly alter the company's equity structure through legal proceedings in a “cloaked power grab” on the company. Wingtech said in a statement that it was consulting with lawyers and seeking government support to “protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company.” Nexperia, which Wingtech bought for $3.63 billion in 2018, said it complied with all relevant laws and regulations. In its statement, the Dutch government cited issues around “crucial technological knowledge” without elaborating. “The loss of these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,” it said. Nexperia is one of the world's largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors, though it also develops more advanced technologies such as “wide gap” semiconductors used in electrical settings and useful for electric cars, chargers and artificial intelligence data centers. Wingtech said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange Monday that its control over Nexperia would be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings, affecting decision-making and operational efficiency. Wingtech said its chairman Zhang Xuezheng was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order on October 6, and an independent non-Chinese person with a “deciding vote” would be appointed in his place. Wingtech has had run-ins before with other Western governments over its operations, with Britain ordering it to divest ownership of a facility in Newport.
