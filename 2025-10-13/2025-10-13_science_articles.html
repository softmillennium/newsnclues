                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two physicists from the University of Queensland in Australia recently laid out a model for studying hypothetical time travel. Time travel is very hypothetical, with a few paths that scientists explore mostly for fun and to push the boundaries of physics research in interesting directions. Alcubierre is invoked more often as a possible (and, again, very hypothetical) path to travel at “warp speed,” or faster than the speed of light. In our known universe, it isn't possible to travel faster than light speed, because the physics of our particular spacetime just don't allow it. It's kind of like the spaceship is sitting on your dining room table while you pull the tablecloth of spacetime out from under it. In their introduction, the scientists explain that they also use Austro-Hungarian mathematician Kurt Gödel's idea of a spacetime allowing for “closed timelike curves” (CTCs) in their argument. “This seems intuitive, as protocols that allow for superluminal travel can generally be used to create a time machine with a slight modification,” the scientists wrote. Now, intuition doesn't always lead to scientific results, but in the three decades since Alcubierre's presentation of his warp drive idea, others have found that you could time travel using two Alcubierre bubbles or by capitalizing on a special case of rotating spacetime. So, what's the latest step forward in this corner of theoretical physics? Quantum information legend Tim C. Ralph joined forces with Ph.D. candidate Achintya Sajeendran to publish a paper in the peer-reviewed journal APS Physical Review D. In their paper, they stabilize one measurement of an Alcubierre spacetime by anchoring it to coordinates in the bubble, turning the CTCs into complex shapes called geodesic circles. Dubbing these “closed timelike geodesics” (CTGs), Ralph and Sajeendran explain in the paper: “Such a CTG would be ideal for studying situations in which a particle interacts with its past or future self, such as the billiard ball problem, and may generally serve as a useful playground for investigating classical and quantum models of time travel.” In other words, this is a specially controlled case of a specially controlled case, and by limiting the variables even further than before, scientists may be able to shake loose new insights into the mind-boggling questions that come up when thinking about time travel, Alcubierre bubbles, or anything else that veers off the beaten path of classical physics. And wait, what's the “billiard ball problem?” It's a great illustration of exactly how mind-boggling time travel theories can be. What if, they wondered in 2017, the billiard ball could collide with its own past self? These examples can sound a bit slapstick-y, but the philosophical-sounding edge cases help scientists refine their models and explore how and where their theories may fail. Indeed, that's exactly the point for Ralph and Sajeendran, who conclude: “Despite the questionable physical realisability of our metric, we suggest that it may provide a useful background for future theoretical studies of classical and quantum models of time travel in a general relativistic setting.” Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nobel laureate Shimon Sakaguchi reflects on the role of regulatory T cells in peripheral immune tolerance and how the cells could transform treatment for cancer, autoimmune disease and organ transplant rejection Shimon Sakaguchi, an immunologist and a distinguished professor of Osaka University, attends a press conference after winning the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine, in Suita, Osaka prefecture on October 6, 2025. That process, known as peripheral immune tolerance, stops the body's primary defense mechanism from entering self-destruct mode, called autoimmunity. The experiments Sakaguchi cataloged in Scientific American nearly 20 years ago were recognized last week at the 2025 Nobel award ceremony in Stockholm, where he and immunologists Mary E. Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell shared the prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

He discussed the crucial findings that led to the discovery of regulatory T cells and clinical trials that harness these cells to potentially treat chronic infections, cancer and autoimmune diseases. What was your journey into looking for cells that suppressed the immune system? So the immune system has two aspects: good and bad. If we can understand that mechanism, we may be able to treat autoimmune diseases—or the opposite: make the immune system attack abnormal cells, such as cancer cells, arising in our body. That was my interest when I was a student in medical school, and then I became a researcher to tackle this conundrum. I happened to find that newborn mice, if you remove the thymus [an organ in the chest that produces various types of T cells], they spontaneously develop autoimmunelike diseases. And then what was interesting was: if you inoculate the thymus-free mice with normal T cells from nonaffected adult mice, you can prevent disease development—meaning that in the normal collection of T cells in the thymus, there must be some cells that can prevent or suppress disease development. That was the start of my research career. What convinced you that regulatory T cells existed when others abandoned the theory? I was convinced that autoimmune diseases, similar to [how they can arise] in humans, can be produced in healthy animals by just manipulating the immune system—removing certain T cells. That was always a very solid phenomenon for me. Our results were not so bad—and were even better—so that was the reason that I continued my research on regulatory T cells. It is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves? And then he came up with that idea: “peacekeeper.” It was a really nice name because, later on, we gradually realized that regulatory T cells not only are immunosuppressive but also have various other functions, such as promoting tissue repair. You essentially documented in the article how pivotal this work was nearly two decades ago. Did you think back then that your research would be recognized for a Nobel Prize? I really hoped that we could have a better understanding of immunological self-tolerance. Even the 1960 Nobel awards were awarded to Peter Medawar and Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who showed that immune tolerance is acquired, not innate. Well, that's really interesting, but how does it happen? There have been several theories, including clonal deletion: deleting the dangerous self-reactive clones [of T cells]. But that couldn't explain how usual autoimmune diseases happen—for example, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. So it is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves? What is fascinating about regulatory T cells is that they are specialized for immune suppression, and so this means that if you strengthen their functions or increase their numbers, it could be a good way to treat autoimmunity or allergies or various diseases. So it could be good for cancer immunity. We are pursuing both directions, our team and many others. There are many, many trials underway—at the Nobel announcement, the chairperson told us that more than 200 clinical trials are ongoing now. For example, current immune checkpoint blockade [a type of therapy that uses lab-made antibodies, or inhibitors, that block signals so the immune response can attack cancer cells] is maybe 20 to 30 percent effective and not curative. So our idea is: regulatory T cells are really abundant in cancer tissue and are suppressing effective antitumor immune responses. How can we remove them in tumor tissue? If you think about the future, we could develop an oral drug of small molecules that may have a similar effect as the molecular antibodies against Tregs [molecules that are typically delivered intravenously in most trials]. You mentioned this could be the basis for cancer treatments. How about infections that suppress the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS? So increasing immune response could be good in a tumor immunity setting but also for chronic infection. We still don't know if it would work, but if strengthening the immune response can be achieved by reducing Treg numbers, I think that's one idea for tackling chronic infections. What advice would you like to give early-career scientists? It's maybe a common one, but really what is important is: if you are interested in something, in science or whatever, then pursue and continue working on that. But it always takes time to arrive at something important. Young is an associate editor for health and medicine at Scientific American.

On his quest to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold somewhere in the American southwest, Spanish explorer Vázquez de Coronado left behind some materials after a pit stop that, while perhaps an afterthought to him, included what is now a major piece of archaeological and weapon history in the United States. A team of researchers uncovered a bronze cannon, or “wall gun,” in Arizona and, using radiocarbon dating among other dating techniques, pegged the 480-year-old device to the Coronado expedition. At 42 inches in length and weighing 40 pounds, researchers say it would have taken two people to operate. There were no bullets found near the gun—the team did uncover plenty of broken swords and daggers, fishhooks, pottery, and other items—and the lack of residue in the barrel indicated it was never fired. “It was just an odd feeling that I rarely get.” While it's not what we traditionally think of when we hear the word, it is also referred to as a cannon, largely because of the smoothbore nature of the barrels. It was then abandoned at the site hundreds of years ago. “An artifact like this can connect people to the past, to history, and really stirs their imagination,” Seymour said.

A one-of-a-kind piece of medical tech could heal diseases that have stumped researchers for decades. An estimated 1.1 million Americans are currently living with Parkinson's disease—a neurodegenerative condition that causes tremors, limb stiffness, and mobility issues. Despite how common Parkinson's is, researchers still aren't quite sure what exactly makes neurons in the brain deteriorate, which causes the disease. In their recent paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, a team from University College London and Oxford University debuted an ultrasound helmet that can accurately send pulses to the deepest parts of the brain to influence how cells communicate. The helmet is the most recent iteration of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), a treatment method that has gained attention in recent years for its ability to modify how neurons fire signals. The devices come in all shapes and sizes, with some that look like headgear and others that resemble typical ultrasound wands. Parkinson's in particular damages neurons deep in a region of the midbrain called the substantia nigra, which is responsible for producing dopamine, which affects movement and muscle tone. The new helmet corrects these flaws with 256 small, tubular probes and a plastic face mask. And the helmet isn't just exciting in theory, either. Participants observed a flashing checkerboard, and an fMRI revealed increased activity in their visual cortexes, indicating the ultrasound beams were successfully hitting the LGN. A second experiment revealed extended decreased activity in the same area. Researchers say both these tests show promising results for eventually harnessing the power of TUS to control symptoms like hand tremors. “Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, depression, and essential tremor, offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions,”  Bradley Treeby, PhD, senior author of the study, says in a press release. The researchers hope the new method will eventually work alongside or even replace invasive treatments, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), which requires a surgically implanted device similar to a pacemaker deep in the brain. Should the device continue to prove successful, it could finally be the cure to many conditions that have long stumped researchers.

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. A quaint estate in the West Midlands of England sits atop a treasure trove of Roman artifacts. Digging out Roman treasure sure helps a pilot project take root. In the debut effort, teams of volunteers worked alongside professionals at the site where Roman villas were recently uncovered, bringing school children, youth groups, and community organizations in for a public dig. “This fortnight has made a significant, and important, contribution to our understanding of Wroxeter and its immediate surroundings,” said Roger White, an expert at the nearby Wroxeter Roman City, according to the BBC. “The dig may have been small in scale, but its impact is enormous.” The volunteers were involved with surveying, washing finds, and test pit excavations. “This pilot project marks an exciting new approach for the trust.” “Recent surveys have revealed high archaeological potential, making it the ideal place to begin,” the trust said in a statement. “This project will act as a proof of concept. Everything learned at Attingham, what worked, what needs refining, will shape how the National Trust delivers archaeological engagement in the future.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

Tuhin Mukherjee is an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA. But their supply chains face three interlinked challenges: dwindling reserves, rising demand and high greenhouse-gas emissions1–3. At the current rates of extraction and use, the known reserves of some metals, including copper, nickel and chromium, will only last for the next few decades1,2. And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world's population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem'). Furthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes. There are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material's strength and toughness4. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium's global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock. To accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance. Academia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation. The metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain. Green manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid. Innovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support. Another way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes. Governments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. The United Nations Environment Programme's International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11. Accelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial. In 2021, for example, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country's transition to a circular economy. According to the nation's economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.

When physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford's first cry was of alarm, not delight. “Don't call it transmutation, they'll have our heads off as alchemists!” For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher's stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn't espouse outdated ideas. Illustrations from the Ripley Scroll, around 1600 (left), and The Works of Jacob Behmen, 1764.Credit: Getty Research Institute, Manly Palmer Hall collection of alchemical manuscripts, GRI Special Collections, MS 205 (PDM); Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art'. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone's money with the promise of gold that would never come. As well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball's gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu's Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.

Nature Biotechnology (2025)Cite this article Subtle changes in gene expression direct cells to distinct cellular states. Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. Here, we develop a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotype and fate in direct conversion to induced motor neurons. The DIAL framework opens opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fatal overdoses among adults 65 and older involving fentanyl mixed with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamines have risen dramatically, climbing 9,000% in the past eight years. This research is one of the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to reveal that older adults -- often left out of overdose analyses -- are increasingly part of the national surge in fentanyl-stimulant deaths. People in this age group face higher risks of overdose because many manage chronic illnesses, take multiple medications, and metabolize drugs more slowly as they age. "Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. To conduct the study, researchers examined 404,964 death certificates listing fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, using data from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. "National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults," said Mr. Pasia. "Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time -- not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths -- not due to fentanyl alone -- and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients." The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should: "Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose," said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. "With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Surging temperatures worldwide have pushed coral reef ecosystems into a state of widespread decline, marking the first time the planet has reached a climate ‘tipping point', researchers announced today. They also say that without rapid action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, other systems on Earth will also soon reach planetary tipping points, thresholds for profound changes that cannot be rolled back. It also discusses progress towards various positive tipping points focused on social and economic change, such as the adoption of clean energy. The group's first such assessment, released less than two years ago, raised alarms but did not officially declare that any climate tipping points had been reached.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eating a Mediterranean-style diet with fewer calories, adding moderate physical activity, and receiving professional guidance for weight management can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 31%. That is the key finding of PREDIMED-Plus, a large clinical trial led in Spain by the University of Navarra together with more than 200 researchers from 22 universities, hospitals, and research institutes. The project was carried out in over 100 primary care centers within Spain's National Health System. Between 2014 and 2016, additional institutions joined the effort, bringing total funding above 15 million euros. The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, followed 4,746 adults between the ages of 55 and 75 who were overweight or obese and had metabolic syndrome but no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The other group continued a traditional Mediterranean diet without calorie limits or exercise advice. On average, they lost 3.3 kg and 3.6 cm from their waist, compared to 0.6 kg and 0.3 cm in the control group. This translated to preventing about three new cases of type 2 diabetes for every 100 participants -- a meaningful benefit for public health. "Applied at scale in at-risk populations, these modest and sustained lifestyle changes could prevent thousands of new diagnoses every year. We hope soon to show similar evidence for other major public health challenges." Its rise is fueled by urbanization (unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity), an aging population, and increasing rates of overweight and obesity. In Spain, an estimated 4.7 million adults live with diabetes -- mostly type 2 -- giving the country one of the highest rates in Europe, where total cases exceed 65 million. Experts emphasize that prevention is crucial to slow this escalating crisis, which greatly increases the risk of heart, kidney, and metabolic complications. "The Mediterranean diet acts synergistically to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Annals of Internal Medicine accompanied the publication with an editorial by Sharon J. They praised the intervention's clinical relevance and its potential as a preventive model for type 2 diabetes. At a time when new drugs against obesity and diabetes are grabbing headlines, PREDIMED-Plus demonstrates that modest, sustained lifestyle changes can still deliver powerful health benefits. This study demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30%. Researchers emphasize that primary care providers can integrate the new intervention as a sustainable, cost-efficient strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes on a large scale. The PREDIMED-Plus trial has assembled a broad network of investigators from across Spain. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
