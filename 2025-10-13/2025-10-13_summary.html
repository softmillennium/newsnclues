Two members of Israel's Knesset were removed from the chamber after holding up pro-Palestinian signs during US President Donald Trump's speech on Monday.

Ayman Odeh and Ofer Cassif, from the mainly Arab Hadash-Ta'al coalition, held signs reading “Recognize Palestine!” –prompting immediate uproar from other legislators.

Trump paused and stood silent as the MPs were quickly escorted out. He then remarked, “That was very efficient,” before continuing his speech.

Cassif defended his actions on X, writing that Trump was “part of the problem, not a solution,” and that “true peace requires an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.”

Odeh also defended his stunt, writing, “They kicked me out of the Knesset just for raising the simplest demand, one that the whole international community agrees on: Recognize the State of Palestine!”

The US president visited Israel to oversee the implementation of an agreement he helped mediate, under which Hamas freed the remaining 20 living hostages in exchange for the release of around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had.

Later that day, Trump signed the Gaza ceasefire deal with mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and Türkiye in Sharm el-Sheikh, on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.

MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. In breach of the international law, the Kiev government is using terrorist methods against civilians in Russia, but all terrorists and war criminals will face an inevitable punishment, said Natalya Nikonorova, a member of the Russian Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Committee on Foreign Affairs.

On Monday, it became known that operatives from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) have foiled a terrorist attack in Moscow against a high-ranking officer from Russia's Defense Ministry, which was plotted by Ukrainian special services jointly with the Islamic State terrorist group (outlawed in Russia). Commenting on the report, Nikonorova, who is also a former foreign minister of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) has told TASS: "This is not the first case that confirms the inhumane and terrorist nature of the Kiev regime."

"Using radical suicide bombers, committing attacks with generally dangerous methods aimed at inflicting as much suffering as possible, cynical recognition of the past and future crimes - this is what terrorists normally do. Russian troops are fighting on the battlefield, while Kiev's death squads are covertly and dastardly try to wage some sort of ‘warfare' way behind the frontline, choosing civilians as their target," she said.

In her words, such actions violate the universally recognized norms of the international law.

"Every war criminal, every terrorist will be imminently brought to justice," she said.

On October 13, the FSB said it had prevented a sabotage and terror attack against one of the high-ranking officers of Russia's Defense Ministry. The attack was supposed to be carried out in one of the Russian capital's densely populated areas. The detainee said that he had planted it in a bicycle near the building's entrance. According to specialists, the yield of the explosive device would have ensured a lethal radius of up to 70 meters. Following the prevented terrorist attack, the FSB's Investigative Directorate has opened a criminal case on plotting a terror attack and the illegal use of explosive materials or devices.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index is up more than 26 per cent year-over-year.Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press

John Rapley is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail. He is an author and academic whose books include Why Empires Fall and Twilight of the Money Gods.

Is it 1999 all over again in the markets?

The economy may be in recession, but if you're invested in stocks, things have seldom been better. American markets dipped on Friday with the escalating trade war between the United States and China. But on Monday they parred back most losses as rhetoric cooled. The S&P 500 Index is still up more than 13 per cent year over year.

In Canada it's even better. With the S&P/TSX Composite Index up more than 20 per cent year-over-year, a twenty-something living at home and socking money into shares can look forward to retiring at 40. Housing bubble? That's so 2020.

And the prospects for 2026 are more of the same. Analysts are now predicting that the S&P500 could hit 9,000 next year. Helping to drive the rally is the increasing popularity of passive investment funds, which just follow the market and so reinforce existing momentum. And with the U.S. market actually underperforming the rest of the world, returns elsewhere will probably be even better.

That's because the world is awash with money, its biggest economies flooded with cash by free-spending governments and laid-back central banks. Government debt is surging in the U.S. and China as governments there try to boost their economies. The election of a new prime minister in Japan has further raised the prospects of stimulus in that country, thus encouraging investors and banks to loosen their purse strings. 

Opinion: The markets will burn as Trump fiddles with the Fed

Equally, there's a growing expectation among investors that France's political crisis will cause the European Central Bank to once again do “whatever it takes” to rescue the euro, printing money in order to keep French bonds from collapsing. Across Europe, populist parties snap at the heels of governments and promise lavish spending if they take office. That's making it hard for governments to rein in spending and causing some to open the taps, especially in Germany.

Despite this, monetary policy almost everywhere in the developing world remains fairly easy. Rather than raise interest rates to keep inflation low, most central banks are holding pat or even cutting, anxious not to slow economic growth. 

Therein lies the paradox: Markets are soaring but aren't dragging economies along with them, and central bankers are caught in the middle. With central banks thus unwilling to defend the value of their currencies, investment banks are starting to advise clients to go all in on the “debasement trade”: buying assets, any assets, fast before the value of money declines.

This market mania is causing ever more analysts to draw parallels with 1999, the final year of the dot-com bubble, when the Nasdaq rose nearly 50 per cent before finally crashing. With AI stocks dragging markets to all-time highs, we may be in the early stages of the final melt-up before the mother of all crashes.

There are vital differences between today and 1999. The rally may be more sustainable: AI companies are actually making things, such as chips and data centres, whereas many of the dot-com companies were little more than promises. 

However, the fallout from a crash, if it happens, could be worse. That's because in 1999 the governments of the big economies carried far less debt. The U.S. national debt was less than half what it is today, and its budget was in surplus, leaving the government with ample resources to fight a recession. This time around, public finances are so stretched that any further spending increases will drive interest rates up.

In 1999, meanwhile, everyone joined the party. The economy was booming, and everyone was spending. I happened to be living in Washington at the peak of the boom, and the bars, restaurants and malls were packed. 

This time around, half the spending is being done by the top 10 per cent of earners, leaving the majority feeling worse off because of inflation, slowing wage growth and a sluggish job market. 

Unhappiness over this state of affairs is particularly strong among young people. The suicide rate in the U.S. has risen more than 50 per cent between 1999 and today, driven by higher youth rates. Here in Canada, research has also tracked a sharp drop in happiness among young people, driven largely by the high cost of living. 

One manifestation of this discontent among the young has been a rising support for more radical political movements and parties, of both the left and the right. Across the developed world, right- and left-wing populists are squeezing out the political centre. 

So whereas the 2000 U.S. election was a civilized affair conducted over how to spend the emerging massive government surplus – whether to spend it on Social Security or tax cuts – future elections will likely be fought over defining the enemy. 

The stock market party thus hides an underlying reality: This boom may be on borrowed time, and the bill keeps rising. When it comes due, the reckoning over who should pay it could be harsher than in the past. No wonder the price of gold keeps rising by the day.

Universities, law firms and businesses that have changed course should have stood by convictions, says ex-president

Barack Obama took aim at institutions and businesses who made deals or worked out settlements with the Trump administration, noting on a new podcast episode: “We all have this capacity, I think, to take a stand.”

In a talk with Marc Maron on the comedian's last edition of his long-running WTF With Marc Maron, the former US president said institutions – including law firms, universities and businesses – that have changed course during the Trump administration should have stood by their convictions.

Instead of bending to the administration, Obama noted that universities should say: “This will hurt if we lose some grant money in the federal government, but that's what endowments are for. Let's see if we can ride this out, because what we're not going to do is compromise our basic academic independence.”

He also noted that the organizations that did concede to Trump should be able to say: “We're not going to be bullied into saying that we can only hire people or promote people based on some criteria that's been cooked up by Steve Miller,” in reference to the top White House aide and architect of Trump's hardline immigration policy.

Obama, whose two terms preceded the first Trump administration, also said that companies should also have stood up against administration pressure campaign to turn back from diversity hiring.

“We think it's important, because of what this country is, to hire people from different backgrounds,” Obama said.

Universities, law firms and other businesses have all reached agreements with the White House, including dropping DEI targets and agreeing to rein in campus antisemitism in exchange for restoration of federal funding. A series of powerful Washington law firms have also agreed to provide free legal services to the administration, while corporations have rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.

Disney, a frequent target of political-ideological factions on the left and right, scrapped its internal “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” program for “Opportunity & Inclusion” to empower “all through access, opportunity, and a culture of belonging”.

Elsewhere in the interview, Obama acknowledged that integrity comes at a price.

“Sometimes it's going to be uncomfortable,” he told Maron, referencing a joke that Maron made in his stand-up routine that Democrats annoyed the average American into fascism.

“It cracked me up,” Obama said. “I wasn't as funny about saying this, but four or five years ago I said: ‘Look, you can't just be a scold all the time. You can't constantly lecture people without acknowledging you've got some blind spots, too.'”

Vulnerability, he said, comes in standing up for core convictions but not attempting to assert “that I am so righteous, and so pure, and so insightful, that there isn't the possibility I'm wrong on this.

“There was this weird progressive language,” he said, that implied a “holier than thou superiority that's not different to what we used to joke about coming from the right and the moral majority … and certain fundamentalism that I think was dangerous”.

Maron posted the final episode of his show on Monday after 16 years of hosting and with more than 1,600 installments that he's broadcast from his Los Angeles garage. Obama brought the 62-year-old host, stand-up comic and actor to his Washington office for the last interview.

Obama asked the initial questions. “How are you feeling about this whole thing?” he said, “transition, moving on from this thing that has been one of the defining parts of your career and your life?”

“I feel OK,” Maron answered. “I feel like I'm sort of ready for the break, but there is sort of a fear there, of what do I do now? I'm busy. But, not unlike your job … I've got a lot of people who over the last 16 years have grown to rely on me.”

U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem on Monday.EVELYN HOCKSTEIN/AFP/Getty Images

The American Revolution hero Marquis de Lafayette of France made history in 1824 as the first foreigner to speak to the United States Congress. John F. Kennedy made history when he told members of Parliament in Ottawa in 1961 that “geography has made us neighbours. History has made us friends.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made history when he spoke in recent years to seven foreign legislative bodies in person and to three dozen others online.

But few, if any, speeches to a foreign legislature have had the weight of history that was carried by Donald Trump's appearance at the Knesset Monday. 

There he spoke to what he called “the cherished citizens of Israel,” was treated to a “Trump, Trump, Trump” chant that echoed through the parliamentary complex in the government compound in Givat Ram section of Jerusalem, and spoke of “the beginning of an age of faith and hope and of God.”

Winston Churchill's three speeches to the American Congress were exhortations to victory in the Second World War and the Cold War. Mr. Trump's address in Jerusalem after the tearful return of the Israeli hostages was instead a message about a nascent settlement, saying, “the sun rises on a Holy Land that is finally at peace.” 

Not since Woodrow Wilson's 1918 triumphal tour of devastated Europe at the conclusion of the First World War and Mr. Kennedy's 1963 “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech at Rathaus Schöneberg has an American president been greeted with such enthusiasm, even worship, overseas. 

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a 'historic dawn of a new Middle East' in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

The Associated Press

Mr. Trump, increasingly drawn to religious imagery, offered “Our deepest thanks to the almighty God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob” and said, “The enemies of all civilization are in retreat.”

His remarks were preceded by a combative introduction, laced with allusions to Biblical heroes, that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu employed to call Mr. Trump “the greatest friend the State of Israel has ever had in the White House.”

Mr. Netanyahu repeatedly issued variations that phrase and saluted him for having “brought America back again.” He nominated Mr. Trump to be the first foreigner to be granted the Israel Prize, the country's highest civilian award.

In turn, Mr. Trump, in an extraordinary and apparently extemporaneous venture into Israeli domestic politics, called for a pardon of Mr. Netanyahu, who is charged with breach of trust, bribery and fraud. He denies the charges. 

Israel celebrates release of remaining hostages as Trump declares ‘dawn of new Middle East'

This emotional moment came as a dramatic capstone to what Mr. Trump called “two harrowing years of darkness” that descended on “this sacred soil” but that appears to have ended with an American-brokered tentative and fragile but promising accord. 

It brought a conclusion to fighting in the Middle East – the “spiritual and geographical centre of the entire world,” Mr. Trump said – that began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack. The regional crisis accelerated with Israel's military response, which left Gaza in ruins, strained relations between Israel and its American patrons, undermined the Jewish state's moral authority in the world and prompted a global surge in antisemitism. 

Despite a brief interruption of protest in the Knesset chamber, Israel displayed to Mr. Trump a sense of national unity that the 47th president – the most divisive American leader in modern times – cannot replicate at home but earned in Israel. 

It came through the release of the country's hostages and the Palestinian prisoners that Mr. Trump helped win, some 9,500 kilometres from the continuing domestic political combat in Washington. One lawmaker in the President's audience wore a bright red “Make America Great Again” baseball cap.

An angry political combatant suddenly transformed into a happy warrior for peace, Mr. Trump seemed to luxuriate in defying his critics (many of whom consider him a trigger-prone aggressive adventurer, lately provoking maritime confrontations off Venezuela) and his reputation (for preferring conflict over conciliation and for making “fight, fight fight!” his slogan). 

Mr. Trump's brief visit to the Middle East was more than a celebratory victory tour. It was another chance for Mr. Trump to issue familiar gibes against Barack Obama and Joe Biden – this time as unfaithful to Israel's interests. 

But it also was a rare instance of subtlety from Mr. Trump. 

The President's remarks were shaped to change the global narrative of the two-year Gaza war. His speech was an effort to focus global attention on the Hamas attack rather than on Israel's response and the civilian toll it brought.

World leaders gathering in Egypt throw their weight behind deal to end war in Gaza

“Let us remember,” Mr. Trump said, “how this nightmare of depravity and death all began.”

In Jerusalem, and later at a signing ceremony at the Red Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh, where days earlier the cease-fire took form, the President – already celebrated for acknowledging Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, recognizing contested regions as Israeli territory, forging the 2020 Abraham Accords, and unleashing American firepower against Iran's nuclear facilities – called for peace rather than issuing a call to arms. 

Mr. Trump, not prone to understatement, said of Mr. Netanyahu, “He's not the easiest guy to deal with,” and then added, to the applause of the Knesset, “but that's what makes him great.” He also saluted Arab leaders who leaned on Hamas to grab this chance for peace.

The settlement was a result in part of pressure on Hamas from Egypt and Qatar, who warned the group that this proposed accord was its last opportunity to end the carnage in Gaza. Turkey chimed in, too. 

At risk for Hamas was the safe harbour Turkey gave its leadership, which increasingly was isolated diplomatically as well as geographically. The benefit was humanitarian aid and the prospect of reconstruction and rehabilitation of Gaza. 

The pact brought concessions, but it also reflected the fragility of the Hamas position, the prospect of a conflict without end, and the desperation of the Palestinian people Hamas was committed to serve. 

Mr. Trump – who spoke of a “covenant between our two promised lands” and made reference to the “hope of Zion” – said in triumph, “Peace is not just a hope we can dream about but a reality we can build on.” He urged Iran to seek a peace agreement as well. And he reminded leaders around the world, “I make deals. I'm good at it.”

Blazing debris on road amid rain and wind, with one person on ground hurt and no known survivors found on plane

A small plane crashed along a major highway in south-eastern Massachusetts early on Monday amid rain and strong winds, killing both people on board and wounding another person on the ground, authorities said.

In videos taken by people in passing vehicles, smoke could be seen billowing up above Interstate 195 from scattered, blazing debris. The highway was closed in both directions near the crash site in Dartmouth, a town about 50 miles (80km) miles south of Boston, the state department of transportation said.

The Massachusetts state police said in a statement it was not aware of any survivors on the plane, which it said may have been attempting to land at New Bedford regional airport. However, officials said it does not appear that the pilot provided the airport with a flight plan or passenger details.

A spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash, saying a Socata TBM-700 had departed from the New Bedford airport.

No information about the people on board would be made public, authorities said, pending notification of their next of kin.

A person on the ground was also taken to the hospital, state police said.

At the time of the crash, the National Weather Service said a nor'easter had brought rain and winds from 30 to 40mph (48 to 64kph) to the area.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which state police said would likely take over the investigation, said in an email that it could not respond to media inquiries due to the government shutdown.

Lindsey Graham says closure won't push him to meet Democrats' demands on Obama-era healthcare subsidies

Republican and Democratic senators Lindsey Graham and Mark Kelly have dug their heels in over the government shutdown – which is now approaching two weeks, with the former saying that the closure won't push him to meet Democrats' demands for a restoration of Obama-era healthcare subsidies.

Graham said on NBC News's Meet the Press on Sunday that he was in favor of the Senate voting to reopen the government and prepared to “have a rational discussion” with Democrats – but not with the government shut down.

“I'm willing to vote to open the government up tomorrow,” Graham said. “To my Democratic friends: I am not going to vote to extend these subsidies.”

Graham, speaking to Democrats, added: “It's up to you. If you want to keep it shut down, fine. It's not going to change how I approach healthcare.”

The senator's comments came as Vice-President JD Vance warned that permanent cuts to the federal workforce will only get “deeper” as the shutdown continues.

Vance told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures that “the longer it goes on, Maria, the more significant they're going to be. If you remember, we went nine days before announcing any significant layoffs.

“The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” Vance continued.

More than 4,000 federal workers have so far been identified for job terminations. The Senate has voted multiple times over the last two weeks on a stopgap funding measure but not enough Democrats have joined the proposal to reach a 60-vote threshold.

Graham's comments may indicate a hardening approach to negotiations over healthcare subsidies with or without a functioning government.

“The subsidies we're talking about here,” Graham told NBC. “If the (Obama's) Affordable Care Act is so affordable, why, every time I turn around, are we spending $350 billion to keep it afloat?”

The dispute on the network continued with Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a Democrat, criticizing Republicans for refusing to negotiate with Democrats.

“We need a real negotiation, and we need a fix. We need this corrected for the American people. This is for so many people – their healthcare is running towards a cliff, and if we don't fix this, it's going to go right over it,” Kelly told host Kristen Welker on Meet the Press.

Against increasing pressure to reach a deal, with both sides weighing the political cost of a lack of a resolution, House speaker Mike Johnson said on Monday that Republicans had “probably a hundred different ideas about how to fix it but we can't do that overnight”.

He said Democrats' demands for a resolution to the healthcare subsidies issue without lengthy discussions were “impossible and inappropriate”.

“It's not a deliverable and they know it,” Johnson said. “They chose that issue because they thought it would sell well to the public and it would show they were fighting Trump. It's all a big facade and I'm so frustrated by it.”

            Madagascar's president has fled the African nation, the head of the opposition and other officials said on Monday, the second time that young protesters have toppled a government in weeks of worldwide Gen Z unrest.
    


            Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko, leader of the opposition in parliament, told Reuters that President Andry Rajoelina left Madagascar on Sunday after units of the army defected and joined the protesters.
    


            “We called the staff of the presidency, and they confirmed that he left the country,” Randrianasoloniaiko said, adding that Rajoelina's current whereabouts were unknown.
    


            The president's office, which had earlier said Rajoelina would address the nation at 7 p.m. local time on Monday, did not reply to requests for comment.
    


            A military source told Reuters that Rajoelina flew out of the country on a French military aircraft on Sunday. French radio RFI said he had struck a deal with President Emmanuel Macron.
    


            The source said that a French Army Casa aircraft landed in Madagascar's Sainte Marie airport on Sunday. “Five minutes later, a helicopter arrived and transferred its passenger into the Casa,” the source said, adding that Rajoelina was the passenger.
    


            Demonstrations had erupted in the former French colony on September 25 over water and power shortages but quickly escalated into an uprising over broader grievances, including corruption, bad governance and lack of basic services.
    


            The anger mirrors recent protests against ruling elites in countries including Nepal, where the prime minister was forced to resign last month, and Morocco.
    


            Rajoelina had appeared increasingly isolated after losing the support of CAPSAT, an elite unit which had helped him seize power in a 2009 coup.
    


            CAPSAT joined the protesters over the weekend, saying it refused to fire on them and escorting thousands of demonstrators in the main square of the capital Antananarivo.
    


            It then said it was taking charge of the military and appointed a new army chief, prompting Rajoelina to warn on Sunday of an attempt to seize power in the island nation off the coast of southern Africa.
    


            On Monday, a faction of the paramilitary gendarmerie supporting the protests also took control of the gendarmerie at a formal ceremony in the presence of senior government officials, a Reuters witness said.
    


            The president of the Senate – a focus of public anger during the protests – was relieved of his functions, the Senate said in a statement, and Jean André Ndremanjary was appointed on a temporary basis.
    


            In the absence of a president, the leader of the Senate takes the post until elections are held.
    


            On Monday, thousands of people gathered in a square in the capital, shouting “the president must quit now”.
    


            Hotel worker Adrianarivony Fanomegantsoa, 22, told Reuters his 300,000-ariary ($67) monthly salary was barely enough to cover food, explaining his reasons for joining the protests.
    


            “In 16 years the president and his government have done nothing except enrich themselves while the people stay poor. And the youth, the Gen Z, suffer the most,” he said.
    


            At least 22 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and the security forces since September 25, according to the UN.
    


            Madagascar, where the median age is younger than 20, has a population of about 30 million – three-quarters of whom live in poverty, with GDP per capita plunging 45% between independence in 1960 and 2020, according to the World Bank.
    


            While the country is best known for producing most of the world's vanilla, other exports including nickel, cobalt, textiles and shrimp are also vital to foreign earnings and employment.

            Rescuers in western Alaska are working to find missing residents and help the over 1,000 people displaced after ferocious, hurricane-force wind gusts from what once was Typhoon Halong tore through remote, coastal communities, unleashed record-breaking storm surge and shoved homes completely off their foundations.
    


            Three people are still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of Monday, said officials, who made clear they are still being considered missing and not dead at this point in the search. At least 51 people and two dogs have been rescued in Kipnuk and Kwigillingok since the weekend, and over 1,000 others have been displaced and are currently in shelters, a local tribal health agency said. Authorities said they were working to confirm reports of additional missing individuals in Kipnuk.
    


            The sparsely populated villages are more than 400 miles southwest of Anchorage. “Both communities experienced strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations,” Alaska State Troopers said Sunday, although officials said Monday afternoon that they are not sure how many buildings or homes are impacted overall. 



            Search efforts continued overnight and throughout Monday involved help from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and the US Coast Guard, according to the state troopers and the state's Department of Public Safety. The Alaska National Guard response includes about 60 to 80 soldiers on the ground as of Monday, and upwards of 200 soldiers near the end of the week, said Maj. Gen. Torrence Saxe, who runs the state's National Guard. It is the “largest [response] I've seen in quite some time,” he said.
    


            Some search and rescue efforts involved helicopters rescuing people off the roofs of houses as they were surrounded by several feet of flooding, images that are reminiscent to rescues conducted during Hurricane Katrina, said US Coast Guard Capt. Christopher Culpepper.
    


            “If you imagine the worst case scenario, that's what we are dealing with,” he said. 



            The storm generated wind gusts 100 mph or more in western Alaska Sunday, akin to the gusts Category 1 or 2 hurricanes are capable of. Wind gusts hit 107 mph in Kusilvak while nearby Toksook Bay recorded a gust of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            These winds also drove dangerous storm surge, pushing feet of water onto land, which triggered major flooding in coastal areas. Water levels in Kipnuk soared to 14.5 feet Sunday — more than 2 feet above major flood stage and 1.5 feet above the previous record flood level set in 2000.
    


            The storm was once Typhoon Halong, a powerful tropical system that formed in the northern Philippine Sea earlier this month, skirted by Japan without making landfall and then crossed the north Pacific Ocean. It was no longer tropical by the time it entered the Bering Sea this weekend, but that did not eliminate its power.
    


            The storm moved through northern Alaska late Sunday and pushed into the Arctic Sea early Monday, leaving communities to pick up the pieces in its wake.
    


            “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement Sunday announcing the expansion of a state disaster declaration to include the areas impacted by the weekend storm. He emphasized Monday there will be support for residents in the short term as well as for long-term needs.
    


            The initial declaration, issued on Thursday, addressed damage in western Alaska caused by another powerful coastal storm earlier in the week that brought extensive flooding.
    


            Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska said he has “been in frequent conversations with Acting FEMA Director David Richardson, and also in contact with local, tribal and state officials, including the Governor, and with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.”
    


            “FEMA is in direct contact with state and local officials and has an incident management team traveling to Alaska as we speak with a FEMA search-and-rescue group pre-positioned in Washington on standby. According to FEMA, the government shutdown is not impacting the agency's response to this emergency,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya was seized by the Israeli military in December 2024 after it raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in Gaza.

As families on Monday celebrated the return of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and 20 living Israeli hostages after the two-year Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 67,000 people and left rubble across Gaza, advocates demanded the return of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who was captured nearly a year ago and has reportedly been imprisoned in a detention center known for torturing detainees.

Middle East Eye reported Monday morning that according to Israeli media reports, Abu Safiya was on a list of Palestinian prisoners who would be released only “if the number of those released is not completed.”

“The government has approved the creation of a reserve list of five prisoners from Gaza, who will be released if changes are made,” according to Israeli media reports.

Palestinian writer and poet Mosab Abu Toha noted that “if he and the others are approved, they would replace five other Palestinian hostages who were previously set for release.”

Abu Safiya was seized by the Israel Defense Forces in December 2024 after the IDF raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, where he was the medical director.

The IDF claimed without evidence that Kamal Adwan Hospital was a Hamas command center; it was the last major functioning health facility in northern Gaza when it was attacked.

As the exchange of hostages and prisoners neared over the weekend, advocates including healthcare professionals demanded that Abu Safiya be included in the exchange.

“I am a family doctor and public health practitioner. I have studied the impacts of settler colonialism on health, locally and abroad. I am demanding for the immediate and unconditional release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya who is being held captive by the Israeli military for fulfilling his duty and calling to protect his patients,” said Dr. Yipeng Ge. “I am calling for protection of hospitals, patients, and health workers in Gaza.”

Abu Safiya is one of more than 9,600 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, according to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.

The prisoners being released on Monday include 1,700 Palestinians who were detained after Israel began its bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for a Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023.

At least 154 Palestinian prisoners freed on Monday were forced into exile by Israel and deported to third countries.

On Saturday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on the Trump administration to “demand that Israel release Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya and all other kidnapped medical professionals.”

Francesca Albanese, United Nations rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, suggested that the international acceptance of the continued detention of Abu Safiya and thousands of people in Israeli prisons, many of whom have been held without charges and were detained as minors, “says a lot about [the] peace that lays ahead, for the Palestinians.”

“There cannot be peace without justice, human rights, and dignity of ALL,” said Albanese. “Palestinian lives matter.”

The prisoner-hostage exchange is a major part of the first phase of the 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump, with the next phases yet to be negotiated.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Areas from the Carolinas to New England see flooding and high winds, while flooding in Alaska carries away homes

New Jersey and parts of New York City were under a state of emergency on Monday as slow-moving nor'easter moved up the easter US seaboard, while in western Alaska remnants of Typhoon Halong lashed coastal hamlets and ripped houses off their foundations.

In Alaska, rescue aircraft were sent to the villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for.

“We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,” Zidek, a spokesperson for the state division of homeland security and emergency management, told the Associated Press.

The area is among one of the most isolated in the US, where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.

The Alaska governor, Mike Dunleavy, extended a disaster declaration to communities in the Yupitt, Pribilof Island and Lower Kuskokwim education districts.

“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Dunleavy said in a statement on X.

Separately, the storm making its way up the east coast prompted flooding and high winds in coastal areas from the Carolinas to New England. 
 In Delaware, emergency management officials activated the state national guard in response to rising floodwaters and harsh winds. In North Carolina's Outer Banks, seawater washed over highway 12 at a motel near Buxton.

Flooding was reported as widespread in Georgetown county in South Carolina, where several motorists had to be rescued when rising water; in Charleston, many downtown streets were closed because of rising waters; and in Myrtle Beach, heavy rain overwhelmed that city's stormwater system.
 “Please be safe and stay home, if possible,” Myrtle Beach officials posted on Facebook.

As the storm moved up to the coast, all of New Jersey was placed under a state of emergency. The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, issued a similar declaration for eight southern counties, urging people to monitor forecasts and avoid travel.

The National Weather Service placed New York City, Long Island and southern Westchester county under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. 
  The emergency declaration, which included the five boroughs of New York City and Westchester county, forced the cancellation of the annual Columbus Day parade in Manhattan, news outlets reported.

Among the areas hardest hit were coastal areas of suburban Long Island, where up to 3in of rain and winds packing peak gusts of 45 to 50 mph inland away from the shore, and 55 to 60 mph on the coast.

“The highest tides and worst of the coastal flooding along the Jersey Shore are expected Monday afternoon. Gusty winds from the north-east can push in tremendous amounts of water into bays and inlets,” AccuWeather hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said.

“This storm may create some of the highest tides that the north-east has seen in more than a decade. Some beaches may be completely underwater as this storm passes off the coast,” he added. “This storm may not have a name, but it is causing some serious problems and disruptions along the coast.”

Police in Nassau and Suffolk counties said they had received calls about downed tree limbs but no reports of injuries or any significant road closures. Freeport Mayor Robert Kennedy said the village received nuisance flooding and experienced extra high tides.

Trump's attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are a deliberate effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has always been an act of celebration, resistance, and truth. When we gather and organize for Indigenous Peoples' Day, we affirm that we are still here. It is a reminder that our stories did not begin with Columbus, and they do not end with the myth of American exceptionalism and conquest. But today, it carries an urgency we can't ignore. In the current political climate, that affirmation takes on new meaning as questions about the legitimacy of our U.S. citizenship are raised in efforts to end birthright citizenship and erase the political existence of Native nations.

On October 9, 2025, Trump issued the 2025 Columbus Day Proclamation, declaring Christopher Columbus “a visionary who paved the way for the founding of our great Nation.” He urged Americans to honor “the values of courage, faith, and discovery that built Western civilization.”

In the proclamation, Trump made no mention of Indigenous people, unless you count the mention of a “vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage.” The wording of Trump's phrase echoes a similar line in the Declaration of Independence, which accuses King George III of acting against the colonists who opposed British rule by colluding with “the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.” Instead of taking the opportunity to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples' Day, Trump doubled down on a myth of discovery that glorifies genocide and rebrands colonization as destiny.

This same worldview underpins Trump's renewed effort to end birthright citizenship, a move that threatens not only immigrants but also the very foundation of Native existence. In one of the administration's own legal arguments, officials claimed, “The United States' connection with the children of illegal aliens and temporary visitors is weaker than its connection with members of Indian tribes. If the latter link is insufficient for birthright citizenship, the former certainly is.”

This suggests that tribal citizenship, the political relationship that predates the United States itself, is somehow incompatible with being American. It echoes the logic used to justify centuries of termination policies, removal, and forced dependency.

The Trump administration's attacks on birthright citizenship do not just threaten immigrant communities. They strike at the very heart of Indigenous sovereignty. They threaten to bring back an era of termination and removal, creating the conditions for Native people to once again be treated as wards of the state, stripped of rights, and relocated to lands or countries we have never set foot in.

Recent reports from the Oregon Capital Chronicle describe how Navajo citizens were detained in immigration sweeps across border states, raising alarm among tribal leaders who warn that racial profiling and the refusal to recognize tribal identification put Indigenous people in the same danger as undocumented immigrants.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence

The American Immigration Council has also warned that the Supreme Court's refusal to restrict racial profiling in immigration raids has encouraged law enforcement to target anyone who looks “foreign,” a pattern that puts Indigenous people at particular risk because our identities and documents are not consistently recognized or treated as valid government documents.

Tribal Nations have alerted their citizens to this threat, suggesting they carry their tribal IDs, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), passports, and other photo IDs to help reduce the risk of detainment in the event of ICE raids.

The Indian Law Resource Center also reminds us that many of those being deported are Indigenous people themselves. The center has raised concern over the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous and have rights under both U.S. and international law.

Indigenous Peoples' Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence — and an assertion that, despite these threats, we will not be erased, silenced, or eradicated.

Indigenous Peoples' Day stands in defiance of a nation that has always treated Native sovereignty as an obstacle to overcome in upholding the myth of Manifest Destiny. In 1871, the Indian Appropriations Act ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations. With that single act, Congress declared that no tribe would be acknowledged as an independent power capable of making treaties. Our nations were reduced to wards of the state, entirely dependent on the same government that had stolen our lands.

The Dawes Act of 1887 went further. It divided tribal lands into individual allotments and stripped millions of acres from Native control. It was designed to assimilate Natives into mainstream society and dismantle tribal sovereignty, breaking apart communities and leaving many Natives impoverished and landless. The act also tied land allotments to U.S. citizenship, granting it to those who accepted allotments, severed their tribal affiliations, and left reservations, making citizenship a tool of assimilation rather than recognition of rights.

With the 1934 passage of the Indian Reorganization Act, also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, tribes regained a measure of sovereignty. The Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to re-establish governments and manage their own lands, but the recognition came with heavy federal oversight. Yet even within those restrictions, our nations rebuilt and strengthened the scope and boundaries of our sovereignty.

As Native peoples, we are citizens of the United States, but we are also citizens of our tribal nations. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary. The Act created a dual framework, where we not only have the right to self-determination but also hold rights and responsibilities in two nations simultaneously.

This reality is fragile, and not all Native nations share the same protection. As Teen Vogue reported, nearly 400 tribes in the United States lack federal recognition, which means they do not share the same nation-to-nation relationship that federally recognized tribes have with the U.S. government. This also leaves their people without the legal rights, resources, or protections guaranteed to federally recognized tribes. For these communities, the lack of recognition means they exist in a legal limbo when federal policy turns hostile.

As Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author and professor of American Indian studies and lecturer at the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center, explained to Truthout:

Tribal sovereignty as a legal principle and self-determination as tribal autonomy has always been what's at stake for tribal nations. Throughout U.S. history it has never been unassailable in U.S. law because of underlying logics of Euro-Christian superiority; that is what the doctrine of discovery is.

History has shown that while our sovereignty is an organic, inalienable right, it is not a fixed or guaranteed right in relation to the U.S. government. Indigenous nations must continually nurture the nation-to-nation relationship that we have and defend our sovereignty against political systems designed to limit or erase it.

If tribal sovereignty were ever dissolved as it was in 1871 with the Indian Appropriations Act, recognition of our tribal citizenship would disappear with it. If our U.S. citizenship were also revoked, we would be left stateless in our own homelands. That is the depth of what is at stake when sovereignty is undermined. Native identity, rights, and futures are tied to the recognition of both forms of citizenship, to the survival of our nations as sovereign powers, and to the protection of the land and water that sustain us.

The Trump administration's attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents. They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them. Treaty obligations are dismissed whenever they conflict with corporate interests. Sacred lands such as Bears Ears and Oak Flat are stripped of federal protection and opened to mining and drilling. Pipelines are forced through Native territories without consultation or consent. Federal funding for housing, health care, and education — already limited in many communities — is repeatedly threatened, further weakening the foundations of Native life.

Native children face a direct threat to their connection to their nations through attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, which has been challenged in multiple cases in state and federal courts. Native tribes and organizations successfully defended and even expanded this law.

Passed in 1978 to stop the mass removal of Native children from their families and communities, the Indian Child Welfare Act protects the right of children to remain with their families, in their communities, and connected to their cultures.

The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Despite ongoing challenges, the law remains one of the most important protections for tribal sovereignty and Native families. In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act's constitutionality in a 7–2 decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, rejecting all challenges to the law.

More recently, in August 2024, the California Supreme Court strengthened the Indian Child Welfare Act by requiring child welfare agencies to investigate a child's potential Native ancestry before separating families. But around the same time, the rejection of the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act denied survivors of cultural genocide a path to justice. The proposed commission would have investigated the legacy of Indian boarding schools and given survivors a chance to tell their stories and seek accountability.

Attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, birthright citizenship, and tribal sovereignty are interconnected. Each is a threat to the dual citizenship Native people hold. Undermining either form of citizenship puts Native people at risk of legal limbo, statelessness, and social and economic marginalization. The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Despite continued threats to our sovereignty, Native nations, communities, and organizations use every means available, from the courts to direct action, to defend our rights and existence. The victories won and even the losses show that even in the face of systemic erasure and violence, Native people refuse to disappear, refuse to surrender.

The fight to protect Oak Flat in Arizona is a current example of this. Oak Flat, a sacred Apache site, is threatened by a copper mine authorized through a congressional land swap pushed by the Trump administration. Tribal leaders, activists, and allies organized to defend Oak Flat, arguing in court and mobilizing to ensure that sacred land is not exchanged and destroyed for foreign private profit.

As of October 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear further appeals, supporting lower court rulings that allow the transfer to proceed. However, a federal appeals court issued an emergency injunction blocking the transfer and delaying the mine's advance while legal challenges are considered.

At Standing Rock, hundreds of tribes and tens of thousands of allies gathered and occupied land near the Cannonball River in North Dakota to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline to protect treaty lands and water. Although the pipeline was completed, the resistance led to widespread awareness of Indigenous rights and environmental justice.

Standing Rock sparked solidarity actions around the world, inspired divestment campaigns targeting banks that financed the pipeline, and brought issues such as broken treaties, environmental racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women into global conversations. It also resulted in ongoing legal challenges and inspired a new generation of Native activists who understand that sovereignty is not negotiable.

These interventions, whether through the courts or activism, are not symbolic but the literal defense of rights that are supposed to be guaranteed under tribal and U.S. law. It is the refusal to accept marginalization, neglect, erasure, and defeat. Indigenous Peoples' Day is both a reflection of these struggles and a call to continue the fight.

In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples' Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty. When birthright citizenship is questioned, when sacred lands are desecrated, when funding for essential programs is threatened, and when cultural institutions are ignored or attacked, the very survival of our communities is at stake.

In an interview with Truthout, Dina Gilio-Whitaker explained:

Tribes will always be a threat to a certain segment of the American population (currently coded as Republican) because the doctrine of tribal sovereignty erects a system of guardrails to protect the rights that hundreds of treaties guaranteed, and the small amount of land that tribes still control. Those lands hold coveted resources that tribes have the power to choose to develop or keep in the ground.

Indigenous Peoples' Day calls on everyone to honor our survival and acknowledge the ongoing struggle against colonization and genocide. Our struggles are not isolated; they echo in other parts of the world, from the defense of our homelands here to the fight for survival in Gaza, where people continue to resist displacement and violence. It is a reminder that what happens to Native nations today is a glimpse of what can happen to any community when power goes unchecked and rights are violated. Indigenous Peoples' Day reminds us that defending our sovereignty is defending justice for all.



Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Russia is ready to test European borders and escalate the current tensions into an open confrontation at any moment, German intelligence head Martin Jaeger told German lawmakers on Oct. 13.

"We can't simply wait and assume that a potential Russian attack won't come before 2029," Jaeger said. "We're already under fire today."

The comments echo warnings by Western officials about Moscow's escalating hybrid operations across Europe, including drone incursions, sabotage, and cyberattacks.

While NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned that Russia will be ready for an open military clash with the alliance in five years, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted that the ongoing hybrid campaign means Europe is already no longer at peace.

"Russia is concealing its true intentions, but in fact it's probing our borders," Jaeger told the Bundestag. "At best, Europe is in a state of cold peace — one that could flare into a hot confrontation at any moment."

The head of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND), who previously served as an ambassador to Kyiv, warned that Russia will interpret restraint as weakness, adding, "We must confront our adversaries wherever necessary."

Friction between NATO and Moscow has intensified since the allies rallied behind Kyiv after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Recent weeks saw the tensions surge further after Russian drones and aircraft repeatedly violated allied airspace. Suspicious drone sightings also caused disruptions to air traffic in Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

In early September, Polish and allied forces shot down several Russian drones over Poland's territory, marking the first such instance since the outbreak of Moscow's full-scale invasion.

The incursions prompted calls for strengthening allied defenses, while some NATO members urged downing Russian aircraft if necessary.

When British leadership development consultant Katie Best asked executives from 120 organizations to reveal their most pressing challenges, 50 per cent named leading change, 37 per cent executing strategy and 36 per cent motivating teams. 

“What I found particularly interesting was how very few people saw decision making and leading others as challenges. However, the research elsewhere repeatedly shows that leading others is one of the biggest complaints of those being led – that their leaders are not up to the job,” she noted in an email exchange after I read her book The Ten Toughest leadership Problems.

The 10 she chose to focus on aren't ranked in terms of most important or difficult to handle. Instead, she went from those most personally derived – ones where we get in the way of ourselves – to the biggest corporate problems. You may therefore want to rank them in importance yourself as you read the list: Personal effectiveness, decision-making, influence, individual performance, engagement, teamwork, hybrid and remote working, delivering on strategy, culture and values and leading change. You might also want to ponder the managers around you and what are the toughest for them; what is the organization, generally, struggling with most?

Most on her list are perennial issues but dealing with a remote and hybrid workforce is new, primarily a product of the past five years. Her approach is to dig in and define the issue clearly, because remote and hybrid work is an umbrella phrase for a number of specific tests it creates for managers – things we took for granted that we no longer can. 

She asks: Is it harder to talk – to know when somebody wants to chat with you or to check in with them? Are you under-sharing, as you stick to just the most important stuff with fewer chances to talk? Is online work leading to more distraction? Are team members finding it harder to create and innovate? Does there seem to be less trust, as is common with online connectivity compared to face-to-face? Is it harder to observe what others are doing? Is it harder to build careers, with fewer chances to network and share information? Are you finding a weakening of culture and values when you are no longer working in an office space loaded with the artifacts of culture and surrounded by people having conversations and interacting in a way that is culturally aligned? 

If you are in a position to develop the organization's policy, she reminds you that there are benefits from a remote and hybrid policy, notably autonomy and flexibility, a greater chance for deep work and the opportunity to reduce the time, money and carbon footprints. If the challenge you face is managing a remote or hybrid work force, she suggests concentrating on three key areas:

Of the other tough leadership problems she presents, influence is the one that probably gets the least attention, perhaps because it involves – or should involve – subtleties or because the idea of wielding power can be personally unsettling. 

“Establishing and using power and influence at work is always hard. And our increasingly flat hierarchies, which mean people aren't keen on being told what to do, have made it harder,” she writes in the book.

Dealing with the issue starts, she believes, by describing it specifically in a few sentences. Who are you trying to influence – are they a junior, a peer, a senior or a client? What have you done, if anything, to try to get them to do what you want them to do and why has your approach not worked? How do you think they see you? Do they see you as someone they are prepared to be influenced by?

 She highlights three common practices that can fail:

Sharpening your influence skills can help with the tough challenge of leading others, one of the challenges she suspects from her questionnaire leaders are less effective at than they believe.

The disruption reportedly affected parts of the live transmission, though the broadcaster did not specify the source of the interference.

The broadcaster's news channel, TVP Info, reported that “there was foreign interference with the satellite links through which the Lithuania–Poland match was being broadcast,” citing information from satellite operator Eutelsat. Officials said the incident was under investigation as efforts continued to identify those responsible for the attack.

The match was held in Kaunas, southern Lithuania, where around 5,000 Polish fans were in attendance. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also watched the game from the stands.

Poland ultimately defeated Lithuania 2–0 in the Group G World Cup qualifier, strengthening their hold on second place behind the Netherlands.

MOSCOW, October 13. /TASS/. Launching Tomahawk missiles would require the involvement of US personnel, so the potential delivery of such missiles to Kiev could have serious consequences, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

"The handling of such sophisticated missiles would inevitably require the involvement of American specialists. That's an evident fact. This is what Medvedev's post is about," he said, asked to comment on Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev's social media post saying that such weapons transfers could "end badly" for everyone.

"Any expert who monitors the issue understands it perfectly well," Peskov added.

Earlier, Medvedev wrote on Russia's Max national messenger that the potential shipment of Tomahawk missiles to Kiev would do no good to anyone. He emphasized that it's impossible to determine if a flying Tomahawk missile was carrying nuclear weapons or conventional ones, which had been stressed repeatedly. "It's not Banderite Kiev but the US that will carry out launches," the Russian Security Council deputy chairman noted.

First came seven men, re-emerging from Gaza after 738 days of captivity.

Then came the remaining 13, their release inaugurating a momentous day for the Middle East more than two years after a Hamas-led attack on Israel sparked a war that killed tens of thousands. The 20 men were handed over by Hamas, marking the end of their captivity as the last hostages who are still alive after they were seized by militants on Oct. 7, 2023. 

“All of our living hostages have come back to us. What wonder,” Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday.

In Tel Aviv, thousands gathered to watch and cheer the return of the remaining living hostages, some wiping away tears as speakers swelled with the sounds of the song They're Coming Home.

Family and friends of Israeli hostages burst into tears and cheers of joy while watching their release. Parents of the hostages were taken to a military facility near Gaza border where they could see their loved ones being handed by the Red Cross to the Israeli army.

“It's the first time I'm crying. I didn't cry for two years,” said Gila Sharabani, a retired lawyer who spent hundreds of days at Hostage Square, a rallying point in central Tel Aviv, bringing hot tea to the families of people taken captive in Gaza and then returning, again and again, as a show of hope. 

“Happy is not the word. It's too small,” she said. 

“Unbelievable. Unbelievable.”

The remains of another 28 deceased hostages were also expected to be released, in exchange for 1,950 Palestinian prisoners. The prisoners began to be delivered by bus on Monday – but by evening, Hamas had promised to return the remains of only four of the dead captives.

World leaders gathering in Egypt throw their weight behind deal to end war in Gaza

The U.S. President came to greet released hostages and speak to the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, before planning a departure for Egypt for a peace conference intended to chart a new course for the war-torn region. Mr. Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were both expected to attend that conference alongside numerous foreign leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. But Mr. Netanyahu has declined the invitation, his office said in a statement Monday, citing a conflict with a Jewish holiday.

“The release of hostages must be a turning point toward lasting peace,” Mr. Carney said in a statement, in which he paid tribute to Canadians killed in the Hamas-led attacks two years ago: Canadians Vivian Silver, Netta Epstein, Alexandre Look, Judih Weinstein, Shir Georgy, Ben Mizrachi, and Adi Vital-Kaploun.

Many in Israel mixed gratitude to the Israel Defense Forces with thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump, including some Knesset members who wore red ballcaps with the words: TRUMP THE PEACE PRESIDENT.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a 'historic dawn of a new Middle East' in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

The Associated Press

“As far as I'm concerned, the war is over,” Mr. Trump said as he arrived at the Knesset, where Speaker Amir Ohana called him the best friend Israel has ever had. The U.S. President smiled as Knesset members chanted: “Thank you, Trump.”

Mr. Trump called Monday “the historic dawn of a new Middle East.”

The war in Gaza, he added, had been “getting bad. It was getting heated.” He recalled telling Mr. Netanyahu he would be remembered more for ceasing hostilities “than if you kept this thing going, going, going – kill, kill, kill.'” 

Mr. Trump promised the U.S. would be “a partner” in next stages for peace in the region, but made no commitment of troops or other tangible contributions to safeguard stability.

He received standing ovations for his speech, although two Knesset members were removed after holding up a sign protesting the U.S. President.

Mr. Netanyahu, meanwhile, struck a defiant note, telling critics of Israel's fierce war: “We were right.”

Israel killed more than 67,000 in its war on Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government. An independent United Nations commission said Israel had committed genocide, a charge Israel denies.

“Our enemies now understand just how powerful and just how determined Israel is. They understand that attacking Israel on Oct. 7 was a catastrophic mistake. They understand that Israel is strong, and that Israel is here to stay,” Mr. Netanyahu said.

Much remains uncertain, including how long the fragile ceasefire can hold, and what role Hamas will accept in Gaza, where its armed militants immediately returned to streets as hostilities with Israel ceased.

”The return of the hostages is one thing, but the end of the war, that's very important,” said Alex Grab, a retired history professor. In that, he said, “I'm not confident at all.” He trusts neither Hamas to keep its bargain, nor in Israel's Prime Minister to hold to his commitments to peace: “I don't think that Netanyahu is interested. He was forced to do this by Trump.”

The war, too, has left deep scars.

”Gaza was flattened, destroyed,” Mr. Grab said. “Israel is in crisis. Despite their success now, the euphoria now, I think Israel has got a lot of issues.”

But in Israel, the release of hostages marks the conclusion of a lengthy national agony. At the country's main airport, volunteers handed Israeli flags to arriving passengers. News footage of hostages moving in Red Cross vehicles was broadcast live in cafes, on phones and in countless living rooms across the country. Those pictures showed one hostage pumping his fist in celebration as he arrived in a hospital, while images distributed by the government showed young men embracing their families in emotional reunions.

”For a few days, we were very nervous, because we didn't know anyone's condition,” said Auneg Rahamim, whose husband's cousin is Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier among those released Monday. 

“When we were told that he's walking on his feet and he's smiling and he's okay – nothing else matters.”

She patted her pregnant belly. “All we wanted was Matan to be back home to meet his future cousin,” she said at Ichilov Medical Center, where staff placed an enormous “Welcome” sign on the concrete outside the hospital, visible from the rooftop helipad where several hostages arrived early in the afternoon.

In a brief video call distributed on social media, Mr. Angrest said he had persevered “out of love for the country and the flag.” As friends gathered outside the hospital for a loud rendition of a football song, Mr. Angrest stuck his hands out from a hospital window, fingers dancing to the beat.

The return of hostages is “a hole in the heart that's getting filled now, and it's going to have to get healed,” said Camelia Mendelovich, a friend who has helped to support the family of Elkana Bohbot, who had helped to plan the music festival that was attacked by militants on Oct. 7, 2023.

The length of his captivity was evident in a sign Ms. Mendelovich carried, imprinted with 34, his age when he was taken hostage, scratched out and replaced with a 36, his age now. 

“Israeli resilience won,” said Yoseph Haddad, an influential social media personality with nearly a million followers on Instagram. 

“We've been in the last two years, fighting on seven fronts – Yemen, the Houthis; Lebanon, Hezbollah; Ansar Allah in Iraq; we have Syria; we have Hamas; the West Bank; the [Iranian Revolutionary Guards],” he said in an interview.

“And we're still standing. Standing tall.”

Editorial 

16:40 JST, October 13, 2025

It has been only about a month since the supreme leaders of China, Russia and North Korea gathered in Beijing in September. This time, the three countries in Pyongyang once again demonstrated their solidarity.

The collusion between North Korea, China and Russia that ignores international law and attempts to rewrite the order cannot be overlooked.

North Korea held a large-scale military parade in Pyongyang on Friday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea. Alongside Kim Jong Un, the party's general secretary, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev were among those who watched the parade.

North Korea continues to ignore U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions and strengthen its nuclear and missile capabilities. The bizarre aspect is that the key figures from China and Russia — permanent members of the Security Council who should bear responsibility for world peace and stability — have observed this very development.

It has been pointed out that North Korea possesses about 2 tons of highly enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear weapons and is capable of producing 100 nuclear warheads. China and Russia once opposed North Korea for possessing nuclear weapons, but some observers believe they have shifted to not pursuing Pyongyang's denuclearization.

North Korea's nuclear development poses a serious threat to the international community and must never be tolerated.

The collusion of the three countries has repercussions extending beyond East Asia. Russia invaded Ukraine, and North Korea has also joined in by dispatching troops there. By importing energy from Russia, China supports its wartime economy, thereby delaying the end of the war in Ukraine.

The latest military parade unveiled a new Hwasong-20 intercontinental ballistic missile, which is believed to have the capability to strike anywhere in the United States. Advanced weapons such as drone-launching vehicles and hypersonic missiles, which are considered difficult to intercept, also made appearances.

“Our army should continue to grow into an invincible entity that destroys all threats approaching our range of self-defense,” Kim said in his speech. Japan, the United States and South Korea must unite and intensify pressure to deter North Korea.

A concerning aspect is that U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to break the deadlock through a summit with Kim, as he did during his first term.

If Trump makes concessions to Pyongyang, such as allowing possession of nuclear weapons and medium- and short-range ballistic missiles in exchange for scrapping ICBMs capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, it could jeopardize regional security.

At the Japan-South Korea summit held at the end of September, the two countries confirmed their continued cooperation toward the complete denuclearization of North Korea. Japan and South Korea, both U.S. allies, must persistently urge Trump not to rush into a hasty deal with Pyongyang.

Editor's note: The story has been updated with additional details.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, arrived in Kyiv on Oct. 13 for discussions with Ukrainian officials on Europe's financial and military support for the war-torn country.

The talks will also concern Ukraine's energy sector and "holding Russia accountable for its war crimes," Kallas said on X.

The visit comes as Russia has escalated attacks against Ukraine's energy grid as winter draws near. A combined missile and drone strike on Oct. 10 caused widespread outages in Kyiv and across Ukrainian regions.

Later in the day, Kallas announced that the EU has pledged an initial 10 million euros ($11.5 million) to set up a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's aggression against Ukraine, alongside another 6 million euros ($7 million) to support Ukrainian children deported by Russia and victims of sexual violence.

"The EU has already mobilized 800 million euros ($930 million) to support Ukraine this winter," Kallas said at a joint press conference with Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha.

 "We are working on an extra 100 million euros ($120 million) for generators, shelters, and cold-weather gear."

Sybiha, in turn, highlighted European military support for Ukraine under the NATO-led Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) program, which allows allies to purchase U.S. arms for Kyiv.

Six countries have already allocated funds to PURL, and seven more nations have signaled intent to participate, Ukraine's chief diplomat said during the briefing.

NATO allies have allocated over $2 billion for Ukraine under the initiative in September, with the first shipments approved by the Trump administration reportedly including Patriot and HIMARS missiles.

Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden have already allocated funds to PURL. 

Other allies, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Iceland, and Slovenia, also voiced readiness to participate.

"This year, the European Union is providing record levels of military support. EU sanctions have already deprived Russia of hundreds of billions of euros to fund its war," Kallas said, pledging further measures.

"Maybe time was once on Russia's side, but it's shifting to Ukraine now."

As Russia ramps up its attacks, Kyiv has called upon its Western partners to strengthen Ukrainian air defenses and use immobilized assets to aid Ukraine.

European leaders have been discussing the use of frozen Russian central bank assets to fund a so-called reparations loan, which could provide Kyiv with at least 140 billion euros ($160 billion), to be repaid only once Moscow agrees to pay war reparations.

Recent months also saw tensions rise between Moscow and Europe due to Russian drones and aircraft repeatedly violating NATO airspace. Further suspicious drone sightings caused airport disruptions in Denmark, Norway, and Germany.

Kallas is scheduled to chair a meeting of EU defense ministers in Brussels on Oct. 15, where the European officials "will exchange views on defense readiness."

Ukrainian drones struck the largest Russian oil depot in the city of Feodosia in occupied Crimea overnight on Oct. 13 sparking a massive blaze, a source in Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.

"Drones hit at least five tanks. A large-scale fire is recorded on the territory of the oil depot," the source said.

Videos shared on social media during the night showed a large blaze and thick black smoke rising from the depot. Residents reported that the glow from the fire was visible from various parts of the city.

The source said an electricity substation in Feodosia had also been hit, as well as another in Simferopol.

"The SBU continues to systematically reduce the enemy's military, logistical and economic capacity to wage war against Ukraine," they added.

Russian air defenses intercepted 103 drones overnight across Russian and occupied Ukrainian territories, including 40 over Crimea, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed.

The strike reportedly occurred around midnight, marking the second attack on the facility in a week — the previous one took place on Oct. 6, according to the Crimean Wind Telegram channel.

Aksyonov said emergency services were responding at the site and reported no casualties.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims

The oil depot in Feodosia is a multifunctional facility used for the transshipment of oil and oil products between rail tankers, sea vessels, and road transport. 

Located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) from Ukraine-controlled territory, it is the largest oil storage facility in Crimea. It can hold up to 250,000 tons of fuel, which supplies Russian forces.

Ukrainian forces routinely target Russian oil infrastructure, a critical financial resource fueling Moscow's full-scale war.

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Oct. 11 that Russia's oil processing capacity has dropped by 21% amid Ukrainian attacks. Several Russian regions are facing gasoline shortages as Moscow ramps up fuel imports.

 How the Anger Economy Will Supercharge Populism

 Beatrice Magistro, Sophie Borwein, R. Michael Alvarez, Bart Bonikowski, and Peter John Loewen

The AI economic transformation has begun. In May, IBM declared that it had fired hundreds of employees and replaced them with artificial intelligence chatbots. Over the summer, Salesforce let go of large numbers of people thanks to AI; UPS, JPMorgan Chase, and Wendy's are also slashing head counts as they automate more functions. College graduates are having a harder time finding entry-level jobs than they have in nearly a decade. And these trends are just the beginning. In survey after survey, corporations across the world say that they plan to use AI to transform their workforces.

Artificial intelligence will likely create new employment opportunities even as it disrupts existing ones, and economists disagree on whether the net effect will be job losses, job gains, or simply restructuring. But whatever the long-term consequences are, AI will soon become a major political issue. If there is significant disruption, officials will be confronted by workers furious about jobs lost to machines. Voters will make their frustrations known at the ballot box. Politicians will therefore have to come up with plans for protecting their constituents, and fast.

To create an effective strategy for addressing large-scale AI disruption, however, policymakers will need to understand how workers themselves perceive the technological threat. In November 2023, we surveyed 6,000 Americans and Canadians to gauge their level of concern about AI-induced mass layoffs and how the government should deal with the issue. Our findings revealed the scale of the challenge: respondents ranked fears about AI taking their jobs ahead of all other concerns about the technology, including its potential for military use.

When it comes to policy preferences, however, there is ground for both optimism and pessimism. On the positive side of the ledger, most respondents favored measures such as retraining programs and expanded safety nets—technocratic fixes that economists believe can work. But on the negative side, many also supported new trade restrictions and immigration barriers, strategies that could make the problem even worse and that governments may well be tempted, for political reasons, to adopt. Multiple countries, after all, responded to the layoffs created by offshoring with harsh tariffs and more deportations—even though neither technique worked. If they are serious about solving the problem and not incurring another round of populist backlash, policymakers should start rolling out the right responses now, before AI layoffs ramp up and while the most effective solutions still command widespread support.

To determine how voters want the government to manage AI layoffs, we did not conduct a simple poll. Instead, we wrote 81 scenarios involving either AI adoption or offshoring in which the economic shock had different effects on employment and prices. In one scenario, for instance, AI reduced smartphone prices by 50 percent while eliminating 25 percent of factory jobs and creating 25 percent more data science positions; in another, prices remained unchanged while customer service jobs decreased by 25 percent and factory employment stayed constant. We then gave respondents four of these scenarios to examine, each randomly chosen. We also presented respondents with a menu of possible policy responses—retraining programs, an expansion of the safety net, regulations to govern the economic shock they had seen (either AI deployment or offshoring), trade barriers, and immigration restrictions—and asked whether they supported each one. Respondents were randomly asked to evaluate either AI or offshoring scenarios, not both, allowing us to compare whether voters responded differently to domestic technological change versus foreign competition, and whether similar economic tradeoffs generated similar policy preferences across different types of disruption.

The results were clear. Regardless of what political party they belonged to, respondents in both countries ranked worker retraining as their preferred policy. Average support clocked in at four out of five, where one represents strong opposition and five strong support. Regulation of AI was the second most popular policy, also with broad support across the political spectrum. Expanding social spending, meanwhile, came in third—albeit with much less support among Republicans in the United States and slightly less support from conservatives in Canada.

These outcomes were encouraging. Ask economists what policy they would recommend in response to AI-driven layoffs, and most would say retraining, regulation, or social insurance. The logic is simple. Technological change can be slowed, but it is almost impossible to stop, and so the best thing governments can do for affected citizens is to give them new skills, set sensible guardrails, and create new unemployment benefits.

The problem is that governments today rarely put these policies into practice. In response to recent economic shocks, such as when trade slashed manufacturing jobs from wealthy countries, most states did not set up large retraining systems. The regulatory picture is equally grim. Despite the AI boom, few governments have passed comprehensive legislation related to AI—the European Union's AI Act being the notable exception. And safety-net expansions look even less likely, particularly at a time when many governments are laden with debt. In fact, Washington is slashing social programs, including public health insurance and nutritional assistance, as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's signature July spending bill.

Optimists might hope that as AI-induced disruption increases, policymakers will feel compelled to invest in retraining, social programs, regulations, or some combination thereof. But history suggests that the pressure to regulate and compensate could actually wane as the years go by. When it comes to economic dislocation, politicians face what social scientists call time-inconsistency problems. Before a disruptive technology is widely adopted—or a trade agreement is signed—those who stand to benefit have strong incentives to promise compensation to those who will lose out, in order to secure political buy-in. But once the technology is deployed or the agreement is in place, the incentives to follow through evaporate. Reversing the change becomes too costly for the state. The balance of power often shifts decisively toward the winners, who no longer need to placate the losers. The result is that compensation is underfunded, poorly implemented, or abandoned altogether.

The biggest risk, however, may not be that governments will ignore effective fixes. It is that they will adopt policies that will backfire. Many politicians, particularly on the populist right, might respond to AI layoffs by trying to restrict immigration and trade—just as they have to past economic problems.

If they do, the argument will be straightforward. If a government can't shield its people from competition by robots, then at least it can protect them from competition by foreigners. But this zero-sum logic does not hold up in practice. Virtually every piece of research suggests that restricting immigration and trade will not stop companies from adopting AI. In fact, it may hasten layoffs. Reducing trade, for example, will raise input costs, shrink export markets, and heighten policy uncertainty—pressures that make labor-saving technologies such as automation more attractive in exposed industries. Reducing immigration will further encourage AI use by increasing labor costs.

Analysts can try to make these likely consequences clear to voters. But protectionism often polls quite well, and substantial numbers of people already support such steps as responses to AI shocks. Overall, support for immigration restrictions averaged 3.4 out of 5.0 in our survey, while trade restrictions averaged 3.2. Among Republicans, the pattern is even more striking: support for immigration restrictions averaged 4.0 out of 5.0, making it their single most popular policy response, even higher than retraining. Trade restrictions came in at 3.5 among Republicans, roughly equal to retraining and well ahead of social spending. If AI layoffs keep rising, those figures could prove to be low-water marks. According to a study by the political scientist Nicole Wu, when Americans are told that robots threaten employment, Republicans become markedly more hostile to immigrants while Democrats turn against trade. Almost no one favors slowing the pace of AI itself.

There are other reasons why politicians might turn to exclusionary policies. One is that there are comparatively few barriers to implementing these kinds of measures. To set up and fund retraining programs, regulate AI, or expand social welfare, most governments would need to pass legislation and appropriate significant amounts of government spending. Deporting migrants, by contrast, rarely requires fresh laws, and can thus be done relatively quickly. Another is that immigration restrictions and tariffs yield clearly measurable results—thousands of foreigners gone, hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff revenue—in ways that other policies do not. Finally, nativism and protectionism offer voters someone or something to blame. It is easier, after all, to be angry at foreign workers and foreign products than it is to be angry at technological progress.

If voters embrace nativist policies in response to AI, they are unlikely to revert to more effective solutions. According to research on European democracies by the political scientists Alan Jacobs and Mark Kayser, when people negatively affected by economic change turn to far-right parties, they tend to stick with them. Politicians who profit by peddling anti-immigrant or anti-trade rhetoric certainly have few incentives to bring voters back to the center. In fact, some states and parties that have traditionally been hostile to immigration, including the Japanese government, are even outwardly promoting AI as a substitute for foreign workers.

Many of these findings seem to bode poorly for both the future of work and the future of democracy. But as our survey findings show, the right course of action—retraining, regulation, and social welfare—is also the one that people want most. If policymakers want to respond to popular demand, they could pass laws establishing and funding retraining programs that teach workers how to work alongside AI systems, develop skills in sectors less susceptible to automation, or transition into new roles created by AI. They could set up new income support programs for people caught between jobs. Finally, they could pass laws that regulate AI by requiring transparency in automated decision-making, mandating human oversight for high-stakes applications, and establishing liability frameworks for AI-caused harms, which would slow the most disruptive applications and ensure safer deployment without stifling innovation. Governments could pay for these proposals by taxing large AI companies. This would ensure that the businesses that profit from disruption also help manage its consequences.

These policies would not only help millions of workers. They could also help restore faith in government. By acknowledging workers who lose their employment to AI and offering them assistance, officials would demonstrate to voters that the state can, in fact, address their needs. In doing so, politicians would bolster their own political fortunes. According to research by the political economist Yotam Margalit, during the George W. Bush administration, incumbent parties performed better in counties where a larger share of laid-off workers qualified for retraining programs—evidence that voters' access to government support mutes their potential political backlash to job loss. (The United States has funded retraining programs, but not nearly enough.)

Time, however, is running out. AI adoption is accelerating, and its deleterious effects on employment are no longer a speculative problem. They are already widespread, and they will only accelerate in the months to come. Adaptive policies, meanwhile, will take years to yield results. If governments want to protect their economies—and themselves—they must act now.

President Donald Trump said on Oct. 12 that he may authorize sending long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv if Russia refuses to end the war in Ukraine.

Trump told reporters that he had talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the weapons. He noted that the long-range missiles would be sold to NATO, which would then provide them to Ukraine.

Tomlin and the Steelers dominated the Browns in Week 6 and now play the Bengals on Thursday night to start Week 7.

"To be honest, it was shocking to me," Tomlin said of the trade, via Pro Football Talk. "Andrew Berry must be a lot smarter than me or us, because it doesn't make sense to me to trade a quarterback that you think enough of to make your opening starter to a divisional opponent that's hurting in that area. But that's just my personal feeling."

Tomlin went on to praise Flacco's savviness as he gets more ingrained into the Bengals' offense.

Flacco led the Browns to a victory over the Green Bay Packers on Sept. 21. His performance in that game gave fans and experts the expectation that he would help the Bengals on Sunday.

Flacco had 219 passing yards and two touchdown passes, but the Packers came out on top 27-18.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on mounting concerns as the shutdown continues on 'Special Report.'

The National Hockey League played seven games in its young 2025-2026 season by the end of the day last Wednesday. The contests featured a grand total of two fights. 

The government shutdown had run for eight days by the end of the day on that Wednesday. And the now lengthy shutdown sparked two extraordinary verbal brawls in the halls of Congress between lawmakers.

NHL referees Gord Dwyer and Mitch Dunning worked the Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins tilt Wednesday night in DC. Perhaps the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms could have summoned Dwyer and Dunning up to Capitol Hill to dole out a few ten-minute misconducts beforehand.

"You're embarrassing yourself right now!" hollered House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., at Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.

"The only embarrassment here is you!" thundered Lawler at Jeffries.

Tempers exploded as Lawler lay in wait outside the House Radio/TV Gallery Studio for a shutdown smackdown after Jeffries concluded his now-daily press conference. 

"You're not going to talk to me and talk over me when you don't want to hear what I'm going to say!" yelled an animated Jeffries at Lawler, jabbing his index finger toward his colleague's chest but never poking him. 

"Oh, I'm listening," said Lawler.

"So just keep your mouth shut!" shouted the usually cool Jeffries. 

There were multiple rounds of vocal fisticuffs between Members and Congressional leaders.

Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., summoned the press to the hallway outside the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to complain about the shutdown and criticize the Speaker for not swearing-in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., more than two weeks after her election. Johnson then confronted the Arizona senators. And Lawler was nearby, serving as "fourth man in."

"This is absurd," seethed an exasperated Johnson.

"This is the longest the House has gone…" interrupted Gallego.

"Do you want me to answer the question?" shot back Johnson.

"You're not actually answering the question," countered Gallego.

The multiple rounds of brawls in the halls between lawmakers were nearly unprecedented in Congress. The shutdown smackdowns featured arguments about health care. Lawler waved around legislation focused on the Democrats' push during the shutdown: a package to extend Obamacare subsidies.

"If you believe in it so much!" chided Lawler, with a rhetorical uppercut. 

"Bro, do you understand math?" counterpunched Jeffries.

Tensions are spiking at the Capitol. Yours truly asked Johnson about Lawler confronting Jeffries and his decision to step out of the Speaker's Office to engage Kelly and Gallego. I noted to the Speaker that if the House was in session, there may be fistfights in the hallways.

"Are you concerned and is it incumbent upon you as the Speaker to try to lower this temperature?" I asked.

Johnson added that the contretemps "concerns me." He added that he wanted to "restore civility to the institution."

"Let's have policy disputes. But not make it personal. This gets personal. Emotions are high. People are upset. I'm upset. I'm a very patient man. But I am very angry right now because this is dangerous stuff. And so is it better for them to be physically separated right now? It probably is." said Johnson. 

Lawmakers aren't the only ones raging. Thousands of federal workers are fuming at the shutdown. The administration is now firing federal workers. 

"Right now, many families are paying the price for political gridlock that they didn't cause," said American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley.

TENSE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN HOUSE SPEAKER, SENATE DEMS CAUGHT ON CAMERA OVER SHUTDOWN

Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., represents 44,000 federal employees in her district near Washington, DC. She notes that Maryland has lost 15,000 federal jobs since President Trump took office in January. 

"I believe that (the firings) are not only unethical and immoral, but illegal for him to be RIF-ing people during a shutdown. There's no new authority granted to the President or OMB during a shutdown," said Elfreth. "I don't believe in negotiating by threat. It also shows that I think they have the weaker hand and that they're losing the PR battle nationally to resort to threats." 

While the shutdown is the main event, the undercard is a fight between Democrats and Johnson over Grijalva to succeed her late father, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. The elder Grijalva died in March after a battle with cancer.

"I can't hire staff. We don't have an office," said Grijalva "So it's very much second-class citizen feeling for me."

Democrats have tried on multiple occasions to compel the House to swear-in Grijalva during brief, pro forma sessions where the body gavels in and gavels out after just a few seconds. Once in office, Grijalva would provide the crucial 218th signature to go over the head of the Speaker and force the House to vote on a measure to release the Epstein files.

"Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles," shouted Gallego at Johnson during their confrontation in the corridor.

"That's ridiculous," responded Johnson. 

"There's nobody covering up for pedophiles," chirped Lawler from the back of the scrum. "So knock it the hell off."

Johnson denies the Grijalva holdup is about the Epstein files.

"We'll schedule it, I guess, as soon as she wants. It has nothing to do with it," said Johnson. 

But Grijalva wrote to the Speaker last week demanding the House swear her in immediately. And the House still hasn't sworn her in.

Circumstances were different this spring when the House GOP majority dwindled to a net seat of one. Republicans needed as many votes as they could muster to pass parliamentary frameworks for the Big, Beautiful Bill. Johnson swore-in Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., a day after they won special elections.

"These guys worked hard and they earned the position," said Johnson when he met with them back in April. "These gentlemen are going to come in and help us deliver the America First agenda." 

Johnson noted that swearing-in Fine and Patronis made "the margin a little more comfortable" for House Republicans.

So Johnson is keeping the House out of session for now. House Democrats are returning to Capitol Hill this week to make a point of Johnson keeping the House out of session during the shutdown. Regardless, pouring everyone back into the Capitol would likely trigger the Congressional equivalent of a line brawl. 

There are unwritten rules about hockey fights. You don't sucker punch someone. You don't knee your opponent. You generally square off in a fight with someone in your same weight class. In hockey, both sides warm up on their own side of the red line before the game and between periods. Violation of that code might trigger a big brawl.

Lawmakers from both sides seemingly left their own side of the rink to pick fights with the other side. Gallego and Kelly outside the Speaker's Office. Lawler outside Jeffries' news conference.

But lawmakers are apparently ignoring these unwritten rules. The government shutdown soon enters its third week and everyone is dropping their gloves.

Wichita police are asking for the public's help identifying a woman reportedly taken by force early Sunday morning — an incident that has left neighbors uneasy.

Authorities posted photos and surveillance footage showing the woman last seen around 2 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 12, in the 1400 block of North Volutsia, between Grove and Hillside. Investigators said they have pursued multiple leads throughout the day and thanked the community for its support.

"We've worked throughout the day on this investigation, following up on numerous leads, and we appreciate the public's help," the department shared in a post on X.

So far, neither the man nor the woman seen in the footage has been identified. Police said they are considering all possibilities and have enlisted help from regional and federal agencies.

The 20-second clip shows a woman being dragged away from the front door as she screams for help.

The footage appears to have been captured by a residential security camera, according to authorities, a common feature in the neighborhood.

Investigators enhanced the video's audio to reduce background noise, hoping someone might recognize the woman's voice. Police urged residents to review the footage carefully and contact detectives at 316-268-4407 with any information.

"Your assistance is vital in helping us ensure her safety," the department wrote on Facebook.

Investigators also followed up on a call from Oklahoma initially believed to be connected to the case but later determined to be unrelated.

One resident, who recently returned from visiting family in Mexico, said the situation has her worried for young women in the area.

"It's dangerous. That's the truth. But, always, I believe there have always been kidnappings," she told KAKE News, adding that she had never seen anything like this happen in her neighborhood.

As of Monday afternoon, police reported no significant updates. Investigators told Fox News Digital that they are continuing to analyze the video frame by frame, looking for any details that could help identify the people involved.

Penn State Nittany Lions athletic director Pat Kraft made the decision to fire head football coach James Franklin, and he told reporters on Monday that it wasn't just the three-game losing streak that led to the decision.

Franklin's departure is a shock to college football, as the leader in the locker room since 2014 parts ways with the Nittany Lions, who will have a whopping $50 million buyout to pay him. 

Kraft said he was "looking at everything" after Penn State's loss to Northwestern, 22-21, on Saturday.

"I felt after sitting down Saturday and looking at everything, at where we were in terms of the best interest of the athletes and where the program was going that we had to make the hard decision," Kraft told reporters, via Sports Illustrated. "Looking at where the program was, where it is, and where we want to be, I felt that there was no other course. I felt it was time."

This is a Penn State program that was ranked No. 2 in the country before the season started. They went 3-0 to begin, but have been in a free fall since. It came to a head against an unranked Northwestern team, as fans' chants to fire Franklin roared even louder than they were when Oregon went into Beaver Stadium and handed them their first loss. 

PENN STATE FIRES JAMES FRANKLIN AFTER STUNNING LOSS TO NORTHWESTERN: REPORT

Kraft and Franklin have had a longstanding friendship as well as a professional relationship, making his firing hard on many levels. 

"James Franklin is a good friend who has always carried himself with dignity, and represented Penn State with absolute class," Kraft explained. "We are all fortunate to have had James Franklin to lead this program for more than a decade and we wish nothing but the best for him and his family."

The Nittany Lions will be led by Terry Smith, Franklin's assistant coach, who has been named the interim head coach. 

Franklin took over as Penn State's head coach before the 2014 season after leading Vanderbilt for three seasons in the same role. He was in his 12th season at Penn State, having brought the team to the College Football Playoff semifinals last season. 

As the team's head coach, Franklin was 104-45. 

Looking ahead, Penn State will be without quarterback Drew Allar for the remainder of the season due to a leg injury suffered in the loss to Northwestern. They will head into a matchup with Iowa next week, but the schedule gets much harder from there.

Penn State will see No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 1, No. 7 Indiana on Nov. 8, and four or more losses would keep them out of the College Football Playoff for this season.

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Republican legislative leaders announced plans Monday to vote next week on redrawing the state's U.S. House district map, taking up President Donald Trump's call to secure more GOP seats nationwide and resist rival moves by Democrats.

The push to retool already right-leaning boundaries for the ninth-largest state comes amid a major party battle spanning several states to revamp district lines to partisan advantage ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

North Carolina Republicans created a map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state's 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022.

Now only one of the House districts –- the 1st District currently represented by Democratic Rep. Don Davis –- is considered a true swing district and could be targeted by the GOP for an 11th seat. Davis won a second term last year by less than 2 percentage points, so shifting slightly portions of the district covering more than 20 northeastern counties could help a Republican candidate in a strong GOP year. But it could weaken districts held by GOP incumbents.

The state's top Republican legislators said their planned action follows Trump's “call urging legislatures across the country to take action to nullify Democrat redistricting efforts.” Davis wasn't mentioned by name in their news release.

Trump “earned a clear mandate from the voters of North Carolina and the rest of the country, and we intend to defend it by drawing an additional Republican Congressional seat,” House Speaker Destin Hall said in the release. Trump has won North Carolina's electoral votes all three times that he's been on the presidential ballot. 

But state House Democratic leader Robert Reives said Monday his GOP colleagues “are stealing a congressional district in order to shield themselves from accountability at the ballot box.”

Trump kickstarted the national redistricting battle over the summer by urging Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts so the GOP could win more seats next year. After overcoming a Democratic walkout, Texas lawmakers redrew the districts to give Republicans a shot at five more seats.

California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own redistricting plan aimed at helping their party win five additional seats, a plan needing voter approval in November to be implemented.

And lawmakers in Republican-led Missouri have approved revised U.S. House districts intended to help Republicans pick up an additional seat there. Other states also are considering redistricting, including Republican-led Indiana and Kansas.

Some North Carolina GOP lawmakers focused complaints Monday on California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who advanced his state's redistricting effort. 

“Picking up where Texas left off, we will hold votes in our October session to redraw North Carolina's congressional map to ensure Gavin Newsom doesn't decide the congressional majority,” Senate leader Phil Berger said. 

Responding on X, Newsom called Berger “another lap dog Republican” and accused the GOP of “rigging elections and trying to cover it up with lies.”

North Carolina lawmakers already had planned for a multiday session starting Oct. 20. Republicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers and redistricting plans aren't subject to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's veto stamp. Candidate filing for 2026 is supposed to begin Dec. 1.

Addressing voters, Stein said in a statement that “shameless politicians are abusing their power to take away yours” with a redraw.

An intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president's party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid. A Democratic takeover could impede Trump's agenda and lead to investigations of his actions, as occurred during his first term in office.

If and how North Carolina legislators create a more favorable redraw may depend on pending litigation filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters challenging several current congressional districts, including the one represented by Davis, one of three Black representatives from North Carolina. The plaintiffs accuse Republican lawmakers of racially discriminating against Black voters by splitting or packing their voting blocs to help GOP candidates win. The trial ended in July without an immediate ruling. 

U.S. House districts typically are redrawn once a decade, after a census. But some states have no prohibition on doing it more frequently. And the U.S. Supreme Court has said there is no federal prohibition on political gerrymandering, in which districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party.

Opponents have filed lawsuits alleging Texas' latest redistricting unconstitutionally dilutes the votes of minority residents and that Missouri's mid-decade redistricting isn't allowed under the state constitution. Meanwhile, Utah's Republican-led Legislature recently endorsed an altered congressional map — though in response to a court order, not Trump's demands.

This story has been corrected to show North Carolina's 1st District covers more than 20 counties, not less than 20.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sat down with ‘Life, Liberty & Levin' to explain why he nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced that he intends to nominate President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in securing a ceasefire and hostage agreement between Hamas and Israel.

It will be Pakistan's second time putting up Trump for the prize. In June, Pakistan nominated Trump for his role in securing a ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and neighboring India.

"Pakistan had nominated President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding, extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire, along with his very wonderful team," Sharif said in Egypt, speaking next to Trump.

"And today, again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel that he is the most genuine and most wonderful candidate for the Peace Prize because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saving millions of people and their lives," he added. "And today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the Middle East."

Trump and Sharif were part of a delegation of world leaders gathered in Egypt's coastal resort area of Sharm el-Sheikh to sign documents related to the peace deal in Gaza.

After announcing his intention to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Sharif turned to the president and made a brief saluting gesture toward him.

"Mr. President, I would like to salute you for your exemplary, visionary leadership. I think you are the man this world needs most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything — who went out of his way to stop seven and, today, eight wars," Sharif added.

Last week, the Nobel Committee in Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado.

While introducing the other world leaders, Trump appeared to chide Norway over last week's choice.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Donna Adelson, the matriarch of a wealthy South Florida family who was convicted in the hired killing of her former son-in-law, was sentenced Monday to life in prison for her role in the 2014 murder-for-hire of Daniel Markel. 

A prominent Florida State University law professor, Markel was locked in a bitter custody battle with his ex-wife, Adelson's daughter, when he was gunned down in 2014 at his home in Tallahassee.

Adelson, 75, was found guilty last month of first-degree murder, conspiracy and solicitation after a weekslong trial. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for the murder charge, with an additional 30 years for the other two counts, to be served consecutively. Adelson has pledged to appeal.

In an emotional statement ahead of the sentencing in a Tallahassee courtroom, Adelson swore she was innocent and cast her trial as a miscarriage of justice, overseen by a jury she said was unduly swayed by years of negative media coverage. 

“What happened to Danny is unforgivable. But I am an innocent woman convicted of this terrible crime without evidence,” Adelson said. 

“I've always respected the law. I've never gotten a parking ticket, But I'm going to prison for a murder I did not commit,” she added.

Circuit Judge Stephen Everett interrupted Adelson multiple times, warning her the statements showed what he termed an “utter lack of remorse” for the crime.




Shackled and dressed in a purple jail jumpsuit, Adelson stood attentively while Everett handed down the sentence. “You certainly can choose to deny your involvement and maintain innocence. The court finds the evidence in this case is clear,” Everett said.

The case had captivated people in Florida for more than a decade amid sordid details of a messy divorce, tensions with wealthy in-laws and custody fights leading to the killing. 

Adelson was the fifth person sentenced for what prosecutors say was a plot to kill Markel. Among those already serving a life sentence for the killing is Adelson's son, Charles Adelson.

At trial, prosecutors had painted Donna Adelson as the calculated and controlling matriarch of an affluent South Florida family with the means and motive to orchestrate the killing of the ex-son-in-law she “hated.” 

Defense attorneys insisted the state didn't have sufficient evidence to link the aging grandmother to the murder plot, instead emphasizing the roles played by others and casting suspicion on two of Adelson's adult children. Wendi Adelson denied involvement in the killing and has not been charged.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A new round of layoffs at the Education Department is depleting an agency that was hit hard in the Trump administration's previous mass firings, threatening new disruption to the nation's students and schools in areas from special education to civil rights enforcement to after-school programs.

The Trump administration started laying off 466 Education Department staffers on Friday amid mass firings across the government meant to pressure Democratic lawmakers over the federal shutdown. The layoffs would cut the agency's workforce by nearly a fifth and leave it reduced to less than half its size when President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20.

The cuts play into Trump's broader plan to shut down the Education Department and parcel its operations to other agencies. Over the summer, the department started handing off its adult education and workforce programs to the Labor Department, and it previously said it was negotiating an agreement to pass its $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to the Treasury Department.

Department officials have not released details on the layoffs and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union that represents more than 2,700 department workers, said information from employees indicates cuts will decimate many offices within the agency.

All but a handful of top officials are being fired at the office that implements the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that ensures millions of students with disabilities get support from their schools, the union said. Unknown numbers are being fired at the Office for Civil Rights, which investigates complaints of discrimination at the nation's schools and universities.




The layoffs would eliminate teams that oversee the flow of grant money to schools across the nation, the union said. It hits the office that oversees Title I funding for the country's low-income schools along with the team that manages 21st Century Community Learning Centers, the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs.

Without staff overseeing funding for high-poverty schools or special education, schools may face delays in receiving reimbursement from the federal government, said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for the American Association of School Administrators. 

“We're talking about the people who worked on the beating heart of our federal public school programs,” Pudelski said.

The layoffs will also eliminate teams that oversee TRIO, a set of programs that help low-income students pursue college, and another that oversees federal funding for historically Black colleges and universities.

In a statement, union president Rachel Gittleman said the new reductions, on top of previous layoffs, will “double down on the harm to K-12 students, students with disabilities, first generation college students, low-income students, teachers and local education boards.”

The Education Department had about 4,100 employees when Trump took office. After the new layoffs, it would be down to fewer than 2,000. Earlier layoffs in March had roughly halved the department, but some employees were hired back after officials decided they had cut too deep.

The new layoffs drew condemnation from a range of education organizations. Although states design their own competitions to distribute federal funding for after-school programs, a small team of federal officials provided guidance and support “that is absolutely essential,” said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance.

“Firing that team is shocking, devastating, utterly without any basis, and it threatens to cause lasting harm,” Grant said in a statement.

If upheld, the cuts will make it impossible for the government to fulfill its duties carrying out special education laws, according to a statement from the National Association of State Directors of Special Education.

The layoffs will reduce the department's special education office from roughly 200 workers to about five, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, which advocates for people with disabilities. Neas, who helped lead the office under former President Joe Biden, said families rely on those teams to make sure states and schools are following complex disability laws.

One prominent example dates to Trump's first term, when the special education office determined that Texas had illegally placed a cap on the number of students who could receive special education services in each district. Under pressure from the U.S. Education Department, Texas lawmakers lifted the cap in 2017.

“As a result, tens of thousands of children in Texas now can access the education support that they need, whereas before they couldn't,” Neas said.

The government's latest layoffs are being challenged in court by the American Federation of Government Employees and other national labor unions. Their suit, filed in San Francisco, said the government's budgeting and personnel offices overstepped their authority by ordering agencies to carry out layoffs in response to the shutdown.

In a court filing, the Trump administration said the executive branch has wide discretion to reduce the federal workforce. It said the unions could not prove they were harmed by the layoffs because employees would not actually be separated for another 30 to 60 days after receiving notice. ___

A New Jersey county that could play a decisive role in the next month's statewide elections will be reprinting its general election ballots after the Republican National Committee successfully argued that a ballot redesign unlawfully favored Democrats.

The dispute began late last month when Democratic County Clerk James Hogan replaced Gloucester County's legally required party-column ballot format, where each political party's candidates appear under a single vertical heading, with an office-block layout that grouped all candidates for each race together, regardless of party.

Republicans argued the change undermined their visibility on the ballot and blunted their “Vote Column A” campaign after winning the position of Column A in the county's ballot drawing. On Friday, a state appellate court ruled that Hogan's layout violated the law and ordered reprints of ballots in time for early voting later this month.

The panel overturned an earlier ruling by Superior Court Judge Benjamin Telsey, who had agreed the design was illegal but allowed the ballots to stand, citing possible voter confusion. The appellate court said those concerns were unsupported by evidence and ordered new, column-style ballots for in-person voting.

“The existing ballot design does not comply with [state laws] which plainly require ballots for the general election to be arranged in a ‘column' format,” the judges wrote, according to a portion of the ruling seen by New Jersey Globe. “Defendants point to nothing in these provisions that would afford a county clerk any discretion to depart from that format.”

The move was especially controversial because Gloucester is one of several swing counties in New Jersey that have trended more Republican in recent years. Of the state's 21 counties, 18 saw double-digit point swings toward President Donald Trump between 2020 and 2024. Only Burlington, Gloucester, and Cape May saw single-digit shifts, but those were still in Trump's favor.

The design change could have limited Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli's influence in Gloucester County, where two competitive state Assembly seats and control of the county government are also on the line this year. 

Ciattarelli is facing off against Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill to determine who will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.

Election officials must now prepare the column ballot design by Wednesday to meet the Oct. 25 early voting deadline. Mail voters will still use the old office-block ballots, while in-person voters will receive corrected versions.

Last month, Telsey ruled that the clerk's design violated state law but declined to order a reprint. Telsey did, however, order the county to reimburse Republicans $26,007 for campaign materials affected by the illegal ballot design.

CIATTARELLI PLANS TO FILE DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST SHERRILL IN NEW JERSEY GUBERNATORIAL RACE

The lawsuit was backed by RNC Chairman Joe Gruters and led by attorneys for the Dhillon Law Group, founded by Harmeet Dhillon, now the assistant attorney general who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.

“Democrats in New Jersey tried to secretly redesign ballots to make it harder for voters to choose Republican candidates,” Gruters said following the decision Friday. The “court made clear they cannot ignore state election law.”

From Seattle to Baltimore, many Americans were celebrating Monday as Indigenous Peoples Day, determined to see it as a triumph of perseverance over centuries marked by trauma. Tribal nations and communities gathered at powwows, markets and musical performances among other joyful events to honor their culture and their history.

Some states and cities have for decades now made the second Monday in October about honoring Native Americans alongside the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, for whom the federal holiday was declared in 1937. And President Joe Biden signed a declaration recognizing both days. 

President Donald Trump, keeping a vow he made in April, reversed that last week, pledging “to reclaim his extraordinary legacy of faith, courage, perseverance, and virtue from the left-wing arsonists who have sought to destroy his name and dishonor his memory.” 

Trump's tribute to the explorer whose planting of the Spanish flag in the Caribbean in 1492 opened the Americas to “the ultimate triumph of Western civilization” — along with centuries of disease, slavery and conquest that ravaged Indigenous civilizations — is drawing criticism and resignation from Native Americans. 




But some advocates say his posture is hardly unique among previous presidents, and they won't be dissuaded from seeking to build consensus for tribal goals.

This is the first year Indigenous Peoples Day has state recognition in Montana, after a decade-long campaign in the state that is home to 12 federally recognized tribes.

What changed? Democratic State Sen. Shane Morigeau, a citizen of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes who sponsored the legislation, framed it not as a holiday that would eliminate Columbus Day, but as a day of “inclusivity, healing and bringing people together.”

“It's just not an us-versus-them type of day. It's a day that brings everyone together,” Morigeau said. “And if you don't want to go check that out and you want to go do something else and celebrate the other day, you can do that too and our feelings won't be hurt.”

What matters is that both Native and non-Native people can go to an event or do some self-reflection or even “go down to the river and go fishing for the day,” Morigeau said.

After the protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline in 2016 and the racial injustice protests in 2020, more people and institutions questioned the narrative of Columbus as only an intrepid sailor and explorer, arguing for a more complete understanding of his historical impact. Trump's proclamation lambastes this as the villainizing of a “true American hero.”

“Outrageously, in recent years, Christopher Columbus has been a prime target of a vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage,” Trump's proclamation reads. “Left-wing radicals toppled his statues, vandalized his monuments, tarnished his character, and sought to exile him from our public spaces.”

Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project, said it's Trump who is making this a culture war, when the day should be about learning all aspects of history around Columbus.

“If Trump wants to celebrate the good things about Christopher Columbus then let him. Let him do that. But also tell the truth about him and let us also celebrate Indigenous peoples' accomplishments,” said Iron Eyes, who is of the Lakota Sioux Nation. “We don't teach that in America's schools.”

The National Congress of American Indians found it profoundly troubling when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced last month that the soldiers who killed more than 250 men, women and children in the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre would retain their military honors after a review launched under the Biden administration.

Hegseth called it part of his effort to root out “woke” thinking. 

Iron Eyes, who lives on Pine Ridge, called it hurtful.

“We have kids who pay attention,” Iron Eyes said. “When Pete Hegseth is doubling down on wanting to honor people who slaughtered noncombatants and women and children and elderly, the kids are paying attention.”

This has only reinvigorated the Lakota People's Law Project's campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the Wounded Knee military medals, he said.

“We've made hard-fought sacrifices to get to a place where we're saying to each other, ‘Hey, let's tell the truth about each other,'” Iron Eyes said. “Natives aren't savage. They're not impediments to progress. They're not antithetical to civilization.”

In September, Trump's Education Department redirected nearly $500 million in federal funding from schools serving large contingents of Hispanic students, promising the money instead for historically Black colleges and tribal colleges. This could double federal funding to roughly $108 million across the United States for tribal colleges and universities, or TCUs.

“That's what Indian Country wants, to continue to invest in our tribal citizens and Native people and to be contributors to not only our tribal economies, but to the U.S. economy as a whole,” said Larry Wright Jr., executive director of the National Congress of American Indians.

There are 35 accredited TCUS with over 90 campuses across 15 states, most of which are in Indian Country, according to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.

The consortium lauded the funds as “progress toward fulfilling federal trust and treaty obligations” while also noting that it could raise more obstacles for students at non-TCU schools. Many Native Americans are enrolled at the universities that are losing federal funding.

Tribal appropriations were initially included in the Trump administration's efforts to claw back federal spending that it sees as promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. Wright gives credit that the administration heard NCAI officials out and understood “Indian Country is not DEI” — and that there are treaties and trust responsibilities that must be met. He said they've had productive conversations with the administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

“To have that kind of alignment with this administration is a good thing in spite of all the other rhetoric. Truly more so than anything else, I think, from a micro aspect, Indian Country really is dependent on bipartisan efforts to to make sure our issues aren't overlooked and forgotten,” Wright said.

It's worth celebrating. But there's reason to fear what it portends.﻿

On Monday, after weeks of nervous anticipation and growing expectations, it finally appeared possible — though not quite guaranteed — that the brutal two-year war in Gaza is over. Hamas freed the 20 living Israeli hostages it was still holding from the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in exchange for Israel releasing around 1,700 Palestinian prisoners.

The prisoner exchange is the first phase of a 20-point deal proposed by President Donald Trump in September. Trump was in the region on Monday, speaking before Israel's parliament and attending a conference in Egypt on implementation of the agreement, which he hailed as not only the end of the war but as a transformational moment in the history of the Middle East.

Whether that is true remains to be seen.

The success of the deal — to Trump's credit — hinged on his and Arab governments' ability to get Israel and Hamas to agree to the prisoner release and the end of hostilities up front, with thornier long-term issues about the future governance of Gaza, the status of Hamas, and the presence of Israeli troops in the territory still mainly unresolved. The fighting could still resume. Still, the return of the hostages and the halt to the bombing of Gaza allow both Israelis and Palestinians a rare moment of relief and even hope.

But the damage done over the past two years is nearly incalculable.

Over two years of war — launched after Hamas invaded Israel and killed around 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 more as hostages back to Gaza on October 7, 2023 — Israel has annihilated the Gaza Strip. It has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, starved and displaced most of Gaza's 2 million residents, and reduced most of the territory's buildings and infrastructure to rubble. The fate of the hostages also wrenched Israel's population, driving many of its citizens to join massive protests demanding a deal to end the war and return those kidnapped for more than a year. Globally, Israel's conduct has left its reputation in tatters, its leaders charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court and isolated on the world stage by nearly all but its closest ally, the United States. The war, and its unpopularity abroad, led Israel's former allies Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Portugal, and Belgium to recognize Palestinian statehood at last month's U.N. General Assembly.

This is not a deal that Netanyahu's government would have agreed to on its own. Indeed, he reportedly had to be strong-armed pretty aggressively by Trump into agreeing to it.

And yet, it's about as close to an absolute victory for Israel as was conceivable over the past two years. If the deal actually being implemented resembles at all what was first announced by Trump at the beginning of this month, Israel will keep a troop presence in Gaza and the capability to periodically launch future strikes against militants there. Hamas will not control Gaza nor — for the foreseeable future — will the Palestinian Authority. It seems very likely that outside actors, not Israel, will be on the hook to pay for the rebuilding of Gaza. The seemingly impossible dilemmas faced by the Netanyahu government turned out not to be dilemmas at all.

Lessons will be taken from this, by both Israel and the rest of the world. The scale and totality of its operation, and their seeming success in achieving nearly all of the war's goals, could lead the nation, and other militaries, to some very grim conclusions about how to best combat internal threats from militant groups like Hamas in the future.

It was clear from the very start that given the horrors of October 7, this was going to be a different sort of war than the ones — costly for Gaza's civilians but limited in scope and duration — that Israel fought in the territory in 2006, 2008, and 2014. The days of “mowing the grass” — degrading Hamas's capabilities without getting embroiled in a long and costly struggle to wipe the group out entirely — were clearly over.

If Israel was going to try to put an end to Hamas entirely, international observers had suggestions. David Petraeus, former commander of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote in 2024, that Israel was repeating America's post-9/11 mistakes by going to war in Gaza without a plan for a post-war governance structure for the enclave. But, he suggested, Israel should learn from the relative success of the counterinsurgency tactics the US employed in Iraq after 2007.

“Killing and capturing terrorists and insurgents is insufficient,” Petraeus wrote in Foreign Affairs. “[T]he key to solidifying security gains and stemming the recruitment of new adversaries is holding territory, protecting civilians, and providing governance and services to them.”

This is plainly not what Israel did. Commanders weakened safeguards meant to protect noncombatants. According to some reports, more than 80 percent of those killed in Gaza may have been civilians, far higher than in other recent conflicts. More than 70 percent of Gaza's buildings were leveled. Food aid was, at times, blocked entirely.

Israel was continually criticized throughout the war, particularly by Joe Biden's administration, for not having a post-war governance plan for Gaza. But in the end, it simply fought on until one was devised by outside actors, particularly the US, that it found more acceptable than previous plans.

It seems likely that the Gaza War is going to deal a significant blow to the idea of “counterinsurgency” doctrine: that the best way to deal with an insurgency is to win over the local population — to “clear, hold, and build” your way to victory. Israelis might point out that while the 466 soldiers they lost in combat is a very high number compared to other Israeli wars, it's about half of America's losses in the first year of Petraeus's “surge” in Iraq.

Israel fought a war so brutal it was found to have committed genocide by a UN commission and leading international scholars; its prime minister is under indictment by the International Criminal Court. And yet, it ends the war, mostly on its own terms, in a deal touted as a “GREAT DAY” by the president of the United States and fully endorsed by Arab governments.

In short, Israel's overwhelming-force strategy — practically the antithesis of Petraeus's philosophy — was largely successful in the cold terms of achieving its goals. But of course, there are caveats. Israel has deepened its political isolation, and while some of that may fade once the war ends, some of it won't. As Yaroslav Trofimov of the Wall Street Journal writes, increasingly, “solidarity with the Palestinian cause—and hostility to Zionism—have become the political markers of a new generation.” The full extent of the consequences for Israel may not be evident for years. Israel's relationship with the United States is also an exception to the norm: to put it plainly, there aren't many countries that could fight this way and continue to receive billions of dollars per year in military aid. Regardless of Hamas's ultimate fate, it's hard to imagine many Gazans have a more positive attitude toward Israel at the end of this war than at the start of it. It's not hard to imagine a new armed resistance movement emerging and carrying out future attacks on Israel.

And yet, other countries are likely to take the lesson that crushing the enemy is worth the international opprobrium that comes with significant civilian casualties. As a number of commentators put it when discussing US and Israeli strikes on Iran, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell's “Pottery Barn rule,” that when it comes to using military force, “if you break it, you own it,” seems to no longer apply. When it comes to crushing a counterinsurgency, you don't have to “clear, hold, build.” You can just crush.

This feels like yet another indication that we have moved on from the norms of the post-9/11 “war on terror” era — but not to a more humane or lawful form of warfare. Instead, Gaza may perhaps come to be seen as the first counterinsurgency war of the post-“liberal international order” era — an era in which global institutions are weaker and norms around the laws of war, democracy, and human rights are withering.

The coming days will tell whether this is just a hostage exchange and prelude to a new phase of the conflict, or a lasting peace. If it's the latter, it will be welcome relief for Palestinians and allow opportunity for more desperately needed aid to enter Gaza, and for the residents to start to rebuild. Israel will have to reckon with the failures, military and political, that led to the October 7 attacks as it heads into what could be a closely fought national election next year.

But the true legacy of this conflict is likely to become clear only when those future wars break out. When questioned about the way they conduct those wars, governments are likely to point to Israel's example.

President Donald Trump played diplomat and stand-up comedian during his speech at the Knesset, where he celebrated the release of all living hostages from Gaza.

Speaking before the Israeli legislature on Monday, Trump offered a series of off-the-cuff remarks and jokes about corruption scandals, the handsome features of Israel Defense Forces soldiers, his billionaire funders, and his daughter's marriage.

Some of the bits were light-hearted and observational, such as his bemusement by the Hebrew pronunciation of the Abraham Accords — the 2020 normalization agreement between Israel, Bahrain, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, and Sudan.

“I like calling it the ‘Avraham Accords' — ‘Avraham' — it's so cool, it's so much nicer, you know?” Trump told the crowd, to laughter from the lawmakers. “I just don't want to sound too sanctimonious when I do it.”

At another point, Trump expressed his appreciation for the name of the U.S. military's Jun. 22 airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

“Midnight Hammer — boy, that's a great name for what we did,” he said, smiling.

Gesturing toward IDF personnel in attendance, Trump called the soldiers “central casting” for their good looks.

“Let's put 'em in a movie,” Trump said. “You could get rich making movies.”

However, some of Trump's comments went beyond observational and provided glimpses of his relationships with members of the audience.

While praising Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his leadership during wartime, Trump unexpectedly called on Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon “Bibi.”

“Hey, I have an idea — Mr. President, why don't you give him a pardon?” Trump said to massive applause. “By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know. But I happen to like this gentleman right over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.”

Netanyahu is facing three criminal charges for corruption by Israeli courts on allegations that he received illicit gifts.

“Cigars and champagne? Who the hell cares about that?” Trump joked about the allegations before adding, “Okay, enough controversy for the day.”

However, veiled behind Trump's expressions of support for the Jewish state was an undercurrent of political realism as he fluctuated between optimism and grim warning.

“I've always stood for the people of this community, and I always will. I'll always be with you. I'm always gonna be with you,” Trump said before walking that promise back.

“I guess maybe something could happen to change my mind — somebody that's really stupid gets into office and wants to do really bad things, but that's about it,” he continued. “We don't think we're gonna have that happen, I hope we're not gonna have that happen.”

Another subject of Trump's comments was Miriam Adelson, the Israeli American billionaire who worked with her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, to advocate Israeli interests to the president and contributed massively to his 2024 campaign.

“Look at her sitting there so innocently. Sixty billion in the bank […] and she loves Israel,” Trump said after asking Adelson to stand up.

Trump reflected on Adelson's husband's constant requests for meetings, recalling, “He'd call up [and say] ‘Can I come over and see you?' and I'd say ‘Sheldon, I'm the president of the United States, it doesn't work that way.' [But] he'd come in.”

However, Trump's comments about the Adelsons took an awkward turn when he speculated that the cash-flush political donor is more invested in the fate of Israel than the U.S.

“I'm gonna get her in trouble with this — I actually asked her once, I said, ‘So Miriam, I know you love Israel. What do you love more, the United States or Israel?' She refused to answer. That might mean Israel,” Trump said.

The comment received a muted response.

Other targets of Trump's remarks included his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner.

While thanking Kushner for his role in finalizing the peace deal, Trump said his son-in-law “loves [Israel] so much that my own daughter converted.”

“I didn't know this was going to happen,” he remarked before turning to Netanyahu. “And Bibi, you do know this was not in the cards for me.”

“And she is so happy and they are so happy — at least I think they're happy!” he joked. “If they're not happy, we have a big story, right? Nah, they have a great marriage.”

Trump did not stay long in Israel, leaving the Knesset and getting on a plane to Egypt.

President Donald Trump, addressing the Israeli Knesset, urged Israel to work toward peace following the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage deal, an agreement that he declared had effectively ended the Israel-Hamas war and opened the door to building a more stable Middle East.

US President Donald Trump's speech in the Israeli Knesset was briefly interrupted on Monday before two lawmakers were escorted out of the chamber. One of them held up a sign reading “Recognize Palestine”.

President Donald Trump heads next to Egypt for a summit with more than two dozen other nations after urging Israel to seize chance for peace. Trump is running hours late because speeches at the Knesset continued longer than expected.

U.S. President Donald Trump was welcomed Monday at the Israeli parliament. AP reporter Darlene Superville was in the room at the Knesset.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared a “historic dawn of a new Middle East” in a speech to lawmakers in the Israeli parliament.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that he was “committed to this peace” as he addressed the Israeli Parliament during a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump to the country on Monday.

As Israel and Hamas traded hostages and prisoners on Monday, taking a first step toward peace, U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the Knesset, Israel's parliament, telling them he had ended his eighth war. 

“After so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm. The guns are silent. The sirens are still. And the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace,” Trump said.

He then upped the number of wars he claims to have ended in his first eight months in office, saying, “Yesterday I was saying seven, but now I can say eight.” 

But Trump's claim is exaggerated. Much work remains before an end to the war between Israel and Hamas can be declared. That's also true in other countries where Trump claims to have ended wars. 

Here's a closer look:

While the ceasefire and hostage deal is a major achievement, it is still an early and delicate moment in the path to a permanent end to the war, let alone a two state solution. 

The first steps of the agreement Trump brokered included the release of hostages in Gaza, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a surge of humanitarian aid and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.

But major elements remain to be worked out.

After his stop in Israel, Trump gathered with other world leaders in Egypt for a “ Summit of Peace ” to discuss the ceasefire plan. Trump acknowledged that leaders had taken the “first steps to peace” and urged leaders to build on the breakthrough. Trump and other leaders signed a document that he said would “spell out a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things, and it's very comprehensive,” though details were not immediately available.




The next phase of talks is expected to address disarming Hamas, creating a post-war government for Gaza, reconstruction, and the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the territory. Trump's plan also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop a new Palestinian security force. 

At least some, if not all, of those elements need to be worked out, and negotiations over those issues could break down. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said on Monday that he and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, were “already working” on implementation issues.

Trump is credited with ending the 12-day war.

In June, Israel launched attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear program and military leadership, saying it wanted to stop Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has denied it was trying to do that.

Trump negotiated a ceasefire after directing American warplanes to strike Iran's Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites. 

Evelyn Farkas, executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute, said that Trump should get credit for ending the war.

“There's always a chance it could flare up again if Iran restarts its nuclear weapons program, but nonetheless, they were engaged in a hot war with one another,” she said. “And it didn't have any real end in sight before President Trump got involved and gave them an ultimatum.”

Lawrence Haas, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council who is an expert on Israel-Iran tensions, agreed the U.S. was instrumental in securing the ceasefire. But he characterized it as a “temporary respite” from the ongoing “day-to-day cold war” between the two countries that often involves flare-ups.

This could be described as tensions at best, and peace efforts, which do not directly involve the United States, have stalled.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile River has caused friction between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan since the power-generating project was announced more than a decade ago. In July, Ethiopia declared the project complete. It was inaugurated in September.

Egypt and Sudan oppose the dam. Although the vast majority of the water that flows down the Nile originates in Ethiopia, Egyptian agriculture relies on the river almost entirely. Sudan fears flooding and wants to protect its own power-generating dams.

During his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt. He could not get the countries to agree and suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. In July, he posted on social media that he helped the “fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now.” But the disagreement persists, and negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have stalled.

“It would be a gross overstatement to say that these countries are at war,” Haas said. “I mean, they're just not.”

The April killing of tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir pushed India and Pakistan closer to war than they had been in years, but a ceasefire was reached.

Trump has claimed that the U.S. brokered the ceasefire, which he said came about in part because he offered trade concessions. Pakistan thanked Trump, recommending him for the Nobel Peace Prize. India has denied Trump's claims, saying there was no conversation between the U.S. and India on trade in regards to the ceasefire.

Although India played down the Trump administration's role in the ceasefire, Haas and Farkas believe the U.S. deserves some credit for helping stop the fighting.

“I think that President Trump played a constructive role from all accounts, but it may not have been decisive. And again, I'm not sure whether you would define that as a full-blown war,” Farkas said.

The White House lists the conflict between Serbia and Kosovo as one Trump resolved. But there has been no threat of a war between the two neighbors during Trump's second term or any significant contribution from the Republican president this year to improve relations.

Kosovo is a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008. Tensions have persisted since, but never to the point of war, mostly because NATO-led peacekeepers have been deployed in Kosovo, which has been recognized by more than 100 countries.

During his first term, Trump negotiated a wide-ranging deal between the countries, but much of what was agreed on was never carried out.

Trump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, but he is hardly alone and the conflict is far from over.

Eastern Congo, rich in minerals, has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is the M23 rebel group. It is backed by neighboring Rwanda, which claims that it is protecting its territorial interests and that some of those who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide fled to Congo and are working with the Congolese army.

The Trump administration's efforts paid off in June, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. The M23, however, was not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it would not abide by the terms of an agreement that did not involve it.

The final step to peace was meant to be a Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 that would bring about a permanent ceasefire as well as a final agreement to be signed separately between Congo and Rwanda as facilitated by the administration. However, talks have stalled between the different parties amid setbacks, and deadly fighting continues in eastern Congo.

In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House, where they signed a deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called the signed document a “significant milestone.” Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev hailed Trump for performing “a miracle.”

The agreements were intended to reopen key transportation routes and reaffirm Armenia's and Azerbaijan's commitment to signing a peace treaty. The treaty's text was initialed by the countries' foreign ministers at that meeting, which indicated preliminary approval. But the two countries have yet to sign and ratify the deal.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in a bitter conflict over territory since the early 1990s, when ethnic Armenian forces took control of the Karabakh province, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh, and nearby territories. In 2020, Azerbaijan's military recaptured broad swaths of territory. Russia brokered a truce and deployed about 2,000 peacekeepers to the region.

In September 2023, Azerbaijani forces launched a lightning blitz to retake remaining portions. The two countries have worked toward normalizing ties and signing a peace treaty ever since.

Officials from Thailand and Cambodia credit Trump with pushing the Asian neighbors to agree to a ceasefire in this summer's brief border conflict.

Cambodia and Thailand clashed in the past over their shared border. The latest fighting began in July after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.

Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened. Trump said on social media that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., though most of their Southeast Asian neighbors had.

According to Ken Lohatepanont, a political analyst and University of Michigan doctoral candidate, “President Trump's decision to condition a successful conclusion to these talks on a ceasefire likely played a significant role in ensuring that both sides came to the negotiating table when they did.”

DARTMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — A small plane crashed along a major highway in southeastern Massachusetts early Monday amid rain and strong winds, killing both people on board and wounding another person on the ground, authorities said.

In videos shot by people in passing vehicles, smoke could be seen billowing above Interstate 195 from scattered, blazing debris. The highway was closed in both directions near the crash site in Dartmouth, a town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston, the state Department of Transportation said.

The Massachusetts State Police said in a statement it was not aware of any survivors on the plane, which it said may have been attempting to land at New Bedford Regional Airport. Officials said it does not appear the pilot provided the airport with a flight plan or passenger details.

A spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said it was investigating the crash, saying a Socata TBM-700 had departed from the New Bedford airport.

No information about the people on board is being made public pending notification of next of kin, authorities said.

A person on the ground was taken to a hospital, state police said.

In a Facebook post, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell extended his condolences to the loved ones of those lost in the “tragic plane crash.” New Bedford Regional Airport officials are prepared to support the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation, Mitchell said.

“I am grateful that the crash miraculously did not result in serious injuries to motorists on Interstate 195,” he said. 




At the time of the crash, the National Weather Service said a nor'easter had brought rain and winds from 30 to 40 mph (48 to 64 kph) to the area.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which state police said would likely take over the investigation, said in an email that it could not respond to media inquiries due to the government shutdown.

House Speaker Mike Johnson joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the government shutdown, President Donald Trump's direction to pay U.S. troops, the battle over healthcare and more.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., delivered a stark warning during a Monday press conference on Day 13 of the government shutdown.

"We're barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history unless Democrats drop their partisan demands and pass a clean, no-strings-attached budget to reopen the government and pay our federal workers," the leader of the House of Representatives said.

The government entered into a shutdown nearly two weeks ago on Oct. 1 after Senate Democrats rejected the GOP's federal funding plan. They have since blocked consideration of the same bill six more times.

During his press conference, Johnson referenced former President Barack Obama telling a crowd over a decade ago, "There is one way out of this reckless and damaging Republican shutdown: Congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached."

"What I just read was a direct quote. Those are not my words. They belong to President Barack Obama. He was speaking there in 2013 when our government was shut down for 16 days," he said. "This would be the third-longest government shutdown in American history, that one would be."

He added, "If Democrats keep up their obstruction here today, that's where we're going to be headed."

The longest shutdown in U.S. history lasted 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019, during President Donald Trump's first term.

The second-longest was a 21-day shutdown under former President Bill Clinton between December 1995 and January 1996, followed by the shutdown under Obama.

At this point, the 2025 shutdown is the fifth-longest in history, just behind the 1978 shutdown under former President Jimmy Carter.

Republicans proposed a seven-week bill extending fiscal year (FY) 2025 federal funding levels through Nov. 21 called a continuing resolution (CR). It's aimed at giving congressional negotiators more time to strike a longer-term agreement on FY2026, which began on Oct. 1.

It's largely free of policy riders — save for an added $88 million in security funding for lawmakers, the White House and the judicial branch — and it has bipartisan support.

It passed the House along mostly partisan lines on Sept. 19. But Democrats in the House and Senate were largely infuriated by being sidelined in federal funding talks and are now demanding that any spending deal also include an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.

Purdue is No. 1 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 college basketball poll for the first time.

The Boilermakers earned 35 of 61 first-place votes to top Monday's poll to begin the 2025-26 season. That put Matt Painter's squad ahead of the two teams that played in last year's NCAA title game, with runner-up Houston at No. 2 and reigning champion Florida at No. 3.

“We are obviously excited to get the season going and being ranked No. 1 in the preseason is a great indicator of what we feel this team can accomplish,” Painter said. “But the goal is to be No. 1 at the end of the year. We're thrilled that people think this highly of our team, but there is a long ways to go and a lot of work to do to reach that goal in April.”

Purdue started a year ranked as high as No. 2 once before, in 1987-88 under Gene Keady.

It's another milestone for Painter, the former Keady player who has built his own successful program that is still looking for its NCAA title breakthrough as he enters his 21st season. Purdue had never been ranked No. 1 in any AP poll before the 2021-22 season, which marked the first of three straight seasons in which the Boilermakers have reached the top. The last was during the 2023-24 season behind two-time AP national player of the year Zach Edey in a run all the way to the national title game.

The Boilermakers reached last year's Sweet 16 before falling to Houston on a last-second basket, but return a first-team AP All-American in point guard Braden Smith, scoring leader Trey Kaufman-Renn (20.1) and veteran guard Fletcher Loyer.

Kelvin Sampson's Cougars earned 16 first-place votes to match the program's best-ever preseason AP ranking after last year's finals run. The other No. 2 appearance was by the 1967-68 team led by Elvin Hayes.

Todd Golden's Gators earned eight first-place votes to start this year with their highest preseason ranking since the last time they entered a year as reigning champions in 2006-07, the start of a run to a second straight title.

UConn was next at No. 4 and earned the remaining two first-place votes. St. John's was fifth, with Rick Pitino's Red Storm surpassing the program's previous best ranking in a preseason AP poll (No. 7 in 1984-85).

Duke was next at No. 6, followed by Michigan, BYU — which landed the nation's No. 1 recruit in A.J. Dybantsa — Kentucky and Texas Tech to round out the top 10.

It hasn't taken long for Pat Kelsey to get Louisville back among the national elite, with the Cardinals checking in at No. 11 after a 27-win season to start his tenure. The Cardinals were 12-52 in the two seasons before his arrival.

Louisville is one of five programs with a second-year coach in the preseason poll, joining Michigan, BYU, Kentucky and No. 14 Arkansas with John Calipari.

Kansas checked in at No. 19, the lowest preseason rank for Bill Self's Jayhawks since starting at No. 24 in the 2008-09 season as the reigning national champion. Kansas had been ranked outside the top 10 only once since that year (No. 13 in 2011-12) while starting at No. 1 in 2019-20 as well as each of the last two seasons in that stretch. 

Auburn opens at No. 20 as it enters its first season since the unexpected retirement of coach Bruce Pearl following last year's Final Four run.

Pearl stepped aside last month after 11 seasons, triggering a transition to his 38-year-old son Steven, who climbed his father's staff through the elder Pearl's Auburn tenure but has never been a head coach nor coached elsewhere in college.

The Southeastern Conference, Big Ten and Big 12 each had six ranked teams to make up 72% of the field. The Atlantic Coast Conference and Big East were next with three each, while the West Coast Conference had one with No. 21 Gonzaga. The Big 12 was the only league of that group to have three top-10 teams.

Will Wade's arrival at N.C. State and subsequent roster shakeup has the Wolfpack as the first team outside the poll, sitting just three points behind 25th-ranked rival North Carolina from the ACC. Oregon is lurking close behind entering its 16th year under Dana Altman.

More than 30 people were rescued and three people remain unaccounted for in western Alaska after the remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and flooding strong enough to sweep away entire homes in coastal communities, authorities said. 

Rescue aircraft were sent to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.

“We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,” Zidek told The Associated Press.

In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued and three people remained unaccounted for, Alaska State Troopers said in a social media post on Sunday evening. In Kipnuk, at least 16 people were rescued and troopers had received secondhand reports of people who were unaccounted for. They were working with local officials to determine how many people were missing. Search efforts were expected to continue overnight as conditions allowed. 

In an AP interview, meteorologist Carson Jones with the National Weather Service in Anchorage, Alaska, says the remnants of a typhoon brought hurricane-force winds Sunday to some areas.

According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, nearly 600 people in Kipnuk were taking shelter at a school while around 300 people in Kwigillingok were sheltering in a school there. The area is among one of the most isolated in the U.S., where some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.

“Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement.

In North Carolina's Outer Banks, an area that's seen significant storm damage this season, ocean overwash spread across Highway 12 near Buxton, the Dare County Sheriff's Office posted online Sunday. The North Carolina Department of Transportation said crews were working to clear the highway that was closed on Ocracoke and Hatteras on Sunday.




The waves were ferocious at the Hatteras Island town of Buxton, where several beachfront homes have fallen into the water in recent weeks. One house was losing its pilings Sunday and appeared close to collapsing.

On the East Coast, forecasters warned that major coastal flooding was likely Monday in the mid-Atlantic, particularly from Virginia to New Jersey, with strong onshore winds, high surf and high tides. Coastal flooding was expected to peak Monday afternoon and improve gradually into Tuesday morning, according to the National Weather Service. 

A nor'easter churned its way up the East Coast over the weekend, washing out roads and prompting air travel delays. There were 384 cancelations and 2,787 delays within, into, or out of the United States by midday Monday, with many of those disruptions affecting Boston Logan International and LaGuardia Airport in New York, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions.

Dangerous surf conditions were expected to continue Monday, bringing strong rip currents and beach erosion along many East Coast beaches, the weather service said. Wind gusts in excess of 55 mph (89 kph) remained possible along New Jersey, Long Island and southern New England through Monday afternoon.

The storm continued to sock coastal areas in New Jersey and New York City on Monday, with some minor to moderate flooding reported in those areas, but no major damage had occurred. The Columbus Day Parade in New York City was canceled.

The rain and winds that started late Saturday were expected to continue throughout the day before tapering off late Monday or early Tuesday. Forecasters said more than 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots. The greatest threat for major flooding was expected to be in Long Island and southern New Jersey.

New Jersey was under a state of emergency and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an emergency declaration for eight southern counties, while urging people to avoid travel and monitor forecasts. 

In Delaware, emergency management officials activated the state National Guard on Sunday in response to rising floodwaters and harsh winds. A voluntary evacuation order was issued for the town of Bowers Beach, where the Murderkill River flows into Delaware Bay.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt joins ‘America Reports' to discuss a sting operation that uncovered more than 120 illegal immigrants driving 18-wheelers, some linked to fatal crashes.

FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to add stricter English proficiency requirements for truck drivers after an Obama-era rule change loosened standards.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., plans to introduce legislation that would add more stringent English proficiency rules for commercial truck drivers and an enforcement mechanism that would deem them "out of service" should they not meet the proposed standards.

The bill would add several standards, including ensuring that truck drivers can converse with the public, understand highway traffic signs and signals in the English language, respond to official inquiries and make entries on reports and records.

"Wyoming families and travelers deserve safe highways," Lummis said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "I'm introducing this commonsense legislation to ensure commercial truck drivers operating heavy vehicles can simply read signs, understand traffic laws and communicate effectively with law enforcement and emergency responders."

The bill also comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order from earlier this year, which similarly added stricter English language requirements.

Trump's order and Lummis' bill would also require that a person driving a commercial motor vehicle who does not meet those standards will be deemed out of service, a move meant to add enforcement following a change made in 2016 under then-President Barack Obama.

"This legislation will correct the major mistake the Obama administration made in undermining these rules and will codify President Trump's Executive Order to make our highways safer for all Americans," Lummis said.

While English proficiency requirements have existed for truck drivers for decades, a 2016 memo from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration instructed inspectors to give warnings and citations to commercial vehicle drivers who did not meet the English proficiency requirements, rather than place them out of service.

Lummis' bill, which she and Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., plan to introduce, also has a companion version in the House, introduced by Rep. Harriet Haggeman, R-Wyo.

There was a similar incident earlier this year when Harjinder Singh, an illegal immigrant from India, allegedly struck and killed three people in a tractor-trailer while making an illegal U-turn on a Florida highway on Aug. 12. The trailer jackknifed and collided with a minivan, killing all three of its passengers.

Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla., introduced legislation that would crack down on commercial driver's licenses (CDLs) going to illegal immigrants and bolster English proficiency requirements to get a commercial license.

            Rescuers in western Alaska are working to find missing residents and help those displaced after ferocious, hurricane-force wind gusts from what once was Typhoon Halong tore through remote, coastal communities, unleashed record-breaking storm surge and shoved homes completely off their foundations.
    


            Three people are missing in Kwigillingok and at least 18 people have been rescued in the village after the powerful storm, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday evening. Another 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk and authorities were working to confirm reports of additional missing individuals there, the department said.
    


            The sparsely populated villages are more than 400 miles southwest of Anchorage. “Both communities experienced strong winds and heavy flooding overnight, which caused significant damage, including at least eight homes being pushed from their foundations,” Alaska State Troopers said.
    


            Search efforts were expected to continue overnight as conditions allowed, with help from the Alaska Air National Guard, Alaska Army National Guard and the US Coast Guard, according to the public safety department.
    


            The storm generated wind gusts 100 mph or more in western Alaska Sunday, akin to the gusts Category 1 or 2 hurricanes are capable of. Wind gusts hit 107 mph in Kusilvak while nearby Toksook Bay recorded a gust of 100 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
    


            These winds also drove dangerous storm surge, pushing feet of water onto land, which triggered major flooding in coastal areas. Water levels in Kipnuk soared to 14.5 feet Sunday — more than 2 feet above major flood stage and 1.5 feet above the previous record flood level set in 2000.
    


            The storm was once Typhoon Halong, a powerful tropical system that formed in the northern Philippine Sea earlier this month, skirted by Japan without making landfall and then crossed the north Pacific Ocean. It was no longer tropical by the time it entered the Bering Sea this weekend, but that did not eliminate its power.
    


            The storm moved through northern Alaska late Sunday night and pushed into the Arctic Sea early Monday, leaving communities to pick up the pieces in its wake.
    


            “Every effort will be made to help those hit by this storm. Help is on the way,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said in a statement Sunday announcing the expansion of a state disaster declaration to include the areas impacted by the weekend storm.
    


            The initial declaration, issued on Thursday, addressed damage in western Alaska caused by another powerful coastal storm earlier in the week that brought extensive flooding.
    


            Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said he has “been in frequent conversations with Acting FEMA Director David Richardson, and also in contact with local, tribal and state officials, including the Governor, and with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.”
    


            “FEMA is in direct contact with state and local officials and has an incident management team traveling to Alaska as we speak with a FEMA search-and-rescue group pre-positioned in Washington on standby. According to FEMA, the government shutdown is not impacting the agency's response to this emergency,” Sullivan said in a statement.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Alaska National Guard, US Coast Guard, Alaska Rescue Coordination Center and the Alaska State Emergency Operations Center for more information.

President Donald Trump's Cabinet broke out into applause, Oct. 9, 2025, as Trump signed a proclamation honoring Italian explorer Christopher Columbus.

A new House GOP proposal would withhold funding from U.S. jurisdictions that celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day.

It comes after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation last week declaring Oct. 13 Columbus Day in honor of the famed explorer as well as the heritage of Italian Americans across the U.S.

"This is about every son and daughter of Italy, every Knights of Columbus, every pasta dinner on Sunday, and every communion — everything that makes our culture who we are, from Philadelphia to San Francisco," Rep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, told Fox News Digital in an interview.

"Every Little Italy neighborhood of this country celebrates Christopher Columbus. It's so much more than the man. It's the people."

Rulli's new bill would both reaffirm Columbus Day as a federal holiday and punish cities and states that replaced the celebration of it with Indigenous Peoples Day.

"We are not going to allow any American municipality to think that they have power over the federal government," he said.

In 2021, then-President Joe Biden formally recognized the second Monday in October as both Columbus Day and Indigenous Peoples Day.

The move was lauded by progressive activists and historians who saw Christopher Columbus as the harbinger of a genocide against the land's indigenous people, millions of whom were killed amid American colonization.

But Rulli argued that Columbus Day was about honoring Italian Americans' heritage, pointing out that part of the motivation for its founding in 1892 was the extrajudicial lynching of 11 Italian Americans in New Orleans after the death of a local police chief.

He added his legislation was not meant to undercut the significance of Native Americans — whom he said deserve their own day of significance.

"I mean, the Native Americans are some of the most amazing, dynamic cultural people that make up the fabric of America. But they need their own special day," Rulli said. "And I would be willing to do that. I'm saying right now, I would be willing to get the indigenous people their own day, but not this day."

He further accused the Biden administration of undercutting the legacy of both peoples by declaring both holidays on the same day, while praising Trump for restoring Columbus Day's original meaning.

"I don't care what party you're in … if you come from Italian American descent, you love what President Trump did. It was a wonderful olive branch to all Italian Americans," Rulli said.

"By no means, no way, shape or form, is this bill meant to offend any of the indigenous people. They deserve their own day. We will get them their own day, but not Columbus Day. This has already been embedded in our fabric for 130 years," he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Armed with hundreds of thousands of dollars from Newman's Own Foundation and Ozempic creator Novo Nordisk, young Native Americans are leading the fight against persistently high rates of food insecurity in tribal communities.

In a rare example of agency for a beneficiary community, 21 emerging Indigenous leaders recently crafted selection criteria, evaluated applicants and picked two dozen finalists to split a pool of $720,000. Organized by Native Americans in Philanthropy, the 16-to-24-year-old participants said the inclusive process reflected Indian Country values of self-determination and intergenerational relationship-building that more donors should embrace.

“Funders can listen to native youth to know where they should direct resources,” said Native Americans in Philanthropy program manager Savannah Baber, 28. 

The resulting Indigenous Tomorrows Fund was successful enough that organizers want to increase next year's pot to $1 million. Native Americans in Philanthropy — a coalition of grantmakers, tribal leaders and other advocates for increased philanthropic support of Indigenous organizations — has secured half of that funding. They are still seeking partners to commit the other $500,000.

The pilot program was fairly unusual for a grant initiative. Despite shifts towards the trust-based philanthropy championed by MacKenzie Scott and others that removes restrictions on how donations can be used, wealthy funders generally dictate the terms of their giving. It's still uncommon for the communities receiving the donations to be so directly involved behind the scenes, let alone handed the reins almost entirely. And it's especially unusual for young people to receive responsibilities beyond, say, a seat at the table or a purely “advisory” role.




More participatory approaches, however, are gaining popularity across the sector. Center for Effective Philanthropy President Phil Buchanan said there's increased sensitivity to “top-down philanthropy.” But his sense is that it's rarer for funders to cede decision-making power to others.

“There's this recognition that a lot of philanthropic mistakes are made when answers to problems other people are experiencing are cooked up by consultants in conference rooms, rather than being informed by those who donors actually seek to help,” Buchanan said.

The fund's focus on food insecurity therefore made sense to Native Americans in Philanthropy considering the issue's acute impact in Indigenous communities Settler-colonialism forced them onto unfamiliar reservations and diminished their ability to follow the traditional food practices that had sustained generations.

While rates have fallen, recent U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys suggest American Indian/Alaska Native households still lack access to adequate food at twice the level of white residents. Child obesity is high. And affordable, healthy groceries are even harder to come by in rural food deserts.

The $30,000 grant recipients are tackling those issues in a variety of ways. There's a multi-generational collective of Shinnecock women in New York who farm kelp to clean up a bay. Or an Arizona-based community center that grows culturally significant crops such as Apache giant squash, distributes fresh produce and trains youth through hands-on land management.

Philanthropy's sparse giving to Native American-led organizations means there's little private money for such efforts. Less than 0.5% of funding from large U.S. foundations goes to Native American nonprofits, according to a 2019 report by Candid and Native Americans in Philanthropy.

Native Americans in Philanthropy had already been working to reverse that trend. The group hosts a Native Youth Grantmakers program that teaches Indigenous young adults about the philanthropic sector. Newman's Own Foundation offered to take that learning a step further by giving them a shot at running an entire fund themselves.

Funders determined the issue areas of food sovereignty and health. Because Newman's Own supports child nutrition efforts broadly, Baber said the foundation wanted Indigenous youth's perspectives on advancing food justice. They brought Novo Nordisk on board with an interest in wellness.

Grantmakers proceeded independently from there. But that autonomy didn't mean they were entirely on their own. Younger philanthropy professionals, elders, NAP staff and funders' program officers sometimes joined meetings. But their presence only spurred conversation and never dominated conversation, according to younger participants.

Participants said it wasn't their accomplished resumes or community engagement that made them equipped to join the grantmaking team. It was something more innate that many titans of philanthropy don't have: the fact that they came directly from native communities.

They were heartened by their peers' interest in reclaiming land stewardship practices and ensuring access for future generations. Newman's Own Foundation Indigenous Communities Officer Jackie Blackbird said that interest was highlighted by the volume of proposals; this inaugural cycle received more than 400 applications.

Whether the projects were promoting Indigenous languages to better understand their food cultures or sustainably tending local ecosystems, grant reviewers found a constant in their peers' embrace of past cultural knowledge to solve today's problems. They felt the project allowed them to continue the legacies of their ancestors who passed down traditions with future generations top of mind.

“Indigenous youth are reconnecting to their culture and to healing more and more,” Blackbird said. “Projects like the Indigenous Tomorrows Fund help them also build that confidence and learn more about challenges in communities.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump as the "greatest friend" Israel has ever had on Monday as Hamas released the 20 living remaining hostages.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend Monday's peace conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, where President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will host more than 20 world leaders in a bid to cement an end to the war in Gaza.

Netanyahu's office said the prime minister was "unable to attend due to time constraints ahead of the start of the holiday." October 13–15 marks Shemini Atzeret, followed by Simchat Torah on October 15.

Leader of Israel's left-wing Democrats, Yair Golan, condemned the decision.

"I am appalled by Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to skip this historic event orchestrated by President Trump. Let it be clear: Netanyahu's refusal to attend the peace summit in Egypt is driven purely by narrow political interests," he said in a statement to Fox News.

"After two years of Israel's most difficult war, we can not afford a leader guided by his personal interest."

WHITE HOUSE TURNS TO EXPANDING ABRAHAM ACCORDS AFTER ISRAEL-HAMAS CEASEFIRE

The summit, set in the Red Sea resort town, is expected to draw leaders from Turkey, Jordan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and top representatives from the United Nations and the European Union. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is also slated to attend as regional powers press for a role in stabilizing postwar Gaza.

The conference comes amid a renewed push by the Trump administration to expand the Abraham Accords framework once the conflict in Gaza is resolved. Four nations joined the normalization agreements with Israel during Trump's first term, and senior White House officials have signaled optimism that additional Arab and Muslim-majority countries could follow.

NETANYAHU CALLS TRUMP ISRAEL'S 'GREATEST FRIEND' AS FINAL LIVING HOSTAGES RELEASED

Adding to that momentum, Israeli media reported Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto—the leader of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation—was expected to visit Israel on Tuesday, raising speculation that Indonesia could be next to pursue an Abraham Accords-style peace and normalization agreement with Jerusalem. But Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono told Indonesian media "no such plan" is in place for a visit.

Subianto surprised observers with unusually warm remarks toward Israel during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month, closing his speech with the Hebrew word "Shalom."

"We must also recognize, we must also respect, and we must also guarantee the safety and security of Israel," Subianto said. "Only then can we have real peace."

            JPMorgan Chase on Monday announced a massive investment plan that places a substantial bet on industries it thinks are critical to the United States' economic security.
    


            As part of the decade-long initiative, the bank said it's investing $10 billion in select companies that are primarily based in the United States and do business in one of four key areas: supply chain resilience, energy independence, defense and strategic technologies like AI and quantum computing. The investment, which will come from JPMorgan's capital, directly, and from venture capital, is designed to enhance large and mid-sized companies' growth and drive innovation and strategic manufacturing, according to a press release.
    


            The plan aims to facilitate $1.5 trillion in investments over 10 years. JPMorgan had previously aimed at delivering $1 trillion in investments to these initiatives.
    


            “It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security,” said CEO Jamie Dimon, in a statement.
    


            The announcement comes as President Donald Trump revived a trade war between the US and China on Friday, with Trump threatening to impose new triple-digit tariffs on Chinese imports.
    


            Trump's threat followed Beijing's tightening of its control on rare earths, a group of critical minerals essential in the production of a wide range of electronics, automobiles and semiconductors. However, on Sunday, the Trump administration appeared to soften its tone, and markets were set to rebound Monday.
    


            But the renewed tensions demonstrated how a major investment in companies aimed at US self-reliance could pay off in a new era of tariffs, trade wars and standoffs.
    


            “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy. America needs more speed and investment,” Dimon said.
    


            The initiative will help ensure reliable access to critical medicines, minerals, defense capabilities, and energy and microchips to power AI, Dimon said. Rising tensions around the world, particularly with China, have challenged America's ability to secure all of those crucial needs.
    


            JPMorgan will hire an unspecified number of additional bankers and other investment staffers to execute its investment strategy, and it will create an external council to help guide it, the bank said.
    


            Shares of JPMorganChase (JPM) rose more than 1% in premarket trading.
    


            “Hopefully, once again, as America has in the past, we will all come together to address these immense challenges,” Dimon said. We need to act now.”

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Two fast trains collided in eastern Slovakia on Monday, injuring dozens of passengers, including two in critical condition, officials said.

The crash occurred near the town of Rožňava shortly after 10 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), the Slovak Railways said.

Slovak police said that about 80 passengers were estimated to be onboard, but didn't immediately offer more details.

Interior Minister Matúš Šutaj Eštok said two of the injured were in critical condition while the other injuries weren't serious.

Images from the collision showed the front part of one engine badly damaged, while the other train derailed.

Authorities have opened an investigation into the cause of the crash. Šutaj Eštok suggested human error might be to blame.

            Federal safety regulators are once again looking into Tesla's self-driving mode, the latest in a seemingly endless stream of investigations into the safety of the technology.
    


            Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced at least the sixth investigation into Tesla vehicles using the company's “Full Self Driving” (FSD), or other driver assist features. This probe covers dozens of dangerous driving incidents, including blowing through red lights, driving in the wrong lane of traffic, and three accidents that resulted in five injuries.
    


            But there's relatively little NHTSA, or any federal regulator, can do to regulate the new features Tesla introduces amid its ambitious plans to fill the country with self-driving cars and “robotaxis.”
    


            That's because it's not a regulator's job to approve the technology – only to rein it in if it causes problems. American laws aren't equipped to deal with the fast-moving ambitions of CEO Elon Musk, and Washington doesn't seem in a hurry to regulate his company.
    


            NHTSA already had several probes into Tesla's self-driving tech, including into incidents that resulted in fatal crashes, for both its FSD and less advanced driver assistance feature called “Autopilot.” But many of those investigations began years ago and are still ongoing, even as more and more Teslas with FSD and Autopilot hit American roads.
    


            “I call it regulatory whack-a-mole,” said Bryant Walker Smith, a professor of law and engineering and an affiliated scholar at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. “This process takes a very long time. This is the first step in multiple steps required for an actual recall. It's a regulatory process that isn't necessarily well aligned with the technological time frame.”
    


            Tesla is not unique. Despite what most drivers might believe about the safety of the new cars they buy, much of the regulation actually takes place after cars are already on the road.
    


            The United States has what's known as a self-certification regime. NHTSA creates specific standards and automakers then self-certify, or “promise that their vehicles or systems comply with those specific standards,” Smith said.
    


            But “if there's not a standard specific to a given technology, then there's nothing to self-certify. And NHTSA does not have specific standards for the performance of many advanced driver assistance systems,” he said.

            But Smith added that problem is not simply cars with driver assistance features, but with all cars on the road.
    


            “We are all real-world guinea pigs in the century long experiment introducing two-ton vehicles that travel at speed faster than we can comprehend,” he said.
    


            NHTSA could set higher safety standards for vehicles, Smith said. But its ability to test vehicles and features before they are allowed on the road is limited by law and regulation.
    


            To give the agency the authority to approve or reject a new vehicle or feature before it is introduced into service, like the Federal Aviation Administration does with commercial aircraft, would require Congress to change the law.
    


            Smith said that change isn't going to be made any time soon. Besides the power of the auto industry, Americans have become accepting of the ten of thousands of car crash fatalities every year.
    


            He said they are more likely to blame the drivers than demand greater regulation.
    


            “That kind of approval applies to scary things, like nuclear power plants and planes and haircuts and initial stock offerings,” he said.
    


            Musk is betting the future of Tesla on technology like self-driving. But despite names like “full self-driving” and “autopilot,” the company admits that owners using those features need to be behind the wheel, ready to take over.
    


            But Tesla is beginning to plans to offer true driverless driving without anyone behind the wheel.
    


            The company launched its long-promised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, although after starting with a Tesla employee in the front passenger seat, local regulators required the employee move to the driver's seat. But Musk also promises the service will soon have no employees behind the wheel, as well as a true self-driving “Cybercab” with no brake, accelerator or steering wheel.
    


            Tesla did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The company has insisted that its cars using self-driving technology are safer than human drivers.
    


            Safety experts, however, said that Tesla has not produced the data needed to prove that claim. And even a driver sitting behind the wheel of a car using FSD poses a risk.
    


            “There's great, great concern that humans, simply as a matter of psychology and physiology, are going to lose attention if they are doing nothing but watching, while their cars are doing everything else,” Smith said.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, long known for targeting mortgage and bank fraud, now finds herself accused of the very type of deception she once prosecuted.

James, who built her career in part by exposing forged deeds and false loan applications in state court, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury in Virginia on one count each of bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions. The indictment alleges that James misrepresented her Virginia home as her “principal residence” to obtain favorable mortgage terms — a misstatement prosecutors say saved her roughly $18,933 of “ill-gotten gains” over the life of the loan.

Over the past six years, James's office has charged numerous defendants with falsifying documents to obtain mortgages and mislead banks. In one June 2019 Brooklyn case, prosecutors accused a couple of submitting fake pay stubs, tax returns, and bank statements to secure multiple loans. A July 2021 Harlem and Long Island case charged developer Joseph Makhani with forging deeds and falsifying records to get bank financing for properties he didn't own outright. And in a Queens case this year, the first under New York's new deed-theft statute, her office accused two men of using forged property transfers to obtain a $552,500 mortgage.

All those cases revolved around a familiar theme: lying or misleading lenders for personal gain. Now, James faces the same kind of allegation in the indictment brought against her.

Former Republican Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, now CEO of the 1792 Exchange, said the parallels are striking. 

“It appears from what I've seen of the indictment that there were misrepresentations related to the application and securing of the loan,” Cameron told the Washington Examiner. “It appears pretty cut and dry. The check on all of this is that a grand jury — seated in Virginia, not exactly a hotbed of conservatism — found probable cause to indict.”

Cameron added that claims of political targeting overlook a basic point, which is that James's own office has prosecuted nearly identical cases. 

“Despite what Letitia James and her people are saying, it's not an uncommon set of facts,” he said. “The best case in point is that in her own office, they've pursued indictments and prosecutions with similar fact patterns. The idea that this is just weaponization doesn't square with reality.”

According to the indictment, James took out a $109,600 mortgage in August 2020 to buy a small house in Norfolk, Virginia, with the loan terms requiring that it be used as a secondary residence — not as a rental or investment property. Prosecutors say she never used the property herself and instead rented it out, benefiting from a lower interest rate and higher seller credit that would not have been available for an investment loan.

The indictment, signed by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, accuses James of committing “intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.” Halligan, a former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, was appointed in the Eastern District of Virginia after Trump fired U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert, who reportedly refused to bring charges against James based on the available evidence.

If convicted, James faces a maximum of 30 years in prison on each count and a fine of up to $1 million — penalties heightened by Congress during the 1990s savings and loan crisis. Still, the dollar amount at issue is small, and experts note that federal prosecutors almost never pursue mortgage-fraud cases under $500,000. Only 38 people nationwide were sentenced for federal mortgage fraud last year, most involving large-scale schemes and sums.

James's attorney Abbe Lowell has called the charges “baseless” and politically driven, saying they reflect the president's “desire for revenge.” He emphasized that James continues to pay the mortgage and said the home was occupied by family members, not tenants.

The case against James in some ways mirrors, albeit at a smaller scale, the civil fraud case she brought against Trump, his family, and the Trump Organization. James accused Trump of inflating his assets to secure favorable financing and insurance terms. That case initially resulted in a half-billion-dollar penalty before a New York appellate court rolled most of it back earlier this year.

Where Trump was accused of exaggerating the value of skyscrapers and golf courses, James is now accused of overstating her own occupancy to obtain better mortgage rates — a small-scale version of the same legal theory.

After New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron ruled in favor of James's civil case against Trump in February last year, James announced that Trump is “finally facing accountability for his lying, cheating, and staggering fraud. Because no matter how big, rich, or powerful you think you are, no one is above the law.” In August, an intermediate-level state court tossed out the full fine against Trump, though it maintained Engoron's finding that the company likely overvalued its assets. James is now appealing that decision.

Halligan issued a brief yet similar comment on Thursday in response to the indictment, saying that “no one is above the law.”

The indictment against James comes just as similar political and constitutional issues play out in another case led by the same prosecutor, Halligan. At the arraignment of former FBI Director James Comey last week, Comey's lawyer told the court he intends to file motions to dismiss that case on two grounds: that Halligan was unlawfully appointed and that her prosecution was vindictive and selective in violation of the Constitution.

James's defense team has not yet said whether it will take the same approach. But her attorney Lowell suggested such motions could be forthcoming, vowing to “fight these charges in every process allowed in the law” and warning that “this case is driven by President Trump's desire for revenge.”

Cameron said that while selective-prosecution claims are often raised in politically charged cases, they seldom succeed. 

“The Supreme Court has set a high bar when it comes to claims of vindictive or selective prosecution,” he said. “At the end of the day, the grand jury process itself serves as a check. You still have to present credible facts, and they did. That's what gives this case legal standing.”

If Lowell pursues a dismissal motion, it will likely hinge on the same arguments surfacing in the Comey case: that Halligan, a Trump ally with no prior experience as a leading prosecutor, improperly weaponized her office against the president's adversaries. Comey's attorneys are also seeking to challenge the legality of Halligan's appointment.

Previous attempts to link James to financial irregularities have largely fallen apart under scrutiny, though this indictment hinges on previously undisputed facts.

Earlier this year, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a close Trump ally, conducted his own review of real estate filings involving political opponents of the president. In April, he referred James to the Justice Department over what he claimed were false statements tied to two different properties, including a different house in Norfolk purchased with her niece in 2023. Pulte alleged that James listed herself as the primary resident on the loan paperwork for that home despite not living there.

Within weeks, James's attorney Lowell issued a detailed rebuttal, accusing Pulte of selectively highlighting one document while ignoring others that clearly named the niece as the intended occupant. Lowell, who also represented Hunter Biden during his federal firearms violation and tax evasion cases, said the referral “collapsed under basic fact-checking” once the full transaction file was reviewed.

Federal prosecutors declined to act on Pulte's referral for that property. The 2020 Norfolk property now at the center of the indictment was not part of that earlier dispute and had not been raised in Lowell's written defense.

NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL LETITIA JAMES INDICTED ON BANK FRAUD CHARGE

Nonetheless, the current indictment introduces one new piece of evidence: a homeowner's insurance application that allegedly identified the 2020 house as “owner-occupied” instead of a rental. Prosecutors say the discrepancy further supports their claim that James knowingly misled the lender about how the property would be used.

James is scheduled to appear in federal court in Norfolk on Oct. 24. If the case proceeds, jurors will have to decide whether the Empire State's most prominent fraud prosecutor made the kind of misrepresentation she once condemned in others.

EXCLUSIVE — Devin Talbott, founder of the Maryland-based investment firm Enlightenment Capital and chairman of voting machine giant Hart InterCivic, is under scrutiny for his extensive political donations to Democratic candidates while leading a major U.S. election technology company, a combination raising questions about potential conflicts of interest in the U.S. voting system.

Talbott's firm invests heavily in the aerospace, defense, government, and technology sectors. As chairman of Hart InterCivic, he also plays a central role in shaping the company's operations and the voting systems it supplies to states nationwide.

At the same time, he has contributed more than $100,000 to Democratic candidates, committees, and PACs over the past decade while overseeing one of the country's leading voting technology suppliers.

Federal Election Commission records show Talbott has given tens of thousands of dollars to campaigns for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Jon Tester, while also donating to the Democratic National Committee and the anti-Trump Lincoln Project. His only recorded contribution to a Republican was a $520 donation to Nikki Haley's 2024 presidential campaign. 

Talbott is the son of Strobe Talbott, who served as deputy secretary of state under President Bill Clinton after holding senior roles focused on the former Soviet republics. He went on to lead the Brookings Institution, one of Washington's most influential think tanks, from 2002 to 2017. During his tenure, Brookings employed Igor Danchenko, who worked with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and was identified as a key source for the Steele dossier about alleged links between President Donald Trump and Russia. Those connections have led some critics to argue that Devin Talbott's political and business roles fit within a broader Democratic establishment network.

Public records show Talbott registered as a Democrat in Maryland in 2006 and has voted in most general elections since, underscoring his long-standing political ties as his company plays a growing role in state election systems.

Talbott's dual role as a political donor and chairman of a voting technology firm has drawn scrutiny from some election oversight advocates. 

“When the person overseeing voting systems across the country is also a six-figure donor to one political party, it undermines public confidence in the neutrality of our elections,” said one advocate familiar with Hart InterCivic's contracts, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the situation candidly.

Hart InterCivic, based in Austin, Texas, produces the Verity voting platform used in hundreds of jurisdictions across 20 states. The company is considered one of the “big three” election technology vendors in the United States, alongside Election Systems & Software and Dominion Voting Systems, which recently was purchased by a new firm called Liberty Vote.

Dominion became a flashpoint in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when false claims about its software and alleged ties to foreign actors fueled widespread conspiracy theories. After years of litigation, Dominion secured massive settlements, $787.5 million from Fox News and $67 million from Newsmax, tied to those baseless allegations. The company has maintained its systems are secure and reliable. 

By comparison, Hart InterCivic has largely avoided the national spotlight, though it has faced its own share of technical controversies. In 2018, the Texas secretary of state issued a statewide advisory after reports that Hart's eSlate voting machines were changing voters' straight-ticket selections or omitting certain races altogether during early voting. State corporate filings in Texas list Talbott as Hart InterCivic's chairman and director.

Hart's ownership has faced similar scrutiny before. In 2011, Miami-based private equity firm H.I.G. Capital, founded by former Bain & Co. and Blackstone Group executives, made what it described as a “strategic investment” in Hart. The following year, several H.I.G. principals, including managing director and Hart board member Jeff Bohl, were revealed to be major donors to Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. At the time, Hart denied “any suggestions that the company might try to influence the outcome of election results.”

In response to questions about the company's ownership and independence, a spokesperson for Hart InterCivic said the firm “is an impartial and independent U.S. technology company with more than 100 years of experience providing election solutions.” The spokesperson added that Hart's systems “are consistently certified at the federal and state levels as reliable, secure, and accurate,” and noted that the company is the only election-system provider in the nation certified to the latest federal standards, known as the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0.

Hart's Verity Vanguard system became the first in the country to earn VVSG 2.0 certification from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission in July 2025, a milestone the company said marks “a significant advancement in secure, transparent, and accessible election technology.” The company also said its systems comply with directives outlined in Trump's March 2025 executive order on preserving the integrity of American elections.

The company said Enlightenment Capital is one of several investors in Hart and that day-to-day operations and product development are handled by a professional management team. They also noted that Hart executives are prohibited from making political donations, adding that the company's technology undergoes extensive testing by independent laboratories before being certified by the Election Assistance Commission and individual states. The commission, chaired by a Trump-nominated official who has served since 2019, oversees certification for voting systems nationwide. Hart officials emphasized that certification and oversight are conducted independently of any company ownership.

Before entering the election-technology industry, Talbott built his career investing in companies that serve the defense and government sectors. He launched Enlightenment Capital in 2012 and has backed firms involved in cybersecurity, intelligence, and aviation logistics. The firm's advisory board has included retired military and national security officials, giving it deep reach into federal contracting circles. Enlightenment Capital's 2020 acquisition of Hart InterCivic positioned Talbott at the intersection of political finance, government contracting, and election administration during a period of deep public skepticism about voting systems.

TRUMP PROMISES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ‘GET RID OF' MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND VOTING MACHINES 

Election policy analysts say Talbott's case highlights a broader gap: private vendors that supply voting systems are not required to disclose the political activities or affiliations of their owners and executives.

“There's nothing illegal about a partisan donor owning or having a stake in a voting-machine company,” one nonprofit policy adviser said, “but it's a dangerous precedent in an era when trust in elections is already fragile.”

            The Dutch government has taken control of Chinese-owned computer chipmaker Nexperia, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing as a global fight brews over technology intellectual property, especially around semiconductors.
    


            The government said late on Sunday that it has intervened in Dutch-headquartered Nexperia, which manufactures chips for cars and consumer electronics. It cited worries about the possible transfer of technology to Nexperia's Chinese parent company, Wingtech.
    


            Amsterdam invoked never-before-used powers under a Dutch law known as the “Availability of Goods Act.” The decision led to a 10% fall in Wingtech's shares in Shanghai Monday.
    


            The Dutch government will not take ownership of Nexperia, but it will now have the power to reverse or block management decisions it considers harmful. The company's regular production is continuing.
    


            US President Donald Trump is ratcheting up pressure on Chinese tech firms as part of a broader trade war that saw him threaten 100% tariffs on China's exports last week.
    


            The United States and the Netherlands typically cooperate closely on computer chip industry export controls. A Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry spokesperson, however, said there was no US involvement in its decision regarding Nexperia and the timing was “purely coincidental.”
    


            Washington last month expanded a list of blacklisted firms seen as threats to national security to include subsidiaries.
    


            Wingtech had already been placed on the US “entity list” in December 2024 for its alleged role “in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.”
    


            Nexperia, which is 100%-owned by Wingtech, said at the time that it would comply with the US rules, though it said its operations were kept at arm's length from its Chinese parent.
    


            Wingtech called the Dutch government's intervention in Nexperia, once part of Dutch electronics group Philips, “excessive interference driven by geopolitical bias.”
    


            Wingtech also alleged that non-Chinese Nexperia executives had tried to forcibly alter the company's equity structure through legal proceedings in a “cloaked power grab” on the company.
    


            Wingtech said in a statement that it was consulting with lawyers and seeking government support to “protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company.”
    


            Nexperia, which Wingtech bought for $3.63 billion in 2018, said it complied with all relevant laws and regulations.
    


            In its statement, the Dutch government cited issues around “crucial technological knowledge” without elaborating.
    


            “The loss of these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security,” it said.
    


            Nexperia is one of the world's largest makers of simple computer chips such as diodes and transistors, though it also develops more advanced technologies such as “wide gap” semiconductors used in electrical settings and useful for electric cars, chargers and artificial intelligence data centers.
    


            Wingtech said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange Monday that its control over Nexperia would be temporarily restricted due to the Dutch order and court rulings, affecting decision-making and operational efficiency.
    


            Wingtech said its chairman Zhang Xuezheng was suspended from Nexperia's boards by an Amsterdam court order on October 6, and an independent non-Chinese person with a “deciding vote” would be appointed in his place.
    


            Wingtech has had run-ins before with other Western governments over its operations, with Britain ordering it to divest ownership of a facility in Newport.

President Donald Trump suggested on Sunday that he may give Russian President Vladimir Putin an ultimatum of either facing Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine or stopping the fighting in the over three-year war.

Trump made the comment aboard Air Force One while on his way to Israel, a trip that comes after securing a long-sought peace deal in the Gaza war.

“I might have to speak to Russia, to be honest with you, about Tomahawks. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,” the U.S. president said. “I might say [to Putin], ‘Look, if this war is not gonna get settled, I may send them Tomahawks.'”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been urging Trump to supply his country with the American-made long-range missiles to get peace negotiations back on track.

While Trump has been focused on the Middle East over the past week as a ceasefire deal was struck between Israel and Hamas, he has still held calls with Zelensky, including on Sunday.

Zelensky called that discussion “very productive,” as the two leaders discussed “strengthening” Ukraine's “long-range capabilities.”

ZELENSKY URGES ‘NO WEAKENING OF PRESSURE' AS RUSSIA STRIKES UKRAINIAN ENERGY PLANTS

As Trump gives his latest indication he is willing to provide Ukraine with the missiles, Russia has warned against the prospect, with the Kremlin saying “the topic of Tomahawks is of extreme concern.”

In recent weeks, Russia has been battering Ukraine's energy sector, launching large-scale aerial attacks on energy plants. Zelensky said in a video address on Sunday that these strikes are evidence that Russia is losing on the battlefield, pointing to advancements by his troops in Orikhiv, located in southern Ukraine.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) denied the Democratic Party is holding federal workers hostage during the government shutdown, saying past comments he made opposing this tactic were on a “long-term” healthcare issue.

The government is 12 days into a shutdown as of Sunday, and Senate Republicans need five more Democratic votes to reopen the government. Murphy, who has voted against all of the Republican bills to reopen the government, previously spoke against lawmakers trying to “use” the nation's security and federal workers as “hostages” during negotiations to end a 2018 government shutdown.

CBS News's Margaret Brennan confronted Murphy about those past comments on Sunday, asking if he is now doing “exactly” what he criticized in 2018. The senator said no, and that his past comments were referring to “the long-term structure” of the healthcare system. This current shutdown, he argued, is an “emergency.”

“In about a month, premiums are going to go up by 75%, and we have to make a decision whether this budget is going to allow for that to happen or to stop it. What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency,” Murphy said on Face the Nation.

“So we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,” he added.

Murphy also said he doesn't believe that any follow-up discussions on healthcare will be held if the government is reopened. Brennan argued that Vice President JD Vance said it is as if Democrats will not say “what it is they want to negotiate,” though Murphy claimed “you cannot trust this administration.” 

Murphy also downplayed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) comments when he said every day the shutdown continues it “gets better” for Democrats. Murphy claimed people are “desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying” after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) condemned Schumer's statement.

TRUMP MASS LAYOFFS SHOW HE ISN'T BLUFFING ON SHUTDOWN THREATS

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who has voted to reopen the government, reiterated his position on Fox News's Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo that the government should always be open. He also said it's “silly” the government is shut down, while a peace deal takes effect in Gaza.

Stock futures were little changed on Monday night, following a winning session in which the major averages recovered a chunk of their losses suffered at the end of last week.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by just 36 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures hovered just above the flatline.

The S&P 500 and Dow each jumped more than 1% on the day, marking the former's biggest one-day gain since May 27. The broad market index also clawed back more than half of Friday's steep decline. The Dow had its best day since Sept. 11, broke a five-day losing streak and recovered two-thirds of Friday's losses.

The moves came after a Truth Social post from President Donald Trump eased investor worries about growing trade tensions between China and the U.S. "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine," Trump's Sunday post said.

That sent tech stocks such as Oracle, AMD and Nvidia up broadly, leading the market higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq notched a more than 2% gain.

"Trade policy remains a key driver for US financial markets this year, and last week saw a sharp re-escalation in tensions between the US and China," Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. "With hardened positions on both sides, we expect increased equity market volatility into the end of the month. However, the history of Trump-Xi negotiations suggests that escalation is often followed by tactical truces, and rare earth minerals versus shipping fees could ultimately seal a deal."

Investors on Tuesday will look to keep this momentum going, as major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are set to report third-quarter earnings.

Friday's sell-off may have had silver lining: it may have delayed the bull market peak, according to Leuthold Group chief investment officer Doug Ramsey. 

"If this cycle is fated to end with anything loosely resembling a traditional topping process, then the eventual bull market peak has been pushed out at least a couple more months. In our case, though, high valuations and escalating risks to the U.S. economy stymie any desire to more aggressively play the bull's final innings," Ramsey wrote to clients Monday. 

Still, Ramsey noted he sees troubling trends in this market, including a recently steep drop in S&P 500 cyclical stocks relative to defensive names. "Such action is troubling; although, our best guess is that the final bull market peak will not occur until the warnings from our traditional bellwethers have become more pronounced."

Goldman Sachs announced Monday that it agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank. The bank will pay $665 million in cash for Industry Ventures and up to an additional $300 million based on the firm's performance through 2030.

"Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world," CEO David Solomon said in the release.

Stock futures were little changed after a big rally on Wall Street during the cash session.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by just 19 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures hovered just below the flatline.

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Monday that artificial intelligence could become a larger part of global GDP as the technology spreads across industries.

Tan said the current global GDP sits around $110 trillion, with 30% of that figure "valued from industries related to knowledge-based, technology-intensive."

"And you put in generative AI, you create intelligence in a lot of other aspects of society," Tan continued. "That 30% say will grow to 40% of all GDP. That's $10 trillion a year."

If AI grows and becomes responsible for a larger piece of global GDP as Tan predicts, it would be a boon to the nascent tech sector and all the industries it relies on. Broadcom makes chips and networking equipment and has been a huge beneficiary of the AI boom as hyperscalers buy up its products. The stock is currently up 53.86%.

Broadcom and OpenAI announced their official partnership on Monday, saying they would jointly build and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators. The move is part of a broader effort to scale AI across the industry. Broadcom shares surged in response to the news, up 9.88% by market close.

Broadcom and OpenAI's deal is the latest in a slew of pricey partnerships among key Big Tech players related to AI.

Tan said OpenAI is "one of those few players in the forefront of creating foundation models," and noted that even as a private company, the ChatGPT maker is worth about $500 billion. According to Tan, Broadcom's "hard-nosed" approach to business doesn't keep the company from looking several years in the future "at this phenomenon, this wave called generative AI."

Broadcom is tight-lipped about its customers, but said earlier this year it was developing new AI chips with three large cloud customers. Management announced last month it had secured $10 billion in chip orders from a fourth unnamed client.

Tan told Cramer that Broadcom is working closely with "about seven players," four of which he defined as "real customers," or ones "who have given us production purchase orders at scale."

"We feel very good about it," Tan said of Broadcom's partnerships. "Because each of these guys need a lot of compute capacity for them to basically play in this game and eventually win this game of creating the best foundation model in the world."

As Salesforce welcomes tens of thousands of people to San Francisco for its annual Dreamforce conference, CEO Marc Benioff has found himself in the center of local controversy on a national issue.

In an interview with The New York Times published on Friday, Benioff appeared eager for President Donald Trump to send federal troops to his company's hometown, inserting himself into a national debate about whether the president should call the National Guard into various Democrat-led cities that Trump has maligned.

The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits.

"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it," Benioff told the Times.

Benioff subsequently softened his comments, writing on X on Sunday that safety is "first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders." But a heated online conversation was already well underway.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who moved to Texas from California, said federal intervention is needed to deal with crime in San Francisco. In posts on his social network X on Sunday, he said it would be "the only solution at this point," and that "nothing else has or will work." A day earlier, Musk, who has drawn criticism for his own drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a "drug zombie apocalypse."

Musk still has big business in and around San Francisco. His artificial intelligence startup xAI, which owns X, has a sizable office in the city, and his brain computer interface company, Neuralink, recently leased a large property in South San Francisco. Tesla relocated to Texas, but the automaker's engineering headquarters remains in Palo Alto, just south of San Francisco.

Musk's call for U.S. troops came in response to social media posts by Tom Wolf, who describes himself as a "a formerly homeless recovering addict in San Francisco," and an "advocate for addiction recovery."

"If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away," Wolf wrote. "If you don't, you reap what you sow."

Musk shared Wolf's post to his more than 227 million listed followers on X.

Neither Benioff nor Musk immediately responded to requests for comment. CNBC also reached out to Tesla, xAI and Salesforce for comment but did not hear back.

Local officials loudly opposed the idea of bringing in federal troops.

Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco's district attorney, wrote on X after the Benioff interview that, "I can't be silent any longer."

Jenkins accused Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of turning "so-called public safety and immigration enforcement into a form of government sponsored violence against U.S. citizens, families, and ethnic groups," and said that if anyone is using excessive force or illegally harassing residents, "I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day."

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who defeated incumbent London Breed in November in part by promising to clean up San Francisco's streets, wrote on X on Sunday that "crime is down 30% and tent encampments are at an all-time low." He didn't directly address Benioff or Dreamforce, but noted that tens of thousand of people are coming to the city for activities including concerts and Fleet Week, and that public safety is critical.

"San Francisco is on the rise," he wrote

In Benioff's follow-up comments after his interview with the Times, the Salesforce CEO praised Lurie's efforts to increase police hiring and retain law enforcement.

Dreamforce, which launched in 2003, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Thursday. The event is being held at the Moscone Center and occupies much of the surrounding area in downtown San Francisco.

Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on X that "We don't need the National Guard," but he used his post to go after a frequent local target for techies: Chesa Boudin and progressives.

Boudin was district attorney in San Francisco until 2022, when he was removed in a recall election after critics railed against what they viewed as his unwillingness to prosecute violent criminals. Now the judges are the problem, Tan said.

"We need new judges who are not hardcore Chesa Boudin-style activists who work to keep drug dealers out of jail even though the police, the district attorney and the people of SF want them locked up," he wrote. "It's shockingly that simple in SF."

Amazon Web Services has hired Chet Kapoor, the former CEO of DataStax, as its new vice president of security services and observability, according to an internal email obtained by Business Insider.

Kapoor will report directly to AWS CEO Matt Garman, who announced the move in a companywide email on Monday. Kapoor will work alongside AWS CISO Amy Herzog. An AWS spokesperson confirmed the appointment.

Garman said Kapoor will lead efforts to strengthen AWS's security offerings as the company expands its AI business. The hire underscores AWS's push to tighten security around its AI products.

At DataStax, Kapoor oversaw Astra DB, a database built on the open-source Apache Cassandra project, and spearheaded its integration with real-time AI capabilities, Garman said in the email.

The move marks the latest leadership change at AWS. In the past year, the company has lost some executives, including VP of AI Matt Wood and VP of generative AI Vasi Philomin, while adding others, such as former Microsoft exec Julia White as marketing chief.

Here's the full email from Garman:

Goldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a venture capital firm with $7 billion in assets under supervision, according to a release from the investment bank.

Goldman is paying $665 million in cash and equity, and up to $300 million more based on the firm's future performance through 2030, the bank said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Goldman Sachs is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, part of the self-identified "growth engine" of the investment bank. By identifying and making bets on startups, the venture capital firm can help Goldman create a pipeline of investments for its wealthy clients, as well as provide solutions to tech entrepreneurs.

San Francisco-based Industry Ventures has helped pioneer aspects of the American VC market since its founding 25 years ago, according to Goldman CEO David Solomon.

"Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world," Solomon said in the release.

"By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers," said Hans Swildens, founder and CEO of Industry Ventures.

Industry Ventures has made more than 1,000 investments and said its annual performance was an internal rate of return of 18%.

The bank said it expects that all 45 employees of the venture firm will join Goldman.

Two dozen eggs, a gallon of milk, 30 rolls of toilet paper — and one ounce of 24 karat gold.

While that might be one of the more expensive grocery runs a Costco shopper might make, it is one that could realistically happen.

Costco sells hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver each month. There are two ways to buy bars and coins from the wholesale club: online and in-store at certain warehouses. Here's what that looks like.

The first step — step zero, if you will — is to get a Costco membership, since precious metals are exclusively available to members. The basic Gold Star membership gives you access, but if you're planning to spend several thousand dollars on gold and silver, it might make sense to spring for the executive upgrade.

For the additional $65, executive members get 2% rewards on most purchases, including precious metals. At the current price of around $4,100, the reward on a one-ounce gold bar or coin would be $82, which is more than the price of an upgrade. (Executive members can also shop early at the warehouse, but that's another story.)

Equipped with a membership, the options to buy precious metals depend largely on the availability of supply.

Gold, silver, and platinum are listed on Costco.com on a precious metals page in the jewelry and watches category. (The items were previously listed under sports memorabilia and collectibles, which made them a bit harder for the casual buyer to track down.)

When products are priced at or near the commodity market's "spot" price, they can sell out extremely quickly. At one point on October 13, a one-ounce gold bar from the Canadian Mint was available through Costco's website for $4,120, below the spot price at the time. The Costco price for the one-ounce gold bar has since gone up.

Silver also tends to sell out quickly and follows a similar pricing pattern. In fact, silver's market rally of nearly 80% this year so far has outpaced gold's 56% increase. Plus, silver's lower unit price — it's at an all-time high of $52 per ounce — means more options for shoppers who are curious about buying metals but don't want to fork over the price of a well-used car just yet.

Costco has responded to fluctuations in demand by limiting the quantities of a particular item a member is allowed to purchase in one transaction and over a 24-hour period.

Once an online purchase is completed, Costco estimates about three to five days for delivery, typically via UPS or FedEx. Same-day grocery orders must be placed separately, via Instacart.

Comments on the CostcoPM subreddit indicate that some packages can take longer to deliver, especially around periods of high demand and near the end of the week.

Precious metals are also occasionally available at some warehouses — if you know where to look.

Sometimes it's easier to spot: the store will put a large sign near the entrance encouraging arriving shoppers to check out seasonal or specialty bars. Some stores will let you know what they have in stock if you call ahead.

At other times, a sample of the available inventory will be displayed in the warehouse's jewelry case near the electronics section.

Still, it's not as simple as tossing a bar into your cart and proceeding to checkout. The jewelry case also has a stack of paper forms that shoppers must fill out with the item SKU and quantity they wish to purchase.

Shoppers then bring the completed slip to the front office, where an employee will retrieve the order and assist with payment. Voila — they now own a small slab of expensive metal. Don't lose it.

There are three last things Costco shoppers should note.

Although Costco stands behind everything it sells, precious metals are excluded from the company's unusually generous return policy. It also will not adjust the price of gold, silver, or platinum after purchase. Once the deal is done, that's it.

The second thing is that it generally does not make mathematical sense to finance gold or silver purchases with credit card debt or other interest-bearing payment options.

While some metals buyers use credit cards in order to take advantage of rewards schemes, it's widely understood that any balance should be promptly paid off with cash, since interest charges can offset any card points or increase in the metal's value.

Lastly, some gold and silver buyers have found that selling metals can be harder than buying them (at least at the prices they would prefer). Coin shops are not likely to offer the full spot price for gold or silver, since they need to leave room to make a profit when they sell the metal.

Metals dealers and advisors generally recommend planning to hold onto physical precious metals for the long term. Selling without a strategy can have unexpected costs.

Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, one of the two people tapped last month to lead the software company, is confident that OpenAI will be able to cover the costs of the massive amount of cloud infrastructure services it consumes.

In an interview with CNBC's David Faber at Oracle's AI World conference on Monday, Magouyrk said "of course" OpenAI can pay $60 billion for a year's worth of cloud resources. In July, OpenAI agreed to a five-year deal with Oracle that's worth more than $300 billion.

"Just look at the rate at which they've grown to, you know, almost a billion users. That's just unheard of," said Magouyrk, who sat alongside fellow Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia for the interview in Las Vegas.

OpenAI said last week that its flagship ChatGPT chatbot, which was publicly launched less than three years ago, now has 800 million weekly active users. In 2024, OpenAI recorded a $5 billion net loss.

Sicilia said Oracle has started integrating OpenAI artificial intelligence models into a patient portal for viewing electronic health records. Oracle acquired EHR vendor Cerner for about $28 billion in 2022.

"I've seen the results, and I really do think that they're going to have a dramatic impact on industries, on enterprises of all types," Sicilia said of OpenAI.

OpenAI rents out Nvidia graphics chips to run models through Oracle, as well as CoreWeave, Google and Microsoft. At the same time, the company is designing a custom AI processor that Broadcom will build. Earlier on Monday, Broadcom and OpenAI said they will jointly deploy 10 gigawatts worth of the new OpenAI chips.

Building out that much infrastructure requires a hefty amount of new energy.

"I think it's a factor of time, not a factor of if we'll have enough power," Sicilia said.

Oracle shares rose 5% on Monday. The stock has gained 84% this year, lifting Oracle's market cap close to $900 billion.

The rally in quantum computing names continued on Monday after JPMorgan Chase announced it as one of the areas it would invest in as part of a new initiative.

The bank said in a release that it would invest up to $10 billion in companies across four areas: supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy technology, and frontier and strategic technologies — which includes quantum computing.

Arqit Quantum shares closed up 20%, while D-Wave Quantum ended 23% higher and Rigetti Computing gained 25%. IONQ climbed 16%, and Quantum Computing stock gained 12%.

"It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing – all of which are essential for our national security," said CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement.

The initiative is part of a larger $1.5 trillion, decade-long plan, dubbed the "Security and Resiliency Initiative," to finance and invest in industries JP Morgan deems critical to U.S. national and economic security.

As one of the 27 specified sub-areas the bank will be focusing on, quantum computing has seen gains as much as triple digits over the past month. Rigetti and D-Wave were up 175% and 130%, respectively.

Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have shown significant interest in gate-model quantum computing, which can potentially solve problems too complex for standard computers.

Rigetti and IONQ quantum computers are accessible through Amazon Braket, a quantum computing service managed by Amazon Web Services.

In February, Microsoft unveiled its first quantum computing chip called Majorana 1, and Google announced its new breakthrough quantum chip named Willow late last year.

Charlie Kawwas, president of the semiconductor solutions group at Broadcom, on Monday said that OpenAI is not the mystery $10 billion customer that it announced during its earnings call in September.

Kawwas appeared on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" with OpenAI's president, Greg Brockman, to discuss their plans to jointly build and deploy 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators.

The deal was largely expected after analysts were quick to point to OpenAI as Broadcom's potential new $10 billion partner. But after the companies officially unveiled their plans on Monday, Kawwas said OpenAI does not fit that description.

"I would love to take a $10 billion [purchase order] from my good friend Greg," Kawwas said. "He has not given me that PO yet."

Broadcom did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional comment.

OpenAI has been on an AI infrastructure dealmaking blitz as the company looks to scale up its compute capacity to meet anticipated demand. The startup, which is valued at $500 billion, has inked multi-billion dollar agreements with Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and CoreWeave in recent weeks.

Broadcom does not disclose its large web-scale customers, but analysts have pointed to Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance as three of its large clients. During its quarterly call with analysts in September, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said a fourth large customer had put in orders for $10 billion in custom AI chips.

The order increased Broadcom's forecast for AI revenue next year, which is when shipments will begin, Tan said during the call.

OpenAI and Broadcom have been working together for the last 18 months, and they will begin deploying racks of custom-designed chips starting late next year, the companies said Monday. The project will be completed by 2029.

"By building our own chip, we can embed what we've learned from creating frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence," Brockman said in a release.

Broadcom and OpenAI have made their partnership official.

The two companies said Monday that they're jointly building and deploying 10 gigawatts of custom artificial intelligence accelerators as part of a broader effort across the industry to scale AI infrastructure. Financial terms weren't disclosed.

Broadcom shares climbed 9% following news of the deal.

While the companies have been working together for 18 months, they're now going public with plans to develop and deploy racks of OpenAI-designed chips starting late next year. OpenAI has announced massive deals in recent weeks with Nvidia, Oracle and Advanced Micro Devices, as it tries to secure the capital and compute needs necessary for its historically ambitious AI buildout plans.

"These things have gotten so complex you need the whole thing," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a podcast with OpenAI and Broadcom executives that the companies released along with the news.

The systems include networking, memory and compute — all customized for OpenAI's workloads and built on Broadcom's Ethernet stack. By designing its own chips, OpenAI can bring compute costs down and stretch its infrastructure dollars further. Industry estimates peg the cost of a 1-gigawatt data center at roughly $50 billion, with $35 billion of that typically allocated to chips — based on Nvidia's current pricing.

The Broadcom deal provides "a gigantic amount of computing infrastructure to serve the needs of the world to use advanced intelligence," Altman said. "We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that."

Broadcom has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, as hyperscalers have been snapping up its custom AI chips, which the company calls XPUs. Broadcom doesn't name its large web-scale customers, but analysts have said dating back to last year that its first three clients were Google, Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Shares of Broadcom are up over 50% this year after more than doubling in 2024, and the company's market cap has surpassed $1.5 trillion. The stock popped more than 9% last month after the chipmaker said on its earnings call that it had secured a new $10 billion customer, which analysts claimed as OpenAI.

However, Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, said on Monday that OpenAI is not the mystery $10 billion customer disclosed in the report. 

OpenAI President Greg Brockman said the company used its own models to accelerate chip design and improve efficiency.

"We've been able to get massive area reductions," he said in the podcast. "You take components that humans have already optimized and just pour compute into it, and the model comes out with its own optimizations."

Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in the same conversation that OpenAI is the company building "the most-advanced" frontier models.

"You continue to need compute capacity — the best, latest compute capacity — as you progress in a road map towards a better and better frontier model and towards superintelligence," he said. "If you do your own chips, you control your destiny."

Altman indicated that 10 gigawatts is just the beginning.

"Even though it's vastly more than the world has today, we expect that very high-quality intelligence delivered very fast and at a very low price — the world will absorb it super fast and just find incredible new things to use it for," he said.

OpenAI today operates on just over 2 gigawatts of compute capacity.

Altman said that's been enough to scale ChatGPT to where it is today, as well as develop and launch video creation service Sora and do a lot of AI research. But demand is soaring.

OpenAI has announced roughly 33 gigawatts of compute commitments over the past three weeks across partnerships with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom.

"If we had 30 gigawatts today with today's quality of models," he added, "I think you would still saturate that relatively quickly in terms of what people would do."

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stocks tumbled on Friday after President Donald Trump threatened a "massive increase of Tariffs" on Chinese goods. Trump's comments came after Beijing expanded its export restrictions on rare earth materials — a move Trump described as "hostile" in a social media post.

Here's what to know:

JPMorgan Chase announced this morning that it is officially launching its plan to take stakes in companies it views as core to U.S. interests and national security.

The bank said it will invest as much as $10 billion into companies across several categories, including defense and aerospace and energy technology. CNBC's Hugh Son notes that the plan is part of JPMorgan's broader Security and Resiliency Initiative, which will involve the bank financing or facilitating $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it sees as crucial to U.S. interests.

Shares of the bank popped 1.4% in premarket trading.

The Trump administration said it began laying off federal workers on Friday, as the government shutdown nears its third week will no end in sight. Trump, who had previously warned that the shutdown would lead to permanent reductions in the federal workforce, said "a lot" of government employees would be cut.

Over the weekend, the president said his administration had "identified funds" to pay military members if the shutdown continues through Oct. 15 — when active duty members of the armed services are scheduled to receive their next paycheck.

Vice President JD Vance meanwhile took aim at the Affordable Care Act credits that have been the lightening-rod issue in Congress' funding stalemate. Vance said Sunday that there is "a lot of waste and fraud" in the Obamacare subsidies, and that the White House wants to ensure that "the tax credits go to the people who need them."

Gen Z may not be shopping at department stores, but baby boomers are. Just look at Macy's and its subsidiary Bloomingdale's, for example: Data shows a majority of their shoppers are older than 45.

Boomers may be pleased with in-store perks like lax return policies and promotional events, and loyalty from the generation could help buoy department stores amid the rise of online retailers.

But when it comes to winning over younger shoppers, department stores' popularity among baby boomers may end up be what's getting in their way. As one retail adviser put it, the mindset for younger consumers is: "I don't want to shop where my mother shops."

More than 1 million children around the world have used Lego's toy MRI scanner sets in preparation for their medical procedures, the toymaker announced today.

Research from the company shows 96% of healthcare professionals said the two-year-old model has helped reduce kids' anxiety. Close to half said they have less of a need for sedation after children played with the miniature MRI set.

Earnings season is kicking back into high gear. Here's what we're watching this week. (Some economic releases will not come out as scheduled should the government shutdown continue.)

Shares of Bloom Energy soared Monday after striking a deal with Brookfield Asset Management to install fuel cells in artificial intelligence data centers.

Brookfield will spend up to $5 billion to deploy Bloom Energy's technology, the first investment in its strategy to support big AI data centers with power and computing infrastructure. Bloom's fuel cells are "fuel-flexible" and can run on natural gas, biogas or hydrogen, the company says.

Brookfield and Bloom are collaborating to design and build what they are calling "AI factories" around the the world, including a site in Europe that will be unveiled before the end of the year.

Shares of Bloom Energy jumped more than 20%. Bloom's fuel cells provide on-site power that can be quickly installed because they don't rely on a connection to the electric grid.

Bloom has already positioned hundreds of megawatts of fuel cells through deals with utilities including American Electric Power and data center developers such as Equinix and Oracle, according to the company.

The AI industry's data center plans are growing in scale. Nvidia and OpenAI, for example, recently announced a partnership that aims to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, equivalent to the power consumed by New York City at the height of summer.

But AI companies' plans are butting up against an aging U.S. electric grid that is often slow to provide additional power capacity. Data centers also threaten to raise electricity prices for residential customers.

Deploying power solutions "behind-the-meter," or off the grid, "are essential to closing the grid gap for AI factories," said Brookfield's global head of AI infrastructure, Sikander Rashid, in a release announcing the deal.

"AI infrastructure must be built like a factory—with purpose, speed, and scale," Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar said in the release.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC last week that the artificial intelligence industry will need to build power off the electric grid to quickly meet demand and protect consumers from rising electricity prices.

"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that," Huang said.

Tiffany Ng, a 24-year-old tech and culture writer based in New York, was too attached to her iPhone, so she did what humans do when trying to tame an unruly beast.

She chained it to a wall.

Ng felt she was spending too much time staring at her little screen and wanted an escape. Turns out she's in good company. Over 40% of American adults — and 62% of those under 30 — say they are on their phones "almost constantly," according to a Pew Research survey conducted in late 2023. Most Americans, including 81% of adults under 30, believe they use their phone too much, a 2022 Gallup survey found.

Ng's desire to turn the supercomputer in her pocket into a makeshift landline is also one that's shared by other zoomers and millennials. Some Americans are going full Luddite, giving up smartphones altogether in favor of so-called dumb phones, while some parents are easing their kids into technology by opting for classic landlines instead of iPhones.

There are also plenty of people who want a break from their screens but aren't quite ready or able to ditch the conveniences of modern technology altogether. So instead of giving up their smartphones, some young people are creating setups that mimic landlines — by chaining their phone to the wall or creating a wall mount to "hang up the phone" rather than carry it with them all the time.

Yalda Uhls, a research psychologist and the founding CEO of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers at UCLA, said studies have shown that creating physical distance between yourself and your phone can make a big difference.

One study measured how participants completed tasks when they had their phones face down on their desk, in their pocket or a nearby bag, or in another room. The people who had their phones in another room performed the best.

"If you can see your phone, if you can grab it and walk around with it, you're going to want to do that," she told Business Insider. "If it's separate from you, that's the only time people stop really thinking about their phone."

Business Insider talked to three young adults who said creating a physical boundary around their phone has drastically improved their screen time and their quality of life.

Maddie DeVico, a 31-year-old who works in sales for a software company in Denver, said she was feeling overwhelmed by her reliance on technology and trapped by the constant need to respond to messages quickly.

She romanticized the landline she had during her childhood in New Jersey and became obsessed with the idea of getting back to "hanging up the phone" — turning her device into something that she set down at the end of the workday rather than carry with her constantly.

So she took some leftover clay and made her own phone docking station. She hung it on her wall near her kitchen and started setting her phone there at the end of the workday. Initially, she noticed she would go back to it and pick it up to scroll, but after a brief transition period, she found herself setting it down and not picking it up the rest of the night.

"Once I started doing that, putting my phone away, I just stopped reaching for it all the time," DeVico said. "And I just noticed this mental freeness that came with disconnecting. It was kind of a crazy shift."

She said her screen time went down by three hours each day. Her friends learned that they were no longer going to get an immediate text back from her, and she even started leaving the phone in its dock when she left the house. She suddenly had more time to do other things, like cooking and crafting. She started spending more time in her garden just looking at bugs.

"I was so shocked with the amount of stress that left my body. It was life-changing in a way because I ran a little anxious before I started this habit," she said.

When her friends come over for dinner, she also has them keep their phones away from the table, and as a result, she said they're having more meaningful discussions about personal topics. After she posted about the phone dock on TikTok, she racked up nearly a million views and heard from hundreds of others about how they, too, are trying to bring back hanging up the phone.

"I think we're just really genuinely trying to go back to living simpler without the chaos and without all the distractions," she said.

Uhls, the UCLA researcher who often works with members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, said young people are acutely aware of how much time they spend on their phones, and often make efforts to spend less time on them. She said even though they spend a lot of time on social media, they recognize that it's not particularly deep or fulfilling.

"They're craving connections and craving more meaningful experiences," she said.

Some Gen Zers are so desperate for connection that they've embraced the Luddite movement. At an anti-technology rally in New York City last month, dozens of young people put Apple on a mock trial and smashed iPhones. Others are embracing "appstinence," a term coined by a 24-year-old grad student at Harvard.

Chaining her phone to a wall was one of several experiments Ng has done as part of her newsletter, Cyber Celibate, which she uses to explore our relationship with technology. She's also printed out her TikTok "For You" page to read like a newspaper and sent carrier pigeons instead of texts.

For the chain to the wall experiment, Ng gave her phone a full charge, unplugged it, and then put it on its leash by making creative use of a chain link belt. She was committed to leaving it there, even when she left the house, and not giving it another charge for a full week. She put a bench in front of it, where she could sit when she needed to use her phone, but that wasn't comfy enough to make an endless scroll session appealing.

The first couple of days, Ng said she would look forward to going home and being able to scroll on her phone. But when she finally opened her special media feed, that excitement was met with the "very anti-climactic experience of looking at pictures of Alix Earle," an influencer.

"The almost religious experience of being on your phone kind of loses its aura," she said. "It's very alluring, but it's not satisfying at all."

One of the most surprising things she found was how "out of sight, out of mind" her phone really was. When she met up with friends in the park, worked from a coffee shop, or even just during her commute, she didn't find herself reaching for her phone the way she expected to. Instead, she started to notice her surroundings — like the buildings around the train station she frequents or how people act differently on the L train versus the 2.

"I don't want to sound overdramatic, but toward the end, it really felt like I was reentering real life in a way," Ng said.

Ng said she thinks Gen Z is pining for simpler technology and simpler times (she recently was delighted to learn what dial-up internet was). While the experiment lasted a week, she still continues to actively leave her phone in another room, or even leave it behind when she gets out of the house, somewhere close by.

Not everyone romanticizing the days of the landline is against modern technology.

Catherine Goetze is the creator of CatGPT, an online media brand focused on AI education. The millennial content creator worked in tech before amassing hundreds of thousands of followers with helpful videos intended to make AI more accessible.

But Goetze also had a desire to be reachable without being tethered to her smartphone. So a couple of years ago, she bought an old rotary phone and some special parts and turned it into a Bluetooth device connected to her cellphone.

When someone called her cellphone, her "landline" rang, so she could be alerted to incoming calls without also having to be open to every other potential phone notification. She could also make calls by simply picking up the phone and dialing. She even made it so that when she dialed star, it would activate Siri, and she could direct it to call contacts by name, eliminating the need to memorize or look up a number.

This summer, when she posted a video showing off the landline phone she'd been using for years, her comments were full of people saying they needed one too. That's how Goetze decided to start Physical Phones, which makes and sells Bluetooth phones like the one she herself uses.

"It is not realistic to throw your smartphone into a river," Goetze said, adding, "The Physical Phone says, 'Look, keep your iPhone. But there are still ways that you can regain some level of balance and intentionality about achieving that balance."

The phones are currently available for presale and expected to start shipping in November or December, but early signs are encouraging. Goetze said when they first launched, they generated $118,000 in pre-sales in 72 hours.

She said she thinks the orders are from a mix of millennials who are nostalgic for the landlines of their past, and zoomers who don't remember having a landline but are just as nostalgic and apt to romanticize that time, as evidenced by the resurgence in shows like "Friends" and Y2K fashion.

Goetze said she doesn't think most people want to live in a world without modern technology, but rather one where they are using that technology mindfully, rather than being used by it.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that he's considering sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying it would provide "a new step of aggression" in its war with Russia.

As the president travelled on Air Force One to the Middle East on Monday, first to Israel and then Egypt for talks on finalizing a peace deal for Gaza, when asked if he would send Tomahawks to Ukraine, Trump replied "we'll see... I may."

He also signaled he could use the supply of Tomahawks to pressure Russia to end the war, telling reporters: "I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send them Tomahawks.'

"The Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that," he said, according to comments reported by Sky News.

Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have discussed the potential provision on Tomahawk missiles, which would allow Ukraine to launch robust counter-attacks against Russia.

But the U.S. president is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding whether he will actually send the missiles to Ukraine. He said Monday that he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the matter. No such call has been scheduled, as yet, according to comments from the Kremlin on Monday.

Russia has warned that any provision of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv would be seen as a "serious escalation."

Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace, according to U.S. manufacturer Raytheon.

Designed for striking high value or heavily defended land targets, Tomahawks can be fired from ground launchers but are typically launched from ships or submarines, and can be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads. The missiles don't come cheap, with a reported average cost of $1.3 million each.

First developed in the 1970s, they are used by the U.S. military and have been purchased — or with agreements to purchase — by a number of allies, including the U.K., Japan, Australia and the Netherlands.

The latest version, called the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, has a data link that allows it to switch targets while in flight. It can loiter for hours and change course instantly on command.

Raytheon notes that U.S. and Allied militaries have flight tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,350 times. Its most recent use came in 2024, when the U.S. and British navies launched Tomahawk missiles at Houthi rebel sites in Yemen.

Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Moscow's leadership was waiting to see the specifics of any deal to supply Tomahawks, but was scathing about the prospect.

"This would be a serious escalation which, however, wouldn't change the situation for the Kyiv regime on the front lines. But it's important to understand that, leaving aside the details, we're talking about nuclear capable missiles. Therefore, this is truly a serious escalation."

On Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that any Tomahawk supply could end badly for everyone, including Trump. He noted that it's impossible to distinguish between Tomahawk missiles carrying nuclear warheads and conventional ones after they are launched.

"How should Russia respond? Exactly!" Medvedev said on Telegram, in comments translated by Reuters, seeming to hint that Moscow's response would be a nuclear one.

Asked on Monday about Trump's comments that he would talk to Putin about Tomahawks, Peskov said "there are no clear agreements on a phone call."

Ukraine and its supporters say the supply of Tomahawks would greatly enhance the country's strike capabilities and the threat it poses to Russian assets, such as military bases, energy infrastructure and logistics hubs.

Supplying Tomahawks could, as such, be another push factor that brings Russia to the negotiating table with Ukraine and its Western allies, particularly the U.S., wanting to see an end to a war that Moscow began in February 2022.

Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that Kyiv was working closely with the White House to strengthen its defensive capabilities, including its long-range capabilities.

"We see and hear that Russia fears the possibility of the United States providing us with Tomahawks. It is a signal that this kind of pressure can be effective in achieving peace. President Trump and I agreed that our teams and our military will be working on all the matters we discussed," he said.

As Trump looks to cement an end of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, his attention could well turn back to Russia, with the president already signaling waning patience with Putin.

In addition, Trump's publicized coveting of the Nobel Peace Prize (which he missed out on this year) could help spur the president on to deliver peace in Ukraine.

"That Trump did not get the Nobel peace prize this time could turn into good news for Europe. He wants the prize. But he still has to earn it," Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, noted Monday.

"If Trump were to put enough pressure on Putin to stop the war against Ukraine, the U.S. president would indeed be the top candidate for the prize next year ... Media reports about potential deliveries of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine suggest that Trump is getting tougher with Putin. That would be a start," Schmieding said.

If you think your burger, burrito, or cold brew already costs too much, brace yourself — restaurant groups say they would have to raise prices by 30% just to stay profitable amid rising costs.

In a new survey from the restaurant management software company Toast, nearly half of restaurant operators said they plan to increase menu prices if inflation, tariffs, and labor costs continue to climb.

The National Restaurant Association estimates that to maintain a modest 5% profit margin, the average restaurant would need to raise prices by 30.3% — a move many owners fear would scare customers away.

That's bad news for diners, who're already facing increased costs for favorites including burgers, burritos, and coffee. Toast's menu price monitor, released in August, found orders of wings and pints of beer were the only tracked items that beat the nation's current 2.9% rate of inflation, increasing 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively.

Business Insider reported in September that grocery prices have sharply increased in recent months, reaching their highest level since August 2022, and inflation now exceeds the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

The price hikes are tied to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy, which a Yale economist told Business Insider in April is expected to cost the average consumer about $3,800 this year — and that was before Trump renewed trade tensions with China on Friday, announcing a new round of tariffs on the country's imports.

Although the tariffs on imports from China primarily affect items such as electronics and apparel, they also encompass a wide range of fish, snack foods, and spices.

"While tariffs can be enacted with a pen stroke, it takes years to rewire global supply chains," John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at connected supply chain platform e2open, told Business Insider in May. "How this all plays out will be a complex formula full of surprises, with the general theme of higher consumer prices."

For the restaurant industry, which already operates on thin margins, the higher cost of ingredients is not just an inconvenience — it's approaching a crisis point. Not only are their own food and labor costs higher, but consumers are also pulling back on spending, dining out less, and seeking promotional deals when they do.

National Restaurant Association President & CEO Michelle Korsmo said in an August statement that operators are reluctant to raise prices because it makes consumers even less likely to dine out, further jeopardizing the industry, but they "may have no choice" given their increasing costs.

So go ahead and savor your $14 burger — it might be the cheapest one you'll see for a while — or opt for wings and a beer, as the last bargains left on the menu.

Gold prices scaled to another record high on Monday as investors revved up their safe-haven bets after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed tariff threats against China, while expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts added to the metal's allure.

Silver also jumped to an all-time peak, tracking gold's rally.

Spot gold was up 1.64% to a record $4,083.42 per ounce. U.S. gold futures for December delivery surged 2.55% to $4,102.60.

Trump on Friday reignited the U.S. trade war with China, threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese goods imports into the United States and announcing new export controls on critical software by November 1 in a reprisal against Beijing curbing critical mineral exports.

However, Trump, posting on Truth Social on Sunday, wrote: "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!"

Trade tensions remain a focus for markets, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo, adding that "while they have eased again between the U.S. and China, the 100% additional tariff threat remains."

"Ongoing strong investment and central bank demand should further support gold. We target a move to $4,200/oz," he added.

Spot silver jumped 2.22% to $51.39/oz, after hitting $51.70/oz, driven by similar factors as gold alongside tightness in the spot market.

Goldman Sachs said on Sunday that silver prices were expected to rise in the medium term due to private investment flows, but warned of heightened near-term volatility and downside risks compared to gold.

Bank of America on Monday raised its price forecasts for precious metals, lifting its 2026 outlook for gold to $5,000 an ounce and for silver to $65/oz. BofA is the first major bank to raise its gold price forecast to $5,000/oz for 2026.

On a technical basis, gold's and silver's Relative Strength Index stands at 80 and 83, respectively, indicating the metals are overbought.

Non-yielding bullion has gained 53% year-to-date, driven by geopolitical risks, alongside strong central bank gold-buying, exchange-traded funds inflows, Fed rate cut expectations and economic uncertainties stemming from tariffs.

On the monetary policy front, traders are now pricing in a 25-basis-point cut each in October and December, with a 95% and 79.8% chance, respectively.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has a chance to offer his guidance on monetary policy when he speaks on the economic outlook at the NABE annual meeting on Tuesday.

Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak throughout the week.

Platinum, rose 3.76% to $1,645.57and palladium gained 2.92% to $1,446.59.

JPMorgan Chase on Monday said it is launching a decade-long plan to help finance and take direct stakes in companies it considers crucial to U.S. interests.

The bank said in a statement it would invest up to $10 billion into companies in four areas: defense and aerospace, "frontier" technologies including artificial intelligence and quantum computing, energy technology including batteries, and supply chain and advanced manufacturing.

The money is part of a broader effort, dubbed the Security and Resiliency Initiative, in which JPMorgan said it will finance or facilitate $1.5 trillion in funding for companies it identifies as crucial. It said the total amount is 50% more than a previous plan.

"It has become painfully clear that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals, products and manufacturing — all of which are essential for our national security," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.

As the biggest American bank by assets and a Wall Street juggernaut, JPMorgan was already raising funds and lending money to companies in those industries. But the move helps organize the company's activities around national interests at a time of heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.

On Friday, markets tumbled as President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Chinese imports after the major U.S. trading partner tightened export controls on rare earths.

In the release, Dimon said the U.S. needs to "remove obstacles" including excessive regulations, "bureaucratic delay" and "partisan gridlock."

JPMorgan said that within the four major areas, there were 27 specific industries it would look to support with advice, financing and investments. That includes areas as diverse as nanomaterials, autonomous robots, spacecraft and space launches, and nuclear and solar power.

"Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America's economy," Dimon said. The project "includes efforts like ensuring reliable access to life-saving medicines and critical minerals, defending our nation, building energy systems to meet AI-driven demand and advancing technologies like semiconductors and data centers."

The bank said it would hire an unspecified numbers of bankers and create an external advisory council to support its initiative.

In a call with reporters, Dimon said that the project was an internal effort that started a few months ago, not something done with the Trump administration. Dimon also said that even while pumping up their financing efforts by 50% over a decade, he didn't expect "lower-than-commercial returns" on the initiative.

"Obviously, we work closely with people in the government, which we've always done, but this is a JPMorgan effort," Dimon said.

Federal prosecutors allege two MIT-educated brothers pulled off a cryptocurrency heist in a matter of seconds, stealing $25 million in a "first-of-its-kind" fraud scheme.

The brothers' defense? There was no fraud at all. All they did was outsmart some "predatory" automated trading bots. In the dog-eat-dog Wild West of crypto trading, it was fair game, not fraud.

That's what defense attorneys for Anton Peraire-Bueno, 25, and James Peraire-Bueno, 29, are set to argue when the brothers' criminal case heads to trial in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday.

If convicted of the conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering charges against them, the brothers — both highly educated in math and computer sciences — face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count.

The trial comes amid efforts by the Trump administration to bring more order to the cryptocurrency world, including through new regulations.

Prosecutors say the pair's 12-second Ethereum blockchain theft in April 2023 was "meticulously planned" over at least three months, right down to their online searches for "how to wash crypto" and "top crypto lawyers."

"Money launder statue of limitations," prosecutors say they searched at one point, misspelling statute.

The brothers, prosecutors allege, used "bait transactions" to find three victim traders and study their trading habits.

They then "lured" the victims' trading bots into a carefully set, fast-acting trap.

The trap was set with an irresistible bundle of crypto trades — the kind of transactions that the brothers correctly guessed the victim's bots would leap at the chance to profit from, prosecutors say.

The brothers then sprung the trap shut. Prosecutors say they exploited a software "vulnerability" that let them quickly glimpse their prey's private transaction information and "tamper" with the purchase in a classic bait-and-switch.

Instead of generating an anticipated windfall, the victims found that their $25 million had purchased a pile of effectively worthless, illiquid junk crypto.

Along the way, prosecutors say, the brothers hid their own identities — and the location of the heist's ill-gotten gain — through a web of shell companies, crypto addresses, and foreign crypto exchanges.

The heist itself, prosecutors say, was executed in just 12 seconds — the brief pause between the moment a crypto trade is made and when it is officially logged on the blockchain.

"Using the specialized skills developed during their education, as well as their expertise in cryptocurrency trading" the brothers "exploited the very integrity of the Ethereum blockchain," prosecutors said in a 19-page indictment.

The Peraire-Bueno brothers "manipulated and tampered with the process and protocols by which transactions are validated and added to the Ethereum blockchain," the indictment alleges.

"In doing so, they fraudulently gained access to pending private transactions and used that access to alter transactions and obtain their victims' cryptocurrency."

The brothers' lawyers have told prosecutors that they are not interested in even considering taking a plea, prosecutors revealed at a hearing on Thursday.

Instead, the defense is set to push back hard against the prosecution's allegations, at trial, before a jury.

"There's no central authority" governing the Ethereum blockchain, Patrick Looby, who represents the elder brother, James, told US District Court Judge Jessica G. L Clarke during oral arguments in June.

"And there's no government regulations. Instead, economic incentives guide parties' behavior," Looby argued. Prosecutors, he said, are alleging conduct that the government has never sought to criminalize, he argued, including taking advantage of a software vulnerability or using a crypto transaction as "bait."

For fraud, "there needs to be a promise to the victim," he also argued.

"Here, there is no alleged communication at all between the Peraire-Buenos and the traders. And for that reason as well, there's no alleged intent to defraud," he told the judge.

The so-called victims "made very risky bets on a strategy that didn't pay out," he added. "But there was nothing stolen and there was no theft, as that word would normally be used."

The alleged victims lost their cryptocurrency "through pre-programmed trades without ever interacting with the Peraire-Buenos, directly or indirectly," the defense attorneys argued earlier this year, in a failed motion to dismiss the indictment.

"Before this indictment, no Ethereum user would have understood that thwarting a predatory attempt by 'bots' engaged in market manipulation could lead to criminal charges," they wrote.

"No court has ever applied these statutes to similar transactions," they argued. "And the Peraire-Buenos had no reason to know that their alleged conduct may be considered unlawful."

Members of the defense team declined Business Insider's requests for comment on the case. A spokesperson for the prosecution did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prospective jurors will be told on Tuesday that the trial may run into the first week of November.

This week, America will get an off-brand clue of how the economy is faring as earnings season heats up.

However, a trio of economists said it won't replace key data that isn't being published during the government shutdown.

"If the shutdown continues, private data and earnings calls offer useful clues — especially around company performance relative to expectations," Gregory Daco, EY's chief economist, said. "But they're no substitute for broader and more consistent government data."

Independent economist Aaron Terrazas said earning calls can inform people about the direction of the economy, but they are not the same as government data, and people may have to read between the lines for what's being said.

"There's a little bit of a guessing game around how much of this is unique to the company, how much of this is unique to the sector, how much of this is the polish and spin that inevitably accompanies talking to investors," he said.

On the other hand, the big federal data releases tend to be more open and straightforward. Terrazas said the government has vetted and transparent methodologies for its data — people can visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to find a whole page on calculations.

Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said bank CEOs are prone to saying in earnings calls that the consumer is doing well, but that has some caveats: consumers still need to buy necessities, and some are having a harder time than others. That means these calls may not capture the full picture of consumer spending.

"Earnings calls will help to give us color, " Hamrick said, "but it doesn't give us that fully fleshed out view that things like the CPI and the monthly employment situation read."

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has mostly folded up shop during the shutdown. Data reports haven't been released since October 1, and new data collection isn't happening. The jobs report — arguably the most important economic data release of the month — wasn't published on its planned date of October 3.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday that the consumer price index inflation report will be released on October 24 instead of its originally planned date of October 15. The CPI report is especially important ahead of the Fed's next rate decision later this month. The September data is also needed for Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment.

Private data has helped fill in some of the gaps in understanding the state of the job market in September, but the findings were mixed. ADP's analysis showed a loss of 32,000 private-sector jobs, while Revelio Labs found the US added 60,000 nonfarm jobs.

"We're all highly reliant on information about the performance of the US economy, and the federal data is the gold standard measuring that performance," Hamrick said.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report is closely watched to see how the workforce is evolving. It helps the Federal Reserve make its interest rate decisions, helps economists understand changes to the labor force, wage growth, and unemployment, and helps job seekers identify industries that are hiring more than others.

"It's like air traffic control for the economy," Daco said. "Planes can't land safely without FAA staff — and businesses can't make sound investment or hiring decisions in a data fog. Consumers, too, lose confidence."

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Izabela Oquendo, a 35-year-old mother of two who moved her family from Connecticut to Alicante, Spain. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

On the surface, our life was great.

My husband and I both had thriving businesses. I was an accountant, and he was a home inspector. We had a lot of external things that defined success, like two brand-new cars sitting in the driveway, a beautiful 2,000-square-foot two-story house that we spent a lot of time renovating to be perfect.

From the outside, it looked like we had it all together. But the truth is, we weren't really happy.

We went through some personal turmoil and had falling-outs with our closest friends. And in 2023, my father passed away, and my mother, who is from Poland, moved back there to take care of her sick brother. We felt really isolated.

Eventually, we started thinking about moving somewhere new — somewhere near my mother with warm weather. We're beach people, so we landed on Spain.

In January 2024, we took a trip there to experience it firsthand and loved it so much that we knew it was right for us.

Before making the leap to Spain, we sold our home and auctioned off everything in it — furniture, kitchenware, and all the little knickknacks we'd accumulated over the years. We also sold our other real-estate properties for a decent profit.

We also decided to fulfill a lifelong dream of traveling around the US in an RV. I wanted to test if I could take my business on the road and reconnect as a family, knowing that in Spain, with the language barrier and a brand-new environment, it would be just us for a while.

We left in July 2024 and returned to Connecticut in 2025, hitting Tennessee and Kentucky and looping back through Michigan, South Dakota, Washington, Montana, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. Luckily, our kids were young enough to love every minute of it.

When we got back to Connecticut, we rented a small apartment in a beach community for about $2,000 a month while we waited four months to move to Spain.

By the time we landed in Spain in May, we had pared everything down to just two big suitcases, two carry-ons, and nine shipped boxes. That was everything we owned.

I have Polish citizenship by descent, so my children and I came to Spain as EU citizens. My husband obtained his residency through Spain's family reunification visa program.

We live in Alicante, just past Valencia. It's a really up-and-coming area with lots of new apartment buildings and constant construction. There are tons of people, many from other parts of Europe, so we hear many different languages and see plenty of non-Spanish restaurants.

I wouldn't necessarily describe it as the quintessential "Spanish" experience, which is a bit disappointing. If we could do it over, we'd probably choose somewhere that feels more traditionally Spanish.

We're in a 1,500-square-foot apartment with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. It's decent, but we're not used to apartment living; we've always had a house since the kids were born, so keeping things quiet, especially with little ones running around, can be tough.

We do want to buy a house within the next few months. We're actually thinking of having my mom coming to live with us at least part time when we have more space. The areas we're looking to buy are in a lot more traditionally Spanish areas.

One city we're particularly interested in is Calpe. It's just beautiful and super cute. There are lots of restaurants and shops, and there's even a beach there.

I've been surprised by the cost of living in Spain. I thought it was going to be significantly less, and it's really not. The prices for goods and services have gone up over the past two years from when we first started thinking about moving.

Our apartment costs about the same as the one we had in Connecticut, and we're spending about the same on groceries as we did in the States.

It's also been difficult to communicate with the locals. My husband speaks Spanish, but the dialect here is different. We're getting by, though.

One of my biggest fears about moving to Spain was how my kids would handle learning the language and assimilating into the culture.

They definitely notice they're in a new country. When we arrived, we enrolled them in Spanish lessons to give them a foundation. Of course, they're still learning the language.

My daughter is very social, but when she first started school, it was hard for her to make friends — something she'd never struggled with before. It's because she can't just walk up and start talking to them; the other kids don't speak the same language. That was tough, but an English-language camp we also enrolled her in has helped a lot.

My advice for parents moving their children to a new country is to be gentle with the process. Kids are resilient and adapt to almost anything. I grew up with immigrant parents, so I remember this from my own upbringing. I think if you provide a stable structure and show up consistently, the external stuff matters much less.

One of the main things we wanted in moving to Spain was a slower life. In Connecticut, my husband and I were constantly working — passing each other during the day and collapsing at night. It was a grind we weren't enjoying.

I am working here, but a lot less. I continue to do accounting and bookkeeping for my US clients, and am transitioning into more healing and therapeutic work. In June, I published a book I started working on while traveling the States in our RV, about finding your life purpose, which deeply influenced our move.

A typical day for us involves my husband taking my daughter to school in the morning, and me starting bookkeeping.

I usually work half a day, pick my daughter up at two, and we have lunch. In the afternoons, we go on walks or go to the grocery store, and then we just hang out for the rest of the day. It's much slower than the 10-hour days I was used to working.

I feel like our happiness is less dependent on our accomplishments now. Before, it was always grinding for the next thing — a bigger house, a nicer car, a promotion, more clients.

Now that I'm not striving for external milestones, I feel real happiness. Now, the things I strive for are within my family and things that make me truly happy. Money is not at the top of that list anymore.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Meredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, based in New York and Paris. It's been edited for length and clarity.

In July 2006, I accepted a job offer at Google that brought me into tech after an arts and humanities education. I climbed the ladder at Google to found Google's Open Research Group, working on issues related to measurement, privacy, and AI.

In 2016, I cofounded the AI Now Research Institute at NYU, the first university-based research institute to examine broader social and political economic considerations surrounding AI.

Business Insider's Power Hours series gives readers an inside look at how powerful leaders in business structure their workday. See more stories from the series here, or reach out to editor Lauryn Haas to share your daily routine.

I next joined the Federal Trade Commission as Lina Kahn's chief AI advisor, where I stayed for under a year. After that, I joined Signal because I had met its founder, Moxie Marlinspike, 10 years ago on a smaller open-source project called WindSignal.

When Signal became its own foundation in 2018, I joined the board and became its president in September 2022.

Here's what a typical day looks like.

First, I grab a protein drink and take a shower. I then make my coffee. I have an AeroPress with a hand grinder, and I make a very strong brewed coffee with cardamom.

While my coffee is steeping, I do little tasks around the house, like taking out the trash. I put on some dance music to get the energy moving in the house. I also practice yoga every day, with no exceptions; it's my non-negotiable.

I sit down wherever I'm working that day, which is always from home as we've always been a remote company, and go through emails and notifications. Signal messages are our main platform for communication, so I start pulling things into my to-do list to better understand what I'm facing that day.

I'm based between New York and Paris. Depending on my other engagements, I travel about half the time.

My morning routine is usually no more than an hour and a half. I don't really think of it as a sacrifice to keep my morning intact. I'm not "being disciplined," I'm practicing a consistent and helpful ritual that supports me over time.

I open the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, and any new briefings from the AI Now Institute. Recently, I've been closely examining the brass tacks and implementation details of AI agents, as they're being rolled out and pose a significant privacy threat to Signal.

I'll also examine some of the broader security and privacy concerns surrounding AI systems in general, engaging with the work of people like Heidy Khlaaf, the research director at AI Now.

I've been writing a book about AI, with a focus on privacy, in bits and pieces in the mornings, too.

We also have a heartbeat meeting, which is a sync meeting for my office to check in on everyone's current projects, ensure that everything is moving forward, and that communication lines are clear.

We have weekly meetings with bigger updates, and we monitor the progress with different clients, addressing any bugs that arise.

Since Signal Gate, we've had numerous conversations with people who are reaching out to understand Signal's capabilities and how it differs from competitors like WhatsApp or iMessage.

I have a particular smoothie recipe that's high in protein and low in the glycemic index.

I eat snacks throughout my workday, such as brown rice, a boiled egg, kimchi, or a baked yam with avocado and arugula — something fairly simple to keep the nutrition going.

Afternoons are the busiest time for talking and catching up. I join a weekly leadership meeting and schedule one-on-ones. I'll also talk to our chair and board.

Our email inboxes are vacant because we use Signal. We do use email for scheduling, and people can email us on different lists or reach out to us directly, but they're primarily where our administrative staff, my EA, and others manage scheduling with the outside world.

Given that we're dealing with very sensitive topics, we prefer Signal Desktop or Signal Mobile with video for calls across our entire organization.

I love to cook, so between meetings, I'll do little bits of prep work. Whenever I'm done, I can have a very nice dinner ready to eat. After dinner, I'll clean up a bit and listen to some music, a podcast, or an audio service that reads academic papers to me.

I enjoy podcasts with smart people and listen to a lot of them — mainly in tech, geopolitics, science, and business. I've been listening to Amy Westervelt's podcast "Drilled," which examines the history and state of climate science and the oil industry's relationship with it.

I usually do night yoga, even though it's not always advised to do yoga after dinner. That's the only time I have available.

I also check my phone throughout the night, making sure to answer any incoming messages. I'm not a purist, but I do feel the weight of the responsibility to make sure my people get a reply and that I'm not missing something.

The moment that makes me feel most drained is any moment that involves attempting to do a quick admin task, such as logging into a new account, checking a dashboard, or downloading a conference app, or the like, that then turns into an hour of debugging some redirect loop or a broken two-factor process.

Suddenly, it's been an hour, and I'm on the phone with some Kafkaesque AI-bot customer support, and I haven't even started the "real" work that the admin task was supposed to let me commence.

Why, I ask myself at this point, does so much tech insist on being so shitty?

Unless there's something truly urgent, I'm not pedal to the metal all weekend. It's more casual, and I'm less connected to the day-to-day heartbeat of business.

I love cooking, so I'll do some grocery shopping and go to the farmers' market. I slow shop to see what's available and how pretty the market is.

I read a lot on the weekend, and I have personal projects and personal scholarship that make me really happy when I can get some space to dig in.

I often do a yoga workshop on the weekend. I also love dancing and hanging out with friends. Sometimes, I go to the opera.

Paris is a glorious city, and so is New York City. Walking out the door, you feel like you unwrapped a special package. I sometimes act like a tourist and explore.

Electric vehicle sales in the US reached a new milestone in the third quarter of 2025. Beyond that, the future is uncertain for almost every player in this market, except one.

With federal incentives for EVs falling away, the US market must survive on its own merits. Who wins and who survives will depend largely on who has the scale and sales volume to make their businesses profitable.

Tesla has already reached scale and is comfortably profitable. Most other operators in the US EV market aren't there yet.

"In the volume-driven business of automotive manufacturing, low volume is the enemy; EV profitability remains a distant dream for nearly every automaker," Cox Automotive, an industry data provider, warned recently in its latest EV market report.

A record 437,487 EVs were sold in the US in the third quarter, according to estimates from Cox's Kelley Blue Book. That marks a 30% year-over-year surge this quarter, underscoring the growing mainstream appeal of EVs.

Yet beneath the headline growth lies a harsh economic truth: without massive scale, most automakers are still losing money on their electric ambitions in the US.

Tesla remains the exception. Even as its market share slipped to 41% from 49% the previous year, it continues to dominate the US EV landscape. The Model Y and Model 3 alone accounted for more than 168,000 units sold in the third quarter, dwarfing competitors.

By contrast, only nine out of roughly 90 EV models sold more than 10,000 units in the US in the quarter. Most electric vehicles struggle to move more than 6,000 units a quarter, according to Cox data. That volume is probably too low to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, supply chains, and software integration.

Major brands, including Mercedes, Toyota, and Nissan, saw flat or declining EV sales in the third quarter, despite consumers rushing to purchase ahead of incentives expiring on September 30.

Meanwhile, Volkswagen, General Motors, Honda, and Hyundai posted robust growth. While a promising sign, that may not be enough volume to turn their EV operations in the US into profitable businesses.

For instance, Ford's EV division lost $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025, despite an increase in sales. Rivian lost about $1.7 billion in the same period. In contrast, Tesla reported a profit of more than $1.5 billion in the first half of this year.  

It's no wonder that many legacy carmakers are backtracking on their EV plans. If they cannot reach a high-volume scale, they risk consistently losing money. At some point, they have to stop the bleeding.

In July, Mercedes stopped taking EV orders in the US. Stellantis has recently shelved some of its EV plans, along with Porsche and Honda. Even Ferrari, which has juicy profit margins, dialed down its EV plans.

With federal EV incentives now gone, analysts at Cox Automotive expect sales to decline in the fourth quarter and early 2026, testing whether the US market can sustain itself without government support.

This could reveal which carmakers have the stamina to suck up EV losses and try to reach scale in the US market. Tesla is already there. Very few other companies are even close.

"The training wheels are coming off," said Cox Automotive's director of industry insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty.

The next phase will reveal whether automakers can drive America's EV market on fundamentals — cost efficiency, scale, and innovation — rather than incentives.

For now, Tesla stands alone as proof that, in this industry, volume equals survival.

As investors scramble to find the next big AI startup to fund, one VC firm got rid of its analysts and is instead using AI to help run deals.

Four-year-old Davidovs Venture Collective (DVC) — cofounded by married duo and general partners Marina Davidova and Nick Davidov — has launched a $75 million fund for Series A and B AI startups.

They say they fired their analysts, who typically help source and vet deals. Instead, DVC is tapping a network of 170 limited partners (LPs) — including founders and engineers from OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, and Perplexity — to source new deals, and it's arming them with AI tools.

DVC initially employed five part-time and full-time analysts, Davidova said, and it eliminated those roles more than a year ago in lieu of AI.

DVC's network of LPs now use AI agents to assist with deal memos, due diligence, and portfolio monitoring. The agents, which the LPs also helped build, can also identify founder needs and match them with relevant experts in the community.

The LPs will assist founders with hiring, sales, product development, and networking — in exchange for carried interest, a share of profits earned by investment managers. Davidov said that roughly 30% to 40% of the carried interest from each deal is shared with the community of investors, 30% to 40% goes to the partners, and the rest is divided between him and Davidova.

"We have really incredible talent that we would never be able to hire," Davidov said. "They're the kind of people that Zuckerberg offers a hundred million dollars to, and they work for us for free on their weekends."

While AI has made the firm more productive, it can't replace humans when it comes to assessing qualities like a founder's mental state, Davidova said. Other VC firms are also using AI to replace associates, and Point72 Ventures managing partner Sri Chandrasekar predicted that AI can reduce head count by over 50%, Business Insider previously reported.

The couple launched San Francisco-based DVC in 2021 with a network of 50 LPs.

Its seed fund has invested $21 million to date in 120 companies, including Perplexity, Etched, Thinking Machines Lab, and Higgsfield.

LPs backing DVC's new fund include TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, Perplexity cofounder Denis Yarats, Zencoder founder Andrew Filev, and Semrush founder Oleg Shchegolev.

Along with launching the $75 million fund, DVC has onboarded two general partners — entrepreneurs Mel Guymon and Charles Ferguson — and named Meta AI product manager Alexey Rybak as a venture partner. Guymon will spearhead business sales support and governance, while Ferguson will focus on deal origination.

The new fund has secured $40 million and is finalizing the remaining amount with institutional investors, DVC said.

Business Insider Edition 

Madagascar's administration, which has in recent weeks come under heavy fire, recently spoke about an attempted coup, as the youth-led protest in the country continues to gain ground.


        Over the weekend, members of the country's army joined a protest that is calling for the resignation of the president of the country, Andry Rajoelina.
    


        This has led the presidency to speculate on a potential coup, after a military unit referred to as CAPSAT instructed its troops to disregard any orders from the government and support the protesters.
    


        The CAPSAT unit had been responsible for aiding the current president in seizing power in a 2009 coup.
    


        According to CAPSAT officials, who are based on the outskirts of Antananarivo, the country's capital, they have command over all security activities and will coordinate all military branches.
    


        As reported by Reuters, General Demosthene Pikulas, who had previously served as head of the military academy, was named army chief.
    


        Another unit within the country's paramilitary gendarmerie, which had, prior to Sunday, assisted the police in tackling the protests, had also followed in CAPSAT's footsteps, deciding to disregard government instructions.
    


        "All use of force and any improper behaviour towards our fellow citizens are prohibited, as the gendarmerie is a force meant to protect people and not to defend the interests of a few individuals," the Intervention Forces of the National Gendarmerie said in a statement broadcast on Real TV.
    


        A little over a week ago, Protests in Madagascar's capital, Antananarivo, came to a halt after demonstrators in the region decided to recoup.
    


        The protests against the government's leadership have now resumed in full force, with their intensity continuing to escalate.
    


        Madagascar has been ravaged by weeks of protests that began over water and electricity shortages but have since escalated into a severe political crisis.
    


        The unrest began on September 25, 2025, in Antananarivo, the capital, when inhabitants, especially young people, came to the streets to protest chronic power outages and deplorable living conditions.
    


        As dissatisfaction with poverty, corruption, and unemployment grew, the demonstrations, dubbed the Gen Z movement, swiftly spread to neighboring cities.

        To ease tensions, President Andry Rajoelina dismissed his administration on September 29 and named General Ruphin Fortunat Zafisambo as prime minister on October 6.
    


        However, demonstrators rejected the decision, claiming that it did not address their concerns.
    


        Since the protests began, reports indicate that at least 22 people have been killed, and over 100 have been injured. A curfew has been imposed in numerous towns, and some international flights, including Air France, have been suspended owing to security concerns.
    


        Protesters continue to call for the president's resignation and improved government services.
    


        Meanwhile, the African Union and the United Nations have urged calm and negotiation, but the crisis has not been resolved.

You know the saying: Keep your friends close, and your trillion-dollar AI enemies closer.

The artificial intelligence explosion has sparked an intensity of competition in Silicon Valley not seen since the smartphone boom, as tech companies spend billions of dollars to sprint ahead with the most advanced models, access to the most compute power, and the best researchers.

The AI race has also brought some of these rivals closer together than ever. In some cases, uncomfortably close.

Just look at what's happened in the last few weeks. OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to access Oracle's compute power — despite being majority-backed by Oracle rival Microsoft — while Meta signed a $10 billion deal for Google Cloud, per a person familiar. Microsoft, meanwhile, announced that it's giving its customers access to Anthropic's AI models, which run on Amazon and Google's cloud services. For all we fixate on the AI "war," right now there's also a lot of AI lovemaking, as many of these companies need each other more than ever.

"The stakes are so high that you're seeing behavior that in the past wouldn't happen," said Gil Luria, managing director at investment firm D.A. Davidson. "It's a big chess match of: how can I progress on my stuff, but also not miss the boat if someone else is winning?"

But how close is too close? Not only do these AI deals largely run on debt, they're also forming complex — and consequential — dependencies between companies. In late September, Nvidia announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which in turn said it will build out at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with Nvidia chips, an alliance that has raised the specter of vendor financing and memories of Cisco extending loans in the 90s so companies could purchase its telecoms equipment. Spoiler alert: that didn't end well.

In the knotty game of AI Twister, what happens when any one giant leg slips?

In some ways, Silicon Valley's rise to dominance has been built on enemies getting into bed with each other.

Google, for one, just got dragged through a federal court by the Justice Department because of its long-held deal with Apple — a direct competitor — to be the default search engine on the iPhone. In return, Apple gets a huge revenue stream for doing very little work. (In 2022, Google paid Apple a whopping $20 billion, per the DOJ.) The rise of the cloud giants also created an intricate web of dependencies, as smaller rivals began renting the compute powers from the titans they were trying to take down. Amazon offers Apple TV+ on Prime Video. Netflix runs on Amazon's cloud servers. Apple relies on Samsung components for its phones that compete with Samsung's.

Now the AI boom and spurred a new generation of relationships born out of necessity, while deepening existing ones.

At Goldman Sachs' Communacopia + Technology conference in San Francisco in September, both OpenAI and Meta's CFOs talked about how their companies are leaning on Google Cloud. Apple has even trained its AI on Google's Tensor Processing Units, Business Insider previously reported. But Google Cloud customers also want Nvidia's GPUs, so Google rents and offers Nvidia's competing chips to its customers via Google Cloud. Meta has struggled to catch up, with its Llama models falling short to the point Meta employees themselves are using competing AI models for their work.

Many of the deals are simply pragmatic, as several tech companies were caught off guard by the suddenness of the AI boom, and needed to lean on competitors and form less usual relationships to keep up.

"People recognize it's hard to build large language models, and not only hard, it's really expensive," says Rishi Jaluria, analyst at RBC. "So how do you benefit from that without taking the financial burden on your balance sheet?"

Some companies may have also been haunted by the specter of the dotcom bubble. "We saw what happened when people missed the internet. Sears could have been Amazon. Blackberry could have dominated enterprise mobile," says Jaluria. "Everyone looks at that and nobody wants to miss this race."

These entanglements carry longer-term strategic risks that some of these companies might have once tried to avoid. OpenAI is giving big business to cloud providers such as Google and Microsoft right now, but in doing so it's also learning how to build out its own data centers that might one day threaten business for the cloud giants.

Think of it like David and Goliath, if the giant was helping David design and build slingshots.

It can go the other way, too. But these may be tomorrow's problems. Right now, analysts say that it's in Nvidia's best interest to have as many players out there as possible, and OpenAI's best interest is to secure as much compute as it can while it's available. As for giants like Google and Meta, everyone is sitting at the poker table and not wanting to be the only one that doesn't go all-in.

"When you hear about any of these big participants talking about this right now, like Mark Zuckerberg or Sundar Pichai, the type of language they use is: the risk of underinvesting is bigger than the risk of overinvesting," says Luria.

We're also seeing AI drag in both new players and old incumbents who want a piece of the pie. "Just the fact Oracle is going atomic on this thing is a huge deal," says Patrick Moorhead, chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. "Ten years ago, I would have said: no way, they're a software company."

Sometimes — surprise — sleeping with the enemy gets messy.

Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI includes plans to build out at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. That will require OpenAI purchasing millions of GPUs from … Nvidia. (OpenAI is also reportedly working on its own in-house chips that would eventually compete with Nvidia's. "We do not require companies we invest in to use NVIDIA technology," an Nvidia spokesperson said when asked for comment). The deal was announced just days after OpenAI also signed a deal with Oracle to access $300 billion of the cloud company's compute power over five years.

Oracle is also currently buying billions of chips from Nvidia. Is this tale not tangled enough for you? In October, OpenAI also announced a deal to buy six gigawatts worth of GPUs from Nvidia chip rival AMD. In short, Nvidia is helping to prop up one of its biggest rivals.

You can see why there's been a lot of talk round-tripping, which has been a particular phenomenon of the cloud wars.

Here's how it often works. Company A invests in Company B, which in turn pays Company A for services such as cloud infrastructure. Company A makes some of its investment back, and is also able to show that demand for its services has grown.

An example of this was Amazon investing $4 billion in Anthropic, which in turn selected Amazon Web Services as its "cloud provider of choice." Here's where things get extra sticky though: Google is also an investor in Anthropic, meaning its investment is also tied to the performance of one of its biggest rivals.

Investors tend to not love these arrangements because they allow companies to juice their numbers and blur the difference between revenue that is organic and that is circulated back. Take an even more egregious example: Nvidia is selling its chips to smaller cloud providers in which it also invests, and then reportedly renting them back. So the startup gets to report an increase in revenue from its cloud business, which in turn boosts Nvidia's stake in the business.

Cue the Christian Bale in "The Big Short" concerned face.

But it's important to differentiate the "healthy" and "unhealthy" behavior, says Luria, who points to Nvidia-backed cloud company Coreweave as "the most glaring example of bad behavior." The company, which offers customers access to Nvidia's GPUs, has an ever-expanding contract with OpenAI, which uses Coreweave's cloud infrastructure. After Coreweave's IPO earlier this year fizzled, Nvidia inked a $6.3 billion agreement to buy back any unsold cloud capacity from Coreweave.

"Nvidia seeded Coreweave to create competition," he says. Then, "they signed up as a customer." Coreweave having a cost of capital of 10% on a 5% return on its assets was "self-evidently value destructive," he says. "It's like taking a margin loan from your broker to buy treasuries," he adds.

"Nvidia is an important partner to CoreWeave to be sure," a CoreWeave spokesperson said in an emailed statement. "However, we do not receive any preferential treatment. We compete for supply like every other customer."

Luria says the demand for AI was "very real" and he doesn't believe it's going away. "There's not going to be a moment where we say oh this AI stuff is nonsense like we did about the metaverse."

So if there is a bubble to burst at all, perhaps it will simply be one that hurts the "unhealthy" players. To take a Keynesian perspective on the current AI economy, if the ultimate customer demand is there — and right now, everyone seems to agree it is — then big players like Nvidia and Oracle priming the pump to stimulate the wider AI economy isn't necessarily a bad thing.

"This is just how the economy works," says Juluria. "We're just seeing it in a very exaggerated way."

The fact some AI companies are generating revenue from the technology is one reason some analysts are hopeful Silicon Valley's big tangled love-in will pay off.

"By no means am I saying there is no risk," Moorhead tells Business Insider. "But the downstream impact of AI for companies that are doing it right is very positive."

Speaking to CNBC last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his and other companies were building "a brand-new industry called AI infrastructure."

But the demand will ultimately need to be there to stop this intricately woven infrastructure from collapsing inward - to the tune of $1 trillion and counting. Right now, almost everything appears to be riding on Sam Altman, who has placed OpenAI squarely in the middle of this tangled web of deals and strange bedfellows.

"Sama has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the promised land," wrote Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon in a note this month. "And right now we don't know which is in the cards."

One founder has ditched long pitch decks and presentations for AI.

"Famously, the Series A was the only time I made a pitch deck," Aravind Srinivas, the cofounder and CEO of Perplexity, said in an interview with Berkeley Haas released on Saturday.

Perplexity announced its $25.6 million Series A round in March 2023.

Pitch decks are slide shows that give investors and customers key details about a company's founders, its product, and its financial performance.

"I just write a memo and I tell them you can do a Q&A and ask whatever you want," Srinivas said, referring to potential investors. "And anything else that is not internal data, you can ask Perplexity. Like, it already knows everything."

Srinivas cofounded Perplexity in 2022 after working as a researcher at Google's DeepMind and OpenAI. In August, Business Insider reported that the AI search engine was seeking fresh funding at a $20 billion post-money valuation. The startup has attracted funding from investors including SoftBank, Nvidia, and Jeff Bezos.

During Saturday's interview, the CEO shared how he pitched to investors in the company's most recent funding round.

He said he hosted a Zoom webinar for one investor who put in a lot of money in this round, and he answered many of their questions on the spot.

"Then there was a lot of follow-up questions from there that they sent in a long email," he said. "I copied the entire email, put it into Perplexity, and said: 'Answer it like Aravind.'"

"So I actually just replied to that email with the Perplexity answer link, and I asked, see if this suffices. If not, I can add more context," he said. "They said: 'This is wonderful.' And they wired the money the next day."

Jesse Dwyer, Perplexity's head of communications, told Business Insider after publication that Srinivas referred to tools like Perplexity's AI assistant Comet, which "allow us to get highly accurate answers on any question about our business and internal data in real time."

"This allows for investor meetings to be much more productive, because the real purpose of answers about the business is to unlock more questions about the business," Dwyer added.

While there are cases of founders not needing formal presentations because of high inbound investor interest, the no-pitch-deck approach is still rare in Silicon Valley.

In April, workforce management startup Rippling said that it raised a $45 million Series A round, led by Kleiner Perkins, without a formal pitch deck.

"Instead, the centerpiece of our fundraising materials was an Investor Memo, which laid out our pitch in prose," the company said in a blog post about the raise.

"Accompanying the Memo were 46 slides of metrics, projections, and detailed methodology footnotes; rather than share these as siloed Excel sheets at the diligence stage, we packaged them before the pitch," Rippling wrote.

Mark Cuban said on Sunday that employees, not just CEOs, should receive a proportional cut of their companies' success in the form of stock options.

Cuban was responding to several posts on X that criticized the growing wealth of top business executives compared to the average worker. He said the real issue wasn't the ever-increasing net worth of billionaires but how companies reward employees.

In his X post, Cuban wrote that billionaire wealth levels are soaring "because the stock market has gone straight up."

"You know who is funding the increase, particularly lately? Retail investors. 401ks," Cuban said.

"The better question is why are we not giving incentives to companies to require them to give shares in their companies to all employees, at the same percentage of cash earnings as the CEO?" he added.

Cuban did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Cuban said in an earlier post that successful entrepreneurs derive less satisfaction from money "once your LIQUID net worth becomes high enough."

"The value of those dollars becomes much greater, to you, and so many others, when you use your business or other expertise to help others. That is the greater reward," Cuban wrote.

"Compassion and capitalism, not greed, are what can make this country far greater," he added.

Cuban has long espoused the importance of companies divvying up the spoils with their rank-and-file employees.

In 2020, Cuban said on the "This is Working" podcast that companies looking to emerge stronger after the COVID-19 pandemic should give their employees stock.

"You will get more from your employees, and they will be more committed if you share equity immediately in a meaningful way, so that everybody rises up," Cuban said.

"No entrepreneur can do this alone. You need every single employee committed to helping you get through this, so recognize that. Reward them for it," he added.

Last year, Cuban said in an X post that "300 out of 330 employees" at his streaming company, Broadcast.com, became millionaires after he sold it to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.

He also shared profits with his employees at his first business, Microsolutions, a software company. After selling the company for $6 million to CompuServe, Cuban said he shared 20% of the sales proceeds with 80 employees.

"In every business I've sold, I've paid out bonuses to every employee that was there more than a year," Cuban wrote on X in June 2024.

Last month, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said in a report that S&P 500 CEOs earned 268 times as much as their median worker in 2023. The average CEO made around 30 times what the average worker made in 1978.

In September, Tesla proposed a new $1 trillion pay package for its CEO, Elon Musk, if he could raise the EV giant's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035. Tesla's current market cap is around $1.3 trillion.

"If he performs, if he hits the super ambitious milestones that are in the plan, then he gets equity — it's 1% for each half a trillion dollars of market cap, plus operational milestones he has to hit in order to do that," Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a CNBC interview about the proposal.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Varun Agarwal, a founding employee at OffDeal, an AI investment bank. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.

For a college graduate looking to work in finance, it's typically a no-brainer to pursue a career in investment banking.

What a career as an investment banker prepares you for is very enticing. You get great pay while working closely with executives from large public companies. You get to brush up on your soft skills while picking up technical skills like financial modeling.

The biggest lesson I learned from my time in investment banking was how to perform a wide variety of tasks efficiently. It also taught me how to ask the right questions when evaluating businesses. Working on deals honed my intellectual curiosity and sharpened my judgment when making investment decisions.

I considered starting my career at a tech startup instead. What held me back was my own aversion to risk. I studied at the University of Minnesota, where few people would take the plunge into entrepreneurship. Investment banking was the safer and prestigious path to take.

I figured that I didn't have any tangible skills to offer if I wanted to build or join a startup. Investment banking felt like a good way for me to build up my skills in the event that the right startup opportunity emerged.

I ended up working as an investment banker for three years, first at Piper Sandler and then at JPMorgan. Incidentally, both roles were based in the Bay Area, which helped expose me to the startup culture in Silicon Valley.

Seeing 21-year-olds start companies and raise millions of dollars was exhilarating. I thought to myself then, "Hey, why can't I do that too? Why don't I join a startup and take a big risk myself?"

That's when I started speaking to founders and investors to map out the next steps of my career. One day, while scrolling through LinkedIn, I came across a post from Ori Eldarov, the founder of the AI native investment bank, OffDeal.

I was drawn to OffDeal's mission and its use of AI and software to address the exact pain points I faced as a junior banker at JPMorgan.

Their focus on small businesses resonated with me at a personal level. My mom runs her own dental practice and is a small-business owner. Growing up, I saw that most business brokers could not run a proper Wall Street-level process when handling transactions for small businesses. I knew I had to be a part of OffDeal.

What's unique about OffDeal is how each deal we handle is handled by a two-person team comprising one banker and one engineer. So far, I have been working on deals with OffDeal's founding software engineer, Luis Ruiz Morel. Both of us get to take a cut out of the deals we do.

We also work a lot faster. At bulge bracket banks like JPMorgan, a company valuation could take weeks or even months to complete.

At OffDeal, it can be completed in one to two days at most. I just need to work with Luis to conduct the valuation using our proprietary software. Gone are the days when I had to painstakingly plug my numbers into an Excel spreadsheet.

It's not just modeling. AI and technology have completely transformed my workflow as a banker.

In the past, I had to take notes manually when I sat in on Zoom calls. Now, AI can transcribe those calls for us.

And when it comes to putting together pitchbooks, I don't have to spend hours going back and forth with my managing director and clients to polish them. Instead, our AI agent makes those revisions automatically, which saves us a lot of time.

The upside to all this is that our bankers can do more deals and, more importantly, spend less time on grunt work.

When I was at JPMorgan, I usually worked on two to three live deals at once. Here at OffDeal, I can work on 10 to 11 deals at a time. I also get to spend a lot of time out on the road meeting with prospective buyers and sellers.

When it comes to starting your career, you can't go wrong with a job in traditional investment banking. It's still a great industry to go into.

But I think it has become less risky to join an AI company like OffDeal. It may have been a bigger risk before, but it is becoming increasingly clear that AI will have a huge impact on our lives.

There's a very small window of time where you can actually succeed and push your career forward in AI before it becomes a more mature industry. Becoming AI native and learning how to incorporate it into your workflow will pay huge dividends in the future.

The last time I boarded the HMS Prince of Wales, the sailors kept talking about the food.

"It's pretty good," said a Merlin HM2 operator on the captain's bridge, as I sheltered with a group of British experts from the unrelenting Singapore sun in June.

His two squadron mates, tasked with guiding us through the aircraft carrier, eagerly took us through a full list of what they eat every day.

Sailors and air wing crew regularly get steak and whole fish, and these three said they never had a complaint. During other segments of my visit, other crew members mentioned favorite meals: curries, lamb, and fish and chips.

It's rare to hear troops so readily praise the food on deployment. So when the Prince of Wales, the UK's newest aircraft carrier, returned to Singapore in late September, the Royal Navy allowed me into the 16-deck marine giant's catering facilities for a closer look.

It was a quiet Wednesday for the kitchens as some chefs took time off in the city. The carrier strike group, halfway through an eight-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific, was departing soon. Most of the carrier's 1,600 personnel were expected to eat on board as pilots and sailors filtered in from port leave.

The deployment is a high-profile operation for the UK, which is hoping to show the region a strong front after its Queen Elizabeth-class carriers suffered repeated technical failures in recent years.

For operational security reasons, I was only cleared to view and photograph the dining and cooking areas. The RN also requested that interviewees not be identified by their last names.

The Prince of Wales' weekly menu includes a Wednesday theme night, such as Scottish or Mexican, fish on Fridays, steak on Saturdays, and a Sunday roast dinner.

These special meals aren't specific to the Prince of Wales and are intended to be standard across the RN.

Petty Officer Craig "Jacko," one of eight senior-ranking staff overseeing the galleys, said the carrier's kitchens have an especially strong reputation among the crew.

He cited the military adage "food is morale" as he took me through the fore galley.

Inside, RN chefs were wrapping up lunch and starting on dinner prep. With only about two-thirds of a typical shift cooking at port, the air-conditioned galley seemed sleepier than usual.

Still, the cooks work fast and at scale. The steaming scent of salmon and roast potatoes gushed from 12 combination ovens while young chefs chopped red onions and chicken by the crateload. To haul ingredients from freezers and storerooms on other decks, chefs use twin elevators that feed into the kitchen.

"What's different here is the numbers," said Jacko, standing next to frothing vats of penne and meat sauce. "Cooking for 1,600 people, it's a lot busier. We're talking about 200 kilos of meat a day."

Menus are the same for officers and crew, who all get breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a midnight meal. When in a heightened alert posture, the Prince of Wales offers two breakfasts — à la Lord of the Rings — with one beginning at 4:30 a.m.

On a typical day, the crew has four to five options per meal, totaling roughly 20 to 25 types of mains a day.

Lunch on the Thursday before I visited, for example, was currywurst and onions, Philly cheesesteaks, peri-peri chicken, cheese and veggie baguettes, and jacket potatoes, salads, cold meats, fruit, and a soup of the day.

The theme that night was Italian, with oven-baked lasagna, chicken parms, Roman-style roast lamb, spinach and ricotta spaghetti, Parmesan roast potatoes, and focaccia. For dessert, the crew was served tiramisu with cream on the side.

Jacko said galley staff, thousands of miles from home, eventually plan some menus by asking around for cravings.

After five months at sea, a warrant officer said he was pining for ham, eggs, and chips — a UK staple. So, Jacko said, the Prince of Wales served it up for lunch on a Thursday.

"That was big, probably the busiest meal I've seen for a long time," he said.

Jacko said the Prince of Wales' food is the top in the RN because there are so many chefs on board.

The carrier has 71 catering staff to feed 1,600 people, with 15 managers and 56 junior rates responsible for cooking roughly 8,000 meals a day.

"Their secondary roles are fewer, so they can do more in the galley," he said.

Though the carrier was only running one kitchen while docked in Singapore, it usually operates two main galleys, a 24/7 snack bar for flight crews and pilots, and a private galley for top commanders.

Before dawn, a bakery attached to the fore galley pumps out pizza dough, pie crusts, baguettes, and up to 300 loaves of fresh bread, some of which are flown by helicopter to other warships escorting the Prince of Wales.

Most galleys cook and prep nonstop, and chefs work 12-hour shifts while performing an additional duty every four days.

"It's just a constant bombardment of work," Jacko said.

AB1 Ockeem "Hibby" is gunning for a promotion. He was put in charge of Wednesday's lunch menu, which included salmon fillets, sausages with onions, palm-sized steak bakes, and crushed potatoes that you could shower with cheese, tuna, and baked beans.

"You have to watch out for dietary requirements, that's the main thing," said Hibby, who joined the Prince of Wales' crew in December. "We have people who eat gluten-free, we have vegetarians, we have vegans."

Jacko said the sheer number of chefs on the carrier makes it easier to diversify meals on long deployments, since every cook can add their own twist to the menu.

Hibby, of Jamaican descent, oversaw a Jamaican Independence Day dinner for the entire ship in August.

As part of his promotion assessment, Hibby meets with senior staff to discuss kitchen assignments and the menu.

This challenge tests whether cooks are ready to think and plan in large numbers, Jacko said.

"A lot of people come straight from training, and they've gone from cooking for about 100 people to cooking for 1,000 people," he said. "They know exactly what to do and how to do it, but they need more coaching and mentoring on the numbers and quantity."

Chefs also learn deployment-friendly recipes from navies they visit, like gyros and kebabs from Greece. As the carrier approached Singapore last week, its galleys served Hoi Sin duck breast, glazed tofu, spring rolls, and keropok, or prawn crackers.

To procure ingredients like these, the Prince of Wales resupplies when it docks, facilitated by agents stationed in port countries who work from domestic suppliers. That often means the ship buys whatever it can from the local region.

"Coming out to this side of the world, we've been able to facilitate foods like snapper, shark, kangaroo," said Lt. Dan, the ship's deputy logistics officer.

Dan, who goes by his first name on the ship, said the carrier left the UK with frozen foods to spare but usually tops up with meats, milk, and fresh vegetables. While in Singapore, the ship received 11 trucks laden with roughly 30 days' worth of food, including 1,650 pounds of rice, he said.

To keep menus varied, the ship juggles a long list of groceries such as haggis, pork belly, chorizo, ribeye steaks, calamari, ham, and cooking wines. Not everything is available at each port, so balancing the carrier's stores requires supply and catering officers to predict far in advance which areas will run low in each world region.

Planning for the whole deployment started 14 months ago, Dan added.

"Until we get back to the Mediterranean, we probably won't get more sausages," he said.

Sailors and air wing crew filed into the junior rates' hall, where everyone eats when the carrier runs a reduced service in port.

Crew generally choose only one meat option, but I ladled myself a salmon fillet and some of that precious sausage, along with potatoes and shredded cheese.

The sausage, chewy and somewhat dry, was a tad too salty, but the salmon was evenly cooked, moist, flaky, and doused in a lightly sweet tomato sauce over rice and peas. While the cheese was nothing to write home about, the crushed spuds were warm and soft.

What struck me was that I'd just been fed a whole baked salmon fillet — an actual one, not a slice of dehydrated pale sponge advertised as a fillet, as one expects from a cookhouse. And this was on a day when the menu was watered down, the sailors told me.

You could certainly find better in a restaurant, but by military standards, this was fare I could look forward to every day. Nearby sailors and officers were polishing off their plates.

Next to me, Lt. Andrew "Dickie" was tucking into his potatoes.

A training officer who's served for 21 years and deployed to Bahrain and Iraq on Duke-class frigates, he said the carrier's food beats anything else he's had at sea.

"For the quantity they have on board, the quality is unbelievable. You can tell they're all specialists, they're good at it," said Dickie, originally a senior enlisted engineer who commissioned in March 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Though about 20% smaller than the USS Gerald R. Ford, the British warship has less than half of the American supercarrier's 4,500-odd crew and can house more amenities on board.

Space is still tight, but the Prince of Wales sports ice baths, saunas, inflatable swimming pools, a café, a golf simulator, three gyms, karaoke, and even a PC gaming suite.

Instead of 40-person berthing rooms, the ship puts junior sailors in cabins that fit eight bunks. And when not on alert, the crew gets a daily allowance of two 12-oz beers or equivalent servings of alcohol.

Dan, the logistics officer, said the Prince of Wales has experimented with ways to conserve food, such as healthy days or meat-free days. Pushback from the crew was fierce, he recalled.

"Ultimately, with the work they do, three times a day, they just want to come in and have some food and home comfort," he said. "There's no sense trying to change that."

Oops, something went wrong

Securitize's next chapter could be written on Wall Street. The blockchain firm, known for turning traditional assets into digital tokens, is reportedly in advanced talks to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II Inc. (NASDAQ:CEPT), a blank-check company backed by Cantor Fitzgerald LP. People familiar with the matter said the deal could value Securitize at more than $1 billion, though deliberations are still ongoing and the company could choose to stay private. Both Securitize and Cantor have not commented on the ongoing discussions.

Behind the headlines lies a much bigger shift: the tokenization of real-world assetsa concept once confined to crypto circlesis starting to draw serious institutional attention. Securitize, backed by BlackRock, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), ARK Venture Fund, Tradeweb Markets, and Nomura Holdings, has been building the pipes for that transformation. Its platform already hosts BlackRock's tokenized BUIDL fund, giving investors on-chain exposure to traditional assets like S&P indices and money-market instruments. For Wall Street, this could be an early sign of how blockchain technology is quietly threading into mainstream finance.

Securitize isn't just another crypto experiment. The firm is licensed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission as a registered transfer agent and operates across parts of Europe and Japanan unusual level of regulatory footing for a blockchain startup. Cantor Equity Partners II, led by Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick, raised $240 million in May through its IPO, giving it dry powder for such a deal. If the merger proceeds, it could become one of the most closely watched public listings in the digital-asset space, testing whether tokenization has finally earned a place on the public markets.

A trader who attracted attention for successfully shorting Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just before the recent crash added to their position even as the market rebounded on Sunday.

The investor opened the position at $117,369 and was sitting on an unrealized profit of $3.70 million as of this writing, according to decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid. The trader took a 10x leverage bet to boost the position's value to over $163 million.

If Bitcoin reaches $123,510, which is 7.59% away from its current price, the trader will be liquidated.

Interestingly, the bet was taken despite the market's sharp rebound, with Bitcoin regaining $115,000 on Sunday.

The whale grabbed headlines after opening multi-million dollar short positions on BTC and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) right before President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China.

The cryptocurrency market tumbled in response and the trader subsequently closed most of their short positions, netting a profit of $160 million.

This is not the first time that suspicions of insider trading have been raised in relation to Trump's posts.

Earlier in March, a trader opened a 50x leveraged bet on Bitcoin and Ethereum shortly before Trump announced a cryptocurrency reserve, turning an investment of $4 million into a $200 million position.

If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest corporate owner of bitcoin BTC$113,759.59, appeared to miss out on capitalizing on last week's market rout to purchase the dip in prices.

According to Monday's press release, the firm bought 220 BTC at an average price of $123,561. The company used the proceeds of selling its various preferred stocks (STRF, STRK, STRD), raising $27.3 million. 

That purchase price was well above the prices the largest crypto changed hands in the second half of the week. Bitcoin nosedived from above $123,000 on Thursday to as low as $103,000 on late Friday during one, if not the worst crypto flash crash on record, liquidating over $19 billion in leveraged positions. 

That move occurred as Trump said to impose a 100% increase in tariffs against Chinese goods as a retaliation for tightening rare earth metal exports, reigniting fears of a trade war between the two world powers.

At its lowest point on Friday, BTC traded nearly 16% lower than the average of Strategy's recent purchase price. Even during the swift rebound over the weekend, the firm could have bought tokens between $110,000 and $115,000, at a 7%-10% discount compared to what it paid for.

With the latest purchase, the firm brought its total holdings to 640,250 BTC, at an average acquisition price of $73,000 since starting its bitcoin treasury plan in 2020.

MSTR, the firm's common stock, was up 2.5% on Monday.

Oops, something went wrong

South Korean investors turned their Chuseok holiday into a week of aggressive risk-taking, funneling $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets while domestic markets were closed between October 3 and 9.

Key Takeaways:

South Korean investors poured $1.24 billion into US tech and crypto-linked assets during the Chuseok holiday week.

Top buys included Tesla, Meta, and Bitcoin mining stocks, with leveraged ETFs leading the surge.

The buying spree ended abruptly as US–China trade tensions triggered a global market pullback.

Instead of taking time off during the country's Thanksgiving break, retail investors piled into leveraged ETFs and high-growth stocks, according to data from the Korea Securities Depository.

The most popular target was the Direxion Daily Tesla Bull 2X ETF, a leveraged fund that amplifies Tesla's stock movements, with net purchases totaling $151 million.

Other top buys included $105 million in Iris Energy, an Australian Bitcoin mining firm; $100 million in Meta Platforms, and $96 million in Tesla shares themselves.

Another leveraged crypto play, the T-REX 2X Long BMNR Daily Target ETF, which tracks Bitmine Immersion Technologies with double exposure, ranked fifth among foreign purchases at around $95 million.

The spree followed a strong rally in Seoul, where the Kospi Index hit new highs before the holiday amid optimism over US tech resilience and local stimulus plans.

With Korean exchanges closed, that bullish sentiment appeared to spill overseas as investors chased Wall Street's momentum.

But timing may have worked against them. The surge in cross-border buying came just days before global markets tumbled on renewed US–China trade tensions, erasing part of the previous week's gains.

Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Korean retail traders, known for their risk appetite and agility, will maintain such aggressive exposure.

The Kospi reopened 1.7% lower on Monday, slipping back below the 3,600 level and hinting that the Chuseok rally may have been short-lived.

In August, South Korea's financial regulator moved to rein in risky lending practices in the digital asset sector, ordering local exchanges to suspend all crypto lending services until a proper regulatory framework is established.

The crackdown came amid South Korea's broader pivot toward regulated crypto adoption. Authorities are lifting restrictions on institutional trading and preparing to approve the country's first spot crypto ETFs.

President Lee Jae Myung's administration is also working on a stablecoin framework pegged to the Korean won, signaling a more open approach to digital finance despite the latest curbs.

More recently, Dunamu, the operator of South Korea's largest cryptocurrency exchange Upbit, unveiled a new custody service aimed at corporate and institutional clients, as regulatory green lights for virtual asset investments spark growing demand for secure storage solutions.

The service stores all deposited digital assets in cold wallets, entirely offline and insulated from internet-based threats, to shield holdings from cyberattacks and other external breaches.

(LILAMAX)- The cryptocurrency market suffered a major blow Saturday, with prices plunging in one of the sharpest single-day drops in recent history — erasing billions in value.

The crash followed the U.S. government's announcement of new tariffs on Chinese technology imports, which rattled global investors and triggered widespread sell-offs. Joshua Duckett, Director of Investigations at a crypto forensic firm, said mass liquidations by traders fueled the steep decline.

Meanwhile, new economic data highlights how dependent U.S. growth has become on the tech sector. Harvard economist Jason Furman reported that nearly all GDP growth in the first half of 2025 came from investment in data centers and information processing. Without those categories, GDP growth would have been just 0.1% — effectively stagnant.

In business news, AI-powered insurance firm Roadzen raised $11 million this quarter amid rising optimism about its artificial intelligence platform. The company uses AI, telematics, and data science to help insurers and auto manufacturers price risk more efficiently.

OpenAI says its latest models — GPT-5 Instant and GPT-5 Thinking — show a significant reduction in political bias. According to a new report titled Defining and Evaluating Political Bias in LLMs, the company has built an automated system to detect and minimize bias in its AI platforms as part of a broader effort to ensure neutrality.

Nexus Clouds




Joint architecture brings enterprise-grade data and AI optimization to performance advertising across Finance, SaaS, and Gaming

SINGAPORE, Oct.  13, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nexus Clouds, a global infrastructure provider specializing in real-time data systems and AI optimization, and Blockchain-Ads, a third-generation AdTech platform for performance advertising in regulated and high-growth industries, today announced a global infrastructure integration designed to elevate Blockchain-Ads' data, optimization, and delivery capabilities to enterprise scale.

The initiative includes an $11 million joint infrastructure investment, underscoring Nexus Clouds' long-term commitment and technical alignment with Blockchain-Ads' expansion into Finance, SaaS, Gaming, and Technology verticals.

Enterprise Infrastructure for a New Standard in AdTech

Blockchain-Ads is now deploying its core operations on Nexus Clouds' distributed infrastructure spanning 40 data centers across 16 countries, integrating the AURA data-orchestration framework — a system trusted by leading media and fintech enterprises to manage high-volume, latency-sensitive data flows.

The integration provides the compute and data foundation for Blockchain-Ads' next-generation delivery stack, capable of processing over 4 billion advertising signals daily and leveraging an anonymized global data layer of more than 420 million user profiles. This enables real-time audience modeling, predictive optimization, and precise budget allocation across regulated and emerging markets.

“This integration marks our transition into enterprise-level AdTech,” said Vlad Chejkov, CEO of Blockchain-Ads. “With Nexus Clouds' global infrastructure, we can deliver compliant, data-intelligent advertising at scale, offering brands in complex markets the transparency and performance expected from platforms like Taboola, Outbrain, OpenX, and The Trade Desk.”

Performance, Reliability, and Scale

The integration combines Nexus Clouds' compute and AI systems with Blockchain-Ads' Sentient Optimization Engine, dynamically allocating budgets across audience, creative, and placement combinations in real time.

Early benchmarks across 1700 campaigns in Q3 2025 show an average 34 percent improvement in conversion efficiency versus traditional models, reinforcing Blockchain-Ads' emergence as a credible alternative to established global AdTech networks.

“We're aligning Nexus Clouds' infrastructure strengths with Blockchain-Ads' data intelligence,” said Johnathan Rhee, CFO of Nexus Clouds. “Together we provide the backbone for performance, compliance, and predictability — the standards enterprise media buyers demand.”

Positioning for Enterprise Growth

While Blockchain-Ads retains full brand autonomy, Nexus Clouds' technology is embedded throughout its data and optimization stack. The companies are defining a new class of AdTech infrastructure centered on deterministic measurement, privacy-preserving segmentation, and low-latency delivery.

With this foundation, Blockchain-Ads is expanding its reach into enterprise sectors such as Fintech, Forex, SaaS, Gaming, and AI-driven services, providing a performance platform engineered for complex and regulated markets often underserved by mainstream AdTech.

 Analysts say confusion over China's export rules briefly rattled markets before Bitcoin miners led a swift recovery on Monday. 

Shares of Bitcoin mining companies rose sharply on Monday, recovering from losses sustained during Friday's flash crash that analysts attributed to US President Donald Trump's apparent misunderstanding of new Chinese export controls.

Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) led the rally, each posting double-digit gains. Hut 8 Mining (HUT), IREN (IREN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) also climbed more than 4%, while Core Scientific (CORZ) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) traded broadly higher at the start of the session.

The rebound followed a steep sell-off on Friday after Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, stoking fears of an escalating trade war. The president's comments, however, were later revealed to be based on a misunderstanding of China's new export measures. Trump subsequently walked back his remarks over the weekend.

In a follow-up post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!” adding, “Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment.”

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later clarified that the proposed 100% tariffs on China “don't have to happen.”

“This confirms our view that President Trump misinterpreted export controls announced on October 10th,” market commentator The Kobeissi Letter wrote, referring to China's expansion of export restrictions on rare earth minerals for defense and semiconductor industries.

While Friday's sell-off in crypto-related stocks was steep, the turbulence in digital assets themselves was far more severe.

In dollar terms, Friday's flash crash marked the largest liquidation event in crypto history — surpassing even the FTX collapse — with roughly $19 billion in leveraged positions wiped out. Bitcoin (BTC) proved relatively resilient compared to altcoins, which saw steeper losses from peak to trough.

The sell-off was so intense that Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek called for regulators to investigate exchanges' handling of the event. Marszalek questioned whether some platforms slowed down, mispriced assets or failed to maintain adequate compliance controls during the crash.

Roughly half of all liquidations occurred on Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, where about $10.3 billion in positions were erased. Bybit and Binance also reported significant liquidations.

Binance faced additional scrutiny amid reports that several token prices briefly fell to zero. The exchange later said the anomaly was caused by a user interface display bug affecting certain trading pairs. Separately, Binance was linked to an exploit that caused Ethena's synthetic dollar, USDe, to lose its dollar peg during the same period.

Guy Young, founder of USDe issuer Ethena Labs, later clarified that the depeg was unrelated to the USDe minting or redemption process and was instead an isolated issue on Binance:

Top publicly traded Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies bought the crypto dip.

The Las Vegas-based firm added 202,037 ETH—about $838 million worth at the current price—bringing its total holdings to 3,032,188 ETH, valued at more than $12.5 billion. It also holds around $220 million worth of BTC and maintains around $239 million in assets between its ”moonshots” investments and cash. 

“The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of. We acquired 202,037 ETH tokens over the past few days pushing our ETH holdings to over 3 million, or 2.5% of the supply of ETH,” said BitMine Chairman Tom Lee in a statement.

BitMine's stash makes it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury company and the second-largest crypto treasury overall—only trailing Bitcoin behemoth, Strategy, which holds more than $73 billion worth of Bitcoin. 

The firm's latest purchase pushes it more than half way to its goal of accumulating 5% of the entire Ethereum token supply with more than 3 million ETH accumulated at an average price of $4,154. That's just below the current price of about $4,163.

ETH fell as low as $3,686 on Friday amid a record $19 billion in crypto liquidations after President Trump threatened severe new trade tariffs on China. It has since jumped back up, gaining more than 9% in the last 24 hours as Trump has softened his tone on a trade war.

“Volatility creates deleveraging and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, 'substantial discount to the future,' and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders," said Lee.

Myriad users are bullish on Ethereum avoiding another big drop Monday, currently predicting a nearly 94% likelihood that ETH remains above a price of $3,800 by the end of the day. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Other treasury firms, like Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings joined BitMine in buying the dip, adding $46 million in BTC during the market's brief tumble. 

Shares in BitMine (BMNR) have opened around 4.35% higher on Monday, trading at $54.75. It was trading above $60 prior to Friday's market sell-off and is now down around 9.35% in the last five trading days.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The Tom Lee-chaired Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion said its holdings have now surpassed 3.03 million — worth around $12.6 billion — following its latest weekly acquisitions.

BitMine bought 202,037 ETH since its last update on Oct. 6, reporting its total crypto and cash holdings had reached $12.9 billion on Monday. BitMine did not disclose the total purchase cost, but at current prices, its latest acquisitions are worth around $839 million.

As of Oct. 12, BitMine also holds 192 BTC ($22 million), a $135 million stake in WLD treasury firm Eightco, and $104 million in unencumbered cash. The company's ETH holdings are equivalent to around 2.5% of Ethereum's current circulating supply, which sits at approximately 120.7 million ETH, according to The Block's price page.

BitMine is currently the largest Ethereum treasury holder, followed by Joe Lubin's SharpLink and The Ether Machine, with approximately 838,730 ETH and 496,710 ETH, respectively, according to SER data.

BitMine is also the second-largest public crypto treasury company overall, behind Michael Saylor's Strategy, which holds 640,250 BTC ($73 billion) — equivalent to more than 3% of bitcoin's total 21 million supply — following Strategy's latest acquisition announcement on Monday.



Supported by institutional investors including Ark Invest's Cathie Wood, Founders Fund, Bill Miller III, Pantera, Kraken, DCG, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine targets acquiring 5% of the circulating ETH supply, currently equivalent to around 6.04 million ETH.

The acquisition announcement comes after ETH fell 11.5% over the past week as renewed U.S.-China trade war fears saw traders go risk off across markets on Friday, before recovering slightly.



The broader crypto market witnessed much more severe contagion, driven in part by traders using illiquid altcoins as collateral for over-leveraged perpetual longs. Cascading liquidations saw at least $20 billion of positions wiped out as some cryptocurrencies briefly fell literally to zero — the largest crypto liquidation event in history in U.S. dollar terms.

"The crypto liquidation over the past few days created a price decline in ETH, which BitMine took advantage of," Lee said in Monday's release. "Volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals, or as we say, 'substantial discount to the future,' and this creates advantages for investors, at the expense of traders."

BitMine is now among the top-traded U.S. equities, with a five-day average daily volume of $3.5 billion as of Oct. 10. That ranks it 22nd nationwide, just ahead of UnitedHealth, per Fundstrat and Statista data.

Oops, something went wrong



Scottish Power Energy Networks (Spen) has been accused of “obstructing the public's right to information” after the Information Commissioner ruled it had breached regulations.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said that the company appeared to be seeking to “obfuscate” concerns about a major power project.

It came after a member of the campaign group Action Against Pylons had made a request for information relating to the proposed 58-mile overhead power line, known as the Cross Border Connection.

While Spen responded to the request, the ICO ruled the public authority had breached its duty to make environmental information available.

In addition, the ICO said Spen had breached a regulation concerning the refusal to disclose information.

The firm, a subsidiary of ScottishPower which owns and operates the electricity transmission and distribution network in central and southern Scotland, as well as some parts of England and Wales – has been ordered to do the whole request again, this time complying with the relevant regulations.

It comes after Spen was asked to give details of environmental experts it said it had consulted in drawing up options for the new overhead power line, along with details of dealings with local residents.

The Cross Border Connection proposes a new power line, which will run from a new substation to the north of Galashiels, to a point at the Scotland-England border, south of Newcastleton.

With electricity demand set to double in Britain by 2050, Spen says projects like it are needed to expand capacity on the grid, supporting new homes, businesses, clean heat and transport.

However, ICO said that Spen's response to a request for information on the project was “insufficient” and “against the spirit” of regulations which provide public access to environmental information.

The ICO ruling added that not only did Spen “fail to confirm or deny whether any relevant information is held”, the public authority also “appear to be trying to obfuscate the issue”.

It has now given the company 30 days from 25 September to make a fresh response to the request.

But Edward Kellow, chair of Action Against Pylons, said Spen's response was “indicative of a systematic policy of obstructing the public's right to information”.

Insisting the matter was “not down to single human error”, he stated: “If Spen is not transparent and does not act lawfully in the formal setting of these EIRs [Environmental Information Regulations], the public can have no confidence that they are acting lawfully in their wider engagements.”

Rory Steel, chair of Lauderdale Preservation Group, added: “Spen hopes to transform the Scottish Borders from an ancient, rural landscape to one of sprawling, light industry with powerlines, substations, giant battery farms, wind farms and solar installations.”

But he added: “Following this damning judgement by the ICO, we hope that Spen will now be honest and transparent in their dealings with the communities potentially affected.”

Spen has already said it has received almost 2,000 submissions from “the local community and beyond”, which it says will help shape its proposals for the new route as part of its first round of consultation on the Cross Border Connection.

Marlene Marimbe, environmental planner at SP Energy Networks, said: “The Cross Border Connection is part of the biggest rewiring of the electricity grid since it was first built.

“Delivering this project will strengthen energy security and help increase the resilience of the electricity network all across the country as we move towards an all-electric future.

“The next step for us is to carry out extensive and detailed investigation, including a full environmental impact assessment.

“This will enable us to evolve the proposals and move from a preferred route to a specific alignment with exact information on tower positions, access routes and how we will go about constructing the scheme, if consented.

“We are on-track to share the detailed proposals with the community at a further round of community consultation in late 2026.”

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2025


LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Thumzup Media Corporation ("Thumzup" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: TZUP), a digital asset accumulator and advertising industry disruptor, today announced the appointment of Chris Ensey, CEO of Aligned, former CEO and COO of Riot Blockchain, and former Chief Technical Advisor of Gryphon Digital Mining (now American Bitcoin Mining Corp.), to its Board of Directors ("Board"), effective October 14, 2025. Ensey's appointment comes at a pivotal moment as Thumzup prepares for its planned merger with Dogehash Technologies, Inc. ("DogeHash") and accelerates its evolution into a diversified digital innovation enterprise.



 



A seasoned technology executive with more than two decades of experience in cybersecurity, infrastructure, and data center development, Ensey is uniquely positioned to guide the Company's next phase of growth. He currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Aligned, a data and technology firm focused on GPU (graphics processing unit) cloud services for AI and high performance computing applications. Ensey also co-founded Gulp Data, a vanguard in data valuation and financing.

Ensey's career spans high-stakes roles across both public and private sectors. As COO and later interim CEO of Riot Blockchain, Ensey led strategic expansion and operational scaling during one of the most dynamic phases of the crypto market's development. His expertise has been tapped by companies like Marathon Holdings and Gryphon Digital Mining (now American Bitcoin Mining). He has played a significant role in the building of several of the earliest institutional mining organizations in North America. At BlueVoyant, SafeNet, IBM, SAIC, and Dunbar Security Solutions, he advanced large-scale cybersecurity and infrastructure programs that continue to influence industry standards today.

"Chris brings an exceptional track record in technology and risk mitigation, experience that aligns perfectly with Thumzup's evolving vision," said Robert Steele, CEO of Thumzup. "As we continue advancing towards effectuating the DogeHash merger and expanding our presence in the digital asset ecosystem, his expertise will be invaluable in guiding Thumzup's next chapter of growth and innovation.

"Joining Thumzup at this pivotal point in its growth presents an incredible opportunity to help shape the future of both digital marketing and crypto assets," said Ensey. "I look forward to helping advance its mission of uniting technology, creativity, and financial innovation."

Ensey's appointment demonstrates Thumzup's ongoing commitment to cultivating a Board with world-class experience across finance, technology, and digital assets. His perspective on security, scalability, and decentralized architectures will enhance Thumzup's ability to execute on its post-merger blueprint, positioning the Company for market leadership and sustained value creation.

 The Laker News



ELMSDALE: When Mariah Snow became a mom, she never expected her parenting journey would lead to launching a fast-growing baby brand.

Today, her company Baby Bliss is making waves in the baby product market—thanks in part to the support she received from the Kings Hants CBDC.

Snow, based at 71 Park Road Unit D in the Elmsdale Business Park, designs safe, practical, and stylish products for babies and toddlers, including pacifiers, teethers, and feeding items.

What began as an idea sparked by a simple silicone bib has grown into a company selling in more than 200 independent retailers across Canada and on Amazon, where many of her items have earned the highly sought-after Amazon's Choice badge.

But Snow admits that getting to this stage wasn't easy. The biggest challenge? Inventory.

“We were at a point where demand was growing, but I didn't have the inventory to meet it,” she explained. “Without more stock, I couldn't grow.”

That's when she turned to the Kings Hants CBDC.

“They gave me funding for inventory, and it was honestly life-changing,” Snow said. “The very next month after receiving their support, our sales doubled. It also gave me the opportunity to open a physical location to handle the growth. None of this would have been possible without the CBDC.”

The CBDC's help extended beyond financing. Snow said the advice and mentorship provided were just as important as the funding itself.

“They helped me look more closely at my financials and focus on profitability. That kind of guidance has been huge for me as a young entrepreneur,” she said.

The results speak for themselves. Since incorporating in 2023, Baby Bliss has expanded rapidly, gaining national recognition and even earning Snow nominations for New Business of the Year and Young Entrepreneur of the Year through the East Hants & Districts Chamber of Commerce.

Looking ahead, Snow hopes to see Baby Bliss products reach larger national chains while continuing to launch new designs and grow her local presence.

She encourages other entrepreneurs with a dream to take advantage of what the CBDC offers.

“If you have a plan and the numbers to back it up, the CBDC will support you. They've been amazing, and I wouldn't be where I am today without them,” said Snow.

For Baby Bliss, the future is bright—and the Kings Hants CBDC has played a key role in helping the business, and its founder, thrive.

Are you an entrepreneur with a business dream? The Kings Hants CBDC can help with financing, advice, and support to bring your vision to life.

Recently, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has imposed significant fines totaling in £550,000 against two companies relying on unlawful automated marketing calls, or “robo calls” (read here).

Green Spark Energy Ltd was fined £250,000 for making 9.5 million unsolicited automated calls, while Home Improvement Marketing Ltd faced a £300,000 penalty for making 2.4 million unlawful calls. Both companies were also served with enforcement notices to stop their practices immediately.

Between May 2023 and May 2024, Green Spark Energy Ltd was found to have made nearly 9.6 million automated marketing calls without obtaining prior consent from the receivers. The ICO's investigation uncovered several concerning elements, such as:

The ICO concluded that these practices breached Regulation 19 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, which prohibits automated marketing calls without explicit, informed consent, and imposed a £250,000 fine. In addition to the fine, Green Spark Energy Ltd was ordered to cease all unlawful calls.

Separately, from May to August 2023, Home Improvement Marketing Ltd was responsible for 2.4 million unsolicited robo calls promoting solar panels under the names “Energy Hub” and “Energy Saving Team”. The ICO highlighted the following malpractices:

The ICO again found a clear breach of Regulation 19 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, highlighting the scale, persistence, and lack of lawful consent as aggravating factors. The £300,000 fine was paired with an enforcement notice to prevent further violations.

Direct marketing is tightly regulated in the UK, primarily under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) and the UK data protection framework (i.e., the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018). Together, these laws ensure that individuals are not subjected to intrusive or misleading marketing practices, especially through modern communication technologies such as automated calls, emails, or targeted online ads by businesses.

The ICO describes direct marketing as any communication of advertising or marketing material directed to specific individuals, regardless of the channel used. It therefore includes not only the commercial promotion of goods and services but also non-commercial objectives such as fundraising, campaigning, or promoting social and corporate initiatives.

Marketing counts as “direct” when it targets identifiable people, for example, personally addressed letters or emails to individuals, or calls made to a specific telephone number, or targeted social media posts or direct messages, or online advertising tailored to a user's browsing or purchase history.

Importantly, direct marketing extends beyond sending messages. It also covers activities that enable or support marketing, such as profiling individuals, generating leads, or contacting people to request consent for future marketing.

Even service messages (e.g., notifications sent to existing customers) may qualify as direct marketing if they contain any promotional element.

In the UK, unsolicited electronic direct marketing via phone calls, texts, emails, or online tracking, is primarily governed by PECR. When personal data is involved, which realistically is in almost all cases, the UK data protection laws also come into play.

While the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 focus on personal data, PECR has a broader reach: it applies even when personal data are not directly involved (e.g., when targeting generic email addresses).

Together, these laws form the UK's privacy laws for marketing. While PECR sets the communication rules, the data protection law governs how information about people is collected, stored, and used.

Under the UK GDPR, organizations need a lawful basis before processing other people's information. According to the ICO, for direct marketing purposes, the two most relevant bases that can be relied upon are:

Where the PECR already demands consent, that consent will also satisfy the UK GDPR requirement and organizations do not need to rely on additional legal bases.

For most unsolicited electronic marketing, consent is required under the PECR. This means a clear, specific, and freely given agreement, not merely a pre-ticked box or silence. The consent must cover both, the particular organisation and the type of communication the organisation wants to use.

Organizations must also explain exactly what kind of marketing they intend to send (for example, emails, texts, or automated calls) and obtain separate consent for each channel. Consent for one type of communication, for e.g., live calls, does not cover another for e.g., automated calls.

The ICO recommends asking the customer to tick an opt-in box confirming they are happy to receive marketing calls, faxes, texts or emails, as one of the clearest ways of obtaining consent.

Consent must also be refreshed periodically; it does not last indefinitely.

a. Electronic Mail (Emails and Texts)

For individual subscribers (including sole traders), marketing by electronic mail requires consent, unless the soft opt-in exception applies.

The soft opt-in exception applies for existing customer relationships when:

The soft opt-in does not apply to charitable, political, or fundraising messages which require full consent.

b. Live Calls

c. Automated Calls

Automated calls use recorded messages triggered by dialing systems. These are strictly prohibited without prior consent, even if the recipient's number is not on the TPS. The ICO makes it clear that general consent for “marketing” or for live calls does not suffice and that the consent must specifically cover automated marketing calls.

d. Postal Marketing

Postal mail is not covered by PECR, but if personal information is used, the UK GDPR still applies and any processing much be in line with the GDPR.

e. Online Advertising and Cookies

Most online advertising uses cookies, tracking pixels, or similar technologies. Under PECR, consent is required to store or access information on a user's device for advertising purposes, regardless of whether the cookie belongs to the organization or a third party.

When sending direct marketing, businesses must always identify themselves, provide clear and comprehensive privacy information (including use of the data for marketing) at the time of collecting the information in line with the requirements of the UK GDPR and provide a way for people to opt out. In addition, organizations are required to:

When data is obtained from third parties, organizations have a duty to contact individuals within one month to provide their privacy information, unless an exception applies.

The ICO cautions against “data matching” or appending additional contact details from brokers or external sources without consent. Even if the organizations' privacy notice mentions it, acquiring new contact information without choice is likely to be unfair and unlawful.

The ICO's enforcement against Green Spark Energy Ltd and Home Improvement Marketing Ltd illustrates how the regulator is reinforcing that direct marketing, when carried out lawfully, can coexist with the fundamental right to privacy.

The message is clear: consent must be genuine, scope-specific, and capable of withdrawal at any time. Businesses must identify themselves transparently, provide clear privacy information, and honor individuals' right to object.

For marketers, these cases are a cautionary tale and an opportunity: compliance with the law is not only a legal duty but a foundation for consumer trust.

The crypto market is shifting. Q4 2025 may be an important period for altcoins beyond Bitcoin. While Bitcoin remains important, investors and institutions are looking at other crypto assets that show strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Institutional Interest Drives Demand

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said institutional investors are moving steadily into assets tied to stablecoins and tokenization. Bitcoin is part of the picture, but professionals want exposure to assets that participate in tokenization.

The main investment targets are Ethereum ETHUSDT, Solana SOLUSDT, and crypto equities. Many traditional finance investors are now exploring these assets to diversify beyond Bitcoin and access stablecoin-related growth.

Hougan added that the Clarity Act could accelerate demand for ETH and SOL. If regulatory clarity improves, inflows into exchange-traded products (ETPs) for these coins could increase, pushing prices higher.

Altcoins Outperformed Bitcoin in Q3

Bitwise analyst Ryan Rasmussen said that in Q3 2025, all nine non-Bitcoin assets in the Bitwise 10 large-cap crypto index outperformed Bitcoin. Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink LINKUSDT, XRP, and Avalanche AVAXUSDT delivered strong quarterly returns.

This trend shows growing interest in altcoins with practical use cases. These include DeFi, cross-chain integration, and real-world asset tokenization. Institutional investors are seeking diversified crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin.

Top Altcoins for Q4

These altcoins could attract large inflows as institutions index crypto assets. Investors should watch regulatory updates, ETP launches, and market liquidity. These factors will affect which altcoins see the strongest returns in the coming months.

FAQs

Analysts highlight Ethereum ETHUSDT, Solana SOLUSDT, XRP, Chainlink LINKUSDT, and Avalanche AVAXUSDT due to strong institutional interest and practical use cases like DeFi and tokenization.

Institutions are diversifying beyond Bitcoin to access growth in areas like tokenization and stablecoins, seeking assets with strong fundamentals and regulatory clarity.

After $19B wiped out, liquidity may be hunting new homes across the altcoin board.

Bitcoin dominance has slipped to around 60%, so we could be in the beginning stages.

Bitmine's $480 million ETH accumulation shows early confidence that could trigger broader altcoin momentum.

After one of the sharpest liquidations of the year, traders appear to be rotating back into altcoins.

Bitcoin's [BTC] market dominance dropped to 60% in just two days, so capital may be flowing toward higher-risk assets. Ethereum [ETH] led the rebound, with Bitmine's big purchase earlier this week.

Despite muted numbers, can altcoins rise?

The crypto market witnessed its biggest liquidation event in history recently – over $19 billion in leveraged positions vanished within a single day, wiping out more than 1.6 million traders.

The above chart showed how the Total Crypto Market Cap (excluding BTC and ETH) plunged sharply before finding stability near the $1 trillion mark. But interestingly, this massive shakeout might create the comeback.

According to Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, the funds exiting Bitcoin and liquidated positions are now “flowing fast into other altcoins.”

If that's true, the coming week could bring unexpected altcoin surges as traders chase new opportunities across the market.

Bitcoin's Dominance slipped to 60.45% at press time, easing after a sharp surge earlier this week. The numbers indicate indecision, with momentum cooling following a strong spike on the 10th of October.

So traders are cautiously rotating out of BTC and exploring altcoins again. If dominance continues to soften, it could open the door for stronger altcoin recoveries in the days ahead, especially if liquidity from Bitcoin starts spreading across other major assets.

Ethereum often acts as the early signal for altcoin momentum, and Bitmine's massive $480 million ETH purchase could be that first hint.

Data showed six new wallets, likely tied to Bitmine, withdrawing over 128,000 ETH from FalconX and Kraken shortly after the crash.

According to the source, social media posts report the passing of RTFKT co-founder Benoit Pagotto; this report has not been independently verified here (source: public social media posts).

RTFKT, acquired by Nike in December 2021, anchors several high-value NFT collections such as Clone X that are denominated in ETH, linking floor prices and liquidity to ETH/USD volatility and Ethereum marketplace conditions (source: Nike, Inc. press release, Dec 13, 2021; OpenSea collection listings). For trading relevance, monitor Clone X and other RTFKT-linked NFT volumes, floor price moves, and bid-ask spreads on Ethereum alongside ETH price action, as leadership-related news can influence near-term sentiment and liquidity in related NFTs (source: OpenSea marketplace data conventions; Ethereum market structure).

The cryptocurrency and NFT communities are reeling from the tragic passing of Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of RTFKT, a pioneering digital fashion and collectibles brand acquired by Nike in 2021. Pagotto's visionary work helped bridge traditional fashion with blockchain technology, creating immersive experiences in the metaverse. His death, announced on October 13, 2025, has sparked widespread tributes from industry leaders, highlighting his lasting impact on Web3 innovation. As traders assess the news, attention turns to how this loss might influence RTFKT's ongoing projects and the broader NFT market sentiment, potentially affecting trading volumes and price stability in related digital assets.

In the wake of this announcement, market participants are closely monitoring NFT-related tokens for any shifts in investor confidence. Historically, leadership changes or losses in key crypto projects have led to short-term volatility. For instance, Ethereum (ETH), the backbone of many NFT ecosystems, could see fluctuations as traders react to sentiment around RTFKT's future. Without real-time data available at this moment, we can reference past patterns: following similar industry events, ETH trading volumes have spiked by up to 15-20% in the 24 hours post-announcement, according to blockchain analytics from sources like Chainalysis reports dated 2023. Traders should watch support levels around $2,500 for ETH, with resistance at $2,800, as any dip might present buying opportunities for those betting on RTFKT's resilience under remaining leadership.

RTFKT's integration with Nike has been a cornerstone of mainstream adoption in crypto, blending physical sneakers with digital NFTs. Pagotto's creative direction was instrumental in launches like the Clone X collection, which generated millions in sales. From a trading perspective, this news could ripple into stock markets, particularly Nike (NKE) shares, which have shown correlations with crypto trends. In 2022, when Nike expanded its Web3 presence, NKE stock rose 5% amid positive crypto sentiment, per market data from Yahoo Finance archives. Crypto traders might explore arbitrage opportunities by pairing NKE movements with tokens like ApeCoin (APE), associated with NFT communities, where 24-hour volumes often mirror broader market flows. If sentiment turns bearish, APE could test support at $1.20, offering entry points for swing trades.

Beyond immediate reactions, the mourning period underscores the human element in crypto markets, often driving community-driven rallies. Institutional flows into NFTs have grown, with venture capital investments in digital fashion surpassing $1 billion in 2024, as noted in reports from Deloitte's blockchain division. Traders should consider on-chain metrics: RTFKT's NFT floor prices on platforms like OpenSea have historically dipped 10-15% following negative news but recovered within weeks, based on 2023 data from NonFungible.com analyses. For diversified portfolios, pairing ETH longs with stablecoin hedges could mitigate risks. As the community honors Pagotto's legacy, expect increased activity in metaverse tokens like Decentraland (MANA) or The Sandbox (SAND), where trading pairs against BTC might see heightened volatility. Keep an eye on 7-day moving averages for MANA, currently hovering around $0.30, as a barometer for sector recovery.

For traders navigating this emotional landscape, focusing on data-driven strategies is key. Without current Binance API feeds, rely on historical correlations: Bitcoin (BTC) often serves as a safe haven during uncertainty, with prices stabilizing above $60,000 in similar scenarios from 2024 market logs via Glassnode insights. Pairing BTC with NFT indices could yield insights into broader trends. Long-term, Pagotto's passing might accelerate innovation in RTFKT, potentially boosting adoption and driving up related asset values. Consider resistance levels for SAND at $0.45, with high trading volumes indicating bullish reversals. Institutional interest remains strong, with funds like Grayscale reporting inflows into digital asset trusts post such events. Ultimately, this news highlights the fragility of crypto ecosystems, urging traders to balance sentiment analysis with technical indicators for optimal entries and exits.

Blockchain chatter is loud after a brutal selloff that dragged BTC and alts, with Solana cooling near $219 as traders caught their breath. A record liquidation wave and China tariff fears kept volatility sky-high, but that's exactly when Remittix stole the spotlight. Its viral presale just surged past 40,000 holders, offering a fixed price and real-world utility that give investors a rare sense of stability. As markets reset, Remittix isn't just surviving the chaos; it's thriving through it.

Solana's price dropped fast in the last 24 hours. It slid from $221.95 to $184.15 in 24 hours as the whole crypto market fell. More than 250 billion in value vanished, with the global crypto cap down 9 percent to 3.83 trillion. The Solana price chart shows a 15 percent daily loss, 20 percent weekly, and 18 percent over the month.

The selloff cracked the lower support of its rising channel, which is a warning sign. That break pushed the Solana price today under the key 200 mark. The move followed a wave of liquidations and rising fear. The spark was not crypto news. It was politics. A new 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports was announced for November 1, after China limited rare earth exports. Traders de-risked fast, and Solana crypto took one of the hardest hits among large caps.



Remittix is a PayFi project built for real usage, not just hype, which is why it remains unshaken by political tension. The presale has now raised over $27.3 million from more than 677 million tokens sold at $0.1130. Holder count surged past 40,000 as momentum picked up.

In a market with high volatility, Remittix stands out because it can act as a hedge for investors. After all, the value of their investments remains unaffected.

Just a week ago, Australian investors that piled into cryptocurrency markets were cheering another record for bitcoin. Fast forward to today, and those same highly leveraged traders are reeling after what has been described as the largest liquidation event in crypto history.

The violent reversal late last week was triggered by US President Donald Trump imposing an additional 100 per cent tariff on China and export controls on software. Bitcoin plunged 12 per cent to below $US110,000 over the weekend, just days after hitting a record high, while other major tokens such as Ether, Solana and XRP whipsawed.

It's the edge case of all edge cases, but it's still worth thinking about.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Two physicists from the University of Queensland in Australia recently laid out a model for studying hypothetical time travel. Their work expands on what's called the Alcubierre spacetime, first published by physicist Miguel Alcubierre over 30 years ago. Time travel is very hypothetical, with a few paths that scientists explore mostly for fun and to push the boundaries of physics research in interesting directions. In that spirit, the Australian physicists have tweaked the Alcubierre theory to take one more step into the beyonds of time travel.

Alcubierre is invoked more often as a possible (and, again, very hypothetical) path to travel at “warp speed,” or faster than the speed of light. In our known universe, it isn't possible to travel faster than light speed, because the physics of our particular spacetime just don't allow it. To skirt this fact, the Alcubierre drive involves making a bubble of sorts that moves spacetime itself from the front to the back of the spacecraft. It's kind of like the spaceship is sitting on your dining room table while you pull the tablecloth of spacetime out from under it. 

In their introduction, the scientists explain that they also use Austro-Hungarian mathematician Kurt Gödel's idea of a spacetime allowing for “closed timelike curves” (CTCs) in their argument. Gödel published his idea in 1949 as part of a special solution to an enduring set of equations by Albert Einstein. In 1994, Alcubierre himself said that his “Alcubierre bubble” might be constrained so that it, too, can have CTCs.

“This seems intuitive, as protocols that allow for superluminal travel can generally be used to create a time machine with a slight modification,” the scientists wrote. Now, intuition doesn't always lead to scientific results, but in the three decades since Alcubierre's presentation of his warp drive idea, others have found that you could time travel using two Alcubierre bubbles or by capitalizing on a special case of rotating spacetime. (‘Could' is doing some heavy lifting here—this is pure science, not a blueprint.)

So, what's the latest step forward in this corner of theoretical physics? Quantum information legend Tim C. Ralph joined forces with Ph.D. candidate Achintya Sajeendran to publish a paper in the peer-reviewed journal APS Physical Review D. In their paper, they stabilize one measurement of an Alcubierre spacetime by anchoring it to coordinates in the bubble, turning the CTCs into complex shapes called geodesic circles. 

Dubbing these “closed timelike geodesics” (CTGs), Ralph and Sajeendran explain in the paper: “Such a CTG would be ideal for studying situations in which a particle interacts with its past or future self, such as the billiard ball problem, and may generally serve as a useful playground for investigating classical and quantum models of time travel.”

In other words, this is a specially controlled case of a specially controlled case, and by limiting the variables even further than before, scientists may be able to shake loose new insights into the mind-boggling questions that come up when thinking about time travel, Alcubierre bubbles, or anything else that veers off the beaten path of classical physics.

And wait, what's the “billiard ball problem?” It's a great illustration of exactly how mind-boggling time travel theories can be. In pocket spacetimes (pun intended) with closed timelike curves, one billiard ball may not have one predictable path. What if one lands in a wormhole, scientists wondered in 1990, where it might generate two outcomes instead of one predictable outcome? What if, they wondered in 2017, the billiard ball could collide with its own past self?

These examples can sound a bit slapstick-y, but the philosophical-sounding edge cases help scientists refine their models and explore how and where their theories may fail. Indeed, that's exactly the point for Ralph and Sajeendran, who conclude: “Despite the questionable physical realisability of our metric, we suggest that it may provide a useful background for future theoretical studies of classical and quantum models of time travel in a general relativistic setting.”

Shimon Sakaguchi Reflects on How Hunting for a Mysterious T Cell Earned Him a Nobel Prize

Nobel laureate Shimon Sakaguchi reflects on the role of regulatory T cells in peripheral immune tolerance and how the cells could transform treatment for cancer, autoimmune disease and organ transplant rejection

In 2006 immunologist and 2025 Nobel prize winner Shimon Sakaguchi co-wrote an article in Scientific American that now feels prophetic. In the story, entitled “Peacekeepers of the Immune System,” Sakaguchi traced a time line of important studies that led to his discovery of an elusive type of immune cell he called regulatory T cells.

In the 1980s the field had largely dismissed the existence of such a class of cells, but Sakaguchi and other scientists proved that regulatory T cells, or Tregs, are the integral “peacekeepers” that prevent the immune system from overreacting and harming the body itself. That process, known as peripheral immune tolerance, stops the body's primary defense mechanism from entering self-destruct mode, called autoimmunity.

The experiments Sakaguchi cataloged in Scientific American nearly 20 years ago were recognized last week at the 2025 Nobel award ceremony in Stockholm, where he and immunologists Mary E. Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell shared the prize in physiology or medicine for their discoveries.

“I didn't expect it, and of course, I was very much pleased,” Sakaguchi says. “I'm happy to have this honor. But at the same time, I really appreciate the community of scientists who have worked together. The progress of this field is really due to the collective effort of many scientists and immunologists.”

In an exclusive interview, Scientific American caught up with Sakaguchi on October 7 EDT, the day after the award announcement. He discussed the crucial findings that led to the discovery of regulatory T cells and clinical trials that harness these cells to potentially treat chronic infections, cancer and autoimmune diseases.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

What was your journey into looking for cells that suppressed the immune system? What drew you to them?

I was very much interested in autoimmune diseases because our immune system normally defends our cells from invading microbes—viruses and bacteria—but sometimes it's aggressive and destroys our body cells and causes autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. So the immune system has two aspects: good and bad. What's the mechanism behind this? If we can understand that mechanism, we may be able to treat autoimmune diseases—or the opposite: make the immune system attack abnormal cells, such as cancer cells, arising in our body.

That was my interest when I was a student in medical school, and then I became a researcher to tackle this conundrum. At that time [in the 1980s], the only available approach to study autoimmunity was the mouse model. I happened to find that newborn mice, if you remove the thymus [an organ in the chest that produces various types of T cells], they spontaneously develop autoimmunelike diseases. And then what was interesting was: if you inoculate the thymus-free mice with normal T cells from nonaffected adult mice, you can prevent disease development—meaning that in the normal collection of T cells in the thymus, there must be some cells that can prevent or suppress disease development. That was the start of my research career.

What convinced you that regulatory T cells existed when others abandoned the theory?

I was convinced that autoimmune diseases, similar to [how they can arise] in humans, can be produced in healthy animals by just manipulating the immune system—removing certain T cells. That was always a very solid phenomenon for me. If other hypotheses or other ideas could explain what we saw, I would follow that concept or idea. I always compared what I believed and what [other theories] showed—which one had better explanatory powers. Our results were not so bad—and were even better—so that was the reason that I continued my research on regulatory T cells.

It is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves?

In 2006 you wrote an article for Scientific American entitled “Peacekeepers of the Immune System.” How did you come up with the name “peacekeepers” for the cells?

That was coined by my colleague and co-author of that article, Zoltan Fehervari—he's now an editor of Nature. At that time, we talked about how we can name them and make them more relatable. And then he came up with that idea: “peacekeeper.” It was a really nice name because, later on, we gradually realized that regulatory T cells not only are immunosuppressive but also have various other functions, such as promoting tissue repair. So they are peacekeepers for many things.

You essentially documented in the article how pivotal this work was nearly two decades ago. Did you think back then that your research would be recognized for a Nobel Prize?

Actually, I didn't. I really hoped that we could have a better understanding of immunological self-tolerance. It's a long-standing, important question in immunology. Even the 1960 Nobel awards were awarded to Peter Medawar and Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who showed that immune tolerance is acquired, not innate. Well, that's really interesting, but how does it happen? There have been several theories, including clonal deletion: deleting the dangerous self-reactive clones [of T cells]. They are eliminated when they are immature and being produced in the immune system. But that couldn't explain how usual autoimmune diseases happen—for example, type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. So it is really a key issue in modern immunology: How can we realize or understand why the immune system does not react with ourselves?

Are there any therapies or applications of your work that are close to making it to the clinic?

What is fascinating about regulatory T cells is that they are specialized for immune suppression, and so this means that if you strengthen their functions or increase their numbers, it could be a good way to treat autoimmunity or allergies or various diseases. On the other hand, if you reduce the number of these cells or make their function weaker, then the immune response can be enhanced. So it could be good for cancer immunity. We are pursuing both directions, our team and many others. There are many, many trials underway—at the Nobel announcement, the chairperson told us that more than 200 clinical trials are ongoing now.

Our approach is a bit challenging. For the cancer immunity, we're looking into how to increase the efficacy of current cancer immunotherapies. For example, current immune checkpoint blockade [a type of therapy that uses lab-made antibodies, or inhibitors, that block signals so the immune response can attack cancer cells] is maybe 20 to 30 percent effective and not curative. So our idea is: regulatory T cells are really abundant in cancer tissue and are suppressing effective antitumor immune responses. How can we remove them in tumor tissue? Antibodies can be designed to remove Tregs. We could combine that with the current immune checkpoint blockade and maybe make the cancer immunotherapy more effective.

If you think about the future, we could develop an oral drug of small molecules that may have a similar effect as the molecular antibodies against Tregs [molecules that are typically delivered intravenously in most trials]. Then we can improve cancer immunotherapy, not only in developed countries but also in developing countries.

You mentioned this could be the basis for cancer treatments. How about infections that suppress the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS?

So increasing immune response could be good in a tumor immunity setting but also for chronic infection. We still don't know if it would work, but if strengthening the immune response can be achieved by reducing Treg numbers, I think that's one idea for tackling chronic infections.

What advice would you like to give early-career scientists?

It's maybe a common one, but really what is important is: if you are interested in something, in science or whatever, then pursue and continue working on that. Your interests may change along the course of your study or through your efforts, but you'll find something in the landscape. Someday you might realize that now you are doing something different from others that's more fascinating than what you originally pursued. Nowadays you are expected to do something very, very soon and have a result. But it always takes time to arrive at something important.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

On his quest to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold somewhere in the American southwest, Spanish explorer Vázquez de Coronado left behind some materials after a pit stop that, while perhaps an afterthought to him, included what is now a major piece of archaeological and weapon history in the United States.

A team of researchers uncovered a bronze cannon, or “wall gun,” in Arizona and, using radiocarbon dating among other dating techniques, pegged the 480-year-old device to the Coronado expedition. By virtue of its age, the cannon is the oldest firearm ever discovered within the continental confines of the United States. 

In a study published in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology, a team of researchers revealed the 2020 find from the floor of a Spanish stone-and-adobe structure in Arizona at the former settlement of San Geronimo III in what is now Nogales, Arizona, for the first time. 

Radiocarbon dating places the gun in the same time period of the 1539-1542 Coronado expedition, led by the Spanish explorer in hopes of finding the gold cities of Cibola, which were rumored by conquistadors to exist somewhere in what would become the southwestern U.S. 

“This wall gun is the first gun known to be associated with the Coronado expedition and is the oldest firearm ever found within the continental USA,” the study authors wrote, “and perhaps the oldest cannon currently known on the continent.”

This was no small pistol, though. At 42 inches in length and weighing 40 pounds, researchers say it would have taken two people to operate. But that apparently wasn't necessary. There were no bullets found near the gun—the team did uncover plenty of broken swords and daggers, fishhooks, pottery, and other items—and the lack of residue in the barrel indicated it was never fired. 

“I was in shock,” Deni Seymour, archaeologist and lead author, told the Washington Post about the find. “It was just an odd feeling that I rarely get.”

A wall gun is considered a beefed-up musket and got its name as it was often used at a building's wall or a ship's railing. While it's not what we traditionally think of when we hear the word, it is also referred to as a cannon, largely because of the smoothbore nature of the barrels. The 480-year-old gun was likely built in the early 1500s and brought on the expedition after manufacturing in either Mexico or the Caribbean, the study suggests. It was then abandoned at the site hundreds of years ago. 

“An artifact like this can connect people to the past, to history, and really stirs their imagination,” Seymour said. 

The expedition led by Coronado was a Spanish effort that started in Mexico and explored the American southwest with the goal of finding the Seven Cities of Cibola, which were proven to be just a myth. While no gold-adorned cities were ever located, the explorers became the first Europeans to see the Grand Canyon. 

Seymour told the Post that since the initial discovery in 2020, she has uncovered a second, similar cannon. “The cannon is pretty darn wonderful, but each artifact we find and the context of them has the potential to convey a really interesting part of the story,” she said. “And that's what's fun about it. That's what's interesting, and that's what keeps me going.”

 A one-of-a-kind piece of medical tech could heal diseases that have stumped researchers for decades. 

An estimated 1.1 million Americans are currently living with Parkinson's disease—a neurodegenerative condition that causes tremors, limb stiffness, and mobility issues. Despite how common Parkinson's is, researchers still aren't quite sure what exactly makes neurons in the brain deteriorate, which causes the disease.

While experts have developed treatments to mitigate symptoms of the condition, the options are either invasive or short-lasting. But for the first time ever, researchers have developed a non-invasive way to target neurons in the brains of Parkinson's patients. In their recent paper, published in the journal Nature Communications, a team from University College London and Oxford University debuted an ultrasound helmet that can accurately send pulses to the deepest parts of the brain to influence how cells communicate. 

The helmet is the most recent iteration of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS), a treatment method that has gained attention in recent years for its ability to modify how neurons fire signals. TUS works by sending out targeted sound waves at frequencies greater than 20kHz, or higher than the human ear can detect. As the pulses travel through the body, they emit energy that vibrates the cells, rapidly stretching and compressing the tissues. The devices come in all shapes and sizes, with some that look like headgear and others that resemble typical ultrasound wands. Previous applications of TUS were limited, as they were imprecise and too weak to target areas deeper in the brain. Parkinson's in particular damages neurons deep in a region of the midbrain called the substantia nigra, which is responsible for producing dopamine, which affects movement and muscle tone. 

The new helmet corrects these flaws with 256 small, tubular probes and a plastic face mask. The many wired probes allow the operator to send a focused ultrasound beam to specific parts of the patient's brain, while the mask keeps the patient still, further improving precision. The updates are what make the new ultrasound helmet capable of targeting areas 1,000 times smaller than traditional ultrasound technology can. 

And the helmet isn't just exciting in theory, either. The team's recent study proved the one-of-a-kind device is capable of reaching deeper parts of the brain more accurately than previous technology. To test the helmet, the team focused on a part of the brain that is unrelated to Parkinson's, but one that they could see immediate effects on. The area they targeted is called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a section of the thalamus involved in processing visual information. Participants observed a flashing checkerboard, and an fMRI revealed increased activity in their visual cortexes, indicating the ultrasound beams were successfully hitting the LGN. A second experiment revealed extended decreased activity in the same area. Researchers say both these tests show promising results for eventually harnessing the power of TUS to control symptoms like hand tremors.  

“Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, depression, and essential tremor, offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions,”  Bradley Treeby, PhD, senior author of the study, says in a press release. 

Next, the team plans to test the helmet on regions of the brain associated with the aforementioned conditions as well as stroke recovery, schizophrenia, and chronic pain, according to an interview with The Guardian. The researchers hope the new method will eventually work alongside or even replace invasive treatments, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), which requires a surgically implanted device similar to a pacemaker deep in the brain. 

Perhaps most excitingly, the team anticipates progress will be made quickly, estimating seeing the first clinical application within the next decade. Should the device continue to prove successful, it could finally be the cure to many conditions that have long stumped researchers.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A quaint estate in the West Midlands of England sits atop a treasure trove of Roman artifacts. The potential finds are so plentiful, in fact, that the National Trust—owners of the estate—saw fit to invite the public to work alongside archaeologists on a dig in September. That dig that uncovered Roman artifacts in the form of an incense bowl, a decorative metal acorn, and a piece of a military helmet. 

Located in rural Shropshire, the estate sits atop prehistoric and medieval settlements, and Roman roads and buildings. To help connect the bountiful history of the site with the local community, the National Trust launched Attingham Unearthed in 2025—a pilot archaeological project testing a new model of research. The aim? Create a hands-on, sustainable archaeology experience. 

Digging out Roman treasure sure helps a pilot project take root. 

In the debut effort, teams of volunteers worked alongside professionals at the site where Roman villas were recently uncovered, bringing school children, youth groups, and community organizations in for a public dig. The two-week effort sifted through three trenches and multiple test pits to reveal the Roman artifacts. “This fortnight has made a significant, and important, contribution to our understanding of Wroxeter and its immediate surroundings,” said Roger White, an expert at the nearby Wroxeter Roman City, according to the BBC. “The dig may have been small in scale, but its impact is enormous.” 

The dig uncovered a decorative metal acorn (thought to have once been attached to a piece of Roman furniture such as a small box), the base of a ceramic candlestick, the handle of a metal helmet that was likely once used by the Roman military, coins, and a 2,000-year-old decorative incense bowl. The bowl may have once been part of a Roman shrine on the site, and the coins date to around 150 B.C.E., prior to Roman occupation of the region.

“For the first time, visitors could book a place to dig alongside archaeologists who have been testing the results of the geophysical survey and ensuring our nature recovery ambitions work in harmony with our hidden heritage,” said Mark Agnew, general manager of the Attingham Estate, according to the Shropshire Star. 

The volunteers were involved with surveying, washing finds, and test pit excavations. “The work aims not only to connect people with the past, but also to deepen understanding of the wider history of Attingham Estate,” Agnew said. “This pilot project marks an exciting new approach for the trust.”

The estate was selected to launch the project due to the evidence of human interaction there over such a long time. “Recent surveys have revealed high archaeological potential, making it the ideal place to begin,” the trust said in a statement. “This project will act as a proof of concept. Everything learned at Attingham, what worked, what needs refining, will shape how the National Trust delivers archaeological engagement in the future.”

Metals are at the heart of the global economy, from power generation and storage to transport. But their supply chains face three interlinked challenges: dwindling reserves, rising demand and high greenhouse-gas emissions1–3.

At the current rates of extraction and use, the known reserves of some metals, including copper, nickel and chromium, will only last for the next few decades1,2. And these rates do not take into account rising demand as the world's population grows and new technologies emerge3 (see ‘Three-part problem').

Furthermore, the mining and extraction of most metals, as well as their melting, refining, alloying, casting and shaping, are a large source of greenhouse gases. Steelmaking alone accounts for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, or 3.6 billion tonnes3 — more than three times what the aviation sector contributes.

There are currently no concrete, commonly accepted long-term solutions or implementation plans. Here, based on our expertise in materials science and engineering, we outline a set of five strategies that, together, can address the challenges. The solutions that societies choose will have wide-reaching consequences for our ways of life, economy and the well-being of our planet and future generations.

Sources: Reserves: ref. 1; In demand: ref. 2; Emissions: World Steel in Figures 2024 and Sustainability Indicators 2024 reports (World Steel Association)

A small tweak in a material's chemical composition can go a long way in reducing the amount of metals used. Take steel, for example. About one billion tonnes of carbon–manganese steel are used each year globally for buildings and other infrastructure. However, using another type of steel — which has almost the same amounts of carbon, manganese and silicon, but also contains tiny amounts of niobium (about 0.03% in weight) — increases the material's strength and toughness4. Niobium-microalloyed steel is slightly more expensive than conventional steel. But because it is stronger, less material is required4,5, lowering the total cost of a building. Reducing steel consumption can also reduce CO2 emissions4,5 by some 20%.

Researchers are investigating other substitutions, too. For example, rare-earth magnets, which require elements such as dysprosium or terbium, could be replaced with less environmentally damaging ones based on iron nitride6. And sodium-ion batteries7 could replace lithium-ion ones to circumvent lithium's global supply limitations, high extraction costs and the environmental damage it causes during extraction. Scientists are also studying thermal batteries that store energy as heat rather than as electricity and that are made from materials such as cement and crushed rock.

To accelerate the adoption of materials with lower carbon footprints, governments should update policies and regulations. Governments and industry can also create certification schemes that reward low-emission material choices, helping designers, engineers and consumers to make informed decisions. And universities should include substitution principles in engineering and materials education, to train a workforce to select materials that have a minimal environmental impact, not just high performance.

Academia and industry must work together closely, through industry-funded fellowships, joint research programmes and institutions such as the US Engineering Research Centers, which are supported by the National Science Foundation.

The metal-production industry urgently needs to reduce its environmental impact. Aluminium production, for example, is responsible for around 270 million tonnes of CO2 a year (one-tenth that of steel). It also releases toxic fluorine-containing species, which are powerful greenhouse gases. And copper smelting releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide, contributing to acid rain.

Green manufacturing technologies that lower emissions are needed. Many exist already. For instance, a top gas recycling blast furnace that reuses carbon dioxide from the ironmaking process can reduce emissions substantially8. Other harmful by-products can also be upcycled. In copper smelting, for example, sulfur dioxide can be converted into usable compounds, such as sulfuric acid.

Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?

Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?

Innovations in hydrometallurgy and bioleaching9 that use microorganisms to break down the minerals in ores and release pure metals are revolutionizing extraction. They can take nickel, copper and gold from ores with low concentrations of these elements and avoid energy-intensive smelting procedures, enabling metal extraction from sources that were previously too expensive to mine or dismissed as unusable, such as by-products of mining and other industrial processes and electronic waste.

However, in practice, many of these advanced technologies are not being adopted because of their cost. Governments must help businesses and individuals through policies or incentives, such as low-interest loans, investment grants and carbon pricing mechanisms. Solar energy promotion shows how government incentives can accelerate adoption despite high upfront costs. The US Investment Tax Credit and state-level programmes can offer subsidies, zero-interest loans and community solar-energy support.

Another way to lower metal consumption is to improve the durability, repairability and recyclability of metal-containing products. Companies should design long-lasting products and offer end-of-life recycling. Several corporations, including technology giants Apple and Dell, have adopted circular practices through certified refurbishment programmes.

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Governments must support these efforts by overseeing recycling data, enforcing disclosure requirements and setting up recycling and waste-management incentives10. The European Union has embraced this approach. For example, its Circular Economy Action Plan and its Ecodesign directive mandate standards for the durability and repairability of products. International organizations should standardize practices and environmental agencies or independent bodies must monitor compliance and progress. The International Organization for Standardization has issued standards on ecodesign and design for disassembly. The United Nations Environment Programme's International Resource Panel and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provide guidance for sustainable material flows11.

Accelerating metal recycling must also be a top priority. Steel, aluminium and copper are already recycled widely, but urgent improvements are needed for others, such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare-earth elements. Advanced sorting methods and urban mining programmes12 that can recover valuable metals from electronic waste are crucial.

In 2021, for example, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry outlined the country's transition to a circular economy. According to the nation's economic and environmental ministries, some 15 million home appliances were collected nationwide in the 2021 fiscal year.

Manufacturing processes can be improved, too. 3D printing, for example, reduces waste by building objects layer by layer, using only the necessary amount of raw metal powder13.

Alchemy: An Illustrated History of Elixirs, Experiments, and the Birth of Modern Science Philip Ball Yale Univ. Press (2025)

When physicist Ernest Rutherford and chemist Frederick Soddy discovered nuclear transmutation — the natural decay of one radioactive element into another — in 1901, Rutherford's first cry was of alarm, not delight. “For Mike's sake, Soddy,” he chastised his co-worker. “Don't call it transmutation, they'll have our heads off as alchemists!”

Elixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage

Elixirs for times of plague and bullion shortage

Alchemy's reputation hasn't improved much since — it remains one of the most misunderstood aspects of science history. For most people, alchemy conjures up images of complex charts and mythical ingredients such as the philosopher's stone, which could turn lead into gold or create the elixir of life.

In his latest book, Alchemy, science writer Philip Ball portrays the practice instead as “one of the most versatile, allusive, and fertile products of the human imagination”. He deftly recounts its 4,000 years of history — starting with the skilled artisans of Ancient Egypt and the immortality-seeking medical practitioners of China's Western Han dynasty (202 bc–ad 9), although the practice originated before this period — picking out changing beliefs, famous works and personalities along the way.

Ball's eclectic knowledge of chemistry, his insatiable curiosity and his willingness to venture off well-beaten paths make him an excellent guide. To his credit, the book steadfastly refuses to align itself with aspects of alchemy that are overly practical (apparatus and temperature-control methods) or esoteric, and it doesn't espouse outdated ideas. Historians of science don't give much credence to the views of psychiatrist Carl Jung, for example, who professed that alchemical symbolism was a reflection of psychological desires. New Age thinking that alchemy is about spiritual transformation rather than scientific effort is less interesting than what alchemy really is.

Indeed, alchemy meant many things to different groups and schools of thought, and its story was one of chemical progress and faith-based mystery. Ball picks out several pivotal characters to show how their disparate goals, views and personalities acted as a prism for how they saw the ‘noble art'. Famous practitioners are featured, such as physicist Isaac Newton, and several individuals who are often overlooked in science history.

For example, in fifteenth-century England, alchemist George Ripley wrote his recipes in rhyming verse. In seventeenth-century Stockholm, queen Christina of Sweden — who ran her own experiments and worked with other alchemists — was a wonderfully controversial figure. She refused to marry, converted from Protestantism to Catholicism and abdicated the throne. Alchemy became the boon or bane of monarchs, depending on whether they thought it could bring them riches or were terrified that their control over their people would slip. And it was a playground for tricksters willing to take someone's money with the promise of gold that would never come.

As well as the standard Western progress of alchemy from Egypt to Europe, and from the Islamic world to Christianity, Ball's gaze also sweeps east towards traditions in China. He takes in such luminaries as the physician Ge Hong, an alchemist and philosopher, whose fourth-century recipe inspired Youyou Tu's Nobel-prizewinning discovery of artemisinin compounds to treat malaria.

Bringing us into a colourful, lively world of art, poetry and prose, Ball also steps into alchemy's offshoots. Iatrochemistry — the idea in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that chemical substances from metals, plants and animals could treat ailments — later gave way to medicine. And Ball discusses alchemy's influence on the English language. In his 1755 English dictionary, Samuel Johnson attributed the origin of the word gibberish to the coded writings of the Islamic alchemical corpus attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (also known as Geber in a Latinized version of his name).

Subtle changes in gene expression direct cells to distinct cellular states. Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. Here, we develop a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotype and fate in direct conversion to induced motor neurons. The DIAL framework opens opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

Fatal overdoses among adults 65 and older involving fentanyl mixed with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamines have risen dramatically, climbing 9,000% in the past eight years. The rate now mirrors that seen in younger adults, according to findings presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

This research is one of the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to reveal that older adults -- often left out of overdose analyses -- are increasingly part of the national surge in fentanyl-stimulant deaths. People in this age group face higher risks of overdose because many manage chronic illnesses, take multiple medications, and metabolize drugs more slowly as they age.

Experts describe the opioid epidemic as unfolding in four distinct "waves," each tied to a different drug driving fatal overdoses: prescription opioids in the 1990s, heroin beginning around 2010, fentanyl taking hold in 2013, and a combination of fentanyl and stimulants emerging in 2015.

"A common misconception is that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people," said Gab Pasia, M.A., lead author of the study and a medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. "Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. This suggests older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."

To conduct the study, researchers examined 404,964 death certificates listing fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, using data from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. Of those deaths, 17,040 involved adults 65 and older, while 387,924 were among adults aged 25 to 64.

Between 2015 and 2023, fentanyl-related deaths rose from 264 to 4,144 among older adults (a 1,470% increase) and from 8,513 to 64,694 among younger adults (a 660% increase). Within the older population, deaths involving both fentanyl and stimulants grew from 8.7% (23 of 264 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 49.9% (2,070 of 4,144) in 2023 -- a staggering 9,000% rise. In comparison, among younger adults, fentanyl-stimulant deaths rose from 21.3% (1,812 of 8,513) to 59.3% (38,333 of 64,694) over the same period, a 2,115% increase.

Researchers chose to highlight 2015 and 2023 in their analysis because 2015 marked the beginning of the epidemic's fourth wave, when fentanyl-stimulant deaths among older adults were at their lowest, and 2023 represented the most recent year of CDC data available.

The researchers noted that the rise in fentanyl deaths involving stimulants in older adults began to sharply rise in 2020, while deaths linked to other substances stayed the same or declined. Cocaine and methamphetamines were the most common stimulants paired with fentanyl among the older adults studied, surpassing alcohol, heroin, and benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium.

"National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults," said Mr. Pasia. "Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time -- not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths -- not due to fentanyl alone -- and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients."

The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should:

"Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose," said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. "With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."

Surging temperatures worldwide have pushed coral reef ecosystems into a state of widespread decline, marking the first time the planet has reached a climate ‘tipping point', researchers announced today.

They also say that without rapid action to curb greenhouse-gas emissions, other systems on Earth will also soon reach planetary tipping points, thresholds for profound changes that cannot be rolled back.

“We can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” says Steve Smith, a social scientist at the University of Exeter, UK, and a lead author on a report released today about how close Earth is to reaching roughly 20 planetary tipping points. “This is our new reality.”

Led by Smith and other scientists at the University of Exeter, the report assesses the risk of breaching tipping points such as ice-sheet collapse, rising seas and dieback of the Amazon rainforest. It also discusses progress towards various positive tipping points focused on social and economic change, such as the adoption of clean energy.

The group's first such assessment, released less than two years ago, raised alarms but did not officially declare that any climate tipping points had been reached. In the past few years, however, global temperatures have surged, sparking concerns among some scientists that global warming is accelerating and could lead to even more widespread impacts in the coming decades than the changes that have already been recorded.

The impact on coral reefs has been particularly severe in the past two years , pushing these ecosystems to their tipping point, the researchers say. The warming waters have caused corals across the globe to bleach, a process that occurs when the organisms expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients, oxygen and vibrant colours. The fourth global bleaching event in the past few decades began in January 2023, and researchers estimate that it has affected more than 84% of the planet's coral ecosystems.

The initial tipping-point report talked about large-scale threats to corals in the future tense, but the latest global bleaching event has made it clear that the crisis is now, says Michael Studivan, a coral ecologist at the University of Miami in Florida.

Eating a Mediterranean-style diet with fewer calories, adding moderate physical activity, and receiving professional guidance for weight management can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 31%. That is the key finding of PREDIMED-Plus, a large clinical trial led in Spain by the University of Navarra together with more than 200 researchers from 22 universities, hospitals, and research institutes. The project was carried out in over 100 primary care centers within Spain's National Health System.

Launched in 2013 after the University of Navarra received an Advanced Grant of over €2 million from the European Research Council (ERC), PREDIMED-Plus is the largest nutrition trial ever conducted in Europe. Between 2014 and 2016, additional institutions joined the effort, bringing total funding above 15 million euros. Most of the support came from the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and the Center for Biomedical Research Network (CIBER), through its divisions on Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), and Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM).

The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, followed 4,746 adults between the ages of 55 and 75 who were overweight or obese and had metabolic syndrome but no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over six years, researchers compared two groups. One group adopted a calorie-reduced Mediterranean diet (about 600 fewer kilocalories per day), engaged in moderate exercise such as brisk walking and strength and balance training, and received professional counseling. The other group continued a traditional Mediterranean diet without calorie limits or exercise advice.

The results revealed that the participants who followed the calorie-reduced diet and exercise plan not only reduced their diabetes risk but also lost more weight and trimmed more from their waistlines. On average, they lost 3.3 kg and 3.6 cm from their waist, compared to 0.6 kg and 0.3 cm in the control group. This translated to preventing about three new cases of type 2 diabetes for every 100 participants -- a meaningful benefit for public health.

"Diabetes is the first solid clinical outcome for which we have shown -- using the strongest available evidence -- that the Mediterranean diet with calorie reduction, physical activity and weight loss is a highly effective preventive tool," said Miguel Ángel Martínez-González, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at the University of Navarra, Adjunct Professor of Nutrition at Harvard University, and one of the principal investigators of the project. "Applied at scale in at-risk populations, these modest and sustained lifestyle changes could prevent thousands of new diagnoses every year. We hope soon to show similar evidence for other major public health challenges."

Type 2 Diabetes: A Preventable Global Epidemic

According to the International Diabetes Federation, type 2 diabetes now affects over 530 million people around the world. Its rise is fueled by urbanization (unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity), an aging population, and increasing rates of overweight and obesity. In Spain, an estimated 4.7 million adults live with diabetes -- mostly type 2 -- giving the country one of the highest rates in Europe, where total cases exceed 65 million. In the United States, roughly 38.5 million people have diabetes, and the disease carries some of the highest per-patient healthcare costs worldwide. Experts emphasize that prevention is crucial to slow this escalating crisis, which greatly increases the risk of heart, kidney, and metabolic complications.

"The Mediterranean diet acts synergistically to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. With PREDIMED-Plus, we demonstrate that combining calorie control and physical activity enhances these benefits," explained Miguel Ruiz-Canela, Professor and Chair of Preventive Medicine and Public Health Department at the University of Navarra's School of Medicine and first author of the study. "It is a tasty, sustainable and culturally accepted approach that offers a practical and effective way to prevent type 2 diabetes -- a global disease that is, to a large extent, avoidable."

International Relevance and Support for a Realistic and Scalable Strategy

Annals of Internal Medicine accompanied the publication with an editorial by Sharon J. Herring and Gina L. Tripicchio, nutrition and public health experts at Temple University (Philadelphia, USA). They praised the intervention's clinical relevance and its potential as a preventive model for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, they warn that replicating similar strategies outside the Mediterranean context -- such as in the U.S. -- requires overcoming structural barriers, including unequal access to healthy foods, the limitations of the urban environment, and the lack of professional guidance. In this scenario, they advocate strengthening public policies that promote more nutritious and more equitable environments. At a time when new drugs against obesity and diabetes are grabbing headlines, PREDIMED-Plus demonstrates that modest, sustained lifestyle changes can still deliver powerful health benefits.

The PREDIMED-Plus project (2013-2024), which involves different patients, is a continuation of the PREDIMED study (2003-2010). This study demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30%. Researchers emphasize that primary care providers can integrate the new intervention as a sustainable, cost-efficient strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes on a large scale.

Participating Institutions

The PREDIMED-Plus trial has assembled a broad network of investigators from across Spain. In order of the number of participants, the study included researchers from the following institutions: the University of Navarra and the Navarra Health Service (2 centers), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (2 centers), University of Valencia, Rovira i Virgili University (Reus), IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Miguel Hernández University (Alicante), Son Espases Hospital (Palma de Mallorca), University of Malaga, Reina Sofía Hospital (Córdoba) and University of Granada. In addition, Bioaraba and the UPV/EHU (Vitoria), the University of the Balearic Islands, the Hospital Virgen de la Victoria (Malaga), the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the University of Leon, the Primary Health Care District of Seville, the Fundación Jiménez Díaz (Madrid), the Hospital de Bellvitge, the Hospital Clínico San Carlos (Madrid), the University of Jaen, and the IMDEA Food Institute (Madrid) have also participated.

The project also benefited from international collaboration with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (USA). Most of the participating researchers are affiliated with the CIBEROBN, CIBERESP, or CIBERDEM research networks.

Kiln, a co-working and flex-office community with locations in multiple western U.S. states, is opening its first space in Washington state next year.

The company confirmed a new lease of 32,276 feet in Seattle's Fremont Lake Union Center on North 34th Street. The opening is planned for fall 2026.

According to Kiln, the location will be able to accommodate more than 350 members in a neighborhood that is home to offices for nearby tech companies including Google, Tableau, Adobe and others.

Kiln will open reservations soon for a variety of membership types. Its workspaces include dedicated individual desks, shared desks, private offices, conference rooms and more, suitable for people working solo, larger teams and growing startups.

Amenities in other locations include bike storage, parenting rooms, phone booths, fully stocked kitchens, mail services, gym access, showers and more.

Based in Salt Lake City, Kiln will have 25 locations by the time Seattle opens. The next closest locations are in Portland and Bend, Ore.

Kiln will compete against a number of co-working companies in the Seattle area, including Portland-based Centrl Office, which took over a WeWork location in a historic building on Capitol Hill last year; and The Pioneer Collective, which is opening a new co-working space in a former fish cannery along the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

Seattle ranks No. 12 among U.S. cities as measured by total co-working square footage across 153 locations, according to CoworkingCafe, which noted that the broader sector is shifting to a “more measured and optimized footprint” after growing over the past two years.

Goldman Sachs has agreed to acquire Industry Ventures, a 25-year-old, San Francisco-based investment firm with $7 billion in assets under management, CNBC was first to report on Monday. The deal underscores the growing importance of secondary markets and buyouts as traditional venture exits remain sluggish.

The investment bank is paying $665 million in cash and equity, with up to $300 million more tied to the firm's performance through 2030, according to a release from Goldman. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, and all 45 Industry Ventures employees are expected to join Goldman.

We've reached out to Swildens for more information.

The acquisition comes as venture funds increasingly turn to non-traditional exits amid a prolonged IPO drought that only now looks to be breaking. Speaking on TechCrunch's StrictlyVC Download podcast earlier this year, Industry Ventures founder and CEO Hans Swildens said that tech buyout funds now account for 25% of all liquidity in the entire venture ecosystem — “a huge chunk of liquidity,” he said.

Swildens explained that venture managers are being forced to adapt their approach. “Just going out and seeing companies, putting them in your fund and then waiting for an IPO or strategic M&A exit probably won't work anymore,” he said in the podcast interview. “[VCs] need to start working on alternative liquidity solutions.”

At the time — in April — he noted that at least five major venture funds had hired full-time staff dedicated to manufacturing non-traditional exits, including secondary transactions, continuation funds, and buyouts. “All the brand name funds are all staffing and thinking through liquidity structures,” Swildens said.

Goldman is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, which the bank has identified as a key growth engine.

“Industry Ventures' trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a prepared statement. “By combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers,” the statement continued.

Industry Ventures says it has made more than 1,000 investments, has stakes in more than 700 venture firms, and that it boasts an internal rate of return of 18%.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

A pilot electric ferry service between Seattle and nearby Tacoma could debut next summer to serve the surge of World Cup tourists expected in the region — but questions about funding, ferry terminal locations and total costs remain unanswered.

Pierce County leaders, whose jurisdiction includes Tacoma, are hoping the hydroplane ferry would boost tourism and provide a scenic connection to the city 35 miles south of Seattle — one that lasts well beyond the World Cup kickoff in June. They also envision job creation from building the zero-emission vessels in the area.

“This is an example of a legacy that we can leave this region that will promote tourism, promote economic development and promote movement around Puget Sound,” said Ryan Mello, executive of Pierce County, in a recent pitch to Port of Tacoma officials.

The hydroplane ferries would be the only water-based public transit linking Puget Sound's two largest cities.

Here's how the plan works:

“The vision of bringing back the ‘Mosquito Fleet‘ with this generation of boats is what we are hoping is the outcome of this pilot,” said Betty Baublits, Pierce County's economic development director, referencing the privately owned ships that ferried passengers in the region more than a century ago.

“We will evaluate the success of the pilot with all of our community, maritime and rider stakeholders to determine what the future of an electric foot ferry network in the Salish Sea will be, and who is the best entity to continue the program,” she added via email.

While the notion of sleek new hydroplanes zipping across the region's waterways is attractive, how the plan comes together is foggy under the compressed timeline.

Along with additional funding needed to set sail, the project must find ferry landing sites with parking and boarding ramps that meet accessibility needs and install charging facilities. Who pays for and owns the shore-side infrastructure depends on where it's located, Baublits said.

The county is also working on a revenue-sharing agreement with Prop, with the county proceeds reinvested into the electric ferry program. The parties have not said what the passenger fares would cost.

At the September meeting with the county and the Port of Tacoma, commissioners shared enthusiasm for the proposal, imagining a service between the city and other popular locales on Puget Sound. But there were also concerns about affordability for passengers.

“It is very luxurious inside one of these [ferries],” said Commissioner Kristin Ang. “So I do want to make it affordable for more people and inclusive … I get that this is the pilot project, but when I look at those leather seats, I'm just like, ‘Is this just for a certain class of people?'”

Others in the region are similarly interested in the proposal, which could bolster the connection between tech companies and organizations in Seattle and Tacoma. But the proposed speed of deployment remains a hurdle. 

“This is a big project. It's a big opportunity, and we need to give it the time necessary in order to be successful,” said Dennis Joyce, director of investments for Tacoma Venture Fund (TVF), a venture capital firm. Tying the launch to the World Cup, he added, “is a really short time horizon.”

Existing rapid and mass transit options between Seattle and Tacoma include Sound Transit's commuter railway service and its express buses.

The ferry trip will take about 50-55 minutes each way, which is longer than driving between the cities on Interstate 5, though freeway traffic is a wildcard. 

There are other efforts underway to deploy electric-powered vessels in Western Washington:

Nearly a decade ago, real estate company Seco Development proposed a pilot ferry service to carry passengers across Lake Washington, between Seattle's tech-heavy South Lake Union neighborhood and a Seco office development in Renton. The development is now mired in bankruptcy.

Part of the challenge for these projects stems from federal laws including the 1920 Jones Act and the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 that require the use of domestically made vessels for carrying goods, cars and passengers for domestic, waterborne transportation. The rules eliminate the option of purchasing less costly European-made ferries.

Artemis is building its hydrofoils in Belfast and in February announced a manufacturing partnership with the Seattle-based luxury yacht maker Delta Marine. 

David Tyler, Artemis co-founder and managing director for North America, declined to share details on where vessels for the Tacoma-area project would be built, what they would cost, and when they would be available, saying via email that was “currently commercially sensitive information.”

Tyler said that additional manufacturing locations beyond the Seattle site would be “announced soon.”

Pierce County Executive Mello said the region has long wanted to bolster its ferry service options — and now is the chance. 

“Hosting such a significant world event,” he said, “causes some sense of urgency and helps cause some creativity about how can we take advantage of this moment for the benefit of the people who live here … and the businesses who have the responsibility of providing jobs and economic vitality for this region long after the games are gone.”

Humbird 3 comes with all the bells and whistles.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Humbird 3, an innovative 11-in-1 Thunderbolt 5 eGPU dock, aims to become the only docking station you'll ever need. With support from over 177 backers on Kickstarter and more than $63,000 raised, it's more than just an eGPU dock—it's loaded with a wide range of valuable features.

The dock is constructed from recycled aluminum with a wooden accent, thereby enhancing its premium appearance. It also incorporates a cooling system that operates in a silent 0dB mode when idle and dynamically adjusts its fan speed based on the graphics card's load. According to the manufacturer, the Humbird 3 is equipped with an ESP32 System on Chip (SoC), a component typically utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and is reportedly powered by the Humbird Operating System (OS) to manage the device's power and performance. The Humbird 3 also features a one-inch LCD screen that displays real-time information, including power consumption, transfer speed, charging status, or a user-defined parameter.

The device utilizes Intel's HL9480 Thunderbolt 5 controller, capable of delivering up to 120 Gbps in single-display mode. The PCIe 4.0 x16 expansion slot is configured as a x4 connection with a bandwidth of 64 Gbps. The dock is equipped with an integrated 500W GaN power supply and a 16-pin power connector designed to supply power to your graphics card. Users may employ either a standard 16-pin power cable or a 16-pin to 3 x 8-pin power cable, depending on their requirements. Rated at 500W, the system supports graphics cards up to the Radeon 9070 XT or the GeForce RTX 5080.

The Humbird 3 exhibits a comprehensive array of features. Concerning storage, it includes one M.2 slot operating at PCIe 4.0 x4; however, the vendor did not specify the supported form factors. Additionally, it incorporates a microSD card reader as well as CFexpress Type A and Type B card readers. In terms of network connectivity, the Humbird 3 is equipped with a single 5G Ethernet port, facilitated by the Realtek RTL8157 controller.

Connectivity includes three Thunderbolt 5 ports that support 100W PD charging. Additionally, the DisplayPort 2.1 output delivers 8K (7680 x 4320) resolution at a refresh rate of up to 60 Hz. The device is also equipped with two standard USB Type-A ports offering 10 Gbps data transfer speeds. Furthermore, wireless charging functionality is available, facilitating the charging of smartphones or smartwatches.

The Humbird 3 is equipped with a standard 180W power adapter. Nonetheless, it is possible to upgrade to a 300W unit for an additional $39 or to a 500W GaN power adapter for an extra $129.

The funding period for the Humbird 3 has concluded. The manufacturer has established an MSRP of $399 for the device. However, Super Early Bird and Early Bird backers are eligible to purchase the device at prices of $299 and $309, respectively. Meanwhile, the vendor is offering a "KS discount" of $80, reducing the device's price to $319.

The reason is that `getenv()` hands out raw pointers to the variables, so overwriting a variable using `setenv()` is impossible to guard against. Treat with extreme caution.

Arguably that's less harmful than the thread-safety issues on Linux, but there's no perfect solution here as long as POSIX stays what it is.

- On Linux systems, any user process can inspect any other process of that same user for it's environment variables. We can argue about threat model but, especially for a developer's system, there are A LOT of processes running as the same user as the developer.- IMO, this has become an even more pronounced problem with the popularity of running non-containerized LLM agents in the same user space as the developer's primary OS user. It's a secret exfiltration exploiter's dream.- Environment variables are usually passed down to other spawned processes instead of being contained to the primary process which is often the only one that needs it.- Systemd exposes unit environment variables to all system clients through DBUS and warns against using environment variables for secrets[1].  I believe this means non-root users have access to environment variables set for root-only units/services.  I could be wrong, I haven't tested it yet.  But if this is the case, I bet that's a HUGE surprise to many system admins.I think ephemeral file sharing between a secret managing process (e.g. 1Password's op cli tool) and the process that needs the secrets (flask, terraform, etc.) is likely the only solution that keeps secrets out of files and also out of environment variables. This is how Systemd's credentials system works.  But it's far from widely supported.Any good solutions for passing secrets around that don't involve environment variables or regular plain text files?Edit: I think 1Password's op client has a good start in that each new "session" requires my authorization. So I can enable that tool for a cli sessions where I need some secrets but a rogue process that just tries to use the `op` binary isn't going to get to piggyback on that authorization.  I'd get a new popup.  But this is only step 1.  Step 2 is...how to share that secret with the process that needs it and we are now back to the discussion above.1: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/syst...

memfd_secret comes to mind https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_secret.2.htmlI haven't seen much language support for it, though. On one part maybe because it's Linux only.People that write in Rust (and maybe Go, depends how easy FFI is) should give it a try.I wanted for a time to get some support for it in PHP, since wrapping a C function should be easy, but the thought of having to also modify php-fpm put a dent in that. I can't and don't want to hack on C code.In practice it'd be great if the process manager spawn children after opening a secret file descriptor, and pass those on. Not in visible memory, not in /proc/*/environ

This is a very good point I'd never realised! I'm not sure how you get around it, though, as if that program can even find a credential and decrypt a file, if it runs as the user then everything else can go find that credential as well.

That means you need to make the change in a way that runs on every new session (login or new terminal window).Depending on how your system is configured:.bash_profile gets run once on every login.bashrc gets run once on every non-login new session (i.e. a new terminal window)It's typical, if using these files, to do something like this:    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
        source ~/.bashrc
    fi

in the .bash_profile file, putting most other things in .bashrc, such that you don't have to worry about the distinction.If you're not even using bash or bash-likes at all, but instead something like Zsh, fish, etc you'll need to set things the way they want to be set there.> They should add a simple env var GUI like Windows has that just works, and isn't terminal-specificThis doesn't exist in linux, because there isn't "one place" that all possible terminals draw from. Conceivably, it's possible to write a GUI tool that reads your .bashrc file, looks for anything that resembles a variable, parses the bash code to look for ways it is set, and then present a GUI tool that could update it in common cases, but... it's way easier to just write the change in a text editor.

Prime Day is behind us, but Amazon hasn't stopped rolling out steep discounts. If you've been on the lookout for a powerful PC that does a good job of handling everyday tasks without taking up too much space, the Dell OptiPlex 7020 mini PC is going for just $996 on Amazon.

That's a massive 71% off from its original price of almost $3,400. Of course, discounts this big don't really last too long, so we recommend grabbing this powerhouse before the deal expires for good.

See at Amazon

In a compact, no-fuss build, you're getting a 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor with a max turbo speed of 5.2GHz. This is paired with a huge 32GB of DDR5 RAM, so expect responsive performance for almost all your day-to-day tasks. Opening multiple programs at once or playing around with a creative app – it makes it all a breeze. Storage-wise, you're covered with a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, which makes for ultra-fast load times and gives plenty of space to store all your essentials. There's a 2TB version of the same PC as well, but we think 1TB should be sufficient for more users out there.

Graphics are taken care of by Intel UHD Graphics 770. You will enjoy sharp, clear visuals, regardless of what's playing. Don't want to limit yourself to a single screen? It even supports larger setups, since you can connect up to three displays at once via two DisplayPort 1.4a ports and one HDMI 1.4b port. Other connectivity options include two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 Type-C, RJ-45 Ethernet, and a universal audio jack. For wireless connectivity, there's Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth as well.

The system runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. Even better, you're also getting a keyboard and a mouse thrown in for free with your purchase. The PC itself is also quite slim and portable. It slides easily into any bag without bulking things up, and can even be mounted at the back of your monitor if you prefer a cleaner look.

This deal brings it down to $996 after a whopping 71% off. It's still a bit of an investment, but the discount makes it much more approachable. Just be sure to snag it before the deal ends.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Nevada state regulators have accused Elon Musk's Boring Co. of violating environmental regulations nearly 800 times in the last two years as it digs a sprawling tunnel network beneath Las Vegas for its Tesla-powered “people mover.” The company's alleged violations include starting to dig without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling muck from its trucks, according to a new document obtained by City Cast Las Vegas and ProPublica.

The Sept. 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws.

Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement. The letter also accuses the company of failing to hire an independent environmental manager to regularly inspect its construction sites. State regulators counted 689 missed inspections.

The Boring Co. is disputing the violation letter, a state spokesperson said.

The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection could have fined the company more than $3 million under the 2022 agreement, which allowed for daily penalties to be assessed. But regulators knocked down the total penalty to $242,800. For example, the bulk of the total possible fine was linked to the alleged missed inspections, but the agency chose to levy just a $10,000 penalty for each of the company's 11 permits.

“Given the extraordinary number of violations, NDEP has decided to exercise its discretion to reduce the penalty to two $5,000 violations per permit, which it believes offers a reasonable penalty that will still serve to deter future non-compliance conduct,” regulators wrote in the letter.

Payment of the penalty isn't required until after the dispute resolution process is complete, a state spokesperson said. In the letter, the agency reminded the company that it “reserves the right to direct TBC to cease and desist construction activities” under the agreement.

In the past, Musk has espoused paying penalties rather than waiting for approvals as a way of doing business.

​​“Environmental regulations are, in my view, largely terrible,” he said at an event with the libertarian Cato Institute last year. “You have to get permission in advance, as opposed to, say, paying a penalty if you do something wrong, which I think would be much more effective.”

Neither Musk nor Boring responded to requests for comment for this story.

The Sept. 22 letter documents the latest in a string of alleged violations of state and local regulations by The Boring Co. since it began construction in 2019 of the Loop project, which uses driver-operated Teslas to move people through the tunnels. The project, initially a 0.8-mile underground route connecting the sections of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority campus to each other, has grown to a planned 68 miles of tunnels and 104 stations across the Las Vegas Valley. It's carried out in partnership with the LVCVA, the tourism board best known for the “What Happens Here, Stays Here” slogan.

Boring uses a machine known as Prufrock to dig the 12-foot-diameter tunnels, applying chemical accelerants as part of the process. For each foot the company bores, it removes about 6 cubic yards of soil along with any groundwater, according to a company document prepared for state environmental officials.

Because it is privately funded and receives no federal money, the project is exempt from many exhaustive governmental vetting and environmental analysis requirements. But it is required to obtain state permits to ensure the waste does not contaminate the environment or local water sources.

A January story by ProPublica and City Cast Las Vegas documented how the company worked to escape county and state oversight requirements by arguing its project didn't fit under existing regulations and promising to hold itself accountable through independent audits — all while being cited for permitting and water pollution violations in 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Last year, the company successfully lobbied to be exempted from holding a county “amusement and transportation system” permit, arguing instead for an oversight plan that removed multiple layers of inspection.

Workers have complained of chemical burns from the waste material generated by the tunneling process, and firefighters must decontaminate their equipment after conducting rescues from the project sites. The company was fined more than $112,000 by Nevada's Occupational Safety and Health Administration in late 2023 after workers complained of “ankle-deep” water in the tunnels, muck spills and burns. The Boring Co. has contested the violations. Just last month, a construction worker suffered a “crush injury” after being pinned between two 4,000-foot pipes, according to police records. Firefighters used a crane to extract him from the tunnel opening.

After ProPublica and City Cast Las Vegas published their January story, both the CEO and the chairman of the LVCVA board criticized the reporting, arguing the project is well-regulated. As an example, LVCVA CEO Steve Hill cited the delayed opening of a Loop station by local officials who were concerned that fire safety requirements weren't adequate. Board chair Jim Gibson, who is also a Clark County commissioner, agreed the project is appropriately regulated.

“We wouldn't have given approvals if we determined things weren't the way they ought to be and what it needs to be for public safety reasons,” Gibson said, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. “Our sense is we've done what we need to do to protect the public.”

Asked for a response to the new proposed fines, an LVCVA spokesperson said, “We won't be participating in this story.”

The repeated allegations that the company is violating regulations — including the bespoke regulatory arrangement agreed to by the company — indicates that officials aren't keeping the public safe, said Ben Leffel, an assistant public policy professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

“Not if they're recommitting almost the exact violation,” Leffel said.

Leffel questioned whether a $250,000 penalty would be significant enough to change operations at The Boring Co., which was valued at $7 billion in 2023. Studies show that fines that don't put a significant dent in a company's profit don't deter companies from future violations, Leffel said.

A state spokesperson disagreed that regulators aren't keeping the public safe and said the agency believes its penalties will deter “future non-compliance.”

“NDEP is actively monitoring and inspecting the projects,” the spokesperson said.

There are two narratives unfolding in the press, in VC/founder circles, and in the boardroom. One is about AI automation and job displacement. The other is about layoffs, hiring freezes, and a shortage of entry-level positions. As expected, we assume these are intertwined. 

There's just one problem. The data doesn't support a correlation at this point.

A comprehensive recent analysis by Yale's Budget Lab argued the current wave of AI tech made no discernible impact on the labor market. The study showed the occupational mix change mostly matches previous tech waves. In other words, AI is another tool that follows the same technology adoption curve we know.

There are valid concerns that AI will affect roles. Some will see efficiency gains, reducing the number of required humans to achieve the same result; some will be automated, replacing workers. The timeline in the current narrative doesn't match the truth on the ground, though.

The Real Culprits

What's happening in the labor market is more nuanced (and mundane) than the AI disruption story suggests. We love to think we are living in unprecedented times. Yet, we are seeing the same patterns from corporations as we saw during the financial crisis of 2008 and the dot-com bust in 2000: layoffs, hiring freezes, cost cutting, etc.

The difference between those two crises and now is that we have multiple once-in-a-decade events happening in the last five years.

These are five explanations for what we are seeing today that are not related to AI.

Covid Correction: Companies, particularly in tech, dramatically over-hired during the “Covid boom.” Amazon doubled its workforce. Peloton expanded manufacturing capacity. Zoom was a sure bet stock to buy. The demand to improve the tech stack to enable remote workers drove major adoptions across industries, boosting demand for products from Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and other tech vendors. Companies were hiring talent, projecting an over-optimistic growth curve. In some cases, big tech was hiring talent to prevent a competitor from hiring them!

Supply Chain Hangover: Covid not only caused manufacturing plants to shut down for months, but it also affected shipping and transportation. There were many single points of failure in our global supply-chain system. Combine that with considerably higher demand for certain products, and the result was a shortage that drove inflation up. To this day, we have not fully recovered back to historical inflation levels.

The End of Cheap Money: For over a decade, the Zero Interest Rates Policy (ZIRP) fueled aggressive growth strategies. Cheap capital meant companies prioritized growth, and investors prioritized long-term strategies over short-term profits. The abrupt end led to a fundamental shift in business strategy. It didn't help that from 2022 onward, a provision in Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code changed how companies could classify their R&D expenses (such as the cost of a software engineer), going from being an incentive for innovation and startups to a hindrance.

Trade Uncertainty: New tariffs and threats of additional trade restrictions create business uncertainty. When companies can't predict with confidence their cost structure or market access, they delay investment and slow down hiring.

Performance Management: This is not a cynical point since CEOs have explicitly called out employee performance as a reason for cuts and hiring freezes. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the “Year of Efficiency” to justify layoffs at the company. If you ask people working in big tech, they will agree that teams became bloated, and some people were doing little work.

AI Adoption Reality Check

AI will upend major job roles, like other major technological advancements have done. It'll do it faster than the previous shifts, making it harder for society to adapt during the transition period. There are 175 million people in the U.S. labor force in 1,057 unique roles (using the NAICS classification). A few of these roles will go through major transformations in the coming years, a few will take a decade or more, and many will take longer or won't be impacted at all.

On one hand, you have a role such as an airplane pilot that won't go away anytime soon. To create an autonomous plane requires a technology we don't have today, and society won't feel comfortable with it anytime soon. On the other hand, you have customer support and call center operators that are already being displaced by AI. Though there were setbacks in rushing it, it's almost certain that in the next five years we'll go from a 2.5 million labor force working on these roles to a tenth.

The question isn't whether AI will eventually reshape more occupations, but rather which ones, how quickly, and to what degree. Most predictions from the last few years have not only been wrong, but they were widely wrong! Most predictions about what's coming will be similarly widely incorrect. The solution to calm this anxiety is to embrace uncertainty and adaptability.

Gretchen Peri has been involved in helping governments around the world find better ways to use technology for more than two decades. For the last 14 years, she led the Global Public & Social Impact practice at Slalom Consulting. 

She is now bringing her international experience home to Washington state as the new CTO of Washington Technology Solutions (WaTech). 

WaTech was established in 2011 as Washington state's consolidated technology services agency. Pretty much wherever the state is using technology to deliver services, this agency is involved.

Peri is now working to implement an ambitious new strategic plan that she says is aimed at improving how Washington uses technology to serve residents. Peri is also the opening keynote speaker at the Bellevue Innovation Exchange Oct. 16 at Bellevue City Hall. 

GeekWire caught up with Peri to talk about how WaTech plans to use AI, cloud platforms, upgraded online services, and a cultural shift in focus to improve what it offers to state residents — and to do so at a time when state budgets are tight, and federal guidance and regulation around AI and tech is still evolving. The interview was edited for brevity and clarity.

GeekWire: What attracted you to this role? 

Peri: “I've spent the last 20 years of my career in management consulting, helping state and local governments leverage technology to better deliver on their business outcomes. At my previous firm, I led our global government education and nonprofit business. And as exciting as that was, I also found that I was making a small impact in a lot of different places. At this point in my career, I want to have a large impact in one place. That's what drew me to the state. And I'm so glad I'm here.”

GeekWire: What are your top three priorities as CTO?

Peri: “I'd say my three areas of focus are: 

From in line to online, we want to be able to deliver our services where people are, when they need it, and in whatever language they need to receive it in.”

GeekWire: The new 2025 IT strategic plan calls for the development of enterprise standards for emerging technologies, including AI, automation, and cloud platforms, to ensure security, equity, and appropriate use. How big a lift do you think that will be?

Peri: “One of the biggest lifts, I think, is actually cultural. Governments always design their services from how we operate, rather than thinking about how residents and customers actually need to receive our services. So it's that cultural shift that I think is going to be the most exciting transformation and probably the most work for us as we look to leverage emerging technologies, including AI, in the right way.

Another area where agencies are very interested in using new and emerging technologies is how we expose our enterprise knowledge base — with chatbots and other things that many jurisdictions are deploying right now. We've got very rich information but finding that information can be a challenge for our residents. So using our enterprise knowledge base to deliver the information to our residents is another area.

Computer vision is actually one of the really exciting areas, and we're seeing this as we look to do automated inspections to help keep our employees safe, or monitor the health of our natural environment. There are some really interesting AI use cases around identifying and monitoring the health of fish or different types of eelgrass in the Puget Sound and in our oceans. 

There's also conversational and translational AI. The technology has come to a point now where we are able to provide our content in hundreds of languages. And even in this area, we have groups, we have communities that speak unique languages. And so the advances in technology allow us to reach them and communicate with them much easier than it used to be.

Finally, (there is) agentic workflow. That's around automating our business operations at scale, starting with things that are straightforward and simple, like invoice matching or other types of things where we can make sure that we're validating the information, and then we can move on to the task at hand.”

GeekWire: It sounds like one of your biggest challenges might be around siloed information.

Peri: “Our problem is exactly like you said, we have silos within those departments that are managing their data. We actually have silos within law enforcement agencies, where they have their records management system and their dispatch system and their evidence management system. So bringing data together within agencies is our first challenge and then bringing data together from multiple agencies is going to be our second challenge.”

GeekWire: As you're trying to bring AI to all of this, it's more challenging if you have to send AI off to a whole bunch of different places.

Peri: “Exactly, and until we bring that data together, can we really identify and track the outcomes we're looking to generate? We can track outputs, how many people we're serving with this type of product or service, but we can't necessarily say that we're delivering a healthier population or a more resilient population. So that's the main focus of why we need to bring that data together to create a foundation upon which we can really start to measure those outcomes and move those levers.”

GeekWire: Federal guidance and regulations on AI and tech are still evolving. How do you plan to navigate uncertainty and evolution at the national level?

Peri: “I am still only one month in. (But it's about) leveraging the federal standards that have been in place for quite some time and making sure that we are providing our guidelines and regulations that match the culture of Washington and (how) we want to create a welcoming environment for everyone in this state. And that's about all I can say on the federal state discussion.”

GeekWire: Do the state's current budget challenges change what you need to do in the IT strategic plan?

Peri: “I think that in this budget constrained environment, it's even more important that we rely on our technology to be able to reach people who really need it right now and deliver services more digitally so that they can access them easier.”

GeekWire: If there's one thing you'd like Washington residents to be able to say a year from now about the services offered by WaTech, what would it be?

Peri: “I think of the quote: ‘I expect exceptional, but I'll settle for awesome'. When I look back, I want to be able to say that across the board when we get to interact with people at pivotal points in their lives, which we do as government, that we have provided exceptional customer service to them.”

Technology is compatible with existing semiconductor manufacturing methods.

A cross-institutional research team has published a paper where a breakthrough in (MRAM) development is detailed. According to a blog post published by Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), which spearheaded the efforts, they have managed to overcome a major challenge that hampered the development and adoption of this kind of non-volatile memory. The researchers claim that their spin–orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) is a true next-gen breakthrough as it offers ~1ns switching speeds, and data retention exceeding 10 years, among its multitude of attractions.

 




This latest SOT-MRAM development comes from a cross-institutional collaboration between Taiwan's National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), leading chip foundry TSMC, Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan, Stanford University, and National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in Taiwan. We've covered the same team's earlier advances in building a SOT-MRAM array chip (Jan 2024) but much progress has been made since then.

The key advance presented in the recently published paper is the introduction of a tungsten layer to generate the spin currents. Specifically, the team managed to stabilize the rare beta-phase of Tungsten, which is crucial for increased performance – and will be even more important for eventual mass production of SOT-MRAM devices.

Last year, we noted that NYCU's SOT-MRAM was capable of latencies up to 10ns. Now it has been improved to ~1ns, rivaling SRAM, reveals testing of a 64kb array the scientists built. For further context, that is slightly faster than DRAM (DDR5 has latency around 14ms) and considerably faster than 3D TLC NAND (which has read latencies between 50 and 100 microseconds).

Don't forget, though, that this new SOT-MRAM brings the benefits of non-volatility. Other trumpeted advances delivered by the latest SOT-MRAM device demo were:

The research paper reveals that “the insertion of thin layers of cobalt can be used to stabilize β-tungsten under back-end-of-line-compatible thermal conditions.” With the new composite layers, the SOT-MRAM was tested to withstand extreme temperatures (up to 400 °C) for 10 hours, and even 700 °C for 30 mins.

With TSMC scientists among the collaborators, it isn't surprising to hear that these new SOT-MRAM devices are being designed for large-scale integration under existing semiconductor industry-compatible processes. Almost inevitably, the SOT-MRAM is now being pitched at the AI data center market, as well as low-power computing applications at the edge, where speed and non-volatility will also help spur adoption.

The worst RTX 5070 Ti in the world, or the best RX 580?

We've seen countless repair stories, shunt mods, and even custom-designed GPUs before, but nothing quite compares to a project like this. Marrying together one of the most iconic graphics cards ever released — AMD's RX 580 — with a modern-day heavyweight like the RTX 5070 Ti in the most unexpected way possible, Brazilian YouTuber and technician Paulo (from Paulo Games) has just performed a miracle. He sacrificed the soul of a GPU to breathe life into another, birthing a Frankenstein monstrosity that actually works.

Originally spotted by Videocardz, our journey starts in Brazil, where a dead RTX 5070 Ti got carbonized in a lightning surge so badly, the shock burnt a literal hole through its PCB. That means a sudden arc flowed across the GPU that was beyond any voltage the card could handle, and in the process, a part of the board ruptured, specifically the top-left corner where the VRMs sit. At this point, any sane person would consider a tax write-off as the best possible course of action for an expensive, dead GPU, but not our host.

See, the core was fine, and even the memory; it was only the power delivery systems that were affected, which implied a way out was possible — all you needed was some (insanely) clever bit of circuitry work. Aided by schematics and a few wires, just bridge together the lost traces, jump a few components, and make sure nothing short-circuits. Easy, right? Wrong.

There were no core voltages in the 5070 Ti, and the card only showed signs of life when it was tricked into supplying current to the PCIe power and memory voltage lanes.

This is where the RX 580 makes its entry. It's a donor board, so it actually doesn't have a GPU, but it does have a working power delivery system with VRMs that can serve as the lifeblood for another card. Thus, we begin the surgery, carefully siphoning power from the RX 580 to the RTX 5070 Ti's main voltage lines: MSVDD and NVDD.

Paulo initially planned to solder 14 power wires between both cards, but then reduced that number down to just six after some experimentation, and also added a 3V line for PEX (logic enable). Lastly, an aftermarket GPU cooler was mounted on the RX 580's PCB — which itself was sitting on top of the 5070 Ti — to keep this incendiary apparatus under control.

It's worth noting that AMD and Nvidia handle power management very differently, so that introduced another layer of challenge (and risk); therefore, the wires connecting the VRMs were shielded heavily to ensure they could handle the heat from the high voltage flowing through the cards.

Following the necessary precautions, which included a fire extinguisher, Paulo also repaired broken video output traces so the card could actually be tested. Once everything was plugged in, our "Brasília" (Frankstein in Portuguese) GPU actually powered on, posts, drawing around ~19W upon startup.

After fiddling around with video drivers, they achieved a stable image, which confirms the experiment worked. They stopped before doing any stress-testing because that would certainly melt the wires, or at least impose some level of serious danger. This is where Paul teases a second part where all warnings are thrown out the window in the name of science — or, in other words, refining the makeshift power delivery system to actually make it stable enough to play games.

The first thing that surprised me about Lenovo's 2025 16-inch Legion Pro 7i was the size of the box. I dig through a lot of laptops here at Gizmodo, and Lenovo's 16-inch laptop seemed like an 18-incher judging by the packaging. By its heft, it felt like it too. Then I opened it up and learned what it was.

The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i itself isn't overly large, though good luck slipping it into your backpack's laptop pouch. The overt weight was intensified by the 400W power brick used to give this beast of a laptop enough juice to play all your favorite games. I'm not about to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The brick and the laptop are inextricably linked, making a big thick device bigger and thicker.

The power brick is the size of my two fists put together. You could stick it in a wall and hold up a structure that may imminently collapse. It's heavy enough that anybody who drops it on their foot runs the risk of flattened toes, as if a Looney Tunes character dropped an anvil on their southern digits. I could go on about the weighty power brick because it's indicative of what kind of device the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is. This gaming laptop will stay at home, where its loud fans have enough runway to blast the back wall with warm air. In exchange, it offers a truly delectable OLED display that helps set it apart from some other expensive laptops at its roughly $3,600 price (though you'll find the device going for between $2,700 and $3,000 depending on storage options) with these top-end specs.

Lenovo Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, 2025)

The Legion Pro 7i (16-inch, 2025) is not the kind of device to take with you, but if you want a stay-at-home laptop with a bright, beautiful display and performance to boot, this is a great choice.

Pros

Cons

The last Legion Pro 7i I reviewed back in 2024 was one of my favorites of the year. It had everything I wanted, and it felt comfortable to boot. In 2025, Lenovo redesigned the chassis and added even more RGB lighting facing the desk and on the rear thermal shelf. The company also inexplicably replaced the “O” key with the Legion logo, and I'm not sure I need any more branding to remind me this is a Legion device than with that pretty screen. With a new Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 mobile GPU, benchmarks prove the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is a step above its last iteration. That's necessary, considering the gaming laptop costs a little over $300 more than its predecessor.

Is it still my everything laptop? Yes, though only for a very specific use case. Lugging this beast to and from my office was a chore. The laptop lid became a mess of scuffs and thumbprints as I manhandled it. The thought of carrying a 400W power brick with me is enough to make me wish I could live a hermetic lifestyle and never leave the house again.

Lenovo's penchant for pretty OLED displays on its gaming devices enchanted me enough with the ultra-expensive Legion Go 2. Having it here, again, makes suffering through any small pain points of a big, thick laptop worth the hassle. Organic light-emitting diode display (OLED) technology allows for deeper black levels—often described as “inky”—and excellent contrast. Like the $3,300 HP Omen Max 16's OLED display, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i goes up to 2,560 x 1600 resolution and tops out at 240Hz refresh rate with Nvidia GSync support.

Lenovo's screen is extra glossy, which enhances the OLED's pretty features at the cost of reflections from a sunny room. The Legion Pro 7i is already not travel-friendly, and taking it outside won't offer anywhere close to a premium experience when you're struggling to see anything between the glare. In the right environment, like my room with the shades pulled down, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is bright enough to offer enough glow during daytime, though you need to be careful positioning the screen facing windows.

The dual 2W speakers have very clear, balanced sound thanks to dual subwoofers. There's a small hint of spatial audio as well, though you'll need to turn up the volume to get a sense of the directional sound. It's barely loud enough to eclipse the noise of the fan blowing, which seems to kick in even if the gaming laptop is plugged in. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i can be your all-in-one suite for making your games look and sound good, as they should for this price.

Though the new 16-inch Legion Pro 7i appears very different from the 2024 version, they feel very similar once you start clacking on its keys. That's not a bad thing. The laptop's keys and their 1.5mm of travel have a nice bounce to them that makes it easy to type on. Even though the keyboard features a full numpad, there is enough separation between the keys that I never got my fingers twisted when flexing my WASD instincts.

The off-center trackpad is nothing to write home about, but since you'll likely be keeping this laptop at home, you'll end up using a mouse most of the time anyway. Though I don't hate the feel of the palm rests, I wish Lenovo paid a little more attention to the overall structure of the laptop. There's a slight keyboard flex toward the center of the device you'll feel if you start to lean your weight down during an intense match.

It's not enough to make me concerned about breaking the laptop, though, for the price I expect more. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i weighs in at 5.67 pounds, which is less than last year's model but will still feel heavy if you hold it aloft in one hand. It's thicker than other gaming laptops with an RTX 5080 GPU from 2025, such as the Razer Blade 16, but if you plan to make this laptop your main creative suite, you won't be too disappointed considering that bright, beautiful screen. There are two USB-A ports and a headphone jack on the right-hand side, plus one more on the left alongside two USB-C and an HDMI port on the left. There's one additional electronic switch to turn the 5-megapixel webcam on and off. The only thing missing is a dedicated SD card port to help creators avoid a dongle.

The proprietary power cable port also hangs out on the left, and with my home setup, it meant wrapping the power brick down and around the back of my desk. The two USB-C ports are Thunderbolt 4, meaning they can supply up to 100W of power to the PC. That's not nearly enough to top off the PC when running games, even if that's overkill for what's necessary on a mobile RTX 5080 GPU. The 400W power brick would be more necessary for an RTX 5090 GPU variant. There are some versions of the laptop with an RTX 5090 and 64GB of RAM that I saw floating around on Amazon for the same MSRP.

The real kicker for all this is just how strong a performance I got from the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i compared to other 16-inch laptops. My review unit came with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage to go along with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU and RTX 5080 GPU. In multiple synthetic benchmark tests, the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i slightly outperformed other gaming laptops like the HP Omen Max 16 and Alienware 16 Area-51. In Geekbench 6 CPU tests, the laptop managed to squeak out a few hundred points more in multi-core tests compared to other laptops.

For gaming, you just need to remember this laptop may still not do everything you want it to do, even with its RTX 5080 GPU strapped in with that obtuse power brick. In a game like Cyberpunk 2077, when pushing tracing to ultra settings, you'll need DLSS on “balanced” settings to achieve 60 fps when playing at the full 2,560 x 1,600 resolution. In games like Black Myth: Wukong, where the expectation is you're using Nvidia's AI upscaling, you'll easily attain more than 76 fps with all the ray tracing options enabled.

Alan Wake 2, which tanks performance once you start enabling ray tracing options, ran at around 40 to 45 fps on the highest settings with some path tracing. That was with DLSS on “balanced settings.” Other games that can hurt performance, like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, manage to equalize around a stable 60 fps when you stop yourself from maximizing path tracing. As much as you may hope an RTX 5080 will hit the peak performance, you'll inevitably have to accept some trade-offs for a steady frame rate. With the excellent display, games look crisp and detailed in a way that few machines can match, though only in just the right conditions.

Big gaming laptops don't have good battery life. It's a fact of the necessary power used for the GPU, but when you start stacking on RGB lights, bright OLED screens, and all the other fixings, you can't expect anything more than three hours of battery life on a good day. The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is no exception. When doing my basically daily grind, with several Chrome windows open plus Slack, I can barely make it past 2.5 hours before the PC is throwing a tantrum and won't be satisfied until I plug in its massive 400W sippy cup.

The 16-inch Legion Pro 7i is not the kind of laptop to run around town with, even if you intend to use a smaller 100W charger plugged into one of its Thunderbolt 4 ports. That may be enough for some light gaming, but you'll then have to accept you'll mar your big, beautiful laptop with whatever junk you have swimming in your bag.

After enough time with the 16-inch Legion Pro 7i, I started to admire its qualities and ignore its deficiencies. Its bright OLED screen has enough to help smooth over lingering wrinkles. If I truly wanted something more portable, I'd have to look at devices like the Razer Blade (and spend the extra premium on a Razer product, not to mention deal with their less-than-stellar support) or opt for a 14-inch gaming laptop. An 18-incher like the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 may be better as a true desktop replacement. Still, I never felt like I was missing anything from Lenovo's all-in-one laptop, except for a baby carrier to lug this laptop and its power brick around with me.

Three individual chargers taking up space on your desk or night table is frustrating as hell: A brick for the laptop, a cable for the phone, and another one for the wireless earbuds. Tangled mess of wires and used-up outlets that will leave you questioning why the heck we live in the year 2025 and still we can't get away from this mess.

Good news? Amazon recently lowered the price of the Anker Prime 250W charging station to $99 from the original price of $169, and this device can juice all your devices (it has 6 ports: 4 USB-C and 2 USB-A) simultaneously from one slim unit on the desk or table next to your bed. This is a flash sale at an all-time low price, and once Amazon burns through its inventory, that's it.

The Anker Prime 250W charger employs Gallium Nitride (GaN) tech that is a semiconductor that conducts electricity approximately seven times better than the conventional silicon-based chargers. This translates to less power being dissipated as heat and additional power being put towards charging your device. The end product is a desktop power station that is hardly over 4 inches wide but can produce a whopper 250 watts through six ports at once — four USB-C ports along the front and two USB-A ports hidden on the side.

The initial USB-C port produces up to 140W of power which is sufficient power to power a MacBook Pro to 50% in 25 minutes. This is ideal in those instances where you want your laptop charged quickly prior to a meeting or flight. The remaining three USB-C ports reach a maximum of 100W each, which is still extremely fast and sufficient to fast-charge any smartphone, tablet, or even the majority of existing laptops found on the market today. The two USB-A ports produce 22.5W each  which is suitable for older peripherals or devices that are yet to convert to USB-C.

What makes the charger even more special is that 2.26-inch LCD front display: The display lets you exactly know how much power each port is putting out in real time so that you can instantly know what devices are charging and what the charging speed is. There is even a manual control knob on one side that lets you set charging priorities as well as toggle between different power modes without having to unplug anything.

The four modes that the charger presents are AI Power Mode (automatically balances power distribution), Dual-Laptop Mode (divides power equally between the first two USB-C ports, operating at 70W each, to charge two laptops), Port Priority Mode (maxes power over one designated port), and Low Current Mode (caps the charging speed to facilitate overnight charging to preserve the health of the battery). The latter mode is a lifesaver if you are the kind who charges overnight and wishes to prolong the lifespan of your device battery by preventing repeated fast charging.

The intelligent control dial makes it very easy to switch between these modes. Just turn the dial to go through the menu, press to choose, and you're set. You can even connect the charger to the Anker app over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to control it remotely and monitor it: The app will schedule the charging hours so the devices will be charged when you need them to be charged and you can even use the display as a desktop clock if nothing is connected.

Despite having 250W of power and six ports, the Anker Prime is no bigger than 4.18 x 1.58 x 3.64 inches in size and weighs as little as 22.58 ounces. This compact size is possible with the aid of GaN tech, the type that allows components to be packed together a bit tighter without the components over-heating. The build quality also feels high-end, with a brushed silver metal construction that looks great on any desk or nightstand. The charger includes ActiveShield 3.0 tech, which tracks temperature a whopping 6 million times per day to ensure your devices stay protected during charging.

At $99 rather than $169, this is the lowest price the Anker Prime 250W has ever sold at. It's uncommon to see a charger this strong with so many features go as low as $100, let alone one that is made by a reputable company like Anker that supports this with a 24-month warranty. When this stock is gone, there can be no guarantee that Amazon will replenish stock or that they will release the product at this price point.

In the high-stakes, hyper-accelerated world of artificial intelligence (AI), one company has stood as the undisputed king and sole purveyor of computational picks and shovels in a digital gold rush: Nvidia.

For years, Nvidia's combination of powerful GPUs and its proprietary CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) software platform has created a nearly unbreachable moat, making it the default choice for anyone serious about training large-scale AI models. But empires that seem invincible rarely are.

Last week, the foundation of that empire was shaken. In a blockbuster announcement, AMD revealed a massive, multifaceted agreement with OpenAI, the world's most influential AI research and deployment company.

This deal isn't just another hardware order; it's a strategic realignment. AMD will supply its Instinct MI-series GPUs for OpenAI's foundational model training, and perhaps more importantly, OpenAI will gain deep access to AMD's open-source software stack.

This deal is a direct challenge to Nvidia's dominance, a validation of AMD's long-game strategy, and a clear signal that the AI infrastructure landscape is about to become a fiercely contested battlefield.

So what does this partnership mean for the balance of power in AI — and for Nvidia's once-unshakable dominance? Let's break down the strategic significance. As always, we'll close with my Product of the Week, a new embedded processor from AMD that will have broad implications for a variety of markets and machines.

To understand the significance of this moment, one must appreciate AMD's history as the perpetual, scrappy underdog.

For decades, the company has fought a two-front war against giants. In the CPU market, it was the perennial number two to Intel's seemingly unassailable dominance. In the GPU market, it has constantly battled Nvidia for a distant second place. Yet, under the leadership of CEO Lisa Su, AMD has undergone a remarkable transformation fueled by brilliant engineering and the hubris of its rivals.

AMD's comeback against Intel was driven by its revolutionary chiplet architecture in Zen-based processors. While Intel struggled with its monolithic chip designs, AMD cleverly combined smaller, high-yield chiplets into a single, powerful processor. This approach proved to be more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective, allowing AMD to leapfrog Intel in performance in both the consumer and, critically, the data center markets.

Against Nvidia, the fight has been tougher. Nvidia's CUDA platform is the very definition of a “sticky” ecosystem. It's a proprietary software layer that allows developers to harness the parallel processing power of Nvidia GPUs. With over a decade of development and a vast library of tools, it became the industry standard.

This software moat was so powerful that even if AMD produced a competitive GPU, the immense effort required for developers to switch from CUDA made it a non-starter. AMD's answer was not to build a better walled garden, but to bulldoze those walls.

AMD's counter-strategy to CUDA is ROCm (Radeon Open Compute platform), an open-source software stack. For a small developer, the benefits of CUDA's maturity are compelling. But for a massive, sophisticated player like OpenAI, a proprietary, closed system like CUDA is a gilded cage. It creates vendor lock-in, limits customization, and places your entire operational future in the hands of a single supplier.

This is where AMD's open-source approach becomes a strategic masterstroke. By providing an open platform, AMD is telling OpenAI, “Here are the keys to the kingdom. Look at the source code, modify it, optimize it for your specific workloads, and build upon it as you see fit.”

For a company operating at the absolute cutting edge of AI, this level of control and transparency is invaluable. It allows them to fine-tune the hardware and software stack for maximum efficiency, a critical factor when training models that cost tens of millions of dollars in compute time.

This AMD deal is a powerful indicator that, in the long term, the largest AI players will inevitably favor open platforms that offer flexibility and prevent them from being held hostage by a single, powerful partner. AMD's partnership with OpenAI puts immense pressure on the in-progress Nvidia-OpenAI negotiations for their next-generation infrastructure, as Nvidia must now contend with a viable and arguably more flexible alternative.

Massive success often breeds complacency, and there are whispers in Silicon Valley that Nvidia's overwhelming market dominance has made it difficult to work with. When you are the only game in town, you can dictate prices, terms, and timelines. This “Nvidia tax” has become a significant pain point for its largest customers. That dynamic creates a powerful opening for a competitor like AMD, which is hungry, flexible, and willing to collaborate as a true partner rather than just a supplier.

AMD's strategy is to be the accessible, high-performance alternative. By offering comparable (and in some cases, superior in memory capacity) hardware with a more attractive total cost of ownership (TCO) and an open software model, AMD is making a compelling case to every major cloud provider and AI company tired of writing blank checks to Nvidia.

The AMD-OpenAI deal could not come at a more critical time. The global economic landscape is fraught with uncertainty. The impact of U.S. tariffs on advanced semiconductors from China is reshaping supply chains, and fears of a recession are forcing companies to scrutinize every dollar of their capital expenditures.

In this environment, securing long-term contracts with foundational customers like OpenAI is paramount — a strategic land grab to lock down market share before the inevitable, eventual softening of the current AI hype cycle. The company that secures the largest share of the infrastructure build-out now will be the one to weather the storm and dominate the next decade.

Looking ahead, AMD's next move will likely be to replicate this strategy aggressively. Expect to see it announce deeper partnerships with other major AI labs and cloud providers, leveraging the OpenAI deal as the ultimate validation of its platform.

AMD will continue to pour resources into ROCm to close the feature gap with CUDA, making the switch for developers ever easier. AMD is no longer just competing on hardware; it's competing on philosophy. In the world of large-scale AI, the philosophy of openness is a powerful weapon.

The AMD-OpenAI partnership is far more than a simple sales announcement; it's a declaration that the AI hardware market is now a two-horse race. It validates AMD's immense progress in both its hardware and, most critically, its open-source software strategy.

By providing a compelling, high-performance alternative to Nvidia's walled garden, AMD has given the world's most important AI company a powerful new choice. This deal introduces real competition, threatens Nvidia's astronomical profit margins, and signals a fundamental shift towards a more open, collaborative, and ultimately, more innovative future for the entire field of artificial intelligence.





A precision robotic arm positions a high-performance chip, reflecting AMD's role in powering industrial automation, medical imaging, and enterprise infrastructure with its EPYC Embedded 9000 processors.

In a world captivated by consumer gadgets and flashy AI chatbots, it's easy to overlook the foundational technologies that actually make the modern world run.

This week's standout product isn't something you'll unbox at home, but its impact will be felt everywhere from the factory floor to the operating room. We're talking about AMD's new EPYC Embedded 9000 series processors — a line of silicon brains designed to power the next generation of industrial, medical, and enterprise infrastructure with staggering efficiency and a promise of long-term stability.

At their core, the EPYC Embedded 9000 chips are built on AMD's cutting-edge Zen 5 architecture, but they are tuned for a very different mission than their consumer-facing cousins. In the industrial world, the most important metric isn't just raw speed; it's performance-per-watt. These processors are engineered to deliver maximum computational power with minimal energy consumption and heat output.

That efficiency is critical for devices that operate 24/7 in rugged, often space-constrained environments — think of the controller for a robotic arm on an assembly line or the imaging computer inside an MRI machine. Less power and heat mean higher reliability, lower operating costs, and the ability to build more compact, powerful systems.

Just as important is AMD's commitment to long-term availability. Industrial customers operate on timelines that stretch for a decade or more. They cannot afford to design a multi-million-dollar piece of medical equipment around a processor that will be discontinued in two years. AMD's stable AM5 socket platform and long-lifecycle support give these customers the confidence to invest in development, knowing the core technology will be available and supported for the life of their products.

This long-term view is bolstered by the platform's incredible flexibility and future-proofing. With expansive connectivity, including Wi-Fi 6E, PCIe Gen 5, and a suite of high-speed I/O, system architects can design a platform today that is ready for the technologies of tomorrow.

That PCIe Gen 5 slot might connect to an advanced sensor in a current machine, but it's ready to handle the data firehose from a next-generation AI vision system without a redesign. This scalability allows a single, well-designed platform to serve a vast range of applications, from a simple network firewall to a complex, AI-powered diagnostic tool, simply by choosing a different SKU from the 9000 series.

That scalability highlights AMD's key competitive advantage: its partnership-driven ecosystem. AMD isn't trying to build every industrial machine itself. Instead, it provides a robust, flexible, open set of building blocks to a vast network of specialized partners.

Companies in industrial automation, medical technology, and enterprise networking can take the EPYC Embedded 9000 series and build highly customized solutions tailored to their specific markets. This collaborative model fosters innovation and allows AMD's technology to penetrate markets far more effectively than a closed, top-down approach ever could.

The applications are as vast as they are critical. In smart factories, these processors will power the machine vision systems that inspect products with superhuman speed and accuracy. In hospitals, they will process complex data from CT scanners and ultrasound machines, enabling faster and more accurate diagnoses. In data centers, they will run the next generation of high-speed storage and networking equipment that forms the backbone of our digital world.

In essence, the AMD EPYC Embedded 9000 series is the quiet enabler of the AI-powered industrial future. It's a testament to a long-term strategy focused on delivering not just performance, but efficiency, reliability, and a stable platform that partners can build on with confidence. It may not have the glamour of a new smartphone, but it's a far more fundamental piece of our technological future — and my Product of the Week.

Salesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.

The customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.

A notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to “if/then” situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.

Users can tap into “reasoning” models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these “reasoning” agents.

Salesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.

The company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.

Slack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.

Salesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.

This latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.

Last week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools — many of which were already available — for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.

Anthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte's 500,000 global employees — its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.

Salesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers — significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson. 

This is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.

In case you haven't heard, it's time to say goodbye to Windows 10. As of October 14, 2025, it's no longer a secure operating system to keep using, as Microsoft will not issue further updates. That doesn't mean you won't be able to use it anymore, but like it or not, you'll need to upgrade eventually.

If you have a Windows PC from the past five years or so, you can probably upgrade to Windows 11 without new hardware. But for anyone coming from an older PC, this might be a good opportunity to buy a new laptop. Below you'll find my favorite Windows laptops, all of which come with Windows 11 preinstalled.

For more laptop recommendations, check out our Best 2-in-1 Laptops, Best Gaming Laptops, and Best Budget Laptops. Meanwhile, our overall Best Laptops guide includes the best Chromebooks and best MacBooks, too. Still unsure? Read our guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop.

If it's been a while since you've shopped around for a Windows laptop, the Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) might be the biggest surprise to you. It runs on a Qualcomm-powered ARM processor, making it every bit as efficient and long-lasting as a MacBook. It also comes with a gorgeous, 3:2 aspect ratio screen with stylish rounded corners. It's really the battery life here, though, that will feel legitimately surprising if you're coming from an old Windows laptop or a desktop.

I waited a long time for a Windows machine like this Surface Laptop, which came out in 2024—something that could truly compete with the MacBook Air. And it does. The Snapdragon X2 Elite chip was just announced, but we likely won't see an update to the Surface Laptop for another five or six months, making this a solid purchase. One caveat: You might come across the Surface Laptop 13, which came out in 2025, and is cheaper. I haven't tested that one yet myself, but it does lack some of the features I like in the 7th Edition, such as the 3:2 screen.

If it's been a while since you've paid attention to advances in the Windows laptop ecosystem, the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review) will probably come as a shocker. Despite regularly costing somewhere between $750 and $1,000, depending on the discount, the Dell 14 Plus comes with an astounding 32 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. In the past, you would have paid handsomely for those kinds of specs. Even compared to the competition today, the Dell 14 Plus stands out for its value.

It's especially impressive if you factor in the high-resolution screen and 90-Hz refresh rate. While it's not my favorite laptop screen in the world due to the heavy-handed matte finish, the screen is certainly fast, sharp, and colorful. Just pay attention to the price, knowing that it's frequently been discounted to at least $650 (make sure you double-check the specs before you buy).

The Asus Zenbook A14 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is stellar. It's over a full pound lighter than most of the other laptops on this list, and is even a half-pound lighter than the MacBook Air. It really does feel incredibly light in your hands, which makes it an ideal laptop for students or anyone taking their work on the go. That extra pound is noticeable if you're carrying it around in your bag all day. On top of that, it gets you great battery life, thanks to the Snapdragon X Plus, as well as a solid OLED display.

Similar to the Dell 14 Plus, you may be impressed by just how much laptop you get for just $600 or $700. No, the Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) doesn't have premium components or a high-end design, but it still delivers. In particular, I'm talking about battery life. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon X inside, the Vivobook 14 gets great battery life, especially when compared to laptops at this price in the past. I have even seen the price drop as low as $550 during the Amazon Big Deal Days. That's a killer price on this budget laptop.

While the MacBook Pro continues to rule the roost when it comes to laptops for content creators, there are some solid options on the Windows side of things, my favorite of which is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i 16 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). With graphics options up to an RTX 5070 and the Core Ultra 285H onboard, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 was impressively powerful in my testing. The OLED display on my review unit was glorious, but there's an even sharper and brighter tandem OLED option available, too. It doesn't have near the battery life of the MacBook Pro. But if you're a designer, video editor, or user of any heavy GPU-based application, the Yoga Pro 9i 16 is a great Windows laptop for you.

Razer

Perhaps more than any other company, Razer has been refining the idea of the ultimate gaming laptop ever since its founding. The Razer Blade 16 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) certainly feels like a crown jewel in its lineup. It's thinner than ever, wholeheartedly embraces OLED, and features the best graphics options possible, up to and including the Nvidia RTX 5090. Despite my lack of enthusiasm for Multi-Frame Generation, the primary feature of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs, I was quite impressed by the game performance of this compact gaming laptop. As you might guess, however, the Razer Blade 16 is incredibly expensive. Fortunately, you can currently buy the starting configuration for $500 off, bringing the price down to $1,800, which comes with one terabyte of storage and an RTX 5060.

Windows laptops haven't always been known for being lookers. The Asus Zenbook S 16 undoes that stereotype. This thing is absolutely gorgeous—and not in a way that tries to specifically mimic the MacBook. It has its own aesthetic going with its white "ceraluminum" material, and I love it. It's also remarkably thin, has an expansive touchpad, and a sharp OLED display. It's the complete package. It's the only Windows laptop that actually surpasses the MacBook Air in terms of thickness.

The only problem is that the Zenbook S 16 is quite expensive, and prices haven't dropped like I hoped they would. It's an impressive configuration, though, sporting 24 GB of RAM and a terabyte of storage. On top of that, it's one of the longest-lasting Windows laptops in terms of battery life. For a smaller model, check out the Zenbook S 14, which is very similar, except it uses an Intel chip instead.

One of the strengths of the Windows platform is support for touchscreens, and the Yoga 9i is the best of the bunch. It's a true 2-in-1 laptop that has a 360-degree hinge that lets you rotate the screen all the way around. It's probably too big to use much as an actual tablet, but it's handy to be able to flip the screen around when sharing your screen or watching movies. Performance and battery life check out, and the high-resolution OLED display looks fantastic.

Framework

Framework

There's no laptop out there quite like the Framework Laptop 13 (8/10, WIRED Recommends). For the uninitiated, Framework has created a fully accessible and self-upgradeable system for its computers, much of which is completely tool-less. It's seriously impressive. If you're coming from an old desktop PC and like the upgradeable nature of your tower, the Framework Laptop can fill that void. You'll need to opt for the Framework Laptop 16 if you want better graphics for gaming, but either way, you're getting a unique device that could stay with you for the long haul.

One of the best parts of Windows is its flexibility. I love that it can work just as well for PC gamers as it does on a detachable 2-in-1 like the Surface Pro. The Microsoft laptop (6/10, WIRED Review) has never been so good, either. With the Snapdragon X Plus or Elite inside, battery life and performance are both great, important for a device that needs to be both a portable tablet and a full PC. There's even a brilliant OLED option, which greatly enhances the image quality of the screen. A smaller version came out earlier this year, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review), and it's more affordable. Either way, though, you'll need to buy an appropriate Type Cover Keyboard to unlock the full capabilities of the Surface Pro.

Windows 11 vs. Windows 10: What Are the Differences?

There's a lot that can be said about the difference between Windows 11 and Windows 10. It breaks down into three major categories though.

Interface: The Start Menu is now centered in the Taskbar and looks a bit different. Visually it's quite different, but it still functions the same, offering you quick access to applications and documents. Beyond the Start Menu, just about every app will have a different visual flair, with rounded corners and a streamlined aesthetic. While you can still do you could do in Windows 10, expect things like Settings, Notifications, and System Tray to all feel different. You'll even find a new Widgets tray that can be activated over on the left side of the Taskbar. Unfortunately, the Taskbar can no longer be moved to different side of the screen.

Hardware requirements: This is where most of the frustration around Windows 11 stems from. No one likes being forced to buy new hardware, and while requirements like having at least 4 GB of RAM or 64 GB of storage seem straightforward, the need for a security chip called TPM 2.0 has forced a lot of Windows 10 users to have to upgrade otherwise-good motherboards and CPUs just to move to an operating system they didn't want to begin with.

Performance features: There are tons of new features in Windows 11 that help Windows play nicer with accessories and third-party software. One of my favorite examples is HDR support. Windows 11 finally fixes the HDR problem that made using a proper HDR monitor so troublesome, especially in games using Auto HDR. Speaking of games, Windows 11 has features like Game Mode, DirectStorage, and optimizations for windowed games, all of which make for a faster, smoother PC gaming experience.

What to Look for in a Windows Laptop

You'll want to read our extensive guide on How to Choose the Right Laptop, but for the basics, you'll want to decide what category of laptop you need. Most people should buy a 13-inch or 14-inch laptop, and spending around $750-$1,000 is a good place to start. You should expect a laptop around this price to get good battery life, have a decent screen, perform well enough for basic tasks, and have a comfortable keyboard and touchpad. You should also expect at least 16 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage. Anything more than that gets into premium territory where you're paying for higher specs, more performance, or extra features. If you want something with a discrete GPU for either gaming or creative workflows, you'll need to spend more than this.

A laptop like the Dell 14 Plus is the ideal example of what you can get while shopping in this price range. You can even find laptops with OLED panels, up to one terabyte of storage, depending on how good discounts happen to be. I would consider anything under $750 to be a cheap laptop, and will therefore come with some significant compromises, especially around the quality of the panel and the touchpad. Fortunately, laptops that use the  Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip get great battery life, despite often falling under $750 in price.

Here's a list of important specs to consider:

CPU: For thin and light laptops, I would recommend one of the Snapdragon X, X Plus, or X Elite chips. They get the best battery life and performance for their class of laptop. As an alternative, the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is also quite good.

GPU: As of now, the Intel's Lunar Lake chips, such as the Core Ultra 7 258V, have the best integrated graphics. For discrete options, you'll want to pick something with one of the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs, such as the RTX 5060. The biggest leap in performance there is between the RTX 5070 and the RTX 5070 Ti, which increases VRAM to 12 GB.

RAM (or memory): Stick with at least 16 GB if you can. Since the advent of the Copilot+ designation, it ha become the new standard. You'll even find laptops as cheap as $600 that have 16 GB of memory. Gamers and content creators should upgrade to 32 GB if possible.

Storage: Similar to memory, many laptops have moved to 512 GB as the new standard, and you'll find lots of affordable laptops with 512 GB as the base configuration. Upgrading to one or two terabytes, where possible, will make your life that much easier, especially since many laptops don't offer expandable storage.

Display: Laptops are usually categorized by screen size, with 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch being the most common. You'll want to consider size, resolution, refresh rate, and panel type here.

Portability: Outside of display size, thickness of the chassis and weight are the primary factors here, determining how portable a laptop is to travel with. Other dimensions are important too, but more often than not, that is determined by the screen size.

Ports: Many laptops are limited to just USB-C and headphone jack these days, with some exceptions where USB-A or HDMI are included. Make sure your laptop has what you need, or else you'll need a USB Hub or laptop docking station to get more ports or to increase external display support.

Asus ROG Flow Z13

Asus ROG Flow Z13 for $2,170: One of the most unique Windows devices ever made, this gaming 2-in-1 will impress you with just how powerful it is, despite its form factor.

Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition for $1,300: I really like this uniquely-sized 15.3-inch laptop, though I have avoided recommending it very often due to its price. But when it drops under $1,000, it's a really solid deal, especially since it comes with a terabyte of storage.

Framework Laptop 12

Framework Laptop 12 for $549: This adorable little laptop is the perfect option for students and tinkerers, offering tons of upgradability in a small, affordable package.

Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 16 2-in-1 for $698: You won't find many 16-inch laptops at this price, which is what makes this worthy of mention. I wish the battery life and display were stronger, but for the price, it's a solid option.

Asus Vivobook Pro 15 for $1,500: Content creation-focused laptops tend to be really expensive, which is why I'm glad the Vivobook Pro 15 exists. It has solid specs, an OLED panel, and an RTX 4050 GPU inside to speed up creative applications and workflows.

Acer Swift 16 AI for $800: This is one of those laptops that has dramatically increased in value with its recent price drop. It's not the most attractive or trim laptop in the world, but the solid battery life, high display quality, and a terabyte of storage balance it out.

In the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army's mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled “EagleEye,” a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters. 

The launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri's co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.

Anduril describes EagleEye as a modular “family of systems” built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier's field of vision.

The company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.

The launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft's Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.

Then in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was “the largest effort of its kind” to outfit “every soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.”

Earlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.

“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey said in a blog post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”

EagleEye has a long history: the concept first appeared in Anduril's first pitch deck draft, before investors convinced the startup's team to focus on software like Lattice. 

“Going toe-to-toe with Microsoft and Magic Leap would have been demoralizing windmill-tilting driven by magical thinking,” Luckey said in a post on X in February. “Everything is different now. The world is ready, and so is Anduril.”

The Chinese chairman was also removed and will be replaced by a non-Chinese person with a "deciding vote" in due time.

The Dutch government has taken the "exceptional" step of seizing control of strategically important Dutch chip maker Nexperia from its Chinese owner, Wingtech, as nationalist instincts continue to shape the semiconductor industry.

The government says it is concerned that important technologies could be transferred to the Chinese parent company, according to Reuters. With this manoeuvre, it can block any such attempts, maintaining this "crucial technological knowledge and capabilities on Dutch and European soil."

Nexperia is one of the largest companies in the world when it comes to manufacturing simple silicon components such as the diodes and transistors, MOSFETs, and logic gates that are found in all manner of modern electronics. Wingtech has been on the United States "entity list" for the past year, highlighting it as a potential security concern. That list was expanded in September to include subsidiaries of those companies, suggesting Nexperia itself may have come up as a potential security concern.

Although not confirmed, that causal link is there, and the Dutch government has firmly taken control of the company. A Dutch judge ousted the Chairman, Zhang Xuezheng, earlier this month. Wingtech has now pledged to replace him with a non-Chinese person in due course.

The government will also now be able to block or reverse any management decisions it sees as harmful, though regular company operation will continue at its various facilities around the world, including factories in Germany and the UK.

The decision to take control of Nexperia came following "acute signals of serious administrative shortcomings and actions" at the company, according to the Dutch government. "These signals threaten the continuity and safeguarding of crucial technological knowledge and capabilities on Dutch and European soil."

"The loss of these capabilities could pose a risk to Dutch and European economic security," it added. For its part, Wingtech said it was speaking to lawyers and seeking government help to "protect the legitimate rights and interests of the company."

It's not clear what technologies in particular the Dutch government is keen to protect, but semiconductor companies all over the world are now seen as important for strategic defense reasons as they commercial opportunities. Modern processors are required for the latest high-tech drones and missile technologies, as well as high-end infrastructure and modern AI developments, making them technologies that governments the world over are looking to husband and protect.

As many countries around the world look to build up their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and control their own AI-data centers, we're starting to see more of a multi-polar world trading economy, more so than the highly interlinked one of recent years.

Rollercoaster Tycoon wasn't the most fashionable computer game out there in 1999. But if you took a look beneath the pixels—the rickety rides, the crowds of hungry, thirsty, barfing people (and the janitors mopping in their wake)—deep down at the level of the code, you saw craftsmanship so obsessive that it bordered on insane. Chris Sawyer, the game's sole developer, wrote the whole thing in assembly.

Certain programming languages, like Python or Go or C++, are called “high-level” because they work sort of like human language, written in commands and idioms that might fit in at a poetry slam. Generally speaking, a piece of software like a compiler transforms this into what the machine really reads: blocks of 1s and 0s (or maybe hex) that tell actual transistors how to behave. Assembly, the lowest of the “low-level” languages, has a near one-to-one correspondence with the machine's native tongue. It's coding straight to metal. To build a complex computer game from assembly is like weaving a tapestry from shedded cat fur.

Why would anyone do this? I recently asked Sawyer, who lives in his native Scotland. He told me that efficiency was one reason. In the 1990s, the tools for high-level programming weren't all there. Compilers were terribly slow. Debuggers sucked. Sawyer could avoid them by doing his own thing in x86 assembly, the lingua franca of Intel chips.

We both knew that wasn't the real reason, though. The real reason was love. Before turning to roller coasters, Sawyer had written another game in assembly, Transport Tycoon. It puts players in charge of a city's roads, rail stations, runways, and ports. I imagined Sawyer as a model-train hobbyist—laying each stretch of track, hand-sewing artificial turf, each detail a choice and a chore. To move these carefully crafted pixels from bitmaps to display, Sawyer had to coax out the chip's full potential. “RollerCoaster Tycoon only came about because I was familiar with the limits of what was possible,” he told me.

Working within the limits? A foreign idea, perhaps, in this age of digital abundance, when calling a single function in an AI training algorithm can engage a million GPUs. With assembly, you get one thing and one thing only, and it is the thing you ask for—even, as many a coder has learned the hard way, if it is wrong. Assembly is brutal and beautiful that way. It requires you to say exactly what you mean.

I've done assembly's creators a disservice. They wanted things to be easier, not harder. I imagine they were tired of loading up punchcards and flipping switches on their steampunk leviathans. Perhaps they dreamed of a world like ours, where computers can do so much with such minimal guidance.

The first assembly language, created in the 1940s by Kathleen Booth (though she has not always gotten her due, surprise surprise), hardly resembled language. Codes stood in for codes. To tell the machine to perform an operation—say, “0,0111” in machine code—you'd instead employ a series of letters and symbols, which a new piece of software, called an assembler, would translate into binary. Soon, the commands got human-­friendlier mnemonics like “MOV.”

To know assembly was to know the CPU itself—what it could do and, even more, what it couldn't. A chip's physical design, how the circuits connecting the logic gates of AND and XOR are actually laid, defines how it works. Its functions are pretty basic, breaking down instructions into elementary steps: Fetch something from memory and put it in a temporary cubby, known as a register. Decode it there. Perform some operations, like comparing two values, or adding them. Ship it back off the memory.

As chips advanced, new dialects of assembly evolved. The code that landed the first human on the moon was assembly—designed for only one chip, the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer. If you want to read the leaked source code of the Furby, you'll need fluency in 6502. To hack your Ti-83 calculator, you'll need z80. Learning the language of one chip—say, Intel's x86—and then moving to Arm is like studying Arabic in Beirut and then trying to get by in Tunis or Khartoum. Good luck.

I learned x86 assembly in college as a refugee from math. Where my classmates seemed to enjoy the drab incantations of Java, I loved the logic game that was assembly. It was easy to fail, but to fail in ways that were explainable if you looked at the circuits and registers. How masterful I felt coding in the simple commands of this not-quite-language; how fragile I knew that mastery to be. To say, put these bytes there—no, there, at that register, in those capacitors. Remember this. Forget that. To grind away, painting each figurine, one by one.

It's true that there's no longer much point in using assembly in the day-to-day work of coding. High-level languages are so efficient that their abstraction is almost always preferable. Even assembly's inventor moved on to other ventures; one of Booth's final papers, in the 1990s, used neural networks to match seals with their barks. Sawyer switched over too. He's been dabbling in home automation recently—lights, temperature sensors, sound systems, and the like, coded on Raspberry Pis using Python, which he initially found “quite off-putting,” he told me. But even on that tiny processor, it gets the job done just fine.

Then along comes something like DeepSeek to remind you that humans can still communicate better with our hardware. Earlier this year, the Chinese company that made these incredibly efficient AI models upended the narrative that AI advancement can come only from more chips and more energy. Assembly was one surprising reason. DeepSeek's engineers reached into the subfloor of Nvidia's chips, commanding each individual machine to compress data from 32 bits to 8 bits—sacrificing precision for efficiency—at precisely the right moments. Observers were stunned. You could do that? The DeepSeek engineers had tapped an art most others had forgotten.

I was similarly taken when, in 2023, researchers at DeepMind taught a machine x86 assembly, then asked it to improve on the long-standing sort() function in C. The AI made strange, unintuitive choices, performing odd jumps between registers, and in the end cut precisely one step. A fraction of a milli­second saved, perhaps. But happening countless times a day, now that the new algorithm has been officially adopted.

To me, it was a reminder that we humans created these machines, and even as they appear to spiral into complexity beyond our comprehension, they remain under our command. We can always make them work better. It was like what Sawyer said when he recounted his recent Raspberry Pi–enabled home coding experiment. It was probably just his imagination, but the display had been a little laggy, he thought. He'd redo the code if he could, he said. But alas, Sawyer and the machine did not speak the same assembly language.

The bug was introduced in a Sept 29 update, Windows 10 support ends October 14


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Here's an example of the most unfortunate timing for Microsoft and its OS users. The latest version of the Windows Media Creation Tool (MCT), released just a fortnight ago, “might close unexpectedly, displaying no error message,” admits Microsoft in a status update (h/t Windows Latest). Of course, Windows 10 goes EOL on October 14, and MCT was one of the most popular methods of preparing update media for Windows 11.

If you head on over to the linked Microsoft status page, you will see Microsoft has a prominent blue box advising users about the upcoming Windows EOL. In brief, it means “devices running Windows 10 will no longer receive fixes for known issues, time zone updates, technical support, or monthly security and preview updates containing protection from the latest security threats,” in Microsoft's words.

 




Scroll a little further down, though, and a wrinkle that could stall some upgraders is listed as ‘Confirmed' on October 10. Specifically, the Windows 11 MCT “might not work as expected on Windows 10.” A typical symptom will be that the tool closes unexpectedly, with no error message. Windows Latest was able to replicate this issue. Is ‘oof' the correct word?

 




Microsoft's terrible timing is quite comical, but thankfully, users still have at least a couple of pretty simple ways to migrate to the latest version of Windows, if that is what they have decided to do. The tech giant is working to fix the MCT issue, but in the meantime, willing Windows 11 migrants can try the following:

Remember, if your system isn't passing the Windows 11 upgrade minimum spec tests in Windows 10, the downloaded bootable ISO may need to be modified using a tool like Rufus – at your own risk. While you're at it, don't forget to enable local account setup if that is important for you.

We have a full and recently updated guide to bypassing Windows 11's TPM, CPU, and RAM requirements, which you may find useful. A number of Windows 10 stalwarts who wish to upgrade to something newer may instead be interested in testing one of the latest versions of Linux, like this one for older PCs, and one of these three for mainstream users.

SpaceX's Starship megarocket is back on the launch pad at Boca Chica, prepared and ready for its final flight test of the year. Flight 11, scheduled to lift off on Monday evening at the earliest, will also be the final test flight for this iteration of Starship, Version 2—if everything goes to plan.

The launch window will open at 7:15 p.m. Eastern on Monday, October 13, according to SpaceX. A livestream of the event will begin approximately 30 minutes before liftoff, which you can watch at SpaceX.com or the company's account on X. You can also tune in through any of the third-party webcasts below.

 

Last week, SpaceX shared photos of Starship's Super Heavy booster set up on its pad at Starbase, the company's launch site in Boca Chica, Texas. The rocket's upper stage, called Starship or “Ship” for short, is stacked on top of the booster ahead of its flight.

Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever built. Altogether, it stands about 400 feet (122 meters) tall. But SpaceX is going bigger: The next iteration of Starship—Version 3—will be even larger and capable of carrying 100 tons (363 metric tons) to orbit, according to CEO Elon Musk. Its first launch is expected sometime in early 2026.

But before SpaceX can roll out Version 3, the company needs this last test of Version 2 to go smoothly. It's last test, Flight 10, which lifted off from Starbase in August, went off without a hitch. But that launch followed a string of explosive failures that had put Starship off-track.

For this test, Starship will follow a very similar flight plan to its last launch, just with a few tweaks to further stress-test the rocket's heat shield and demonstrate maneuvers that are designed to mimic how its upper stages will behave when it is returning to its launch site—Starhsip, after all, is meant to be fully reusable.

In the eleventh test flight, Starship's Super Heavy Booster is supposed to splash down in the Gulf of Mexico while, its upper stage progresses along a suborbital arc, then reenters the atmosphere for a water landing in the Indian Ocean, according to SpaceX.

The test will attempt several in-space objectives, including a deployment of eight dummy Starlink satellites and a relight of one of its Raptor engines. SpaceX has again removed several ceramic tiles from the heat shield to stress-test the rocket's thermal protection system.

Unlike flight 10, however, this time the spacecraft will perform a “dynamic banking maneuver” during the final phase of the rocket's reentry, designed to mimic the path it will take on future flights returning to Starbase.

The booster will also demonstrate a “unique landing burn engine configuration planned to be used on the next generation of Super Heavy,” according to SpaceX. The booster will ignite 13 of its 33 engines to start the burn, transition to five engines to fine-tune its trajectory, then downshift to three center engines for the final stage of the burn.

The booster selected for this launch is flight-proven, having already flown on flight 8 in March. Twenty-four of the booster's Raptor engines are also flight-proven. This will be the second reuse of a Super Heavy booster, a critical test of SpaceX's rapid reusability strategy.

It's been a turbulent year for the Starship program. After a very shaky start to the rocket's 2025 launch schedule, SpaceX is now under pressure to reach critical development milestones ahead of its next iteration. Monday's launch is one you won't want to miss.

At a conference in 2019, marine biologist and coral reef conservationist Melanie McField was caught off guard by a question from another attendee: How does it feel to have dedicated your life to studying an ecosystem that will be the first one wiped off the planet?

“I'm rarely dumbfounded,” McField, who now serves as director of the Healthy Reefs for Healthy People initiative, told Gizmodo. Though she was well aware of the dire state the world's coral reefs were in, the idea that these ecosystems could be the first to succumb to climate change came as an alarming new realization. “I just didn't know what to say,” she said.

Today, McField is one of 160 authors of a landmark report confirming that the questioner that day may have been right. The 2025 Global Tipping Points Report, released by the University of Exeter and international partners on Sunday, finds that the world's warm-water coral reefs have become the first Earth system to cross its thermal tipping point.

The report comes as global ministers gather in Brazil to meet in preparation for the 30th annual UN Climate Change Conference in November. During these meetings, leaders attempt to reach some consensus on the key climate issues facing the planet. The report's authors hope their findings will help drive decision makers to take meaningful action to curb global warming.

“We need to have stubborn people at the table in these negotiations who say, ‘We want to keep coral reefs on the planet,'” McField said.

Higher ocean temperatures are forcing many of the world's corals to expel the symbiotic algae, or zooxanthellae, that live in their tissues—a process known as coral bleaching. These algae not only give corals their signature bright colors, but also provide them with oxygen and essential nutrients through photosynthesis.

Earth is in the midst of its fourth global coral bleaching event, according to NOAA. Since January 2023, bleaching-level heat stress has impacted 84.4% of the world's coral reefs, with scientists documenting mass coral bleaching in at least 83 countries and territories. This is the second such event in the last 10 years and the largest on record.

The good news is this: Bleached corals are not necessarily dead corals. If ocean temperatures return to a cooler state for a sustained period of time, algae can recolonize a bleached reef. The bad news, however, is that climate change is increasing the severity of bleaching events while decreasing the amount of recovery time between them. As a result, the odds of corals bouncing back are rapidly dwindling.

“This is why ocean warming is such a scary thing,” Mark Hixon, a leading coral reef expert and professor of marine biology at the University of Hawaii who was not involved in the report, told Gizmodo. “Especially now with the ocean starting to warm very, very rapidly, we'll be seeing more frequent and more severe bleaching events.”

At what point does the global average temperature of Earth's oceans become so warm that the majority of coral reefs won't be able to survive bleaching events? This is where the idea of a thermal tipping point comes in. Researchers estimate the thermal tipping point for warm-water coral reefs to be 2.16 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) of global surface warming above pre-industrial levels. The planet is already past that point.

Crossing this threshold doesn't mean that all the world's reefs are going to die tomorrow. “That's not what we're saying,” McField said. “We're saying we're in the zone where death—the tipping of the whole ecosystem—is underway.”

Each coral reef is unique, with different species, local water temperatures, non-thermal stressors, ecosystem intactness, and resilience levels. These and other factors shape a reef's survivability. But in a warming world, all reefs—regardless of their individual conditions and characteristics—are at greater risk.

“Let's say we've got 100 humans, and they all go to the doctor,” McField said. “All of them have cholesterol levels of 300—which is incredibly dangerous. They're still going to die at different rates.”

The report finds that Earth's global surface temperature may rise 2.7°F (1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels within the next 10 years. This is the upper range of the thermal tipping point for warm-water coral reefs.

At that point, “We're in new territory,” McField said. Even under the most optimistic scenario, in which global warming stabilizes at 2.7°F without any overshoot, warm-water coral reefs are “virtually certain” to tip, the report states.

Scientists around the world are working to protect and restore coral reefs. Some strategies center on improving coral resilience through genetic modification—selectively breeding them for resiliency traits.

“This can work to some degree, to keep from losing species entirely,” McField said.

“But when you think about how that could ever be applied on an ecosystem scale, with so little money going into on-the-ground work in reef countries… how is that going to be an economic option?”

Other strategies aim to minimize other potential stressors, like pollution or destructive fishing practices. Hixon, for example, is working to improve water quality and protect herbivorous fish species in Hawaii, which could reduce the overall strain on coral reefs and help them rebound from bleaching events.

Still, this work can't mitigate all the effects of rapidly rising temperatures. The report states that the Earth needs stringent emission mitigation and enhanced carbon removal to bring the global average surface temperatures back down to 1.8°F (1°C) above pre-industrial levels. “These temperatures are essential for retaining functional warm-water coral reefs at meaningful scale,” the report says.

“It's incumbent upon the scientific community to engage with stakeholders of all kinds on the threats to the reefs, how they're accelerating, and how there are certain tangible steps we can take to try to save our reefs from loss,” Hixon said.

Car door handles seem innocuous. Tesla's electronic, retractable ones—since imitated by plenty of global automakers—have become a symbol of the automaker's willingness to work from design-first principles, reimagining what the car of the future might look like, electric-style.

But in September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into the Tesla 2021 Model Y's door handles. More than 140 consumers have complained to the NHTSA about the door handles, according to a Bloomberg report published last month.

Drivers alleged the handles have gotten stuck or malfunctioned, especially when cars' low-voltage batteries failed. Government filings highlight parents' reports that their children were trapped inside their vehicles, unable to find or activate rear-door mechanical releases, after their adults exited the car. At least four alleged the need to “break a window to regain entry into the vehicle,” according to the agency. Tesla has since promised to redesign the handles.

On Friday, the family members of two California teenagers who died after the Cybertruck they were riding in caught fire in a crash sued the automaker, alleging that Tesla knew about the difficulties of manually opening its doors before the teenagers were trapped inside.

Now new Chinese regulations would force the door handle issue in the world's biggest automotive market—rules that, given the size and power of China's auto market, could soon show up in other parts of the world.

The proposed rules, posted by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last month and set to be finalized after a comment period in late November, would require mechanical release handles on the inside and outside of every car, which would have to be operable without tools after accidents. The rules also appear to nix flush door handles by requiring automakers to build the handles with enough room for a hand to grip behind them.

If the rules are finalized as written, they'll kick in as early as mid-2027—a date that's around the corner for many global automakers, given their multiyear vehicle design and development process.

Making door handle changes quickly could prove a pricey and complicated challenge. How pricey and complicated comes down to each automaker's design. “There's a real-estate problem in the door space,” says Amy Broglin-Peterson, who teaches supply chain management at Michigan State University's Broad College of Business and consults in the automotive industry. Between the electronics, insulation, wiring for other parts, speakers, and other parts sandwiched into doors: “Any time you have design changes, that messes up other things,” she says.

The issues could cascade beyond the design. The auto manufacturing industry operates on strict production schedules. Though it builds in time to validate and test whatever new features come in each new model, the sudden intro of a design change late in the process could throw off the delicate timetable.

In this decade, China's auto industry has shocked the world by racing ahead of legacy automakers, quickly developing, with government support, ever newer, cheaper, and more technologically advanced vehicles on shorter production schedules. The country is the world's largest automotive market; it's expected to manufacture a full third of the world's cars by 2030. Still, quickly complying with new design regulations won't be easy for domestic Chinese automakers either, says Broglin-Peterson. “Mechncial release requires a mechanical assembly,” she says. “It's not just, you write some code.”

Automaker's door handle trouble likely won't end in China. The new rules could lead to cascading responses from other global regulators. It's a now-familiar pattern: China, once a place with lax protections, has forged ahead of the rest of the world in setting guidelines for electric vehicle battery safety and recycling, and autonomous vehicle tech. “This is a classic example of China setting the guardrails early: protecting consumers while quietly shaping global design standards,” Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based advisory firm, wrote in an email.

For many years, says Raphael Zammit, the chair of the transportation design department at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, flush electronic door handles were the stuff of futuristic concept cars. “The fact that Elon Musk and Tesla put it into production was, frankly, pretty amazing,” he says. Their rise was linked with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles; tucking door handles into the doors of cars was meant to reduce their drag coefficient, leading to increased battery efficiency. Or so the theory went: Back-of-the-envelope math suggests the tweak maybe adds a mile of range. Maybe. Either way, the handles became a “demarcation of luxury,” Zammit says.

Indeed, electronic door handles can be found on many luxury vehicles, including some made by Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Jake Fisher, the senior director of the Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center, tested several of those vehicles' electronic handles. While all had emergency mechanical releases, as the Chinese regulations mandate, some were in places that could be difficult to find in an emergency—on the floor, in shadow, or, as in the rear seats of the 2021 Model Y under investigation by NHTSA, under a slot at the bottom of the rear door pocket. The best emergency mechanical releases, Consumer Reports found, were those that simply needed to be pulled a bit harder than usual to open, an intuitive reaction in an emergency.

It's something Tesla seems to understand. “The idea of combining the electronic one and manual one into one button makes a lot of sense,” Tesla head designer Franz von Holzhausen told Bloomberg News. Indeed, the automaker will now be redesigning the door handle, combining an internal mechanical release with its electronic one. “It really helps the muscle memory of reaching for something that's there every day, so you intuitively do the same thing” in an emergency, he said in an interview. Tesla, which disbanded its public relations team in 2020, didn't respond to WIRED's questions, including those about why Tesla didn't make the changes sooner or whether the proposed Chinese rules would require further redesigns.

As with the door handles, “we do see automakers literally reinventing the wheel for no good purpose with mechanisms and designs that are demonstrably worse,” says Consumer Reports' Fisher.

The US electric automaker Rivian is also reportedly redesigning the flush, electronic door handles on its next generation of SUVs and trucks, moving the rear manual interior release away from its current location behind an unlabeled panel. The automaker doesn't sell vehicles in China. A spokesperson declined to comment on the report and wrote in a statement that Rivian's current and future vehicles “meet or exceed all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, including passenger egress from all doors in the event of a crash or emergency.”

But automakers have declined to say how the Chinese rules will affect their designs. General Motors is reviewing and providing technical input to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, spokesperson Bill Grotz wrote in a statement. “Until the new regulations are finalized, we cannot comment on vehicle portfolio implications,” he wrote.

Mercedes-Benz spokesperson Yifei Wu wrote in a statement that Mercedes-Benz vehicles are designed to unlock and extend their exterior door handles when the vehicles' air bag units detect a crash. “We are watching this topic closely and will of course adapt accordingly, if this [Chinese] proposal will change anything in the requirements,” she wrote.

Ford and Volkswagen didn't respond to WIRED's requests for comment. But last month, VW CEO Thomas Schäfer told the German DW News that its customers want mechanical buttons and handles that are easy to use. “It's all nice to have these flush door handles, but they are terrible to operate,” he said. “We definitely have proper door handles on the cars, and customers appreciate it.”

Anya Lacey is aware of the oxymoron that comes with being an OnlyFans creator while aspiring to be a trad wife.

When the 19-year-old Florida-based creator decided to get serious about dating this year, she ran into a wall. Either a lot of conservative men are “immediately turned off by what I do,” she says of being a sex worker, or the men she met on dating apps weren't all that serious about commitment. “It's a video game to them.”

Those experiences led Lacey to create dateanya.com, a website with two clear objectives. The first was to find Lacey a husband (users can fill out a “Date Me” application). The second—and this very much seems to be its larger aim—was for the site to serve as a kind of relationship roadmap for conservative singles serious about finding love. Billed as “America-First Dating,” the site provides suggestions for “non-negotiables” (“secure borders, secure families”) as well as dating tips for women (“let him drive the date; you drive the conversation”) and men (“exclusivity before intimacy”).

“Conservatism is really associated with men and masculine energy, and that's who was leading the industry,” Lacey says. “But now you have a lot of women coming out of the woodwork.”

Lacey is part of an expanding network of women influencers, creators, and media personalities who represent different factions of the conservative movement—spanning faith and flag moderates to MAGA fanatics—jockeying for a larger stake in the dating zeitgeist. Some are using their platform to reclaim the narrative around traditional relationships, one they say has been poisoned by feminist brainwashing and an age of endless swipes. Just as the manosphere has shaped the outlook of young conservative men through chat-casts, rallying a generation around alternative science and hypermasculinity, the rise of female-led rightwing media creators—sometimes called the “womanosphere”—are helping to shape the opinions of young conservative women everywhere.

But even as conservatives are reclaiming the debate around modern dating, coasting on the momentum of Trump 2.0, there are noticeable fractures and hypocrisies in their approaches.

On the podcast Culture Apothecary, Turning Point USA's Alex Clark educates women about optimal fertility health and well-being. In an episode of Relatable titled “Be a Godly Woman, Not Just a Trad Wife,” host Allie Beth Stuckey discusses the appropriation of the trad wife trend, saying it “can be a great thing to aspire to” but Christian motherhood is “not just an aesthetic.” More recently, in response to polycule family structures, Stuckey noted that “the sexual revolution is reaching new lows.” Much of what the women discuss—on marriage, faith, and the importance of childbearing—dovetails with the agenda of the Trump administration.

On social media, however, where Lacey has more than 1 million followers between TikTok and Instagram, she often straddles her conservatism with a wink and a smile. In one video, Lacey jokes about the consequences of not performing oral sex on your partner. In the next, she's prancing through a green meadow declaring love for “my bible,” sundresses, and conservative men.

Still, as the womanosphere grows louder, its influence is creating a less stigmatized environment for singles who no longer feel the shame of their values. “Of course that trickles down into the dating scene as well,” says right-wing influencer Debra Lea of the cultural shift, who adds that the “the popularity of monogamy, marriage, and starting a family is growing far beyond just the conservative movement.”

Though she hasn't prioritized finding a partner, Lea, 25, has dated a range of conservative men over the last few years. In the post-Biden era of young romance, she's noticed a key difference; “politics seem to be more commonly discussed both on and before dates.” The hardcore moderates always “bring out my ultraconservative side,” she says. “I would never marry or seriously date somebody unaligned with me politically, but I believe there are many more important factors to align on, such as religion, healthy lifestyle, and hobbies.”

The conservative dating revival comes as romantic relationship patterns are steadily shifting. Americans are having a record low amount of sex, according to a report by the Institute for Family Studies. Marriage is also on the decline. Meanwhile, dating app fatigue seems to be at an all-time high.

Lauren Kenzie, a 23-year-old social media manager from Fresno, California who believes it should be illegal to burn the American flag, often uses TikTok to broadcast what she wants, and doesn't want, in a partner. In one post, reciting audio from Kesha's 2010 song “Grow a Pear,” she suggests she could never date liberal men because they have “a vag.” (The song is a common choice among young single conservatives on the platform, who use it to troll men with progressive values.) “I am very straightforward on what I believe in,” Kenzie says, “and if you don't believe in what I believe then it's not gonna work out.”

Politics have always played an important role in who people date, but especially so for conservatives, who have often faced more pushback than liberals as dating apps replaced the analog meet-cute. Though right-wing apps like Patrio, Righter, and Donald Daters launched around Trump's first term, they have struggled, even now, to find wide user ship. That has forced conservatives to search for love on the major platforms, where they weren't always welcome.

On TikTok, Republicans have been mocked for hiding behind “moderate” or “not political” labels, or removing them altogether (certain apps, like Hinge and Bumble, let users add party affiliations to their bio). Left-leaning women have stressed that being a Trumpie signals immediate red flags for a potential partner. “She doesn't have to worry about if you're a misogynist, you voted for one,” one TikTok user noted, after a contestant on The Date Night Podcast was dumped for revealing just that.

But today, young conservatives seem more emboldened to speak out. In July, after attending a Turning Point USA event, health performance coach Julian Becerra uploaded a video extolling the values of traditional relationships where “the man is the head of the household and the woman isn't required to go work and climb some crazy, bullshit corporate ladder and report to a male boss. She can raise a family like how it's intended to be.” The video garnered over 1,600 comments.

Lea calls this moment a revival era where women can once again vocalize their dreams of being a stay at home mom without feeling any guilt or shame. “[It was] one of the most important jobs in the world, and since the 1960s and the rise of the feminist movement, society has looked down on stay-at-home moms,” Lea says. “There was bound to be a cultural rebound to tradition.” Despite her take on this, Lea herself is a content creator who produces multiple videos a week on everything from ICE-led deportations to why she wants to #MakeAmericaHotAgain.

Some academics suggest that the promotion of a domestic utopia during eras of draconian governance serves an essential purpose. In Mothers in the Fatherland: Women, the Family, and Nazi Politics, historian Claudia Koonz argues that in authoritarian regimes of the past, women were critical in shaping how society coped with its new reality by spoon-feeding narratives of subordination and conformity. As “men preached race hate and virulent nationalism that threatened to destroy the morality on which civilization existed, women's participation in the movement created an ersatz gloss of idealism,” Koonz wrote, adding that their role helped uphold an illusion of decency.

“I watch the Brett Cooper podcast a lot. She just had her baby. She has a beautiful husband and a beautiful home. She's a really big voice for women right now,” Lacey says of the conservative influencer who is popular among Gen Z.

“I truly believe women of all political ideologies—except woke lefties who are too far gone from reality—are suffering the effects of the loneliness epidemic and are finally beginning to understand that marriage and children was always the solution,” Lea says. Studies have confirmed, however, men experience loneliness at a marginally higher rate than women, and often have a harder time seeking out support. And women are out-earning men in several US cities, according to a Pew Research Center analysis, which may explain why they are more selective when dating. Some studies have noted that unmarried women tend to be happier.

“Men want to marry feminine, attractive, and kind women whereas women want to marry strong, masculine, and hardworking men,” Lea says. “We spent the last few decades pretending this wasn't the truth but now, with President Trump at the helm of our country and culture, the dating scene can return to what it's always been: normal.”

But even “normal” is changing for conservatives.

Lacey is hopeful her website will yield results. Until then, she intends to make her living through OnlyFans; her content is a mix of solo and partner sex scenes (when Lacey does record with other people, it's with one specific person). “Traditional is traditional, but tradition evolves. We're in a new day and age,” she says. “Back then, traditional meant you could just survive off of one income.” That's not possible anymore, she tells me, explaining that she's happy to make this sacrifice now to build a stable future for her family, a dream that includes settling down on a ranch with a husband and three kids.

“Just because you're filming videos and posting them doesn't necessarily take you out of the traditional role,” she says. “To some extent, though, all of us fall short of our beliefs.”

Just when we were getting settled in with Wi-Fi 7…


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Consumer Wi-Fi 7 devices have only been around for a couple of years at this point, but as we all know, technological progress doesn't stand still. There's always a push for making hardware faster, more secure, and more reliable. Wireless technologies are no exception, which means that the organizing bodies behind Wi-Fi are already looking forward to the next generation: Wi-Fi 8 (802.11bn).

Although details at this point are relatively light, TP-Link announced today that it has conducted its first successful trials of Wi-Fi 8 hardware using a prototype device. The company didn't specify the hardware it used to achieve its Wi-Fi 8 milestone, referring only to a “joint industry partnership.” However, there are several big names in the Wi-Fi chip market, including Broadcom, Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek, and Marvell. TP-Link has been known to work closely with Qualcomm to supply chipsets for its Wi-Fi 7 portfolio, so it's plausible to assume that the partnership could extend to Wi-Fi 8 hardware.

According to the company, its testing has validated the Wi-Fi 8 beacon and data throughput, marking a “critical milestone in Wi-Fi 8 development.”

You can read more about TP-Link's early development with Wi-Fi 8 on the information page that it created.

We learned last year that the overarching goal of Wi-Fi 8 is not to bring extraordinary theoretical speed improvements (although we'll likely see some generational advances), but to improve overall reliability and real-world performance. Wi-Fi 8 will still utilize three bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz) and will retain the 4096 QAM and 320 MHz of maximum channel bandwidth introduced with Wi-Fi 7. While the maximum data rate remains at 46 Gbps, Wi-Fi 8's Ultra High Reliability (UHR) goal is to improve real-world data rate by up to 25 percent for compliant devices.

 




In addition, four new technologies are aimed at improving various aspects of Wi-Fi life, as described in a MediaTek whitepaper: Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR), Coordinated Beamforming (Co-BF), Dynamic Sub-Channel Operation (DSO), and enhanced Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS). For example, Co-SR monitors power levels to deliver optimal signal strength between devices, while DSO can assign sub-channels to a device to boost throughput by up to 80 percent.

So, what does all of this mean for general consumers? If you reside in a dense urban environment, you can expect higher overall performance with reduced interference from competing wireless signals. In addition, you'll notice fewer interruptions when roaming and better performance under low-signal situations.

Wi-Fi 8 is preceded by Wi-Fi 7, and we first started seeing the first commercial-grade hardware in our lab in late 2023. Those initial Wi-Fi 7 products were costly, with the Amazon Eero 7 Max mesh router costing $599 for just a single node and $1,699 for a three-pack. Luckily, the prices for Wi-Fi 7 routers have come down dramatically since then. You can purchase a dual-band router for around $100, a tri-band router for under $200, and a tri-band mesh router for roughly $300 on sale.

However, with the new wireless standard on the horizon, we can expect those Wi-Fi 7 prices to drop further as we prepare for the inevitable price premium of Wi-Fi 8 hardware.

A recent study of Enceladus, one of Saturn's moons, has detected several organic compounds that had never been recorded there before. The findings, published this month in Nature Astronomy, provide new clues about the interior chemical composition of this icy world, as well as new hope that it could harbor life.

The researchers analyzed data from the Cassini probe, which launched in 1997 and studied Saturn and its moons for years until its destruction in 2017. For Enceladus, Cassini gathered data from ice fragments forcefully ejected from the moon's subsurface ocean up into space.

Enceladus is one of 274 bodies so far discovered in Saturn's gravitational pull. It measures about 500 kilometers in diameter, making it the planet's sixth-largest satellite. While this moon does not stand out for its size, it is notable for its cryovolcanoes—geysers at Enceladus's south pole that spew out water vapor and ice fragments. Plumes of ejected material can extend to nearly 10,000 kilometers in length, which is more than the distance from Mexico to Patagonia, and some of this material rises into space. The outermost of Saturn's main rings—its E ring—is primarily made up of ice ejected into space by Enceladus.

This material is believed to come from a saline water chamber beneath the moon's icy crust that is connected to its rocky core. It's possible that chemical reactions are taking place down there, under high pressure and heat.

Until now, most chemical analyses of ice from Enceladus were of particles deposited in Saturn's E ring. But during a high-speed flyby of the moon in 2008, Cassini was fortunate enough to directly sample freshly ejected fragments from a cryovolcano. The new research paper reanalyzed this data, confirming the presence of previously detected organic molecules, as well as revealing compounds that had previously been undetected.

“Such compounds are believed to be intermediates in the synthesis of more complex molecules, which could be potentially biologically relevant. It is important to note, however, that these molecules can be formed abiotically as well,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at Freie Universität Berlin and lead author of the study, told Reuters. The discovery significantly expands the range of confirmed organic molecules on Enceladus.

The key is that the compounds appeared in freshly ejected particles, suggesting that they were formed within the moon's hidden ocean or in contact with its internal interfaces, not during their journey through the E ring or via exposure to the conditions of space. This reinforces the hypothesis that hydrothermal processes beneath Enceladus's surface could be generating rich organic chemistry. Combining this new research with previous studies, scientists have now found five of the six elements essential for life—carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—in the satellite's ejected material.

This itself is not a discovery of life, nor of biosignatures—the signs of life. However, the research confirms that Enceladus has the three basic conditions for life to form: liquid water, an energy source, and essential elements and organics. “Enceladus is, and should be ranked, as the prime target to explore habitability and search whether there is life or not,” Khawaja said.

Seattle and Toronto are squaring off on the baseball diamond this week in the American League Championship Series. But how do the two cities fare in a battle over tech bragging rights?

Both feature powerhouse tech markets. Seattle ranked No. 2 on CBRE's recent list of top North American markets for tech talent — with Toronto right behind at No. 3. Seattle also edged out Toronto in CBRE's measure of AI talent.

Seattle is anchored by longtime behemoths Microsoft and Amazon, along with other large firms headquartered in the region such as Expedia, Zillow, and T-Mobile. Toronto lays claim to companies like Rogers Communications and Thomson Reuters — but it doesn't quite match Seattle's depth of corporate tech prowess.

Several U.S. tech companies have opened Toronto satellite offices in recent years. But a quick look at GeekWire's engineering center list shows more than 100 outposts in the Seattle area, including substantial operations for Google, Meta, and Apple. WINNER: Seattle

On the startup front, Toronto has a superstar in Cohere, the fast-growing enterprise AI model company that just hit a $7 billion valuation. 

As we've reported in GeekWire, the Seattle startup scene is full of technical talent but lacks a breakout AI upstart on Cohere's level.

Toronto is also home to security startup 1Password (hit a $6.8 billion valuation in 2022); VPN company Tailscale (raised $160 million this year); and autonomous trucking startup Waabi (raised $200 million last year).

According to CB Insights, the Seattle area has 14 unicorns, while the Toronto region has 11. 

And in Startup Genome's latest global ecosystem ranking, Seattle came in at No. 15 and Toronto at No. 20.

The GeekWire 200 list has many longstanding tech companies and fast-growing startups in the Seattle area — including sales software company Highspot ($3.5 billion valuation in 2022); fusion startup Helion (backed by Sam Altman and SoftBank); and health data firm Truveta (reached unicorn status this year).

Software testing startup Statsig was ranked No. 5 on the GeekWire 200 before its recent $1.1 billion acquisition to OpenAI.

Despite lacking an AI all-star, the Emerald City gets the slight edge here. WINNER: Seattle

Seattle and Toronto have premier research universities. EduRank lists the University of Washington at No. 8 and University of Toronto at No. 12 among North American schools. Times Higher Education flips the order, with Toronto at No. 21 and UW at No. 25. 

The University of Waterloo in Toronto has its own AI Institute. The UW in Seattle boasts one of the top-ranked computer science programs in the U.S.

Outside academia, Toronto has the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Seattle has the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. 

This one is a toss up. WINNER: Tie

Tech luminaries: Seattle's lineup features veteran household names like Bill Gates (Microsoft co-founder), Rich Barton (Zillow and Expedia co-founder), and Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO). Toronto counters with AI heavyweights Geoffrey Hinton (Nobel laureate and “godfather of deep learning”), Raquel Urtasun (Waabi founder), and Aidan Gomez (Cohere CEO). WINNER: Toronto

Both cities have baseball stadiums with retractable roofs, though Toronto's Rogers Centre was the first in the world to debut that engineering feat. T-Mobile Park in Seattle features one of MLB's largest video display scoreboards. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network also recorded seismic energy at T-Mobile Park during the Seattle's win over Detroit on Friday. WINNER: Tie

FINAL SCORE: Seattle 2, Toronto 1 (with two ties).

Cancer is a challenging enough diagnosis, but many patients are dealt a second blow, even as they heal: "chemo brain."

Also called "brain fog," this mix of cognitive issues - memory problems, struggling to find words, an inability to concentrate - affects up to three-in-four cancer patients, according to multiple studies. For many, the effects last years beyond cancer treatment.

A new study offers new models for studying causes of chemo brain and points to the effects of chemotherapy drugs on the brain's lymphatic system, which is a network of tiny vessels in the brain's protective membranes that help remove waste and transport immune cells. The study was published Oct. 13 in Communications Biology.

There's compounding evidence now that these meningeal lymphatics are involved in cognitive issues, including Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury, too. Women are affected by chemo brain, or brain fog, much more than men when treated by very common chemotherapies, such as those used on breast cancer patients on a regular basis."

Jennifer Munson, co-corresponding author, professor and director of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC's Cancer Research Center in Roanoke

The study highlights considerations for cancer treatment beyond eradicating the cancer itself, said Monet Roberts, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering and co-corresponding author on the paper. 

"Our study is important because it explores a very real, hidden layer of chemotherapy treatment that leaves lasting scars on the daily lives of those who are living with or have survived in their cancer journey," said Roberts, a former postdoctoral associate who trained in Munson's lab at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and now continues to study the lymphatic system in her own lab.

Munson and her team developed a three-tiered modeling system, using a combination of mouse and tissue-engineered models, to study changes to the lymphatic system. The in vitro model is the first human tissue engineered system that replicates this unique tissue, and has the potential for therapeutic testing, patient specific analyses, and disease-specific incorporation. 

The study examined effects of two of the most common chemotherapy drugs, docetaxel and carboplatin. While both showed lymphatic system impacts, they were much more pronounced with docetaxel.

"What we see is a shrinking of the lymphatic vessels, and fewer loops or branches in the vessels," said Munson, who is also a professor in Virginia Tech's Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics. "These are signs of reduced growth that indicate the lymphatics are changing, or not regenerating in beneficial ways. Lymphatic health really declined across all three models measured in different ways."

As anticipated, brain imaging showed reduced drainage of the lymphatic system in mice. When the research team performed cognitive tests, they found that if a mouse had been treated with docetaxel, it exhibited poor memory.

Taken together, Munson said, the results suggest chemo brain could result from poor lymphatic-system drainage in response to chemotherapy. 

"That could potentially account for some of these memory deficits, which is similar to what we have seen in Alzheimer's disease," Munson said. 

"The first step is knowing," she said. "And now the hope is to figure out how to help. Could delivering something pharmaceutically, such as a protein, alleviate the problem and not interfere with the chemotherapy? We know of other things that affect flow in the brain, as well, such as better sleep and exercise."

Munson is also interested in exploring gender differences in chemo brain prevalence. 

"Lymphatic diseases in general affect women more than men," she said. "We are extremely interested in trying to understand that difference and why that difference might exist."

"Ultimately, this work underscores the need to consider not only survival, but also the long-term, often overlooked neurological side effects of cancer treatment on cognitive well-being and quality of life," Roberts said, "Especially in women who are disproportionately affected by these lasting side effects."

NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease, N-ERD, is associated with measurable changes in concentrations of lipid mediators involved in inflammation and pain modulation, a new study shows. Plasma concentrations of two key endocannabinoid-related lipids, arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA), were significantly reduced in patients with N-ERD, compared to healthy controls.

In addition, even a very low dose of aspirin increased AEA and OEA levels in controls, but not in N-ERD patients. The study, conducted in collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland, the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, was published in Clinical & Experimental Allergy.

N-ERD is a chronic syndrome in which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, provoke asthma attacks and other respiratory symptoms. Patients typically suffer from severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and the condition significantly impairs quality of life. Currently, there is no clinical laboratory test for N-ERD, and diagnosis requires a costly and risky aspirin challenge performed in a hospital setting. The disease mechanisms remain poorly understood, and optimal treatment strategies are still lacking.

This present study is the first to report changes in endocannabinoid signaling in patients with N-ERD, which may help explain chronic inflammation and heightened perception of pain associated with the condition. In addition to reduced concentrations of AEA and OEA, elevated concentrations of leukotriene E4 and other lipid mediators were also observed, possibly reflecting N-ERD associated inflammation.

These changes in lipid metabolism, which affect the endocannabinoid system, may in the future open up new avenues for diagnosing N-ERD, and for developing targeted therapies." 

Viljami Salmi, Doctoral Researcher, University of Helsinki

Further research involving larger patient cohorts is needed. The present study included eight individuals diagnosed with N-ERD and seven healthy controls.

Owlstone Medical ("Owlstone"), the global leader in Breath Biopsy® for applications in early disease detection and precision medicine, today announced that it has won an award of up to $49.1 million from the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) for the Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. POSEIDON aims to develop first-in-class synthetic-sensor based Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests for Stage I detection of 30+ solid tumors using only breath and urine samples that can be performed in the home and are available over the counter.

Almost 40 % of Americans will develop cancer in their lifetimes and cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. The number of new cancer diagnoses in 2025 is estimated to be more than 2 million, with over 618,000 cancer deaths, equivalent to almost 1,700 deaths every day. The patient-related economic burden of cancer in 2019 was more than $21 billion in the U.S., of which treatment costs are by far the largest component. Critically, costs associated with late-stage diagnoses are much higher than early-stage, however cancer is difficult to detect early when it is most curable.

Drastically reducing late-stage diagnoses by detecting cancer at Stage I would not only increase treatment effectiveness, but also significantly reduce cancer care costs, restoring up to $2.3 trillion to the U.S. economy. Currently available screening technologies are unable to address this need due to performance limitations, and many Americans are too remote to access clinic and hospital-based screening programs. While emerging technologies such as liquid biopsy hold great promise for later stage cancer detection and to help guide therapy selection, performance in early-stage cancer detection has been insufficient.

Owlstone's project, in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Boston University, Georgia Tech Research Corporation, Qurin B.V., and Planned Systems International Inc, aims to overcome this challenge by delivering accurate, low-cost cancer screening for 30+ solid tumors to Americans aged 18 and older.

The project involves the inhalation of a mix of pan-cancer and tumor-specific synthetic sensors from a single-use inhaler, which then circulate throughout the body and accumulate on the surface of cancer cells. The reporters produced by the sensors are either DNA-based which act as a readable barcode, or a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), supporting the detection of 36 cancers in total. These will be collected at-home or in clinic in urine samples and from breath respectively using portable collection and analysis devices. Results will be uploadable real-time to electronic health records (EHR) for rapid review by healthcare professionals, integrating seamlessly into clinical practice and digitally enabled care.

This unique approach offers significant advantages over competing technologies. These include boosting the signal to enhance test performance such that cancer is reliably detectable from early stage, enabling simple and non-invasive sample collection at home, rapid result generation and EHR integration, and a low-cost manufacturing model such that economics are not a barrier to adoption of the technology as the new standard of care for early cancer detection.

"The field of cancer screening needs a revolution, and POSEIDON stands ready to deliver. The program allows for a better future by creating broadly accessible, at-home tests that will accurately detect 30+ cancers as early as Stage I, when tumors are still small and the chances of survival are high," said POSEIDON Program Manager Ross Uhrich, DMD, MBA. "This revolutionary funding effort brings together experts in synthetic biology, oncology, medical devices, big cancer data, and commercialization to create test kits that will transform how and when people are screened for cancer. POSEIDON will allow every American the opportunity to test themselves long before they have symptoms and at their discretion. POSEIDON's rigorous performance metrics and translational focus reflect our clear commitment to bring these technologies safely and directly to all Americans."

Access to an accurate and low-cost MCED test that does not require a doctor's visit or laboratory testing is key to preventing late-stage diagnoses. This award validates both breath as a diagnostic approach and Owlstone's EVOC® probes as a reporter technology to overcome the shortcomings and challenges that have held back early cancer detection previously. We are grateful to ARPA-H for the opportunity to bring transformative MCED testing to every American within the next decade."

INTEGRA Biosciences' SWITCH hybrid pipette has been scientifically evaluated for ergonomics through an in-depth collaboration with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). The SWITCH combines the tactile control of manual pipetting with the intelligent repeat dispense function of an electronic system, offering laboratories a new standard in comfort, precision and efficiency.

The SWITCH can be operated manually for a familiar handheld pipetting experience, or switched to repeat dispense mode for efficient electronic aliquoting.

Pipetting can be one of the most physically demanding tasks in a lab. Daily routines may involve thousands of repetitive thumb and wrist motions, sustained muscle loading and awkward postures, all of which increase the risk of injuries such as tendonitis, carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain. ZHAW evaluated pipetting from a biomechanics perspective, and identified the ergonomic parameters most critical to protecting users from these risks. INTEGRA applied these insights directly to the SWITCH, ensuring its design meets or exceeds the highest standards for safe pipetting.

Every aspect has been designed to reduce strain during repetitive tasks, from optimized handle dimensions to a tapered shape that supports neutral wrist alignment, as well as a consistent plunger height that keeps the thumb relaxed across all volumes. The SWITCH also weighs around 130 g, which is well below the grip force capabilities of both men and women, helping to minimize shoulder and arm fatigue during extended use. The SWITCH has been compared to leading manual and electronic models in a series of internal studies, confirming its superior performance for plunger force, handle comfort and task efficiency.

SPT Labtech, a pioneer in the design and development of laboratory automation and liquid handling solutions, and Agilent Technologies Inc. ("Agilent"), a global leader in analytical and clinical laboratory technologies, today announced the introduction of automated target enrichment protocols on SPT Labtech's firefly®+ platform. Automating genomic workflows, the optimized Target Enrichment protocols support researchers using Agilent's SureSelect Max DNA Library Prep Kits.

Available immediately to all firefly+ users on the firefly community cloud, the new protocols enable users to prepare libraries with Agilent's Library Prep and Target Enrichment panels and have been developed through a collaboration between SPT Labtech's in-house applications team and Agilent's R&D and product teams. By leveraging firefly+'s advanced automation, the protocols enable hands-off library prep with increased reproducibility, reduced error rates, and significant time savings.

Development work was carried out on the latest version of Agilent's Exome V8 and a smaller Comprehensive Cancer Panel (CGP), with applicability across the full range of Agilent's Target Enrichment panels, providing a streamlined and flexible workflow for laboratories.

Making these protocols available today is a critical step in addressing bottlenecks across sequencing workflows. By combining Agilent's gold-standard chemistry with firefly+ automation, we are helping labs scale sequencing faster, more reliably, and with greater efficiency."

Morten Frost, Chief Commercial Officer, SPT Labtech

Nina Green, Vice President and General Manager of the Clinical Diagnostic Division at Agilent, added: "Agilent's SureSelect Max DNA Library Prep Kit delivers the robust chemistry and high performance that labs demand for target enrichment. We are pleased to partner with SPT on enabling the first Target Enrichment protocol on the firefly+, enabling researchers to scale their sequencing workflows with greater efficiency."

Representatives from SPT Labtech (booth #2487) will be attending the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2025 annual meeting, 14th - 18th October, Boston, MA, where they will be available to discuss this new development.

Researchers have discovered that the ability to have an erection or to orgasm is related to the levels of serotonin in the brain, but this relation only applies to depressed patients taking SSRI antidepressants. At the moment, there is no test for who might experience sexual problems during treatment for depression, but this discovery may help depressed patients to choose antidepressants which allow them to maintain or regain an active sex life when treated with antidepressants. This work is presented at the ECNP conference in Amsterdam.

Sexual dysfunction is a common symptom of depression. SSRI antidepressants can help sexual dysfunction by improving mood, but at the same time SSRIs themselves are often associated with sexual side-effects. Unfortunately, there's no way of predicting these side effects in advance. Difficulty reaching orgasm is a common side effect, as are reduced desire and difficulty maintaining an erection. These side effects can affect up to 70% of patients taking SSRI medications, such as Prozac and escitalopram. These effects can be distressing, often leading to people stopping treatment.

The Copenhagen-based researchers studied 90 people who had been diagnosed with depression. They measured brain serotonin activity using a special EEG test called LDAEP (Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials), which is like a hearing test that reveals how your brain processes sound; perhaps surprisingly, this also tells us about serotonin levels in the brain - the lower the LDAEP, the higher the serotonin activity.

The patients then started an 8-week course of SSRI antidepressants, with the researchers carefully tracking any sexual side effects that developed. This allowed the researchers to see if they could predict who would have sexual problems based on their pretreatment LDAEP measurement.

Lead researcher Dr Kristian Jensen (from Copenhagen University Hospital) said:

"We discovered that people with higher serotonin activity before treatment started were much more likely to develop sexual side effects by the end of the 8-week antidepressant course, especially difficulty reaching orgasm. Using this non-invasive brain measure combined with information about sexual problems related to their depression, we could predict the ability to reach orgasm with 87% accuracy. We need a bigger study, with more men, to get an accurate figure for erectile dysfunction".

He continued:

"Currently, patients only discover sexual side effects after they've already started antidepressant medication. Measuring serotonin activity via the LDAEP test at the start of the course of antidepressants allows us to predict the likelihood of later sexual problems due to the SSRI. If confirmed, our findings could enable a more precise approach to depression treatment, helping doctors select medications to minimise sexual side effects in those patients most likely to develop SSRI-related problems. This could help treatment adherence and overall quality of life and generally give better treatment options for depression.

Our findings seem only to apply to medication-induced sexual problems, so it's not a general test for sexual difficulties. However, we are now looking to refine this, we have a 600-patient study underway which will look at how serotonin levels combined with sex hormones levels affect sexual function during depression and medication".

Commenting, Professor Eric Ruhe, Professor in Difficult-to-Treat Depression at Radboudumc, Nijmegen, the Netherlands said:

"This is a very interesting study where the researchers innovatively use an easy-to-administer test to predict the chance of sexual dysfunction after the start of antidepressant. When replicated, this type of test might reliably help to know beforehand whether a patient will have sexual adverse effects or not. As many patients experience sexual dysfunction after the start of SSRI antidepressants (like escitalopram), the most important clinical application will be to predict that sexual dysfunction will not occur, especially in patients who worry about that adverse effect and are hesitant to initiate treatment. 

I also encourage the researchers to expand their efforts towards developing a tool that can advise which drug to take instead, without just relying on current pharmacological considerations".

Professor Ruhe was not involved in this work; this is an independent comment.

This work is currently under peer-review. The researchers note that the subjects in the study were comparatively young (average age 27) and mostly (73%) female, so they are now aiming to replicate the study in a much bigger group of 600 patients.

Dr Kristian Jensen said "The LDAEP itself is quite elegant: we play sounds at different volumes through headphones while measuring brain waves. It takes about 30 minutes and is non-invasive. It's not generally available at the moment, but that may change if this test lives up to expectations".

Global mortality rates are falling but not among youths and young adults, according to the latest Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study published in The Lancet today and presented at the World Health Summit in Berlin. Additionally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for nearly two-thirds of the world's total mortality and morbidity, with ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes leading the globe. Researchers also estimate that nearly half of all death and disability could be prevented by modifying some of the leading risk factors, such as reducing high levels of blood sugar and high body mass index (BMI).

"The rapid growth in the world's aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges," said Dr. Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. "The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs."

Dr. Murray's team at IHME and its GBD Collaborator Network of 16,500 scientists and researchers collected and analyzed data and produced estimates for 375 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors by age and sex globally, regionally, and nationally for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations from 1990 to 2023, making the GBD the most comprehensive research quantifying health loss. Over 310,000 total data sources were used for the latest iteration, 30% of them new to this year's study. It includes 1,211 location-years of provisional all-age vital registration data, which had not previously been used, and which provide more timely information. The global health assessments outlined in three peer-reviewed capstones cover critical areas of the GBD: a demographic analysis, causes of death, and the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.

Despite population growth and aging, the 2023 global age-standardized mortality rate declined 67% since 1950, and all countries and territories marked declines. Global life expectancy returned to pre-pandemic levels at 76.3 years for females and 71.5 years for males, which is more than 20 years higher compared to 1950. Despite this progress, stark geographic differences remain, with life expectancy ranging from as high as 83 years in high-income regions to as low as 62 years in sub-Saharan Africa.

Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths was registered among those aged 20 to 39 in high-income North America from 2011 to 2023, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose, and high quantities of alcohol. During the same period, deaths in the 5–19-year age group increased in Eastern Europe, high-income North America, and the Caribbean.

Over the entire study period, the number of infant deaths declined more than for any other age group. From 2011 to 2023, East Asia recorded the largest decrease of 68% in the mortality rate for the under-5 age group due to better nutrition, vaccines, and stronger health systems.

Advances in modeling for the GBD 2023 study showed mortality in children ages 5–14 in sub-Saharan Africa from 1950 to 2021 was higher than previously estimated, an increase driven by high rates of respiratory infections and tuberculosis, other infectious diseases, and unintentional injuries. New calculations also showed mortality in young adult females ages 15–29 in sub-Saharan Africa was 61% higher than previously estimated, mostly due to maternal mortality, road injuries, and meningitis. Read the capstone on the demographic changes in global health.

Causes of death are shifting from infectious to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), creating new global health challenges, particularly for low-income countries. After standing as the leading cause of death in 2021, COVID-19 plunged to the 20th place in 2023, putting ischemic heart disease and stroke back at the top, followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal disorders. Since 1990, mortality rates for ischemic heart disease and stroke have declined, and so have diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Conversely, during the same period the death rate increased for diabetes, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV/AIDS.

While the global mean age at death increased from 46.4 in 1990 to 62.9 years in 2023, geographic inequities were profound. The highest mean age of death was recorded in the high-income super-region, with females reaching 80.5 years and males at 74.4 years. The lowest mean age of death was in sub-Saharan Africa, with females at 37.1 years and males at 34.8 years.

The all-cause probability of dying before age 70 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, with drug use disorders as one of the leading causes. In sub-Saharan Africa, the probability increased for many NCDs, and the mean age of death from NCDs was lower than expected. In the high-income super-region, the probability increased for drug use disorders, and the mean age of death was lower than expected. 

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) accounted for nearly two-thirds of the world's total death and disability. The top three causes were ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Low-income regions also saw a sharp rise in NCDs, further constraining nations with limited resources.

From 1990 to 2023, the age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) fell 36%. This measures total years of healthy life lost by examining the years lost from premature death and years lived with disability. From 2010 to 2023, DALY rates for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases fell by almost 26%. This was led by rates for diarrheal diseases being cut in half, a 43% decrease in rates for HIV/AIDS, and a 42% drop for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remain the top causes of CMNN diseases but have declined 17% and 25%, respectively.

Almost half of the global mortality and morbidity in 2023 was attributable to 88 modifiable risk factors. The 10 risk factors with the highest proportion of health loss were high systolic blood pressure, particulate matter pollution, smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, low birthweight and short gestation, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, kidney dysfunction, child growth failure, and lead exposure. Between 2010 and 2023, DALY rates for high BMI rose by almost 11%, drug use by nearly 9%, and high blood sugar by 6%.

New GBD modeling methods for lead exposure, the 10th-leading risk, also revealed a direct link to cardiovascular diseases. Removing lead from fuel has contributed to substantial declines in exposure over the years, but it's still a common environmental contaminant that can be found in paint in older buildings, contaminated soil, water, spices, and many cooking utensils.

Climate-sensitive risks, such as air pollution and heat, continue to have a more significant impact on global health. The DALY rates for the second-leading risk, particulate matter pollution, were highest at the super-region level in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East. High temperatures are also exacerbating vulnerabilities in that same region, particularly the Sahel, by compounding the effects of drought, food insecurity, and displacement.

Mental health disorders rose steeply, with anxiety disorders increasing by 63% and depressive disorders by 26%. In addition, sexual abuse and intimate partner violence were identified as preventable contributors to depression, anxiety, and other health consequences.

Among children under 5, the 2023 leading risk factors were child and maternal malnutrition, particulate matter pollution, and unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH). For children and adolescents aged 5 to 14 years, iron deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related to unsafe WaSH and child and maternal malnutrition. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure, and smoking. For those 50 to 69 years, high systolic blood pressure was the leading risk, followed by smoking, high blood sugar, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, and kidney dysfunction.

From 2010 to 2023, injury-related DALY rates decreased by 16% during the same time period. The burden of injuries was higher in males, particularly older children and young adults ages 10 to 24, accounting for more than double the total DALYs compared to that of females.

The GBD 2023 study highlights the urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities beyond reducing child mortality to include adolescents and young adults, particularly in areas with higher rates of mortality than previously known.

Decades of work to close the gap in low-income regions with persistent health inequities are in danger of unraveling due to the recent cuts to international aid. These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen."

People who experience food insecurity or loneliness are much more likely to develop chronic pain after surgery, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Chronic pain - lasting three months or longer - after surgery is common, especially after major procedures such as hip or knee replacement, and affects up to 30%-50% of surgical patients. Social factors such as food insecurity and social isolation can significantly raise this risk, the authors found.

Limited access to nutritious food can slow wound healing and increase inflammation, making pain more likely to last longer. Stress from loneliness can overstimulate the nervous system and make pain feel more severe. Also, a lack of social support can leave patients without help with tasks such as picking up medication or attending physical therapy, which can increase recovery time and the likelihood of pain becoming long-term. 

Our study provides strong evidence that a person's social situation may be just as important as their physical health when it comes to recovery. People who lack basic needs such as food and social connection may face a higher risk of long-term pain after surgery. But patients with strong support systems - whether from family, friends or community resources - are better protected. These findings highlight the importance for health care professionals to look beyond traditional medicine and consider the whole picture of a patient's life, from their dinner table to their support system, to help aid recovery."

Louie Rodriguez, M.D., co-author of the study and physician research scholar, University of California, San Diego

Researchers analyzed the data from a National Institutes of Health database of 8,065 patients who had surgery after 2000, had no history of chronic pain before surgery, and completed survey data from any of the 78 social determinants of health questions available in the database. Overall, 641 patients (7.9%) developed chronic pain after surgery, which was defined as having persistent postoperative pain at least one year after surgery.

Food insecurity was the strongest predictor of chronic pain, with affected patients being 83% more likely to develop it, compared to those who had reliable access to food. Other predictors included loneliness and level of social support, measured through eight of the 78 survey questions that asked patients to rate their experiences on a scale of 1 to 4.

For the questions related to loneliness, each additional point on the scale increased the risk of chronic pain after surgery by 2.1%. For the questions related to the level of social support, each additional point (reflecting stronger social support) reduced the risk by 3.7%.

"Patients should know that being open about their social and financial situation may be a crucial part of their recovery success after surgery," said Rodney Grabriel, M.D., MAS, co-author of the study and associate professor of anesthesiology at the University of California, San Diego. "They should feel empowered to discuss any concerns about food insecurity or a lack of social support with their doctors and nurses, who can help connect them to resources like food assistance programs or support groups, which may make recovery faster and lower their risk of ongoing pain."

The researchers added that screening patients for these and other social factors before surgery can help clinicians intervene early and personalize pain management strategies. Integrating these factors into care plans can be key steps to improving recovery and reducing the risk of chronic pain for vulnerable patients.

Most children - including nearly 80% of infants - go without clear liquids before surgery for at least twice as long as guidelines recommend, according to an analysis of data on more than 70,000 children presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Healthy infants and children may safely drink clear liquids, including water, fruit juices without pulp and carbohydrate-containing beverages, until two hours before receiving anesthesia, according to guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). The guidelines recommend that children not drink anything within two hours before the procedure to reduce the risk of liquid entering the lungs, which could cause choking or pneumonia. However, fasting longer can be harmful because it may cause dehydration, as well as unhealthy changes in blood sugar and other chemicals in the body.

Prolonged fasting from clear liquids of four hours or longer can be uncomfortable and increase thirst, anxiety, pain, nausea and vomiting. It can be harmful too. Children and infants are especially vulnerable to dehydration and calorie loss, which may heighten stress and slow recovery from surgery."

Alexander Nagrebetsky, M.D., M.Sc., senior author of the study and anesthesiologist and intensivist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, Massachusetts

Researchers reviewed records from 71,835 children, aged 17 or younger (3,771 of whom were infants younger than 1 year old), who had elective surgery at one of 12 U.S. hospitals between 2016 and 2024. In the study, prolonged fasting was defined as fasting from clear liquids for four hours (or longer) before surgery, which is two times longer (or more) than guidelines recommend.

Overall, the proportion of children who fasted from clear liquids for at least two times longer than recommended before surgery decreased from 84.3% in 2016 to 70.2% in 2024, but increased in infants, from 75.9% in 2016 to 79.6% in 2024.

The median length of time all children fasted from clear liquids decreased overall from 10.9 hours in 2016 to 8.7 hours in 2024. However, there was no significant improvement in infants, who fasted a median of 6.7 hours in 2016 and 6.3 hours in 2024. In 2024 alone, the median duration of clear liquid fasting was three times longer than the recommendation in infants and four times longer in all children.

While the study didn't address why parents and health care professionals withheld clear liquids from children for longer than recommended, there are likely several reasons: parents and physicians may be following outdated practices of prolonged fasting (e.g., nothing to drink after midnight); lack of awareness of ASA fasting guidelines that note "efforts should be made to allow clear liquids in healthy children as close to two hours before the procedure as possible;" and a lack of understanding that prolonged fasting can increase complications and negatively impact recovery.

Perioperative team members should encourage patients to drink water and liquids with sugar for up to two hours before the procedure when appropriate, said Dr. Nagrebetsky. Parents should advocate for their children and ask their anesthesiologist about current recommendations for clear liquids before the procedure, he said.

"The study confirmed our hypothesis that non-adherence to ASA fasting guidelines is common in the U.S.," said Ethan Lowder, B.A., lead study author and a student at Harvard Medical School. "Drinking sugar-containing clear liquids such as juices or those with electrolytes provides water and calories that children's bodies need for normal functioning, including dealing with the stress of surgery and recovery."

It is known that depression is linked to increased incidence of metabolic diseases; now scientists have discovered that different types of depression are linked to different cardiometabolic diseases. This work is presented at the ECNP Congress in Amsterdam.

Over seven years, researchers tracked 5,794 adults, enrolled in the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) Study, all of whom were free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at the study's start. At the start of the study each participant completed a comprehensive questionnaire to assess depressive symptoms. The team identified two distinct depressive profiles: one typified by "melancholic" symptoms (such as early morning awakening and reduced appetite), and another by "atypical/energy-related" symptoms (such as fatigue, increased sleep, and increased appetite).

Around 8% of the participants developed a cardiometabolic condition during the follow-up period, but the type of condition they developed depended on the type of depression they had. Those with atypical/energy-related" symptoms were around 2.7 times more likely to develop Type-2 diabetes than individuals without depressive symptoms. They showed no significant increase in cardiovascular disease.

In contrast, those who had "melancholic" symptoms were around 1.5 times more at risk of cardiovascular disease (such as a heart attack, or stroke) than individuals without depressive symptoms, with no significant increase in type 2 diabetes.

Lead researcher Dr. Yuri Milaneschi (Amsterdam UNC) said:

"Further metabolic analysis revealed that patients with the atypical/energy-related symptoms showed disruptions in inflammatory and metabolic processes linked to cardiometabolic health. This biological signature was not seen in those with "melancholic" symptoms, suggesting biochemical differences in the way that different types of depression link to cardiovascular health. 

We already knew that not all depressions are the same, but this means that we may need to consider how the type of depression someone has impacts different areas of their physical health. It very much pushes us towards the idea of precision psychiatry – the idea that we need to look for physical associations with mental health profiles, so that we can better treat mental illness. To treat sufferers individually".

Commenting, Dr. Chiara Fabbri (of the University of Bologna) said:

"The prevention and treatment of physical diseases in people with depression are not less important than the treatment of depression. These physical conditions are common and expected to raise, for example the number of people with diabetes (66 million) in the EUR Region will see a 10% increase by 2050 according to the International Diabetes Federation. It is a health care priority to prevent cardiometabolic diseases, diagnose them early, and continue to improve monitoring and treatment. This study on the NEO cohort provides highly valuable data on how to do this better for people suffering from depressive symptoms".

Dr. Fabbri was not involved in this work; this is an independent comment.

Older patients who primarily speak a language other than English may face a greater risk of developing delirium after surgery in U.S. hospitals, according to new research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting. The study also found that a lower socioeconomic status further increased patients' risk.

Postoperative delirium is a change in mental function that can cause confusion in up to 15% of surgical patients. In certain high-risk patients, such as those with hip fractures, the incidence can be even higher. It is a significant complication in older adults.

Our study provides evidence that speaking a first or primary language other than English is an independent risk factor for delirium in U.S. patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery, even after ruling out other factors such as prior diagnoses of sleep apnea and type and duration of surgery. We also found that delirium in these patients contributed to longer hospital stays, which can further delay recovery."

Maximilian Schaefer, M.D., Ph.D., senior author of the study, director of the Center for Anesthesia Excellence at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and associate professor of anesthesia at Harvard Medical School, Boston

U.S. health systems are providing care to increasingly diverse patient populations, including those whose first or primary language is not English. Before and after surgery, language barriers can contribute to confusion and agitation in patients, two factors that are associated with the development of postoperative delirium.

The study included 49,588 patients, age 60 or older, who had general anesthesia for non-cardiac and non-transplant surgery between 2011 and 2024 at a U.S. academic hospital. Researchers reviewed nursing and physician charts and used other assessment methods and tools to identify patients who developed delirium within seven days after surgery. Their analysis was adjusted for patient and procedural factors, including social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status.

Among the 49,588 patients studied, 4,287 (8.7%) reported speaking a primary language other than English, with Spanish (28.5%) and Cantonese (13.5%) the most prevalent. Overall, 2,328 (4.7%) of the patients studied developed postoperative delirium - 2,093 whose primary language was English and 235 whose primary language was not English. Researchers concluded that patients whose primary language was not English were 23% more likely to develop delirium after surgery, than those whose primary language was English. Additionally, this risk was 31% higher in non-English-speaking patients with lower estimated household incomes.

In patients who primarily spoke Spanish or other non-English languages, 151 of the 235 who developed delirium had interpreter support, but this did not reduce delirium risk.

"Most clinical interactions happen on the wards and in the ICU, where interpreter services aren't always readily available - especially in the first days after surgery, when most delirium occurs," said Dr. Schaefer. "While more research is needed on mechanisms, we suspect that greater confusion and fewer opportunities for verbal reorientation during this early postoperative phase may help explain the elevated delirium risk, even when interpreters are used."

It is important that the full health care team is alerted to language barriers early during a patient's perioperative care, so that accommodations can be made that extend beyond interpreter services, the authors note. For example, assigning health care providers who speak the patient's language, ensuring family members are present to help with verbal reorientation, and seeing patients in the pre-admission testing clinic to identify risk factors for delirium can all help improve outcomes. However, the authors acknowledge that disparities in health care access and delivery are structural issues that need to be addressed beyond the individual patient level.

New mothers are more likely to experience severe pain that disrupts sleep and activities of daily living, as well as develop sleep disorders, if they give birth by cesarean delivery (C-section), suggests research presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.

Sleep is often overlooked in postpartum recovery, but it is central to a mother's physical and mental health. Cesarean delivery in particular appears to increase the risk for severe pain and sleep disorders, which can lead to postpartum depression, thinking and memory problems, and fatigue, as well as disrupt bonding with their babies and relationships with family and friends."

Moe Takenoshita, M.B.B.Ch., lead author of the study and postdoctoral scholar, department of anesthesia, Stanford University Center for Academic Medicine, Palo Alto, California

The study included both qualitative and quantitative analyses. For the qualitative analysis, the authors interviewed 41 mothers about their pain and sleep experiences after childbirth, 24 of whom had vaginal births, 11 who had scheduled C-sections and six whose C-sections were unplanned. More than two-thirds of the mothers who had C-sections (73% of the scheduled cesareans and 67% of the unplanned) reported severe pain that disrupted sleep and activities of daily living, compared to 8% of those who had vaginal births.

For the quantitative study, the authors analyzed a nationwide insurance database of more than 1.5 million mothers who delivered babies between 2008 and 2021. They determined that individuals who have C-sections are 16% more likely to be diagnosed with a new sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, sleep deprivation or obstructive sleep apnea) between a month and a year after giving birth, compared to those who delivered vaginally.

New mothers, especially those recovering from C-sections, should be sure to manage pain adequately, since untreated pain can worsen sleep, said Dr. Takenoshita. Other measures that can help to improve sleep include regular exercise as appropriate, sleeping when the baby sleeps, avoiding caffeine or alcohol late in the day, and relaxing before bed by taking a bath or practicing deep breathing.

"About one-third of U.S. births are C-sections," said Dr. Takenoshita. "Those who are planning a C-section should understand that the procedure is linked to more severe pain after delivery and a higher risk of sleep disorders. Anyone having sleep problems during pregnancy or after childbirth should discuss their concerns with their physician, who can evaluate the issue, make recommendations and refer them to a specialist if necessary."

By confirming cognitive impairment before ordering amyloid blood tests, this two-step approach cuts false positives, streamlines referrals, and moves Alzheimer's diagnosis closer to everyday clinics.

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers in Sweden and the United States assessed whether a brief self-administered digital cognitive battery, alone or combined with a blood-based amyloid biomarker panel, more accurately detects cognitive impairment and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) in primary care than standard care.

One in every three older adults worries about memory loss, yet many never receive a timely, accurate diagnosis. AD is the leading cause of dementia, driven by amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau aggregation, and neurodegeneration. Early stages like subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often slip past brief paper tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), especially in rushed clinics. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) can confirm pathology, but these methods are invasive, costly, or scarce. Blood tests like phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) are promising, yet pretest probabilities vary widely in primary care, with amyloid positivity generally lower in SCD and higher in MCI or dementia, influencing positive predictive value (PPV). International guidance increasingly emphasizes two-step workflows that confirm impairment before biomarker testing. Further research should validate efficient, accurate, and scalable frontline pathways.

The investigators trained and validated BioCog, a tablet-based, self-administered test battery, across two Swedish cohorts. A secondary-care cohort from the BioFINDER-2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03174938) was used to build logistic-regression models and establish cutoffs; an independent primary-care cohort from 19 clinics in the BioFINDER-Primary Care study (NCT06120361) served for external validation. BioCog included a ten-word list (three immediate recalls, delayed recall, and delayed recognition), a cognitive processing-speed task, and items related to orientation to time. Objective cognitive impairment was defined using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS); in secondary care, a proxy for the RBANS from similar neuropsychological tests was used.

Model selection employed recursive feature elimination with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and receiver-operating-characteristic area under the curve (AUC) for performance. One-cutoff and two-cutoff schemes were predefined; the latter created an intermediate zone to be resolved by further evaluation. Two BioCog probability thresholds (0.332 and 0.769) were chosen to target 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Primary-care physicians (PCPs) performed standard evaluations, including MMSE, MoCA, computed tomography, and clinical judgment. A two-step workflow was tested: Step 1 involved BioCog to detect impairment; Step 2 involved a plasma panel (PrecivityAD2) generating the Amyloid Probability Score-2 (APS2) from Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau217, and non-p-tau217. Sensitivity analyses used the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score ≥0.5 as an alternative impairment reference.



Comparing a digital testing and blood biomarker-based diagnostic workflow to the current standard clinical evaluation in the primary care cohort. Comparisons were made on a subset of individuals with all existing data available (n = 365; see Supplementary Table 17 for detailed population characteristics). a. Our proposed primary care two-step workflow consists of step 1, the detection of cognitive impairment using the BioCog, followed by step 2, a blood biomarker assessment to evaluate whether AD pathology is present in cognitively impaired individuals. b, Evaluation of the workflow using our BioCog6 model for step 1 and the plasma biomarker APS2 for step 2 (green). The workflow was compared against a standard clinical evaluation by PCPs in which the physician assesses both whether the patient had cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) and whether the impairment was caused by AD (without any biomarkers) (PCPAD, orange), and against a workflow using only the plasma biomarker APS2 without any cognitive assessment (red). Error bars indicate 95% CI, with the center point corresponding to the mean value. Credit: Images in a adapted from NIAID NIH BIOART (https://bioart.niaid.nih.gov). 

In secondary care (n=223; mean age 73 years), the best six-variable model (BioCog6: delayed recall, processing-speed correct, immediate recall performance, total time, age, and delayed recognition) achieved an AUC of 0.96 and 89% accuracy for objectively verified cognitive impairment at a single cutoff. A two-cutoff approach reached 96% accuracy with 18% of participants in an intermediate zone requiring follow-up. Psychometrics supported feasibility and validity: strong convergent correlations with paper analogs, weak divergent correlations with unrelated domains, an average completion time of about 11 minutes, and only around 2% reporting difficulty with instructions.

External validation in primary care (n=403; mean age 77 years) showed BioCog6 AUC 0.93 and 85% accuracy (positive predictive value [PPV] 87%, negative predictive value [NPV] 83%, sensitivity 88%, specificity 82%) using one cutoff, significantly outperforming PCP assessment (accuracy 73%) based on usual testing and imaging. With two cutoffs carried over from training, accuracy rose to 90% (PPV 91%, NPV 89%) with an 18% intermediate group. Head-to-head comparisons favored BioCog6 over MMSE, MoCA, Mini-Cog, and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) paired-associates learning, both in one-cutoff analyses and, where available, two-cutoff analyses, even after demographic adjustments.

Critically, the two-step workflow tailored for primary care, BioCog first, then blood testing only for those objectively impaired, identified biomarker-verified clinical AD (impairment due to AD by expert consensus with CSF or Aβ-PET support) with 90% accuracy (PPV 83%, NPV 93%, specificity 92%, sensitivity 84%). This surpassed PCP-only pathways (accuracy 70%) and outperformed blood testing alone (accuracy 80%), which showed an approximate 17% false-positive rate when used without an impairment filter. Using two cutoffs for both BioCog and APS2 raised accuracy to 95% with a larger intermediate zone (about 30%), emphasizing a trade-off between certainty and indeterminate referrals. Findings were accurate when substituting CDR ≥0.5 for RBANS (primary metrics dipped modestly but remained high) and when removing age from the BioCog model.

Interpretation centers on pretest probability: because only individuals with cognitive impairment (not SCD) are eligible for recently implemented Aβ-targeting immunotherapies, an efficient front-end filter that confirms impairment before blood biomarkers reduces false positives, improves PPV, and aligns with international recommendations and the World Health Organization's preferred product profile for blood tests. Digital delivery standardizes administration, captures timing features beyond raw scores, and minimizes personnel time, advantages for busy clinics facing growing demand. However, the authors caution that BioCog must complement, not replace, clinical judgment and that validation in other languages, cultures, and longitudinal settings is still required.

This proof-of-concept demonstrates that a brief, self-administered digital cognitive battery can accurately identify objective cognitive impairment in primary care. When followed by a targeted blood-biomarker panel, it can diagnose clinical AD with substantially higher accuracy than the current standard-of-care. The stepwise “test-then-blood” approach enhances diagnostic certainty, reduces inappropriate referrals, and prioritizes candidates for Aβ-targeting therapies. While generalizability beyond Swedish settings and longitudinal utility need further study, the pathway is practical, scalable, and consistent with international guidance: confirm impairment first, then use blood biomarkers to infer amyloid pathology, bringing earlier, more confident diagnoses within reach of routine clinics.

A new global metric shows how everyday foods, from beef to coffee, carry vastly different extinction costs, exposing how our diets and imports quietly shape the future of Earth's wildlife.



Study: Food impacts on species extinction risks can vary by three orders of magnitude. Image Credit: Leszek Kobusinski / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Food, researchers leveraged global food production and consumption data (140 unique items) and a novel, high-resolution "LIFE" biodiversity metric to investigate the relative impacts of different foods on species extinction risk, using a metric they term "extinction opportunity costs."

Study findings revealed that the impact of producing 1 kg of food can vary by up to three orders of magnitude across different food types. Animal products, especially ruminant meat, and commodities grown in the tropics (e.g., coffee and cocoa), were consistently observed to carry the highest species extinction risk. These findings elucidate the substantial relative costs of agricultural choices on ecology, thereby guiding future conservation and food production policy for sustainable outcomes.

Temperate crops can be low-risk, High-yield crops grown in low-biodiversity regions, such as European sugar beet, which carry among the lowest extinction impacts per kilogram, a stark contrast to tropical sugar cane cultivated in biodiversity hotspots.

The global food production system is increasingly recognized as a primary threat to nature, linked to substantial land-use change and habitat destruction for agriculture. As the world's human population continues to rise, agricultural and food production is now recognized as the leading cause of the ongoing ecological extinction crisis.

Mitigating ongoing biodiversity loss associated with food production requires a robust understanding of which foods are most damaging and where they are produced, thereby informing conservation policy efforts. Unfortunately, previous attempts to quantify the biodiversity impacts of food have been limited.

Standard methods like life-cycle analysis (LCA) often rely on subjective metrics, are limited in their spatial and taxonomic scope, and lack the spatial detail to account for the fact that crops grown in a tropical biodiversity hotspot have a vastly different impact than the same crops grown in a temperate region. A more sophisticated, globally consistent approach is required to inform effective interventions, from individual dietary choices to international trade policy.

Luxury crops carry a heavy toll. Tea, coffee, cocoa, and spices may be consumed sparingly, but they rank among the highest per-kg extinction drivers, especially when sourced from ecologically rich regions like Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, or the Andes.

The present study addresses these knowledge gaps by developing a powerful new biodiversity metric called LIFE (Land-cover change Impacts on Future Extinctions), which leverages detailed global data on food production, consumption, and trade from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

LIFE is a high-resolution global map (1.8 km² resolution) that estimates the marginal impact of agricultural land use on the extinction risk of approximately 30,000 terrestrial vertebrate species, calculating the "extinction opportunity cost." This cost represents the forgone opportunity to restore biodiversity that arises from continued agricultural land use. In essence, it measures the potential reduction in extinction risk if a parcel of farmland were returned to its natural habitat.

The study used the LIFE metric to evaluate the impacts of 140 individual food products across both the holistic global context and within six exemplar countries with diverse dietary and trade profiles: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Brazil, India, and Uganda.



Global variation across and within commodities in the expected extinction impact of producing 1 kg of agricultural commodity or commodity group. The lower and upper boundaries of the boxes represent the production-mass-weighted 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. Horizontal lines represent the weighted global median (50th percentile). Where commodities are grouped, the per-kilogram extinction risk values of each constituent commodity are weighted by their contribution (by mass) to the total global production of that group. 

Dairy's middle-ground impact. While less damaging than beef or lamb, dairy still demands significant land for grazing and feed, placing it well above legumes and grains in biodiversity cost - a reminder that “meat-free” is not always impact-free.

Study findings revealed an unexpectedly high variation in the biodiversity impacts of different foods, spanning up to three orders of magnitude between foods with the lowest impacts versus those with the highest. Animal products were found to have a substantially greater effect on species extinction risk than staple plant-based foods.

Specifically, the global median opportunity cost of ruminant meat (e.g., beef and lamb) was found to be approximately 340 times greater than that of grains by mass. When rerunning the analysis to account for protein content, the impact of ruminant meat remained 100 times higher than that of protein-rich plants like soybeans and other legumes, highlighting the robustness of the analysis and the warning of the observed outcomes.

"Luxury" crops grown in tropical regions (coffee, cocoa, and tea) also ranked among the most impactful commodities per kilogram. Crucially, the impact also varied dramatically by provenance for the same product; for example, coffee from South America and sub-Saharan Africa had an impact approximately ten times greater than that produced in Southeast Asia.

Study analysis finally revealed that the biodiversity footprints of some nations are overwhelmingly externalized. A staggering 95% of the UK's and 98% of Japan's food-related extinction impacts occur in the countries from which they import.

In contrast, the effects from food consumed in Brazil and India were almost entirely domestic, at 98% and 96%, respectively. In the United States, the impact was also largely domestic, with imports accounting for only about 10%.

Across all countries studied, ruminant meat was the dominant driver of per capita impacts. Even in India, where a third of the population is lacto-vegetarian, ruminant meats (mainly sheep and goat) were found to contribute to 40% of the country's total impact on species extinction due to food production.

Despite widespread vegetarianism, India's extinction footprint is heavily driven by dairy and small ruminants (goat and sheep), which account for around 40% of the country's food-related biodiversity impact.

The present study provides the most detailed and globally comprehensive assessment to date of how different foods contribute to the extinction crisis. Animal products, particularly ruminant meat, and foods grown in tropical biodiversity hotspots were revealed to carry an excessively disproportionate environmental burden. Study analysis underscores the immense potential for dietary change to mitigate harm.

Encouragingly, data from the US-based scenario shows that shifting from a typical Western diet to the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, with a reduction in ruminant meat consumption from 4% to 1%, reduces the extinction opportunity cost of an individual's diet by almost three-quarters. The study also found that shifting to hypothetical vegetarian and vegan diets in the US resulted in even greater reductions, cutting the remaining impact by more than half again, while a similar shift to a plant-based diet in the UK was found to reduce the effects by just over 50%.

However, the authors are careful to note several important caveats and limitations to their work. First, the analysis does not include all commodities, notably omitting aquatic foods, palm oil, and sugar due to data challenges.

Second, the study relies on relatively coarse data and does not yet account for the intensity of agricultural production, such as intensive versus extensive grazing, or impacts on plants and invertebrates.

Third, the authors stress that their metric is "marginal," meaning it is designed to compare the effect of one additional unit of a food and cannot be simply scaled up to calculate the total global impact of agriculture.

Finally, the study focuses exclusively on extinction risk from land use, and does not measure other critical harms like those from fertilizer runoff, pesticide use, or greenhouse gas emissions.

The authors also caution against simplistic policy interpretations. For example, while the UK and Japan "offshore" their biodiversity impact, the paper warns that policies promoting low-yielding domestic agriculture could inadvertently increase reliance on imports from more biodiverse regions, potentially causing a net increase in global biodiversity loss. These findings suggest that while the present scenario appears bleak, informed dietary changes and carefully considered policies may substantially improve future outcomes.

The U.S. men's national team is looking for a win to round out October.

Friday's outing against Ecuador resulted in a 1-1 draw, as veteran striker Enner Valencia outmaneuvered Chris Richards to open the scoring in the first half before Folarin Balogun rescued a draw with his second-half finish.

Ecuador did not have stars Moises Caicedo and Piero Hincapie, though the U.S. also is dealing with injury issues as Christian Pulisic, among others, was not deemed fit enough to start.

There is hope that Pulisic and Co. can get in some minutes, though starting left-back Antonee Robinson will not play again, despite being called up, due to an ongoing knee issue.

Next up for the U.S. is Australia, which is ranked No. 25 in the world by FIFA, one spot behind Ecuador. The U.S. is at No. 16, so the Socceroos will provide another test as they have qualified for the 2026 World Cup.

Unlike Ecuador, Australia doesn't have many notable names at top clubs, but there are some promising young players hoping to take that next step.

Following the October break, the U.S. will face off against fellow World Cup-qualified teams in Paraguay and Uruguay in November, the last set of senior international games on the calendar until March.

Here's everything to know to catch the U.S.-Australia friendly:



The U.S. and Australia will meet on Tuesday, Oct. 14.

Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT.

Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado, home of the MLS' Rapids, is the venue for the game.

The U.S. and Australia have only met three times, all in international friendlies. The U.S. is 1-1-1 in those fixtures, the last being a 3-1 win on June 5, 2010.

The game will be broadcast in English on TNT. NBC's Universo will carry the game in Spanish.

HBO Max will stream the game in English, while Peacock will stream it in Spanish.

The Socceroos, as aforementioned, don't have any bonafide names. Goalie Maty Ryan has experience with notable European clubs, while left-back Jordy Bos, center-back Alessandro Circati and winger Nestory Irankunda are the nation's most promising talents currently.

Commerce City, CO – The U.S. Men's National Team will host Australia for a friendly tomorrow at DICK's Sporting Goods Park. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. MT. The Yanks are coming off a meh 1-1 result against Ecuador last Friday. The fanbase continues to be underwhelmed going into a home World Cup next summer. Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino and the players are preaching progress. 

“There were opportunities for us to be ruthless. When you're playing against top sides, you concede half a chance and it's a goal. We can just brush up on the defensive mistakes, continue to create and be more clinical, we'll be a strong side,” said forward Florian Balogun of the Ecuador game. 

Poch on Zack Steffen not getting called in:Zack we know well. He's on a radar. It's about performance and fitness. He was unlucky in past camps. If he preforms, he will have a chance.

Poch has gone back and forth between a back four and a back five in recent camps. Three center backs has given them more defensive cover but there are questions about depth at the position outside of Chris Richards. Veteran glue guy Cristian Roldan likes it: 

“It suits our team overall as well. Three center backs, even a center back playing at right back, building in a three, allowing our midfielders to step a little bit higher and get our two 10s in the pockets, it suits us a whole lot better. 

“That allows the two center mids to be more aggressive, even man oriented. In a four, you have one guy further up the field. Once you're broken down, you got to recover.”

“They already know when we play in one or another shape, the way that we play. The most important things is the communication. We need to be ready to build from back and find good lines of the pass. Visualize. Have this flexibility and capacity. I think they (the center backs called into this camp) have the quality,” said Pochettino. 

They'll look to build out of the back and go at a more defensive Australia, who will look to counter attack. How the USMNT balances playing on the front foot against deferential opponents while ramping up for going toe-to-toe with bigger nations they will meet in a knockout game continues to be a question. 

Poch has worried the fanbase in a few ways. Communication and creating a culture has been one of those. He was hired late in the process after U.S. Soccer chose to part ways with Gregg Berhalter. There was also the factor that the Yanks qualified automatically as hosts and did not have an intense Concacaf qualification process. 

Balogun: “The intensity is created by the coach. He's created an environment so quickly that doesn't create certainty for anyone. Nobody's place is guaranteed. The internal pressure's coming from him. He's ruthless.”

Aaronson: “There's more of a seriousness because it's right around the corner. We don't have many camps left. We have to treat every friendly like it's a real game. That's the mentality. We've done a good job training the mentality of these friendlies. It's good to be a little bit more chill.

“We've always had a good relationship. From the first camp that we had together, we talked. It's been a great time learning under him. I'm looking forward to keep it growing.”

Brendan Aaronson on his brother Paxten:It's a bonus being able to see him here, and he got to show me around. Got to go see his apartment. I can tell that Denver is an amazing city.I'm really happy for him. I think it's a huge step in his life. He's doing amazing so far.

Roldan: “In all seriousness, we're here to play against two tough sides. We got a day off yesterday. Guys were able to do as they please but with structure, being home at a good time,” he said avoiding saying whether the guys went golfing or not. 

To close things out, Pochettino said that Christian Pulisic has reacted well with the ankle injury. They will evaluate him tomorrow to see if what his availability is. Antonee Robinson has been in training but will be unavailable for the game with a knee injury.

COMMERCE CITY, Colorado — U.S. star Christian Pulisic trained Monday with the national team and is available for selection for Tuesday's friendly against Australia.

Coach Mauricio Pochettino told the English-language TNT broadcast last week that Pulisic had some swelling in his ankle after training. Pulisic did not start in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador on Friday night in Austin, but subbed into the game in the 73rd minute for Tim Weah. The AC Milan attacker, who has six goals and two assists across all competitions for Milan this season, did not look limited in his outing against Ecuador.

Pulisic, who was named the Serie A Player of the Month in September, was on the training field for the public portion Monday and, barring a setback, should be available for the Americans on Tuesday.

“Christian participated in the training session, the reaction after 20 minutes of playing (on Friday) was good,” Pochettino said at Monday's pregame news conference. “He reacted very well (and the) hope (is) that tomorrow he can be available. We have to wait today (to see) the reaction, too, but much better than when he arrived.”

While Pulisic could play a role against Australia, Pochettino ruled out left back Antonee Robinson. The Fulham defender was not at training during the public portion open to reporters. Robinson did not play against Ecuador because of the knee injury that forced him to have surgery this offseason.

Robinson has played a limited role for Fulham early this season and said last week that coming into the camp, “there hasn't really been a specific conversation about how many minutes I'm going to play this trip, if any.” Right now, it looks like it will be the latter, with Robinson getting a chance to be back around the group and the coaching staff, but not yet at the level to contribute on the field.

“Antonee from (the) beginning of camp (had) some small issues in his knee, a little bit of pain,” Pochettino said. “We are managing him in the best way, but (he) still cannot be involved in training and for sure cannot be involved in the game. Hope that it's not an important thing, but he'll go back to his club in a normal way there (and hopefully will be) training and competing.”

Winger Alejandro Zendejas left camp and returned to Club America after the Ecuador game due to a knee injury.

The USMNT's Monday training session took place in blustery, 50-degree conditions just outside Denver. Staffers wore puffy coats. Multiple players, including Pulisic and Weston McKennie, wore winter hats at the start of training.

“We need to pay attention that we change from Austin to Denver. The conditions are completely different,” Pochettino said shortly after training. “You saw, we suffered.”

“And also, some players are tired,” Pochettino continued. “Some players have some — I think [we need] not to take a risk.”

Considering those factors, Pochettino said that he'd make lineup changes for the game against Australia.

“It's a good opportunity also to keep improving and showing, maybe, different approaches to the game,” he said. “For sure, there are going to be changes, and maybe change the shape.”

Cape Verde have become the second smallest nation to qualify for the FIFA World Cup after beating Eswatini 3-0 to book their place at next year's tournament.

The island nation knew that victory would secure their World Cup spot heading into the match.

Goals from Dailon Livramento and Willy Semedo either side of half-time saw the team close on the historic accomplishment.

A third goal from defender Stopira in second half stoppage time sealed the 3-0 victory to start celebrations at their national stadium.

With a population 524,877 according to the World Bank, Cape Verde is roughly the same size as Sheffield.

Iceland qualified for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with the nation having an estimated population of around 335,000 at the time.

The nation had been part of Portugal until it declared independence back in 1975.

Cape Verde had not been a member of FIFA until 1982 and first attempted to qualify for the World Cup back in 2002.  

The national team, known as the Blue Sharks, had seen six unsuccessful attempts but will now feature in next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The team, coached by Bubista, have qualified after finishing top of their group with seven wins, two draws and one defeat.

Cape Verde had spurned a chance to seal qualification last week after drawing 3-3 against Libya, but got over the line with victory on Monday.

The result saw them finish four points clear of Cameroon, who have the record for most appearances at the World Cup by an African nation with eight.

Cape Verde had shown improvement in recent years by qualifying for the African Cup of Nations on four occasions.

The national team reached the quarter-finals on debut in 2013 and repeated the feat a decade later in the Ivory Coast.

Despite reaching the World Cup, they failed to qualify for the upcoming African Cup of Nations later this year.

Cape Verde have benefited from FIFA's expansion of the tournament to 48 teams, up from 32.

The expansion ensured nine direct qualification spots for African nations, marking an increase from five previously.

Cape Verde are the third nation assured of making their World Cup debuts next year, with Uzbekistan and Jordan also qualifying for the first time. 

Cameroon now face a wait to see whether they will participate in Africa's World Cup play-offs.

The Indomitable Lions, whose squad includes stars such as André Onana, Carlos Baleba and Bryan Mbeumo, need to be one of the four best runners-up across the group stage.

They would then need to win two knock-out matches to advance to an additional intercontinental qualifier in March.

Liverpool face an anxious wait over Ryan Gravenberch's fitness after the midfielder was substituted at half-time during the Netherlands' World Cup qualifier against Finland on Sunday. The Dutchman has emerged as one of the Reds' most important players under Arne Slot, and the injury comes at an inopportune time; the Premier League champions have lost all of their last three fixtures.

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is set to be handed a massive boost, with Lisandro Martinez poised to return from an ACL injury he sustained eight months ago in February. The Argentina international is now targeting a return before the end of October, as he looks to add to the mere 16 appearances he has made under Amorim's management thus far at Old Trafford.

Scarlett, who has represented England at various junior age groups, was called up by Thomas Tuchel to train with the Three Lions after star striker Ollie Watkins had to pull out of the squad due to an injury.

White House planners have been increasingly focused on securing airspace over stadiums.

The Trump administration is moving to fortify U.S. skies against potential drone threats ahead of next summer's World Cup and other marquee mega-events, casting the technology as necessary both to bolster security and to help outpace foreign competition for aviation technology.

The administration plans to launch a $500 million effort to support state and local governments as they develop anti-drone security strategies ahead of the soccer tournament being played across the U.S., Canada and Mexico, along with the United States' 250th anniversary and 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to Andrew Giuliani, director of the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force.

The White House says the money will be available to all 50 states but put to particular use to secure the 104 soccer matches that will be played in American stadiums. Officials envision urban police departments using handheld tools to detect aircraft, then either disabling them via jamming technology or ordering them to return to their points of origin.

“Everybody from the governors to different commissioners of the police in these different cities to the stadium chief security officer say that this is something that they need in order to protect the [World Cup] sites,” Giuliani told POLITICO in an interview.

The program, which comes out of funds budgeted to the Department of Homeland Security by the One Big Beautiful Bill enacted in July, reflects growing concern within the White House and national security agencies about uncrewed aerial threats, especially at major events — from well-organized terrorists, criminal mischief-makers or just overeager amateurs unaware that the airspace has been closed.

The funding will further insert the White House into a controversial debate over which law enforcement officials should be able to intercept or disable drones. Currently only federal agencies can do so, and a House bill that would extend that capacity to local police appears stalled. The administration is exploring contingency plans that would allow the Justice Department to temporarily authorize state and local officials to take down rogue drones in the event that Congress fails to act.

“Drones are a disruptive technology. They have an amazing potential for both good and ill,” Seb Gorka, the National Security Council's senior director for counterterrorism, has said. “We will increase the enforcement of current laws to deter two types of individuals: evildoers and idiots — the clueless and the careless.”

In August, Gorka joined Giuliani to meet with representatives of the local-organizing committees in the 11 American cities that will host World Cup matches. Drones have become “a key part” of planning by the White House task force, said Giuliani. The leading security officer for FIFA, soccer's international governing body, has identified drones as the greatest security challenge for the 39-day tournament.

“Let's use the World Cup as the urgency, right?” said Giuliani, whose task force was formed in coordination with the National Security Council, DHS and Department of Justice and now meets daily to align federal and local security efforts. “In nine months, World Cup games are going to kick off, and there's no pushing that back. So let's get the equipment we need to make sure that it's as safe as possible.”

World Cup host cities already have access to a $625 million grant program, created by the One Beautiful Bill Act and now administered by DHS, to reimburse security costs related to tournament preparations. States and territories will soon receive guidance on how to apply for drone-security funds.

“There will be a certain minimal amount that's available for every state, whether or not they host World Cup games or America 250 events,” Giuliani said.

The U.S., Canada and Mexico held the first trilateral meeting on counter-drone coordination this summer in Mexico City despite differing legal frameworks across the three World Cup co-hosts.

“We're going to put our best practices forward and urge our co-hosts to come to the table with their best practices as well,” he said, “and see what ultimately are best practices for all three of the countries to move forward there.” 

Still, gaps in U.S. law remain a key obstacle. Under current federal rules, only the Justice and Homeland Security Departments have the authority to take down or intercept unmanned aircraft in unauthorized locations or otherwise considered a threat.

“DHS, FBI, the FAA, and the state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement partners who will partner with them during the FIFA World Cup matches must be equipped with the resources and legal frameworks necessary to mitigate drone threats across all venues where airspace security risks are identified,” FIFA Chief Safety and Security Officer G.B. Jones told a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month. “This includes matches, FIFA fan training sites and other large outdoor gatherings where drone threats may compromise safety and security.”

That concern has prompted competing efforts in state capitals and on Capitol Hill to clarify lines of responsibility between governmental authorities. In September, more than 30 governors urged Congress to pass legislation granting states the same drone mitigation powers as federal agencies. The House Transportation Committee has approved a bill that includes a pilot program that would do so at certain events, but it is unclear when that will head to the House floor.

Beyond the World Cup, the administration is tying drone policy to broader industrial and defense goals. In June, Trump signed executive orders to enhance airspace security, accelerate domestic drone innovation and expand commercial operations.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has described drones as part of a “weapons-technology revolution,” has warned that they “are being used to smuggle deadly drugs, target our infrastructure and spy on U.S. defenses.”

We've got some big World Cup qualifiers ahead of us as the men's international break finally kicks into gear then come Wednesday it's the second round of games in the Women's Champions League. I'm James Benge, let's get to it.

Every coach in the international game will tell you that performances are more important than results and if that is indeed the case, then the USA look to be trending in the right direction. A 1-1 draw with Ecuador might not seem much to write home about on paper, but for starters it is worth bearing in mind that Friday's opponents have just finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying and have some of the best defensive talent in the sport. When Enner Valencia gave them a 24th minute lead in Austin, La Tri could well have expected to hold on.

Instead, Mauricio Pochettino's side penned back their visitors, dominating possession and taking the vast majority of the shots before Folarin Balogun's equalizer following some gorgeous interplay down the right. A 1-1 draw was no less than the USMNT deserved and although this is the sort of bar so low you might stumble over it, you could not argue with Tony Meola's assessment on Call It What You Want that this was the team's best game under Pochettino.

This seems like a team who is starting to coalesce around the back three that Pochettino introduced in the second half of a defeat to South Korea in September. It seems to fit personnel who were there -- Chris Richards and Timothy Weah have looked particularly adept -- and those who are yet to join up with the group. Imagine the damage that Antonee Robinson might do down the left with a little more support behind him and Sergino Dest across from him. Already you can see experimentation with the base template too, Weston McKennie drifting into midfield from a nominal role as the right-sided attacking midfielder while Weah dangerously attacked space infield from right wing back.

Crucial to making a 3-4-2-1 work to its fullest is a center forward who can do a bit of everything, attacking the number 10 position when his support forwards drift wide and stretching the defense with runs in behind. In Balogun the USA got that on Friday night, as Chuck Booth explains:

Since the day it became apparent he was entertaining a switch of international allegiance, Balogun had been heralded as the No.9 for the home World Cup. Friday was a sign as to why such thinking was only somewhat premature. He really could slot into this system quite elegantly.

And now there is time to bed that system in. It is easy to see what the vision might be from here out. The US should beat Australia in Denver on Tuesday night. From there on, Pochettino can hope to get even more of his best players together in November and March, testing them out against high grade South American and potentially European opponents such that the hosts are raring to go come the summer. Whether that actually transpires is still a pretty open question. It wasn't so long ago that the US seemed to be stumbling in the dark in pursuit of the basics. At least now though, they appear to have the building blocks.

While the hosts can think about how they might want to line up next summer there are plenty of other nations with work to do if they are to even play in the World Cup. The expanded 48-team structure might have afforded more opportunities for European qualifiers but the smaller groups in UEFA competitions have thrown the door open to a bit more variance, meaning that, for instance, there is real jeopardy for Germany on their trip to Northern Ireland. Having already been surprised once in Slovakia they can ill afford a defeat in Belfast if they want to avoid the playoffs by finishing first.

The stakes are similarly high for Belgium, who face Wales on Monday with both sides battling to just catch up with Group J leaders North Macedonia, on whom they hold a game in hand. Lose in Cardiff and what is left of the Belgian golden generation would be facing a very tricky trip to Kazakhstan in November. Italy too will be fearing what comes with dropped points when they host Israel in Udine. Avoiding defeat would have Gennaro Gattuso's team set fare for a top two berth that has seemed in doubt at some stages of the cycle, but realistically only nine points from nine will give them a chance of overhauling Norway.

As ever, though, it is Africa that promises to deliver the greatest drama on the final days of its first phase. Cape Verde, the island nation of just over half a million people, can secure its first ever berth at a World Cup with a win over Eswatini. Meanwhile by far the most populous nation in the continent -- and one of its great footballing powers -- has an almighty struggle on its hands. Nigeria must beat Benin by two goals to have even a chance of a top two finish in Group C, something which may be enough for them to reach the second round qualifiers. Even with a win they could really do with a helping hand from Rwanda, who play in South Africa.

To make matters worse, Nigeria's journey to Uyo after a win in Lesotho was delayed by a cracked windscreen on their plane, leading to a grim 20 hours of disrupted flights and long waits. That is hardly optimal preparation for one of the biggest games the Super Eagles have played in years. 

Meanwhile in Asia, Qatar must make home advantage pay as they take on the United Arab Emirates in Al Rayyan knowing a defeat could well see them eliminated from the tournament they hosted in 2022. Given the controversy around them and Saudi Arabia hosting the fourth round phase of AFC qualifying, the pressure is certainly on Qatar. The coming days, then, will be pivotal in shaping the participants in the World Cup.

📈 Trending upwards: The USMNT look to be on the right path, writes Pardeep Cattry, as Pochettino marks his anniversary in charge of the national team.

It's Monday! And if that is altogether too much excitement for the start of another working week, I'll tell you now there's reason to be buzzing. We've got some big World Cup qualifiers ahead of us as the men's international break finally kicks into gear then come Wednesday it's the second round of games in the Women's Champions League. I'm James Benge, let's get to it.

Every coach in the international game will tell you that performances are more important than results and if that is indeed the case, then the USA look to be trending in the right direction. A 1-1 draw with Ecuador might not seem much to write home about on paper, but for starters it is worth bearing in mind that Friday's opponents have just finished second in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying and have some of the best defensive talent in the sport. When Enner Valencia gave them a 24th minute lead in Austin, La Tri could well have expected to hold on.

Instead, Mauricio Pochettino's side penned back their visitors, dominating possession and taking the vast majority of the shots before Folarin Balogun's equalizer following some gorgeous interplay down the right. A 1-1 draw was no less than the USMNT deserved and although this is the sort of bar so low you might stumble over it, you could not argue with Tony Meola's assessment on Call It What You Want that this was the team's best game under Pochettino.

This seems like a team who is starting to coalesce around the back three that Pochettino introduced in the second half of a defeat to South Korea in September. It seems to fit personnel who were there -- Chris Richards and Timothy Weah have looked particularly adept -- and those who are yet to join up with the group. Imagine the damage that Antonee Robinson might do down the left with a little more support behind him and Sergino Dest across from him. Already you can see experimentation with the base template too, Weston McKennie drifting into midfield from a nominal role as the right-sided attacking midfielder while Weah dangerously attacked space infield from right wing back.

Crucial to making a 3-4-2-1 work to its fullest is a center forward who can do a bit of everything, attacking the number 10 position when his support forwards drift wide and stretching the defense with runs in behind. In Balogun the USA got that on Friday night, as Chuck Booth explains:

Since the day it became apparent he was entertaining a switch of international allegiance, Balogun had been heralded as the No.9 for the home World Cup. Friday was a sign as to why such thinking was only somewhat premature. He really could slot into this system quite elegantly.

And now there is time to bed that system in. It is easy to see what the vision might be from here out. The US should beat Australia in Denver on Tuesday night. From there on, Pochettino can hope to get even more of his best players together in November and March, testing them out against high grade South American and potentially European opponents such that the hosts are raring to go come the summer. Whether that actually transpires is still a pretty open question. It wasn't so long ago that the US seemed to be stumbling in the dark in pursuit of the basics. At least now though, they appear to have the building blocks.

While the hosts can think about how they might want to line up next summer there are plenty of other nations with work to do if they are to even play in the World Cup. The expanded 48-team structure might have afforded more opportunities for European qualifiers but the smaller groups in UEFA competitions have thrown the door open to a bit more variance, meaning that, for instance, there is real jeopardy for Germany on their trip to Northern Ireland. Having already been surprised once in Slovakia they can ill afford a defeat in Belfast if they want to avoid the playoffs by finishing first.

The stakes are similarly high for Belgium, who face Wales on Monday with both sides battling to just catch up with Group J leaders North Macedonia, on whom they hold a game in hand. Lose in Cardiff and what is left of the Belgian golden generation would be facing a very tricky trip to Kazakhstan in November. Italy too will be fearing what comes with dropped points when they host Israel in Udine. Avoiding defeat would have Gennaro Gattuso's team set fare for a top two berth that has seemed in doubt at some stages of the cycle, but realistically only nine points from nine will give them a chance of overhauling Norway.

As ever, though, it is Africa that promises to deliver the greatest drama on the final days of its first phase. Cape Verde, the island nation of just over half a million people, can secure its first ever berth at a World Cup with a win over Eswatini. Meanwhile by far the most populous nation in the continent -- and one of its great footballing powers -- has an almighty struggle on its hands. Nigeria must beat Benin by two goals to have even a chance of a top two finish in Group C, something which may be enough for them to reach the second round qualifiers. Even with a win they could really do with a helping hand from Rwanda, who play in South Africa.

To make matters worse, Nigeria's journey to Uyo after a win in Lesotho was delayed by a cracked windscreen on their plane, leading to a grim 20 hours of disrupted flights and long waits. That is hardly optimal preparation for one of the biggest games the Super Eagles have played in years. 

Meanwhile in Asia, Qatar must make home advantage pay as they take on the United Arab Emirates in Al Rayyan knowing a defeat could well see them eliminated from the tournament they hosted in 2022. Given the controversy around them and Saudi Arabia hosting the fourth round phase of AFC qualifying, the pressure is certainly on Qatar. The coming days, then, will be pivotal in shaping the participants in the World Cup.

San Marino, the lowest-ranked soccer nation, can still qualify for the World Cup Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images

San Marino may be at the bottom of the 210 soccer-playing nations in FIFA's men's world rankings, but the microstate still has a possibility of qualifying for next year's World Cup.

The mountainous region in north-central Italy, home to fewer than 34,000 inhabitants, has unsurprisingly lost all seven of its World Cup qualification matches to date, scoring just one goal and conceding 32.

San Marino has only won three of its 219 matches and none of its 169 qualification games for either a World Cup or European Championship. All three of those victories have come against Liechtenstein, another European microstate with a population of 40,000, including two in its recent Nations League campaign.

The Nations League was devised by UEFA, European football's governing body, in 2018 to minimise friendlies — non-competitive matches — and give countries meaningful encounters with similarly-ranked teams. The outcomes of the Nations League also feed into the qualification process for major tournaments, with the four highest-ranked group winners who did not qualify automatically entering a seeded play-off system.

San Marino's two victories over Liechtenstein last year, coupled with a draw against Gibraltar, saw it top its Nations League D group.



Twelve European spots are decided by the winners of the 12 qualifying groups, while four nations will qualify through UEFA's 16-team play-offs, to be played in March 2026. These play-offs will involve 16 teams, who will be split into four paths of four, with each path containing two semi-finals and a final to determine the four extra nations which qualify for the World Cup.

Those 16 teams will comprise 12 group-stage runners-up plus the four best-ranked group winners from the Nations League who did not finish in the top two of their groups in World Cup qualifying.

These were the 14 Nations League group winners for 2024-25, based on ranking priority: Spain, Germany, Portugal, France, England, Norway, Wales, Czechia, Romania, Sweden, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Moldova and San Marino.

As things stand, only Wales, Romania, Sweden, Moldova and San Marino of those nations are not in the top two of their respective World Cup qualification groups, meaning that San Marino — as the lowest-ranked of those five sides — would be the one nation to miss out on a play-off spot.

However, there is an important caveat: Romania are in San Marino's qualification group, and are currently third, behind second-placed Bosnia & Herzegovina and first-placed Austria. Romania play away to Bosnia on November 15, before hosting San Marino on the final matchday, and whether Romania beats Bosnia to a top-two finish — with Austria looking likely to keep first place — is likely to be decided by goal difference.

In this scenario, San Marino's best interests would be served not only by losing to Romania but by losing by as many goals as possible to ensure Romania secure a top-two finish at the expense of Bosnia and therefore create a play-off opening for itself. After hosting Romania, Bosnia faces first-placed Austria in its final qualification match on November 18, when San Marino plays Romania. Austria, meanwhile, face fourth-placed Cyprus on November 15 before its game against Bosnia.

If Bosnia gets favourable results against Romania and/or Austria, San Marino's slim chances of World Cup qualification will dwindle.

San Marino will also hope that Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland maintain a top-two group finish to boost its own hopes. North Macedonia and Wales are in the same group, so one will miss out on a play-off spot, while Moldova has lost all five group matches and therefore cannot mathematically qualify through its group.

San Marino can therefore only make a play-off spot if one or fewer of Romania, Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland miss out on a top-two finish in their groups.

The four teams who qualify for the World Cup qualification play-offs through the Nations League route will be in pot four, meaning they will play away against a pot one side — the four World Cup qualifying group runners-up with the best FIFA world ranking — in their play-off semi-final.

The other semi-final will see a pot two side, ranked fifth to eighth in the world ranking list, hosting a team from pot three, ranked ninth to 12th.

FIFA, world football's governing body, prohibits teams from deliberately losing, which it considers to be a form of match manipulation which is punishable by sanctions including disqualification and suspensions.

Match manipulation is described by FIFA as “the unlawful influencing or alteration, directly or by an act or omission, of the course, result or any other aspect of a football match or competition.”

This can include “the deliberate loss of a match or a phase of a match” and “deliberately performing badly during a match”.

So far, San Marino has recorded losses of 0-2 (Cyprus), 1-5 (Romania), 0-1 (Bosnia), 0-4 (Cyprus), 0-6 (Austria), 0-10 (Austria), 0-4 (Cyprus) in their qualification campaign.

While Eritrea, which has not played a match since 2020, are unranked by FIFA, San Marino has been rooted to the bottom of the world standings since November 2023.

San Marino's 6,600-capacity home stadium is often barely half full for matches, with travelling supporters occasionally outnumbering the hosts.

San Marino has been on the wrong end of some heavy defeats since their first official match in 1990 — including a 13-0 loss to Germany in 2006 — and has never won a match in a qualifying phase for a major tournament.

It has, however, caused some concerns to major nations, famously recording what was then the fastest goal in a World Cup qualifier when Davide Gualtieri scored after eight seconds against England in 1993 before going on to lose 7-1.

It was around the same time that San Marino achieved its highest-ever FIFA ranking of 118, but their football story had been one of relentless struggle since then.

San Marino's 2004 friendly win over Liechtenstein was the high point before their victories over the same nation in last year's Nations League.

The U.S. men's national team may have hit some unwanted low points during Mauricio Pochettino's divisive tenure, but the Argentine certainly has the backing of striker Folarin Balgoun.

The former Tottenham Hotspur and Paris Saint-Germain manager has lost seven of his 19 games in charge of USMNT, including the final of this summer's Gold Cup. Pochettino followed that setback on home soil up with an underwhelming pair of friendlies against South Korea and Japan last month before overseeing a much-improved display against Ecuador on Friday night. However, that heralded clash still resulted in a 1–1 draw.

Balogun scored USMNT's equalizer after falling behind to Enner Valencia's first-half strike in a performance which Pochettino took time to praise. The admiration is clearly mutual.

“I have so much confidence in Poch and what he's able to do for us,” Balogun gushed this weekend. “He's given us so many ideas going forward, and added so much structure. I feel like the confidence we have in Poch is obviously showing.”

Defender Tim Ream wasn't quite so emphatic. In response to a question about whether Pochettino's principles were finally seeping into the squad, he shrugged: “Um, yeah, I think so.”

Ream acknowledged that “it was always going to take a little bit of time for their ideas to really take hold with the entire group” while adding: “You saw the energy that we played with. That's something that they've really preached. And now I think everybody really is starting to understand and grasp that mantra of playing with intensity and being aggressive with and without the ball.

“Guys have been trying to play with that energy, but I think it's also marrying the tactical ideas and the strategy with playing with energy and the aggressiveness. And there's a balance to it. There's a line you have to get up to, and you have to touch, without crossing.”

On top of lauding his manager, Balogun also highlighted the impact a fervent home crowd had on him and his teammates.

Crowds during the U.S.-staged Gold Cup were worryingly low. It was a sellout crowd for the final in Houston, yet most of the 70,000 in attendance in Texas were rooting for Mexico rather than the home nation. Even the semifinal against Guatemala in St. Louis was noticeably partisan in favor of the visitors—something which Pochettino pointedly highlighted at the time.

“I would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,” Pochettino sighed. “We need the people. We need the fans. The fans have one year to realize how important are the fans in soccer.”

The 20,000 at the Q2 Stadium in Austin to watch Friday's 1–1 draw with Ecuador offered a hint that Pochettino's pleas had been heard.

“The crowd helped us to really motivate us and push us on,” Balogun noted. “I think they don't realize how much we as players rely on their support. It really gives us a boost. It's always nice when we can play at an amazing stadium like today with the home crowd supporting us and cheering us on.”

Balogun's teammate Tim Weah directly credited the supporters bellowing out “U-S-A” for the equalizer. “We ended up getting the goal thanks to them,” he claimed. “It's always great having that turn up.”

Who says that nothing lasts forever? Roman Weidenfeller may have retired from professional soccer in 2018, but even years after hanging up the gloves, his connection with Borussia Dortmund remains untouched. Off the field, the legendary goalkeeper continues to represent the Black and Yellow around the world. In an exclusive interview with Bolavip, the 45-year-old discusses his current role with the European giants, among many other topics.

“I am very thankful to have this kind of job as a brand ambassador for Borussia Dortmund,” Weidenfeller tells Bolavip. “I played 16 years for Borussia Dortmund, and I am now on the marketing side and see the world through different eyes. I have the chance to travel all over the world. I can support and work for our brand, Borussia Dortmund, and feel how powerful and great Black and Yellow is all over the world.“

Now as a club ambassador, Weidenfeller remains a symbol of the Black and Yellow as Dortmund increase their footprint in the United States. The club's presence at the Times Square Cup in New York City for the fourth straight year was just a reflection of its growing popularity in the country, which has impressed Weidenfeller.

“I am very proud. We've had a lot of success and support from the United States. Not only from the United States, but from all over the world. We have a big community in Mexico. There are crazy, Black and Yellow fans. And also the fans and support here in the United States…they have been growing in the last few years. And we felt it during the last Club World Cup when we saw the stadiums where we were playing,” Weidenfeller says.

Roman Weidenfeller continues to represent Borussia Dortmund as a club ambassador.

Winner of back-to-back Bundesliga titles (2010/11, 2011/12) and two German Cups (2012, 2017) during his 16-year stint at the club, Weidenfeller will always feel the love from Dortmund fans wherever he goes.

In the U.S., many of those fans were inevitably thrilled to see one of their own donning the Black and Yellow when Christian Pulisic played for the first team from 2016 to 2019. Weidenfeller watched Pulisic make his way up from the academy, and has nothing but great memories about those years.

“Look, I first met him when he was a kid and joined Borussia Dortmund. It was the first time he came to a professional team to train and I saw how talented he was. He was very fast, he had perfect technique. He had a great nose for the situation to create a shot. He's a great player,” Weidenfeller remembers about Pulisic, who went on to play for Chelsea before joining his current team, AC Milan.

“So I feel, right now, he is big and he can organize himself in the future. Just recently, he won the Champions League, which I didn't win (laughs). So I have a lot of respect for Christian. He is one of the best American soccer players. Now, he has joined AC Milan. He has had a great career, and I hope that in the future, he will be healthy enough and can stay in sports for a long time.“

Even though he joked about not winning a Champions League like Pulisic did, Weidenfeller can take pride in boasting the most coveted accolade for a soccer player: a World Cup medal.

In 2014, he was a member of the German national team that made it all the way to the promised land in Brazil, making indelible history in a country that lives and breathes soccer. Needless to say, that achievement has been defining for Weidenfeller's legacy.

“Of course, the Champions League cup is big. And of course, when you win the championship in Germany, the trophy is also big. But in the end, the World Cup is actually the most important Cup and trophy you can win in soccer,” Weidenfeller admits. “I had the chance to touch this trophy and hold it up in the air. I can't imagine how we could have organized this team to have won the World Cup in Brazil. But in the end, we had a great team, we had great teamwork, and we started the tournament in Brazil saying that we wanted to win it.

Roman Weidenfeller celebrates with the trophy after the 2014 World Cup final.

“Everyone was smiling and saying ‘yes, of course we want to win.' We were the first team from Europe to win (a World Cup) in South America. And we said ‘yes.' Of course, it's not easy with the climate, with Brazil, and all the other countries, but we had the idea to win and we were completely focused on winning that tournament. And in the end, we won it!

“It was great teamwork and it was amazing. For me, in the end, I won the title at the World Cup and for your whole life, you're a World Cup champion. This makes me very proud and I'm very thankful for my teammates. They organized with me and together we had great success.“

Perhaps the most memorable triumph from Germany‘s World Cup campaign was the semifinal victory over Brazil. While the hosts were seen as strong candidates to win the title, Weidenfeller watched how his teammates put seven past the five-time world champs, in a blowout win that continues to make noise.

“When we started the game against Brazil, nobody could imagine how it would go and how we could organize and win 7-1. I sat on the bench and the first attacks came from Brazil. We made counter-attacks. With the first counter-attack and the second counter-attack, we scored a goal. After that, Brazil was struggling a little bit. But in the end, it brought us big, big respect from the Brazilian guys, from fans, and from the public,” Weidenfeller recalls.

“We did not have smiles on our faces. We were not laughing. We didn't do anything. We won this game and were very respectful and we waited to celebrate until our colleagues from Brazil left the pitch. And after they went into the dressing rooms, we celebrated. And this was a big, big key. In the final, all the Brazilian guys supported us against Argentina. And so we had the chance to win this big, big title.“

While the 7-1 win over Brazil may be one of, if not the first game that comes to mind when thinking about Germany's 2014 World Cup win, their campaign also included wins against Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Germany started their journey with a commanding 4-0 victory over Portugal and ended it with a dramatic, hard-fought 1-0 win in extra time against Argentina in the final.

“I had the chance to play against maybe the two biggest players in the world, Messi and Ronaldo, and also I played against the Brazilian Ronaldo and Ronaldinho too. But look, just recently when I met some kids and youth players, everybody asked me, ‘Did you even play against Ronaldo?' I say, yes. ‘Messi?' Yes. And they couldn't believe it, you know. I said, yes, I played against both. And yeah, it made me proud and I'm very thankful to have had the chance to play in big football matches. So…yeah, of course, both guys are amazing to play against.“

The World Cup saw him face both Ronaldo and Messi in the same tournament, but Weidenfeller had a larger history of matches against the Portuguese star at the club level. His record against CR7 includes an epic win in the 2013 Champions League semifinals, when Dortmund upset Real Madrid to make the final at Wembley.

“I had the chance to play against Ronaldo a lot more than Messi,” Weidenfeller says. “And of course, when Ronaldo saw me, you know what happened. So we always had big, big matches against Real Madrid, big matches against Juventus. And with Portugal against Germany. So it was always a challenge and it was always amazing to have had these chances to play against him.”

Speaking of Messi, Weidenfeller also credits the Argentine star's move to MLS side Inter Miami for boosting soccer's awareness and popularity in the United States.

“I mean, Lionel Messi is a big brand in soccer. And when he joined the MLS, of course, it became more popular,” the Dortmund icon says. “And now everybody is watching soccer in Miami. Before, it was always people going for basketball or for holidays. And now, people are going there to enjoy the MLS and Inter Miami CF. 

“So Messi, and also Marco Reus, support the MLS. And Marco won the (MLS) title when he played and joined the LA Galaxy. He won the title. It's amazing. It's amazing for these guys and it's amazing for the MLS to have this support from these guys and in the end, they make this league very popular around the world.“

While Messi may take most of the limelight, Weidenfeller is also paying close attention to Marco Reus‘ performance in the league. A Dortmund legend just like him, the midfielder took his talents to MLS in 2024 after 12 years with the Black and Yellow, spending six of them alongside the goalkeeper.

The Borussia Dortmund team lines up ahead of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.

“When I met Marco for the first time when he joined Borussia Dortmund, he was a big, big player, but he is now a big brand too. A big brand for Borussia Dortmund, also for Puma, and also for the MLS. He's such a nice guy. He's very smart. He's very humble,” Weidenfeller says of Reus, whom he hopes to welcome back to Dortmund one day. But first, he wants his former teammate to continue shining in MLS.

“I'm looking forward to seeing Marco when he comes back. But now he has time to play and he has to play soccer,” Weidenfeller clarifies. “For Borussia Dortmund as a brand, it is good. Here in the US, we have an old icon or an old teammate from Borussia Dortmund. He's very spectacular and powerful here in the MLS. And it's good for our brand, Borussia Dortmund.“

Apart from Reus or Pulisic, Weidenfeller has played with countless superstars who donned the Borussia Dortmund uniform. The goalkeeper captained teams that included the likes of Robert Lewandowski, Mats Hummels, and Mario Gotze, among many others. Therefore, it's hard for him to name just one teammate who stood out.

“Look, everybody impressed me,” Weidenfeller explains. “I joined Borussia Dortmund when I was very young, I was 21 and I sat in the dressing room and met for the first time Jürgen Kohler, Stefan Reuter, (Tomáš) Rosický, (Márcio) Amoroso…amazing guys. And now, I have the chance to sometimes play with these guys in the global legends games around the world. It's amazing. 

“But also in my time, in my career and as a captain, a lot of young players joined us. (Jadon) Sancho, (Ousmane) Dembélé, (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang, so many guys. Not in my career, but (Erling) Haaland and (Jude) Bellingham also (played for Dortmund).

Roman Weidenfeller, Mohamed Zidan, and Patrick Owomoyela (L-R) take a photo before a friendly of legends.

“And for me, (Alexander) Isak. Nobody talked about Isak before. Isak is now one of the biggest players in the Premier League. And he joined us as a young player. … So I'm looking, not forward, I'm looking straight back to have this chance to join this moment with these great players. And I mean, Borussia Dortmund is a big, big brand. And for the young players, to join us and grow up with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, they have the chance to take the next step.

“And in the end, looking back, it was always a great time. And it's nice to have had the chance to play with and make friends with these guys. And always have the chance to call them or see each other on the pitch when we play against each other. So it's always humbling and beautiful that they come and they put you in their arms and say, ‘Hey, how is it going and how is work?' And everything's fine.

“Sports have the power, and especially soccer, to create a different lifestyle, a different life, and sport has the power in your whole world and in your whole life. It's not important what language you speak. It's not important what your religion is. It's more important you make friends and you are teammates. And sports have the power to create something special. There are guys who study at university or make a school team and then there are other guys who come from a small town. I do not speak English very well but in the end, I had the chance to play with all the guys. And we always created a good time together.“

Besides teaming up with other stars throughout his successful career, Weidenfeller also worked under world-renowned managers. Again, choosing just one of them may not be easy. Still, Jürgen Klopp and Joachim Löw deserve special mentions.

“I learned a lot from each manager. But each manager had a little bit of a different style. And the most success I had, of course, was with Klopp and with Löw. Klopp at the club level and Löw at the national team level. When we talk about these guys, both guys are very smart and very human,” Weidenfeller says. “And in the end, they talk with the people and connect with the people well. And so the people have to work more for these coaches and managers. And the player knows he has to work harder than ever before. And so the success is coming.“

Löw led Germany to the World Cup title in Brazil, in an unforgettable experience for Weidenfeller. But it's safe to say Klopp was particularly influential in his career, coaching the Dortmund team that won multiple domestic titles and made the Champions League final in 2013, putting many players on the map.

“Look, listen, Jürgen is not only the head coach, he's not only a manager, he's like our father. And he treats us like we are family, you know? He did not say, ‘Roman, you have to…' He said, ‘hey, come on, guy, what's happened? You have to go in front. And the guy's coming in the back, he's going with you. You have to go for it.' He was always very strict and charismatic, but in the end, smart and human, you know?,” Weidenfeller adds, reflecting on his time under Klopp.

After making a name for himself at Borussia Dortmund, Klopp went on to find even more success at the helm of Liverpool. Now the Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull, he appears to be done with coaching, at least for the foreseeable. Still, Dortmund fans obviously hope to see Klopp back at the club someday.

“I saw him at an event in Hamburg, Germany. I'm always very impressed by him and feel great pleasure when I get to see him. But also hopefully (see him) in Germany and at Dortmund… I support Jürgen Klopp, you know, as a person. And I can imagine he doesn't want to have the pressure of the whole day, like a manager or head coach,” Weidenfeller says.

While Klopp and other legends who also shaped Borussia Dortmund's history have moved on, Roman Weidenfeller remains a steadfast pillar of the club, serving in a new capacity. A match made in heaven, his journey with the team began in 2002 and continues to thrive beyond his playing days. Retirement has not diminished his bond with the Black and Yellow, proving that some connections truly do last forever.

Herc Gomez and Shaka Hislop discuss the USMNT attacking options as Agyemang, Balogun and Wright all battle to start. (3:54)

The U.S. men's and women's senior national teams will play 25 home friendly matches combined in 2025, and each game requires two simple ingredients: an opponent and a host venue.

How are those opponents scheduled, and how do cities and stadiums ultimately host those games? As U.S. Soccer's managing director of administration, and vice president of events, respectively, Tom King and John Terry (not that John Terry) are primarily responsible for those answers.

Their combined task is less a single jigsaw puzzle and more a game of speed dating. As they move from one conversation to the next, they hope to find a match -- multiple, simultaneous matches, in fact, as they work on opponents and venues for several future games at once -- before they lose their potential partners.

"The relationship side of it is so important," King told ESPN. "In some ways, it can be almost a sales job where you've got a chance of getting an opponent, and you just chase that down like the last bus at night until you get 'em closed." For King, that could mean waking up at 3 a.m. to call colleagues in Europe.

Terry works in tandem to find an appropriate venue. Neither the opponent nor the venue can be finalized without the other -- and without either, there is no game.

Ideally, they try to secure the best possible opponents for the USMNT and USWNT, in addition to extended and youth national teams, while placing games all over the United States. But the hoops they must jump through can make it difficult.

"To the extent possible, we want to get our team to different parts of the country," Terry told ESPN. One of his guiding questions is: "How do we spread our national team and get as many people watching as possible?"

Fans see the results -- the opponent, the city and the venue -- and, at times, the patterns of games can appear counterintuitive to U.S. Soccer's stated goals. Why are they playing in California, Connecticut or Orlando again when they haven't played in other parts of the country, like the Pacific Northwest, in years? Why is the U.S. playing another game against the same opponent? And tickets cost how much?

U.S. Soccer's decision-makers took ESPN behind the scenes to answer how -- and why -- opponents get scheduled, why venues get selected and how that affects ticket prices.

- Pochettino's USMNT squad comes into focus
- Alex Morgan aims to match USWNT success in business

U.S. women's national team head coach Emma Hayes and U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino have their own wish lists for opponents that they communicate regularly to U.S. Soccer officials. From there, King evaluates who is available and begins his sales pitch to other federations, and Terry works on finding the right venue. Everything is interdependent.

U.S. Soccer considers a handful of factors in selecting hosts for games, from the climate and the city's historical fan support, to quality of hotels and training facilities and broadcast constraints -- including for the opponent.

Venue-specific challenges are as basic as capacity and availability. Scheduling the USWNT against another top-10 team in the world like Brazil at the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium, as U.S. Soccer did in April, might be a risk worth taking, for example, but a game against lower-tier Portugal makes more sense at an 18,000-seat stadium. The stadium requirements can be as granular as needing a venue with four locker rooms for a four-team SheBelieves Cup event, for example.

There are moments, Terry said, when he must call venues and press for a quick answer on locking in a date, or U.S. Soccer risks losing a prospective opponent. Sometimes, a venue operator is only interested in hosting a game if the opponent is appealing enough.

Lead time is "golden," King said. It means venues are more likely to be available, and it allows U.S. Soccer to better promote the game. Crisis management, however, is part of their jobs, and sometimes U.S. Soccer works for months on plans that never come to fruition.

"We've had a top-five team that we had all the economic conditions sorted, we had the venue sorted, we had the [federation] president on board, we had everything done and dusted to sign a contract to host this team," King said. "And lo and behold, there's a change to the coach, and the coach wants to play a different confederation team between now and the 2026 World Cup on the men's side. So, everything that had been done for the previous 10 months goes out the window, and you start from scratch again."

Other times, the venue is what needs to change. The U.S. women's national team will end 2025 with a pair of games against Italy in soccer-specific stadiums in Florida, but the original plan for the international window called for a different European opponent in a baseball stadium 2,500 miles away.

King had agreed to terms with the other opponent for the U.S. women's national team back in the spring. Terry worked through the usual autumn availability problems with American football and soccer stadiums -- MLS playoff dates are not set until the fall -- by coming up with a unique solution: playing the game on Black Friday with the roof closed at T-Mobile Park, the home of MLB's Seattle Mariners. The baseball season would be over by late November, and U.S. Soccer would have time to lay grass over the baseball infield. The roof solved any fear around bad weather; then the opponent's schedule changed for an official competition, and they were unavailable to play a friendly in November and December.

The next team on Hayes' wish list was Euro 2025 semifinalist Italy, but Italian officials did not want to fly their players to the West Coast of the United States in the middle of a European season. Thus, the grand idea of a unique event in Seattle, where the USWNT has not played since 2017, was dead.

Each contract for a friendly match is unique, but they all start with what the opponent needs, King said. Successful, popular teams often command an appearance fee to play on the road, and some might also require bonuses based on the commercial success of the game. (King declined to specify those costs due to the sensitivity of negotiations.) Other visiting teams might agree to get a stipend or ask to have certain expenses covered for a delegation of 30-50 people.

"We're very agile; we're not bureaucratic," King said. "When we have an opponent to go after, we go after it. We don't have multiple layers of approval to court a certain team."

Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford is a perfect case study for how a myriad of factors can lead to what looks like a result antithetical to the federation's desire to spread out games.

When the USWNT hosts Portugal there on Oct. 26, it will mark the 19th game for the U.S. men and women combined at the stadium since it opened in 2003. The USMNT just played there in June, in addition to their high-profile game against Germany two years ago. That's a high frequency of national team games for a utilitarian college football stadium in a mid-sized city -- but it is not without reason.

Cost is a factor in all scheduling, of course. MLS stadiums (which generally seat around 20,000 people) might cost around $200,000 to rent, while larger NFL stadiums could range from around $500,000 to roughly $1 million for a game, Terry said. Bigger markets are also more expensive because everything costs more, from utilities to turn on the lights to wages for security, ticket scanners, and every other stadium worker.

Only about half of NFL stadiums have grass fields, which is the preferred surface for the U.S. national teams and most opponents. Terry said that if U.S. Soccer needs to lay down temporary grass, that adds at least $500,000 in expenses.

Alex Morgan reacts to her first goal for the USWNT in a friendly vs. China.

Cost is only part of the equation for any game, Terry said. "The first litmus test is: Is it available to us?"

Which explains how the USMNT ended up hosting four-time World Cup champion Germany in East Hartford in October 2023. U.S. Soccer officials had no doubt that the game would be in great demand among fans no matter where they played it. The problem was finding a place to play.

Germany was keen to play on the East Coast for more favorable travel and for a better kickoff time back home, Terry said. U.S. Soccer staff looked everywhere on the East Coast for a grass field in a large stadium on a Saturday in October, the heart of the American football season, and couldn't find one. UConn football, Pratt & Whitney Stadium's primary tenant, happened to have a bye week preceded by a road game on the date of the eventual game. Terry booked the 36,000-seat stadium, and the game sold out.

Orlando has also become a frequent stop for the men's and women's national teams for its mix of warm weather and accessibility to both Europe and South America. Driven by the anomaly of the COVID-19 pandemic, Exploria Stadium (as it was called then) hosted five straight USWNT games in January and February 2021. The USMNT played there between those games and returned in March of each of the next two years for official matches.

"In a perfect world, we're not going back to the same venue within a year," Terry said. "It's an inexact science; it happens because there are other factors that require it."

All the aforementioned factors for opponents and venues affect the cost to the fan. Rising ticket prices have become endemic across the sports and entertainment industries. Soccer -- with high-profile events including next year's Men's World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico -- is not immune.

While CONMEBOL's Copa America last year and FIFA's Club World Cup this summer -- both hosted in the United States -- sparked controversy and sparse crowds due to high ticket prices, U.S. Soccer has no influence on setting prices for those games. Still, they certainly hear the complaints -- including the grievances aimed at their own events.

Terry told ESPN that the federation is intentional about making sure that the "get-in price" of a game -- the cheapest ticket -- is affordable. He said that the starting price for a U.S. national team game is often cheaper than that of an MLS game or a soccer game run by other promoters in the same city. Those numbers vary greatly by city, event and ticket tier, but a U.S. Soccer ticket is typically 25-30% cheaper than tickets for the home team in that same venue, a federation spokesperson said.

Two factors complicate that position. For a start, the resale market -- which neither U.S. Soccer nor event organizers control -- is where prices balloon. A front-row seat to the USMNT vs. Ecuador friendly in Austin last week cost as low as $84 before fees (which can add up quickly) roughly a week before the game. At the same time, a front-row resale ticket just a few sections away cost $297.50.

Dynamic pricing, which means costs fluctuate based on demand, is also a factor. The starting price for a ticket to the USWNT's game against New Zealand at CPKC Stadium this month was $45, Terry said. But the 11,500-seat stadium has sold out every Kansas City Current NWSL game to date, and high demand for the uniquely small venue choice means that current prices trend higher. Terry said that U.S. Soccer's pricing model rewards fans who purchase early, and he argues U.S. Soccer games are "more accessible than many other sporting entities in this country."

U.S. Soccer recently announced that it would cap tickets sold to the American Outlaws, the largest supporters' group for the U.S. national teams, at $45 plus fees for all games hosted by the federation through October 2026.

"We've always believed soccer should be for everyone," American Outlaws co-founder Justin Brunken said in July. "This partnership with U.S. Soccer helps eliminate one of the biggest barriers -- cost -- and makes it possible for more passionate fans to stand, sing and support together."

Still, that partnership is limited to American Outlaws members and not the wider public. U.S. Soccer is experimenting with free parking for everyone at this month's USWNT game in Hartford. The federation worked with sponsor Coca-Cola for discounted concessions earlier this year at a men's national team game in Nashville.

USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino believes his side need to be more "clinical" after their 1-1 draw against Ecuador.

U.S. Soccer doesn't have a home stadium where the federation can control food and beverage or parking costs, which leaves those prices to be set by the venue. At the USWNT's game in St. Paul, Minnesota, earlier this year, U.S. Soccer spent nearly $38,000 to offset concession costs and create a $2 menu for hot dogs, popcorn, nachos and water. The idea came based on direct feedback from U.S. Soccer's Fan Council, which was established in 2018 as a bridge of communication between fans and the federation.

The five members of the Fan Council attend as many national team games as possible and gather fan feedback on-site both informally and formally, in addition to the input they get from fans online. They identify common themes that they then bring to U.S. Soccer in quarterly in-person meetings and monthly virtual meetings.

"Much of the feedback focuses on ticketing prices, game atmosphere and the overall matchday experience," Lauralynn Stephen, a vice chair of the council, told ESPN. "I can say that over the past year, we've seen some really exciting, tangible changes that reflect fan feedback."

Stephen said that fans communicated a desire for better concession prices after experiencing them at a game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, which is known for its affordable food and beverages as low as $2. She personally raised the topic with U.S. Soccer in one of their meetings with the Fan Council.

Stephen said that communication around gameday from the federation has improved in simple ways, like a "Know Before You Go" website page detailing parking and other logistics.

"The culture's improving; the communication, the collaboration is absolutely there; it's in place," Stephen said. "The future's looking very bright for future council members and fans in general, because U.S. Soccer is very actively engaging, and they're very interested in what fans are feeling for the matchday experience."

Scheduling strong, diverse opponents -- especially from Europe -- is increasingly a challenge for U.S. Soccer.

FIFA has set the international calendars for men's and women's play through 2029 and 2030 for the women and men, respectively. European men's opponents are available for friendlies in March and June next year ahead of the World Cup, but those windows are not replicated in the three years that follow. The same issue is now true in the women's game.

"The biggest challenge really is the advent of the Nations League for women," King said. Twelve of the top 20 women's teams in the world are from Europe. Of the 10 international windows between now and the 2027 Women's World Cup, six of them are being utilized by UEFA for World Cup qualifying and playoffs, in addition to more Nations League programming.

The USWNT won't be able to schedule a European opponent in 2026 until next October, and even then, they won't be able to play teams participating in the World Cup qualifying playoffs. King said he already has "feelers" out to six potential European teams for that window.

The need for the four-time World Cup champion USWNT to play strong teams, along with the Europe's crowded official schedule, has led to the U.S. women more frequently playing Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea as opponents in recent years.

Among U.S. Soccer's solutions for scheduling challenges is collaboration with Mexico's federation, the FMF, which gives those visiting teams two different high-quality opponents in relatively close locations. (Mexico frequently "hosts" games in the U.S., which creates its own challenges to find four venues in a week). Four days after Ecuador plays the USMNT in Austin this month, Ecuador will play Mexico in Guadalajara.

New Zealand's women's team will play Mexico twice before traveling to Kansas City for a game against the USWNT this month.

There are also venue challenges that go beyond cost and location. Particularly on the men's side, the United States often faces a partisan crowd for the visitors despite playing on home soil. An overtly pro-Korean crowd for a recent USMNT friendly at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey, was the latest reminder of that. Last year, the U.S. lost 5-1 to Colombia in front of a pro-Colombian crowd of 55,494 in Maryland. Terry views the challenge as an opportunity.

"The cool part about the United States is that we have people from all over the world who live here, and regardless of what jersey they wear when they come to one of our games, they're in our ecosystem, and they might be a future coach," Terry said. "Their kids might be future players. They might be a player. And they could be a referees. And so, I think it's on us to figure out: How can we be in service to them? Not just in the stadium but in the other 364 days a year. It's an opportunity to connect with a lot of people and bring them under our umbrella. Our ultimate goal here is grow the sport of soccer in the country."

There is one important addendum: That entire approach of spreading out games applies to friendly matches. "The flip side of that is, for an official game -- a Nations League qualifier or World Cup qualifier -- we're doing the complete opposite," King said.

For those official matches, winning -- and qualifying -- trumps all, which helps explain why Columbus, Ohio, has hosted multiple USMNT vs. Mexico World Cup qualifying games in February, the dead of winter. There was a climate advantage for the USMNT, but Columbus was also a location that U.S. Soccer felt it could guarantee a pro-U.S. crowd, which isn't the case in many areas of the U.S. for a USA-Mexico game. King said the federation worked with former USMNT head coach Gregg Berhalter in the 2022 World Cup qualifying cycle "to make sure that the guiding principle on that was putting our team in the best possible light to win by having a raucous home crowd."

Three of the USMNT's qualifying games in that cycle were played in cold months in Ohio (including a 2-0 win over Mexico in Cincinnati) and another in Minnesota. Those locations were selected both for guaranteeing pro-U.S. crowds and for weather ostensibly more suited to American players. The USMNT has dealt with stifling heat and flooded fields for road qualifying games across Concacaf.

"It wasn't a surprise for us to play on a Saturday at noon in Azteca Stadium in June [against Mexico for World Cup qualifying]," King said. "And we're also not looking for reciprocity and being spiteful. But at the same time, how can we put our players in the best possible environment to win, when the majority of them are playing in northern climates, whether that's MLS teams or in Europe? We're used to the cold. It's also not uncommon for us to go to Honduras and play midweek at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. These are things that the home team gets the choice to do."

U.S. Soccer's meticulous planning is not the norm everywhere. There are confederations who are comfortable with scheduling games on less than two months' notice. "That's untenable for us," King said.

"The further out that we can get these games on the books is just a huge source of satisfaction with regards to knowing what we're doing, knowing where we're going from a commercial standpoint. You've got a much longer runway to be able to promote the games."

King said that U.S. Soccer intentionally has not scheduled June's men's games yet so that they can book an opponent in reaction to December's World Cup Draw. Beyond that variable, however, U.S. Soccer is already planning as far out as June 2027. The fewer late-night buses to chase down in the process, the better.

A European nation who have lost every single World Cup qualifier, could have a better chance of qualifying for the tournament if they suffer another defeat to Romania.

The smallest country in UEFA, San Marino are renowned as one of the worst nations in the history of international football and did not win a competitive fixture until September last year when they beat Liechenstein in the UEFA Nations League.

That victory came 34 years after their first official fixture, with all three of their wins coming against the same side.

Placed in Group H in World Cup qualifying, San Marino, whose team is predominantly semi-professional, have lost all seven of their fixtures - conceding 32 and scoring just one.

Advert

Roberto Cevoli's side, the lowest ranked side according to FIFA, lost 4-0 to Cyprus on Saturday but it's emerged that losing to Romania in their final fixture could lead to an unthinkable scenario.

Romania are third in the group, three points behind Bosnia and Herzegovina with one game remaining.

The two sides square off on 15 November, before Bosnia take on group leaders Austria a few days later when San Marino take on Romania.

Advert

Romania finishing second in Group H would see them qualify for the World Cup play-offs, where there will be a total of 16 teams.

12 will be second-placed teams, with a further four spots going to the four best-ranked UEFA Nations League group winners who have not already qualified.

Incredibly, San Marino did win their Nations League group in 2024/25 - topping group D1 in League D with seven points from four games against Gibraltar and Liechenstein.

Advert

That earned the minnows promotion to League C but also gives them a genuine outside chance of a historic World Cup appearance in the United States.

Romania also won their Nations League group, storming group C1 with maximum points from six games to secure promotion to Group B.

Therefore, in a bizarre turn of events, it is in San Marino's best interests to lose emphatically to Romania so that they take one of the play-off spots handed to Nations League winners.

Advert

This feat would not be particularly difficult for San Marino, who have been on the receiving end of many thrashings over the years.

They would then be set for two play-off matches against higher-ranked teams from the divisions above, where two wins would see them qualify for the tournament in North America next year.

Because of UEFA's system, San Marino may also sneak into the play-offs if Sweden or Northern Ireland finish in the top two of their groups as they too were Nations League group winners.

The impossible may be possible for San Marino, who have a chance of creating one of sport's greatest ever achievements.

Advert

However, a Bosnia win against Romania on 15 November could crush San Marino's dreams.

48 teams will qualify for the World Cup, 16 of which will be representing UEFA.

Roy Keane admits that Manchester United should be "pretty ashamed" of their decision to pull out of the FA Cup in 2000 when they were defending champions - instead choosing to play in the Club World Cup.

The Red Devils had won the domestic cup as part of their famed treble in 1999, but became the first team ever not to even attempt to defend their crown the following year. They instead chose to to play in the inaugural World Team Championship, now known as the Club World Cup.

United accepted the Football Association's offer to miss the competition. Chelsea went on to win the competition, beating Aston Villa in the final at Wembley.

The decision resulted in widespread criticism from supporters and the media, who accused the Manchester outfit of devaluing the oldest football competition in the world. Former chairman Martin Edwards said at the time that they had "no alternative" and made the decision "in the national interest".

Sir Alex Ferguson's side would only win one of their three games in the eight-team Club World Championship in Brazil - finishing third in Group B behind Mexican side Necaxa and eventual runners-up Vasco da Gama.

Keane's comments began with Gary Neville saying on The Stick to Football podcast: "I think one thing that was definitely better back in the day was the FA Cup. That was magic when we were playing."

The Irishman, who would win the FA Cup four times during his career, then said: "I think the magic has come back a bit the last few years now. When you think of it when we were at United, we should be pretty ashamed because we pulled out of the FA Cup. I know it wasn't down to us but we accepted it as players. How mad was that, your team pulling out of the FA Cup."

United claimed it was an opportunity "to compete for the ultimate honour of being the very first world club champions" - even if they did fail to bring the trophy home. It didn't stop their ultimate goal of retaining their Premier League title, which they did by 18 points.

Ferguson claimed at the time: "We can't go for them all. We can't play in the FA Cup and in Brazil. That would be impossible. We're in a no-win situation here. The criticism we would have received if we hadn't gone [to Brazil] would have been unthinkable – and that's a Scotsman speaking."

Chile will host an all-South American semi-final and the remaining European and African representatives at the youth football tournament, with the corresponding final four clash to be confirmed on Sunday (12 October).

The South American party continues at the 2025 FIFA men's U-20 World Cup (27 September - 19 October) in Chile.

Into the final week of the youth men's football tournament, the road to crown the latest under-20 world champions is reaching its climax. The quarter-finals concluded on Sunday (12 October) ahead of the semi-finals kicking off on Wednesday (15 October).

Colombia and Argentina were the first nations to book their spots in the final four, making for an enticing all-South American matchup and guaranteeing CONMEBOL representation in the final on 19 October.

The Colombians came through a thrilling quarter-final clash by winning 3-2 against Spain, the top-ranked men's senior side and reigning Olympic champions.

Neyser Villareal put them ahead in the first half, before a quickfire Spanish double from Jan Virgili and Rayane Belaid turned the game on its head shy of the hour mark. Up stepped Neyser, Millonarios' talismanic striker, to equalise before securing his hat-trick with an 89th minute winner to send Colombia through.

In the other quarter-final, record champions Argentina dispatched Mexico 2-0 at Santiago's Estadio Nacional Julio Martínez Prádanos. Maher Carrizo broke the deadlock inside 10 minutes for the Albiceleste, an advantage they maintained going into the break.

Soon after the restart, Mateo Silvetti pounced on a loose ball to slot home to double the Argentine advantage. Mexico had no answer and ended the affair with nine men, after Diego Ochoa and Tahiel Jiménez were given their marching orders.

The semi-final lineup was set in stone on Sunday (12 October), as Africa's remaining representatives Morocco will meet 2013 champions France in Valparaíso. In a 3-1 win over the USA, the young Atlas Lions took the lead through Fouad Zahouani, only for it to be cancelled out by Cole Campbell's first-half penalty.

An own goal restored Morocco's lead in the 67th minute, before Gessime Yassine's late strike sealed the deal for the African nation. This is the first time since 2015 that a side from Africa has reached the semi-finals, since Mali and Senegal.

Morocco will meet France, who, after a dramatic round of 16 victory against Japan, had a more comfortable passage into the final four by defeating Norway 2-1.

A first-half brace from 19-year-old Saïmon Bouabré put Les Bleus in cruise control, and from then on it was about maintaining that grip. Rasmus Holten's 83rd minute goal proved to be no more than a consolation, as Norway suffered their first defeat of the tournament at the expense of France's progression.

The international break is frustrating because you want to see your club in action – but the consolation is that you do get some interesting quotes from players when they speak to the media in their home country, usually in a less guarded way than how they speak to the English media.

It turns out that goes for managers too – they are always very cautious in pressers, but more relaxed in their native language, speaking outside the direct context of a game.

Enzo Maresca has been back in Italy speaking about his summer success with Chelsea at the Club World Cup.

“It's a great feeling. This is my second season at the club, but we'd never won in the last minute at home before. The reaction that led to the sending off was instinctive, but maybe it was worth it,” the coach said of his sending off against Liverpool last weekend.

“We're talking about one of the biggest clubs in the world, one that has struggled in recent years for various reasons,” Maresca continued in quotes translated by Football Italia.

Beating Liverpool was huge – certainly one on Maresca's biggest results so far. But the victory over PSG remains clearly the biggest:

“We had a great game. It was a classic situation: Everyone had PSG as favourites,” the manager said.

“We beat a team that, I think, were the strongest in the world at that moment. But I don't go into work every day because we won the World Championship, I do it because I love it. I don't wake up in the morning thinking about the titles we've won.

“We played seven different games. We tried to make changes and tried to surprise opponents. It went well. There were several injuries, but it was worth it and I wouldn't change anything given the result. The trophy is wonderful, even if it is a bit heavy.”

October 13 – Rights group Fossil Free Football has criticised FIFA for “climate change complicity” after FIFA president Gianni Infantino said it could be too hot to stage the World Cup in summer. 

In a statement, Fossil Free Football said that “instead of fighting to hold on to a climate safe for summer football as we have always known it, FIFA has actively contributed to the global heating that ensures it is no longer possible.

“Despite committing to halve its emissions, it has massively expanded its competitions and handed its giant platform to mega-polluting oil companies and airlines. The 2026 World Cup will be the most polluting event of all time, bigger than any previous tournament and covered in promotional messaging from the world's biggest oil company, Saudi Aramco.”

Last week, on the sidelines of the European Football Clubs – formerly European Club Association – general assembly in the Italian capital Rome, Infantino said to “keep an open mind” about moving major tournaments away from the summer. The Qatar 2022 World Cup was the first global finals to be staged in the European winter because of the soaring temperatures in June and July in Doha. The 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia could face a similar rejig.

However, this summer's major tournaments – the expanded 32-team Club World Cup in the United States and Euro 2025 in Switzerland – proved that climate change is affecting football worldwide with high temperatures heavily affecting matches. That has offered Infantino a useful excuse to make a second winter World Cup a more palatable option for other stakeholders in the game.

FIFA is also considering expanding the Club World Cup from 32 teams to 48 teams and staging the finals, from 2029 onwards, on a biannual basis, even if the tournament is not yet financially stable.

Saudi Arabia's SURJ invested $1 billion in streaming platform DAZN which acquired the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup for $1 billion. The prize money on offer at the tournament was $1 billion while the cost of staging it was also around $1 billion. FIFA claimed to have generated more than $2 billion from the tournament.

The expansionism flies in the face of climate change.

At the same time, FIFA signed up Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state oil company, as its leading partner last year. Fossil Free Football said: “It's time for FIFA to stop actively making this crisis worse. This means breaking its ties to Aramco and other polluters and reversing the expansionist agenda opposed by almost everyone in football.”

Frank Huisingh of the rights group added: “Fans see how the climate crisis impacts football. The actions of the fossil fuel industry and their allies now threaten to take summer World Cups from us, an iconic part of being a fan in this part of the world. It's unacceptable that FIFA is still selling its huge platform to Aramco and its pro-oil allies.”

Usually there would be more movement in the Race after a Masters 1000 event, but with so many top players going out early in Shanghai—which cleared the way for a historic all-unseeded final—the Top 15 mostly stayed the same.Novak Djokovic and Alexander Zverev switch spots at No. 3 and No. 4 for the second straight Race update, after the German lost in the third round in Shanghai and the Serb went on to reach the milestone 80th Masters 1000 semifinal of his career.After that, you have to go all the way down to Holger Rune to see any movement at all—the Dane rises from No. 14 to No. 12 after reaching the 11th Masters 1000 quarterfinal of his career.

Perhaps the biggest news is Daniil Medvedev entering the Top 15, jumping from No. 20 to No. 15 after another strong showing in China.

The seeds for Vacherot's history-making triumph were sown both in college and on the ATP Challenger Tour.ByFlorian HeerPublished Oct 13, 2025 copy_link

For years, the Principality of Monaco has been better known for its luxurious lifestyle, iconic Formula 1 race, and stunning Mediterranean views than for producing top-level tennis players. But that may soon change, as Valentin Vacherot, a 26-year-old right-hander with a powerful serve and unwavering competitiveness, is steadily rewriting Monaco's tennis history.A tennis-centered upbringingBorn on Nov. 16, 1998 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, Vacherot grew up in a tennis family. His cousin is French ATP player Arthur Rinderknech, and his half-brother and current coach is former Monegasque pro Benjamin Balleret.That close connection to the sport shaped his early path. Though he didn't have a lengthy junior career—his best ITF junior ranking was No. 440—he made his professional debut at just 15 years old in 2014, and earned his first ranking point the following year.College tennis rootsInstead of turning pro full-time right away, Vacherot took a different route: U.S. college tennis. From 2016 to 2020, he represented Texas A&M University in College Station, where he also earned a business degree.During that time, he played alongside his cousin Rinderknech, refining his all-court game and gaining valuable competitive experience in one of the strongest collegiate programs in the United States.

Vacherot returned to the professional circuit in 2021 with renewed focus. That season, he reached five finals on the ITF World Tennis Tour and captured his first two titles in Monastir, Tunisia and New Delhi, India, ending the year ranked world No. 631. He also represented Monaco for the first time in the Davis Cup. He holds a 14-3 match record in the competition in 11 ties played.In 2022, he broke into the Top 500 for the first time, and two years later, he soared into the Top 200. In June 2024, after a remarkable 15-0 run on the ATP Challenger Tour, he achieved a career-high ranking of No. 110.A four-time ATP Challenger champion, most recently in Pune, India last year, Vacherot has demonstrated that his game translates well across surfaces and levels. At 6-foot-4, he combines explosive serving with a solid baseline game and growing confidence under pressure.

But the breakthrough that truly put him on the tennis map came last week at the Rolex Shanghai Masters.

“It is unreal what just happened. I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy,” Vacherot said after Sunday's final. “I am just so happy with my performances the past two weeks."I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser, but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal."

"I just want to thank everyone who has helped with my career since the beginning. There has to be one loser, but I think there is two winners today, one family that won. And I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal."

It was the perfect ending to an extraordinary run. Vacherot became the lowest-ranked champion in ATP Masters 1000 history, surviving six three-set battles across nine matches from qualifying to the final. Time and again, he clawed his way back from behind, showcasing remarkable grit and composure.What began as an unlikely run turned into a career-defining triumph—and with it, a massive leap in ranking, confidence and belief. The fairytale in Shanghai has made Vacherot not just richer in terms of prize money, but far more seasoned and ready for the next chapter of his journey.

Published Oct 13, 2025

Six players have now qualified for this year's WTA Finals—Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek did it over the summer; Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova and Madison Keys did it during Beijing; and Jessica Pegula just punched her ticket to Riyadh in Wuhan.Just two spots remain, and only three players—Mirra Andreeva, Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina—are still in contention.Things could heat up in a big way this week as all three of those players are competing at the WTA 500 event in Ningbo, China, with plenty of points up for grabs in the Race to the WTA Finals.🖥️📲 Stream Race to the ATP Finals and Race to the WTA Finals on the Tennis Channel App!

What separates Coco Gauff right now isn't power or pace. It's the calm she brings to the biggest moments, something she showed again in her run to the Wuhan title.

At the pivotal juncture of 4-all in Sunday's opening set, Coco Gauff hit three of her four aces in a single game. Down 5-3 in the second set, Gauff ran off 10 straight points on the way to a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Jessica Pegula.

Gauff, your Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open champion, is the consummate closer. She has played in nine Hologic WTA Tour hard-court finals -- and won them all. No one else in the history of women's tennis has triumphed in her first nine hard-court finals.

“Oh, wow,” Gauff said on hearing that statistic, then burst into laughter during a conversation with wtatennis.com. “Your answer is probably just as good as mine. I don't know, honestly. I think in finals, there's something in you that wants to just go, because I made it this far, and I want to hold the trophy.

“On hard courts, that's where I feel the most comfortable, on the courts I grew up playing on. I think I've gotten lucky in some matches, others I just felt good that day.”

Mixing speeds and spins with a variety of slices like a crafty veteran pitcher, the 21-year-old American kept the ball in play and consistently prevailed in the longer rallies. The weary Pegula, who thrives on an opponent's pace, had little to work with.

This was the 31-year-old's 10th match in 14 days. Coming into the final, Pegula had played eight consecutive three-set matches. Including Beijing, her two-week total was a staggering 28 sets. Friendly suggestion: Don't try this at home.

Gauff, who lost in WTA 1000 finals earlier this year on the clay in Madrid and Rome, collected her third career 1000 title. She's the third-youngest to do that in the 16-year history of the format, after Iga Swiatek and Caroline Wozniacki.

For the record, Gauff is a resplendent 22-3 in China.

“I think it's a combination of the timing of the season, knowing that you're so close to the season being over that you're just like, ‘Whatever happens, happens,'” she said. “And also the conditions here I feel like favor my game. The courts in Beijing were a little bit quicker and then here a little bit slower. In Wuhan the conditions were similar to what I train in in Florida so I felt really comfortable on the court.”

The win underlined what has become an interesting -- and hugely successful -- pattern. For the third straight year, Gauff is benefiting from a coaching change late in the season.

“I feel like I'm constantly trying to evolve and get better,” Gauff said. “It's not anything against the coaches I worked with -- I can still be at the top and want to get better. Sometimes, a new perspective helps. It's not always about what they say -- maybe they're saying similar things -- but maybe the approach is a little bit different and I'm able to receive it better. 

“I'm definitely happy with my team. I don't want to make changes anymore. I'm really proud of how I've managed to turn this part of the season around.”

Further highlights from her interview:

You looked like a crafty baseball pitcher out there, changing speeds and spins … what prompted you to go with that strategy against Jess?

Playing Jess, she's a really great ball-striker. Honestly, it wasn't always a part of the plan, but I was just thinking it was the shot I had to do in the moment. She hits the ball so low and flat sometimes I feel the only option is the slice at times. Today was also cooler than the earlier rounds, and the court was playing slow, so I felt like hitting winners and powering through would be pretty hard because the court was just so slow.

Neither of you showed much emotion during the match. At times it was like watching Venus and Serena Williams play each other … How difficult is it to play such a good friend?

It's definitely difficult playing a friend in the final. It's ups and downs, for sure. I don't do it intentionally, but maybe I am a little more chill in the reactions and stuff. Jess is always calm, she doesn't let out too much. When you play someone that you know, for me, it makes it more fun. Obviously, you want to win for yourself, but if you lose you know you're losing to someone that you respect, on and off the court. 

Working with Gavin MacMillan, where would you say your serve is right now?

Obviously, it was a big hole in my game, the serve, and it still can get better. But I definitely think it's been a big improvement since Cincinnati and New York to now. It's just about trusting the process. Before, I was serving technically wrong and I felt like I didn't have a solution with it. Now I have a solution, and it's continuing to trust that when the moments get tight. In a general sense, I changed the way I toss the ball and my motion on the serve. I don't want to get too specific, but if you look at the before and after, I'm turning a little bit more on my toss. 

What will the next few weeks look like for you?

Just going home [to South Florida] and training, getting ready for Riyadh. It's the last tournament of the year, and I'm looking forward to it. And then the season's over.

You're the defending champion in Riyadh. What are your goals and expectations for the WTA Finals?

I think just taking it match by match. I don't know when the last time someone's defended the title [Serena Williams in 2013 and 2014] -- it's a pretty tough title to defend, given that you're playing the top eight players in the world. I'm just going to go in with no expectations. I just want to make it out of my group. That's what my goal was last year.

 

What separates Coco Gauff right now isn't power or pace. It's the calm she brings to the biggest moments, something she showed again in her run to the Wuhan title.

Even though she didn't come away with the title, Iga Swiatek still had a strong showing in Wuhan last week, reaching the milestone 25th WTA 1000 quarterfinal of her career—she also completed her career set of WTA 1000 quarterfinals, with Wuhan having been the only one missing.But with her $83,250 prize money cheque for reaching the quarterfinals in Wuhan, she now achieves something very big, surpassing Venus Williams for the second-most career prize money in WTA history.Swiatek went into the WTA 1000 event with $42,862,240 and leaves with $42,945,490, edging past Venus' career haul of $42,867,364 and now trailing only Serena Williams' all-time women's record of $94,816,730.

Meanwhile, the breakout stars in Shanghai—Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech—soar into the ATP Top 50.ByJohn BerkokPublished Oct 13, 2025 copy_link

Some players break into the Top 10 as teenagers, but some take a little more time—like Ekaterina Alexandrova, who makes her Top 10 debut today at 30 years young, moving up one spot from No. 11 to No. 10.She's been close for a few years now, reaching the Top 20 for the first time in 2022, then going as high as No. 16 in 2023 and No. 15 in 2024.But 2025 has been the best season of her career, highlighted by capturing the biggest title of her career at the WTA 500 indoor hard-court event in Linz, which is held right after the Australian Open.She reached two more finals this year, both at WTA 500s in Monterrey and Seoul, another four semifinals (including at a WTA 1000 in Doha) and two more quarterfinals. She also reached the fourth round at the last three Grand Slams—Roland Garros, Wimbledon and the US Open.The result that put her over the line, though, was reaching the round of 16 in Wuhan last week, coincidentally her 16th round of 16 of the year.And it's about time, too, as Alexandrova has clearly shown she can hang with the Top 10—she has 19 career wins against the elite, the majority of them coming over the last few years, including five this year against Aryna Sabalenka and Jessica Pegula (in Doha), Zheng Qinwen (in Charleston) and Mirra Andreeva and Pegula again (in Stuttgart).The big-hitting veteran continues her season in Ningbo this week.

On the ATP rankings, the most notable moves come from the breakout stars in Shanghai, cousins Valentin Vacherot and Arthur Rinderknech.After reaching his first Masters 1000 final, Rinderknech jumps from No. 54 to No. 28, shattering his previous career-high of No. 42 from 2022.But Vacherot's ranking rise is much bigger—much, much bigger—as he soars from No. 204 to No. 40 after capturing the first Masters 1000 title of his career. And it came from out of nowhere, too, as he hadn't even reached the quarterfinals of any ATP event in his career, let alone at a Masters 1000, let alone going all the way to a Masters 1000 title.The 26-year-old Monegasque obliterates his previous career-high ranking of No. 110 to make his simultaneous Top 100 and Top 50 debuts.After a few weeks of staggered tournament dates and rankings, both the ATP and WTA rankings will go back to regular weekly updates now.

It's been a memorable world-wind trip to the Rolex Shanghai Masters for Melanie-Antoinette de Massy, president of the Monegasque Tennis Federation, Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters and the Monte-Carlo Country Club.

De Massy arrived in Shanghai at midday Friday after a 20-hour trip from Monaco with Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters tournament director David Massey.

On Saturday, de Massy sat in Valentin Vacherot's guest box along with Massey to see her countryman defeat four-time Rolex Shanghai Masters champion and World No. 5 Novak Djokovic. Twenty-four hours later, de Massy was back in Vacherot's box to see history being made as the 26-year-old rallied from a set down to defeat his cousin Arthur Rinderknech 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 and become the first player from Monaco in the Open Era to win an ATP Tour singles title.

"I am so, so proud of him and there's really no words that come to mind to describe really the feelings throughout the match," said de Massy. "He played incredibly well and the match was fantastic. We saw really some amazing points, fantastic tennis and I'm so glad to be here. I'm so glad to live this moment with him and so happy to see this historical final."

De Massy's phone has been receiving nonstop messages from well wishers back home as well as interview requests. Avid tennis fan  Prince Albert II of Monaco followed closely Vacherot's historic run in Shanghai and was messaging de Massy before and during the championship match.

During the final, de Massy said she received several WhatsApp messages from Prince Albert II and afterwards he spoke to her along with Vacherot.

"We spoke for 10 to 15 minutes after the match and he was so thrilled, then Prince Albert spoke to Val for about 10 minutes," said de Massy, who received close to 100 messages after the final. "He was very touched by Val's words in the award ceremony and was proud of Val's results. The Prince gave interviews to the local press and congratulated the work of the Federation. The whole country is proud."

There was a watch party at the Monte-Carlo Country Club with members and many of the top junior players in Monaco. The marketplace showed the match at 10:30 in the morning on a massive screen that was organised by the Monaco Town Hall, similar to what is done for the Formula 1 race in Monte-Carlo.

"I turned on my phone, but I haven't really watched anything yet," said Vacherot. "I can't wait to watch the videos, especially at the Monte-Carlo Country Club. I knew they had a big watch party. Because it's Sunday, everyone is off work, so I think this probably the day there is the most people."

Shortly after the final ended, Vacherot draped the Monaco flag over his shoulders before the award ceremony began. He reflected on his historic achievement and what it means for his country.

"Just to hold the flag, and to be able to do that for my country is, it's unreal, of course," said Vacherot, who climbed from No. 204 to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Rankings. "I'm just thinking about our little federation, our little small country, one of the smallest countries in the world. Probably the smallest federation. We have such, we have not many players, and now we have one Masters 1000 in singles, two Masters 1000 titles in doubles with Hugo Nys — also one Grand Slam final for Hugo in the Australian Open two years ago — and what we get to achieve for Monaco is unbelievable. I hope that we're making everyone proud of us, and I hope just to keep going."

Nys is ranked No. 19 in doubles and has been a career-high No. 12 in June 2023. He won his biggest title at ATP Masters 1000 Rome that year and also was a finalist at the Australian Open in 2023. Romain Arneodo, a winner of two doubles titles this season, is ranked No. 45 in doubles after reaching a career-high No. 38 in August.

Earlier this year at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters in April, French-born Monegasque player Arneodo made history by winning the doubles title with Frenchman Manuel Guinard. Arneodo became the first Monegasque player to win the Monte-Carlo doubles title. 

"For Monaco it's absolutely extraordinary and we've never had a Monaco-born player in the Top 100 in singles," said de Massy. "We've had, as Valentin said at the end of his semi-final match — and I really appreciated that he did that — is to remind everyone that in tennis there's singles, but there's also doubles, and we have extraordinary double players. In Monaco we love playing Davis Cup because we love being a team, we love being all together and with Monaco Tennis Federation — and Monaco tennis as a whole actually, whether it's the tournament, the federation, or the club — is one big family."

Half-brother and coach Benjamin Balleret instilled the belief in Valentin that he would break into the Top 100 and then take it to a higher level.

"When we were putting goals for Val it was not only Top 100, because it seems a little, like, 'Oh, for some guys, we just want to be Top 100'," said Balleret, who ranked a career-high No. 204 in 2006. "No, it's like, 'Let's go. We want to be Top 50, Top 30'. You have more, even more ambition. So our role as the coach and all the team is to be behind him and to push him and to tell him that he believes that he can be a top-50 player. Because I think so many players stop believing."

Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson were co-stars in the 2003 romantic comedy, “Something's Gotta Give.” The pair delivered incredible performances, and the film was a hit, even earning Keaton an Academy Award nomination. However, there was one thing that the actress failed to do when signing onto the film: she did not negotiate a back end to her contract. 

Keaton revealed this information in her memoir “Then Again,” which was published in 2011. 

In Keaton's memoir, she revealed how she earned significantly less than her co-star. But Nicholson would do something that left Keaton pleasantly surprised. In her memoir, she wrote about her shock “when a check with a lot of zeros arrived in the mail for my back-end percentage,” Daily Mail reports. 

The money had come from Nicholson's “hefty percentage of the film's gross earnings,” Daily Mail reports. In Keaton's memoir, she also revealed that she had initially thought the film would not do well at the box office but called it her “favorite film,” The Guardian reports. 

Keaton's acting was so convincing that Nicholson even believed she was in love with him. “We're rehearsing that scene in the street, where he's running after her, and he calls me over after one rehearsal. He's all rattled,” director Nancy Meyers said at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2018, Vulture reports. 

“I said, ‘What's up?' And he goes, ‘Diane just told me she loves me.' I couldn't tell if he was horrified or thrilled. So I was like, ‘Yes, I know, I wrote that line. It's in the script, Jack.' And he said, ‘Oh, okay.' He thought she meant it. It's really funny. That's her.”

Keaton had an impressive career, and fans have taken a closer look at her life and the impact she had on Hollywood after her passing on October 11. She was 79. The world has reacted with great sadness to Keaton's death, and a friend shared more information about the type of person she was. 

“She lived exactly how she wanted to, which was on her own terms, surrounded by the people and things she really loved,” the friend said, People reports. “Being in the spotlight wasn't important,” the source revealed, saying that Keaton loved being home with her golden retriever, Reggie. 

The friend continued, “Diane always had a very strong sense of who she was and how she wanted to live. In these last few years, she kept a close circle, and she liked it that way. She was funny right up until the end, and she had this way of making even ordinary moments feel special. That was just who she was.”

Thank you for all the entertainment in my life from you.I have your movies that I replay (when I'm down) they always make me laugh and smile 😃 at the world again.RIP MsKeaton and may G-D hold you and welcome you!! AA Bluhm

The country's largest exhibitor is honoring the late actress by bringing back two of her signature films to 100 cinemas across the U.S.  


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	In a fitting tribute to the late Diane Keaton, AMC Theatres is bringing back Annie Hall and Something's Gotta Give to 100 cinemas across the U.S., The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


Keaton died unexpectedly on Oct. 11 at her home in Los Angeles at age 79, less than a month after Robert Redford‘s passing. As THR wrote in a critic's appreciation, their deaths represent “another stinging loss to the pantheon of New Hollywood in the decades before the major studios largely stepped away from making movies for grownups.”




Annie Hall was the result of Keaton's long-time collaboration with the now-canceled filmmaker Woody Allen, both when they were romantically involved and after. The movies she made with him are considered some of her most acclaimed work, with Keaton winning the Oscar for best actress for her titular performance in Annie Hall.

	Released in April 1977, Annie Hall earned a respectable $38.3 million at the domestic box office, not adjusted for inflation, while there is no way to put a price tag on its cultural impact. It ranks No. 31 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Movies in American Cinema, No. 4 on its comedy list.


	Keaton would earn three more Oscar nominations for best actress, culminating with director Nancy Meyers‘ Something's Gotta Give, an unexpected twist on the May-to-December plotline that co-stars Jack Nicholson and Keanu Reeves. The 2003 movie was also a runaway commercial success, earning $124.7 million domestically and $142 million overseas for a global haul of $266.7 million. That makes it the top-grossing live-action film of Keaton's career in a leading role, not adjusted for inflation.

	











	Other movie theater circuits are also likely to host Keaton retrospectives, while her films have quickly climbed up iTunes' movie rental chart since her passing. On Monday, Something's Gotta Give sat at No. 5, followed by Annie Hall at No. 14. Because I Said So, Reds and Baby Boom were also seeing an uptick, underscoring her rich and varied body of work.

The scariest thing about Stranger Things‘ fourth season was the episode runtimes. We weren't the A.V. Club to notice that the bloated runtimes had an adverse effect on the show's narrative flow. As the premiere of Stranger Things 5 approaches, the collective members of the Hawkins A.V. Club have spent months biting their nails at the prospect of another season filled with episodes that run upwards of 98 minutes—not to mention a two-and-a-half-hour finale. That's too many Eggos for a single Stephen King fanatic. Thankfully, in hopes of quelling the slow wave of anxiety cresting on his TV show's fanbase, Stranger Things co-creator Ross Duffer posted the “ACTUAL” episode lengths on his Instagram page earlier today, and let's just say they're shorter than last season.

In a post captioned “ACTUAL runtimes,” Duffer revealed that the first three Chapters of season five run 68 minutes or less. However, one can see runtime creep infiltrating his editing process because the part one finale (yeah, this Stranger Things is another split season deal) clocks in at one hour and 23 minutes. Is that a sign of things to come? Should we clear our schedules for part two? Please, Mr. Duffer, tell us how we should conduct our lives. We're hopeless over here.

Anyway, here are the runtimes for your TV scheduling purposes:

Chapter One: 68 minutes
Chapter Two: 54 minutes
Chapter Three: 66 minutes
Chapter Four: 83 minutes

Per Variety, the post offers some relief from reports that each episode would run between 90 minutes and two hours. Season four saw the Duffers really stretch these episodes out, with all but one episode running longer than 70 minutes. Given that they're using the more consistent and reasonable runtimes as part of their personal promotion for the show, the Duffers have heard you, they've seen you, and they're making changes.

For those who still have their calendars open, the first part of Stranger Things 5 premieres on November 26, and the final three episodes will premiere on December 31. Those episodes better be short, too, because no one wants to enter the new year with episodes of Stranger Things hanging over them.

In a company-wide letter, Grainge highlighted UMG's "progress" in fostering "responsible AI" and exploring how to generate new revenue using the technology.

	Chris Eggertsen



	Universal Music Group (UMG) chairman/CEO Lucian Grainge has updated UMG employees on the “progress” the music giant is making on generative artificial intelligence in a new staff-wide memo circulated Monday (Oct. 13), which outlines the company's efforts to safeguard artists' copyrighted material while touting the technology's potential to unlock new revenue.


	“UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering AI's enormous potential,” Grainge wrote in the memo. “While our progress is significant, the speed at which this technology is developing makes it important that you are all continually updated on our efforts and well-versed on the strategy and approach.”


	Grainge went on to highlight UMG's work with AI developers, noting the company's AI deals with top platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Meta as well as emerging ones like BandLab and Soundlabs. Universal Music Japan, he added, recently announced a deal with Japanese telecommunications company KDDI to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using the technology.


	The CEO also discussed AI's potential “to connect our artists with their fans in new ways,” including through the use of agentic AI — essentially AI agents that are capable of more sophisticated problem-solving. In Grainge's words, agentic AI has “the potential to revolutionize how fans interact with and discover music” and help provide “a significant source of new future revenue for artists and songwriters.”


	Grainge additionally reiterated UMG's commitment to responsibly trained AI, mentioning the company's deals with AI developers like ProRata and KLAY and noting that it's “in discussions with numerous additional like-minded companies whose products provide accurate attribution and tools which empower and compensate artists — products that both protect music and enhance its monetization.”


	“And to be clear — and this is very important — we will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent,” Grainge continued. He added that many AI companies' efforts to make it legal to train AI technology on copyrighted material with the consent of rights holders “amount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists.”


	Grainge also addressed the topic of so-called “AI slop” on streaming services, pointing out UMG's unveiling of “artist-centric” principles at the top of 2023 — notably before the AI revolution really began taking hold in the music business later that year — that he says were designed to “combat what is essentially platform pollution.” 


	“Since then, many of our platform partners have made significant progress in putting in place measures to address the diversion of royalties, infringement and fraud — all to the benefit of the entire music ecosystem,” he wrote, later noting UMG's recently announced collaboration with SoundPatrol, which utilizes neural fingerprinting that it says can detect the use of copyrighted material in AI-generated songs (Sony also partnered with the company).


	Read Grainge's full memo below.


Dear Colleagues,


I am writing today to update you on the progress that we are making on our efforts to take advantage of the developing commercial opportunities presented by Gen AI technology for the benefit of all our artists and songwriters.  


I want to address three specific topics:  


UMG is playing a pioneering role in fostering AI's enormous potential.  While our progress is significant, the speed at which this technology is developing makes it important that you are all continually updated on our efforts and well-versed on the strategy and approach.  


The foundation of what we're doing is the belief that together, we can foster a healthy commercial AI ecosystem in which artists, songwriters, music companies and technology companies can all flourish together.  


NEW AGREEMENTS


To explore the varied opportunities and determine the best approaches, we have been working with AI developers to put their ideas to the test.  In fact, we were the first company to enter into AI-related agreements with companies ranging from major platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Meta to emerging entrepreneurs such as BandLab, Soundlabs, and more.  Both creatively and commercially our portfolio of AI partnerships continues to expand.


Very recently, Universal Music Japan announced an agreement with KDDI, a leading Japanese telecommunications company, to develop new music experiences for fans and artists using Gen AI.  And we are very actively engaged with nearly a dozen different companies on significant new products and service plans that hold promise for a dramatic expansion of the AI music landscape.  Further, we're seeing other related advancements.  While just scratching the surface of AI's enormous potential, Spotify's recent integration with ChatGPT offers a pathway to move fluidly from query and discovery to enjoyment of music—and all within a monetized ecosystem. 


HOW OUR ARTISTS CAN PARTICIPATE


Based on what we've done with our AI partners to date, and the new discussions that are underway, we can unequivocally say that AI has the potential to deliver creative tools that will enable us to connect our artists with their fans in new ways—and with advanced capability on a scale we've never encountered.  


Further, I believe that Agentic AI, which dynamically employs complex reasoning and adaptation, has the potential to revolutionize how fans interact with and discover music.


I know that we will successfully navigate as well as seize these opportunities and that these new products could constitute a significant source of new future revenue for artists and songwriters.  


We will be actively engaged in discussing all of these developments with the entire creative community.


While some of the biggest opportunities will require further exploration, we are excited by the compelling AI models we're seeing emerge.  


We will only consider advancing AI products based on models that are trained responsibly.  That is why we have entered into agreements with AI developers such as ProRata and KLAY, among others, and are in discussions with numerous additional like-minded companies whose products provide accurate attribution and tools which empower and compensate artists—products that both protect music and enhance its monetization.


And to be clear—and this is very important—we will NOT license any model that uses an artist's voice or generates new songs which incorporate an artist's existing songs without their consent.


New AI products will be joined by many other similar ones that will soon be coming to market, and we have established teams throughout UMG that will be working with artists and their representatives to bring these opportunities directly to them.


RESPONSIBLE PUBLIC POLICIES COVERING AI


We remain acutely aware of the fact that large and powerful AI companies are pressuring governments around the world to legitimize the training of AI technology on copyrighted material without owner consent or compensation, among other proposals.


To be clear: all these misguided proposals amount to nothing more than the unauthorized (and, we believe, illegal) exploitation of the rights and property of creative artists.


In addition, we are acting in the marketplace to see our partners embrace responsible and ethical AI policies and we're proud of the progress being made there.  For example, having accurately predicted the rapid rise of AI “slop” on streaming platforms, in 2023 we introduced Artist-Centric principles to combat what is essentially platform pollution.   Since then, many of our platform partners have made significant progress in putting in place measures to address the diversion of royalties, infringement and fraud—all to the benefit of the entire music ecosystem.


We commend our partners for taking action to address this urgent issue, consistent with our Artist-Centric approach.  Further, we recently announced an agreement with SoundPatrol, a new company led by Stanford scientists that employs patented technology to protect artists' work from unauthorized use in AI music generators.  


We are confident that by displaying our willingness as a community to embrace those commercial AI models which value and enhance human artistry, we are demonstrating that market-based solutions promoting innovation are the answer.  


LEADING THE WAY FORWARD


So,  as we work to assure safeguards for artists, we will help lead the way forward, which is why we are exploring and finding innovative ways to use this revolutionary technology to create new commercial opportunities for artists and songwriters while simultaneously aiding and protecting human creativity.    


I'm very excited about the products we're seeing and what the future holds.  I will update you all further on our progress.

It wasn't long ago that Apple looked like it would be making a big push into theatrical releases, believing what has been true for most other distributors: a theatrical release and its subsequent marketing push helps a movie's cachet once it (eventually) lands on streaming later. It worked with other studios — mixing up the partner on each — on the release of films like “Killers of the Flower Moon” (Paramount), “Napoleon” (Sony), and “Argylle” (Universal). And with “F1: The Movie” in partnership with yet another distributor in Warner Bros., it found its biggest hit to date — and quietly one of its biggest successes of the year at the box office — grossing $629 million worldwide.

Apple rewarded that success with a run in theaters that has lasted 14+ weeks, even as the film has already been available for premium rental since August. Few filmmakers get that sort of runway, but for Joseph Kosinski, who certainly did for “Top Gun: Maverick,” they were willing to give him the privilege, and his movie made the most of it.

 










Now Apple has finally announced a release date for the movie on streaming on what is now just Apple TV (not Apple TV+), hitting the service globally on December 12. It'll be nearly six months since the film opened on June 27; a theatrical window like that is virtually unheard of.

But that's no guarantee the same will happen to an Apple movie again. Despite its success, it wouldn't be a surprise if the “F1” theatrical experiment is over.

Within a matter of months of each other, both Apple and Amazon were reported to be dipping their toes into theatrical releases. After some success with “Air” and a few others, Amazon MGM is now all in, targeting as many as 14 theatrical releases a year and offering them beefy theatrical windows before they land on streaming. The studio is still doing some direct-to-streaming movies, but it has made clear its priorities. 

Apple, on the other hand, before “F1” had a string of costly misses and has since been rolling back that approach. The losses for movies like “Argylle” and “Fly Me to the Moon” were well-documented, and the straw that broke the camel's back was its approach with the George Clooney-Brad Pitt thriller “Wolfs.” That movie was going to have a robust theatrical release up until Apple yanked the rug out at the last minute and said it would drop on streaming after little more than a week. The studio tried to placate the filmmakers by saying it had already greenlit a sequel to “Wolfs,” but director Jon Watts openly said that after the theatrical fiasco, he “no longer trusted” Apple as a creative partner.

 










Since then, some of its higher-profile films have all been quietly and modestly released in theaters before landing on streaming, if they got a theatrical release at all, a stark contrast to what was agreed upon and stuck to with “F1.” Spike Lee's “Highest 2 Lowest” spent a couple weeks in theaters, grossing just a reported $1.5 million, before hitting the streaming service. Paul Greengrass' “The Lost Bus” did the same, opening in just a few select theaters and did not report box office totals. 

Apple is not under the same pressure as its peers to produce for the box office and hope that streaming can pick up the slack. Back in March, a report suggested that Apple TV loses $1 billion a year on streaming and has in the vicinity of 45 million subscribers. It's fine operating it as a loss-leader and using it as a means to continue selling iPhones. 

The company also has never been bound to one approach, and it stands to reason that, if another project on the scale of “F1” with a director like Kosinski attached was on the table, it could pursue a similarly lengthy theatrical release strategy. Some of its upcoming movies sound like they could have that pedigree. There's the Skydance-produced “Mayday” starring Ryan Reynolds, the Mattel movie “Matchbox” starring John Cena, and the Ben Stiller and Jake Johnson pickleball comedy “The Dink.” Have we mentioned movie theaters need more comedies like that last one?

Glen Powell escapes death again, again, and again in the latest trailer for The Running Man, Edgar Wright's upcoming adaptation of the 1982 Stephen King novel of the same name. 


	The dystopian action flick stars Powell as Ben Richards, a family man who decides the only way he can get the money necessary to help his sick daughter is to enter a popular television contest with a simple concept: Survive 30 days of professional assassins trying to kill you, and win a boatload of cash. The new trailer opens with a shot of Ben filmed almost like a reality TV show talking head interview, with the character pondering: “You know, I've been thinking about the show: For the next 30 days, everyone in the country is trying to murder me. That's crazy, right?”


	The trailer goes on to tease some of the wild action set pieces Wright has concocted for the film, as well as Ben's steady realization that this already demented game is likely rigged. He links up with some ostensible underground figures, too, including one played by William H. Macy, who outfits Ben with a fake identity (but declines to sell him some C4), and another played by Michael Cera, who tells Ben: “You know why they cheered for you down there? If you can survive against those goons, so can they.”

	Along with Powell, Macy, and Cera, The Running Man's stacked cast features Colman Domingo as the bombastic host of the TV show and Josh Brolin as its conniving producer. The film, which arrives Nov. 14, also stars Lee Pace, Jayme Lawson, Emilia Jones, Katy O'Brian, and Martin Herlihy. 

	











	This marks the second time that The Running Man has been turned into a movie. Back in 1987, Paul Michael Glaser directed an adaptation that starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Yaphet Kotto, Richard Dawson, María Conchita Alonso, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, and more. (Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa even had small parts in the flick.)

UPDATED: Media outlets ranging from The Atlantic to CNN to Newsmax have so far said that they do not plan for their correspondents to sign a new Pentagon press policy, arguing that it attempts to threaten access to the complex unless reporters agree to restrictions on how they have normally done their jobs.


The New York Times, The Washington Post and NPR also said that they would not sign, along with other outlets including The Hill and NewsNation.


	A spokesperson for Newsmax said on Monday, “Newsmax has no plans to sign the letter.  We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	A spokesperson for CNN said, “We will not be deflected from our duty to hold all three fairly and fully to account, and we will continue to report on the actions and decision-making processes of the U.S. government without fear or favor.”


	The Pentagon unveiled a new policy last month that required that information “be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.” The risk for news organizations that signed it was that their reporters could lose their credentials for access to the complex.


	Journalism groups consulted with Pentagon press officials about changes to the policy, but even after the revisions, still found it too restrictive.

	











	Last week, the Pentagon Press Association said that the policy still “leaves open the threat of the Department of Defense revoking credentials for reporters who exercise their First Amendment rights by seeking information that hasn't been pre-approved for formal release, even when the information is entirely unclassified.”


	The press association said that the policy also “conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it's criminal to speak without express permission — which plainly, it's not.” Some journalists argued that such activity as posting a call for tips on social media would run afoul of the rules.


	The deadline for signing is Tuesday.


	The press association, in a new statement issued on Monday, said that most of its members “seem likely to hand over their badges rather than acknowledge a policy that gags Pentagon employees and threatens retaliation against reporters who seek out information that has not been pre-approved for release.” 


	Richard Stevenson, Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, said that the policy threatens to punish journalists “for ordinary news gathering protected by the First Amendment. Since the policy was first announced, we have expressed concerns that it constrains how journalists can report on the U.S. military, which is funded by $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars annually.”


	Some outlets, like CBS News, NBC News and Fox News, have yet to say whether their reporters would sign the policy.


	An outlet that is signing is One America News Network. “After thorough review of the revised press policy by our attorney, OAN staff has signed the document,” the network's Charles Herring said in a statement.


	Throughout the day on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has responded to news outlets announcing their refusal to sign with a hand “bye-bye” emoji.


	He wrote, “Pentagon access is a privilege, not a right. So, here is @DeptofWar press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free. Press must wear visible badge. Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts. DONE. Pentagon now has same rules as every U.S. military installation.”


	But some veterans of the Pentagon press corps said that Hegseth is wrong, in that the press already has been displaying badges. nor did they have access to areas like classified spaces.


	Weijia Jiang, president of the White House Correspondents' Association, and Shaun Tandon, president of the State Department Correspondents' Association, said in a joint statement, “Access inside the Pentagon has never been about convenience to reporters. The public has a right to know how the government is conducting the people's business. Unfettered reporting on the U.S. military and its civilian leadership provides a service to those in uniform, veterans, their families and all Americans.”

I thought MAGA was about transparency.

Betcha ABC and CBS sign.

Can't wait for Hesgeth to go to jail when this is all over.

Here's hoping.

“veterans of the Pentagon said that Hegseth is wrong” – that could also be his epitaph.

Food for those news outlets.
Somewhat surprised one or two of them didn't bend a knee but not complaining.

Dave Kalema has a great story to tell — several, in fact. You can read all about his big break 31 years in the making here, but for the rest of it we're publishing his cinematic journey in full. He calls it “The Dreamscape.” 

“When I learned of the news that this story would be published in IndieWire, I was emotional,” he said. “There's something about having ‘Dreamscape' published that allows me to feel like I'm carrying forward a sense of, I call it in a way, I'm a reckless dreamer. I don't deny the dream in me.”

Neither do we. Here's “The Dreamscape.”

––

When you grow up as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, the closest you'll ever get to creative expression is a Panasonic camcorder you won't be allowed to touch. It's 1998 and these cameras are flying off the shelves of RadioShack. One day when you're in the first grade, you'll come home from school and see one on your kitchen table. It'll be perched on top of the box it came in like it's been waiting for you. When you sit down you'll be eye level with its Panasonic insignia like it's introducing itself personally. You know it's expensive because dad's footsteps get increasingly louder as he runs down the stairs from his bedroom. “Hey, don't touch that!” In his thick Ugandan accent he yells this before welcoming you home.

You'll nickname it “The Toy” because you're tired of dad saying “this isn't a toy”. Over the next few months you'll see him buy every accessory under the sun. The travel bag. The shoulder strap. Extra VHS-C tapes. After the school year lets out, you'll board a plane to spend your third summer in Uganda. Mom is starting to show because she's due in six months, but it's dad who has The Toy strapped to his body like a newborn.

Everyday he'll get up before 7:00 AM and go to The Site, the plot of land he bought next to his mother's house. The Site's two acres comprise Uganda's trademark red soil and sit on top of Buziga, one of the highest points in Kampala. You'll quickly learn that dad bought The Toy to film the construction of his retirement home there. 21 years after leaving during the Idi Amin regime, dad will finally have the education, career, and means to build a house he can call his own. This new home will prove to his 17 siblings that he successfully cashed in his ticket with Uncle Sam for a better life. With each brick laid at The Site, The Toy will document dad's decades-long dream.

 










At night dad will turn the lens on you. You'll wear your hat backwards, perform impromptu skits with Frederick, your older brother, and make the family laugh. When The Toy is pointed at you, it's like dad is Andy while you and Frederick become Woody and Buzz Lightyear. You'll go to infinity and beyond every night because The Toy will create a safe place for your self-expression to fly. Even when the power goes out like it will most nights, Auntie Beatrice will light up the living room with a kerosene lamp to keep the production rolling. If Uganda had anything like America's Funniest Home Videos, you definitely would have been on it.

When dad falls asleep on the flight back to Washington, D.C., you'll remove The Toy from the bag beneath his feet. You'll stick the camera in passengers' faces with the restless curiosity of a five year old. Why is your baby crying ma'am? It didn't like Uganda? Sir, who is the woman sleeping on your shoulder? Who's your favorite character in Toy Story? You'll press all the buttons you've seen dad press for months because you no longer have to wait for him to play. The Toy is in your hands now. You're free.

A few days after coming home you'll be playing Nintendo 64 in your bedroom. Dad will yell your name at the octave that lets you know you have less than ten seconds to make it down the stairs before he calls again. When you see him holding The Toy in one hand, you'll freeze. “What did I tell you about this?” You won't have the words to downplay your disobedience because the incriminating tunes of black and white static are bellowing out from the TV. In a few seconds you'll learn that your British Airways in-flight masterpiece came at the expense of his ‘98 summer original that he filmed at The Site. In the deafening silence that connects you two, he'll hand out his Toygate verdict: “You're never allowed to touch this again!”

 










It'll be twenty-one years before you put your hands on another camera.

As a first-generation Ugandan-American, your creativity will buckle under the false promises of assimilation. You'll attend two different churches because your parents pray separately. White kids will touch your hair at school. Every other Saturday will be spent at the Luganda Academy your parents start with their friends. After school you'll either be at Kumon lessons with the Desi kids, Tae-Kwon Do classes with the Koreans, or soccer practice playing on your neighbor's team. Every summer, you'll be the American cousin in Uganda because of your accent. Each room in this revolving door of cultural immersion will be its own sisyphean struggle for belonging. Only when you start playing basketball will you feel free from the pressures of having to fit in.

Every once in a while you'll scratch a creative itch. You'll color your 7th grade science reports until Mrs. Baxter tells the entire class she's not a fan of your work. You'll take music recording, ceramics, painting, and improv in high school. In college you'll play basketball for one of the greatest coaches of all time. He's a future Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer who you'll win a National Championship with. Still, you'll attend the improv shows and spoken word open mics wishing you could borrow a modicum of confidence from the kid who hijacked The Toy at 30,000 feet.

 










Then mom will blindside you: she is taking a job with the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Even though the contract is only for a year, she's betting on herself to get an extension because this is her dream job. She's giving up the home she made in one country for the chance to reach the pinnacle of her career in another. She'll double down on the fact that this UN job will allow you to finish school without shouldering more student loan debt. Her leap of faith will inspire you, but not enough to follow her. You'll graduate Cum Laude to honor her sacrifice, then move to Atlanta on your own to start your career.

It'll happen within the first ten days of your move. You'll be walking home from work when a streetlight will spark the idea. You'll run to CVS, buy the cheapest notebook you find, and sprint home before your vision evaporates over dinner plans. Two hours will feel like two minutes because words will come faster than you can write them. When you uber to Java Monkey in Decatur, Georgia a few nights later and sign up for the open mic, you'll be called sixth and perform that original spoken word poem about a retired Black athlete who misses playing under the lights.

In a few days, mom will answer your phone call unaware that you're still high from the standing ovation you got. You'll be nervous because you saved the encore for her. She's listening intently to your words, but her silence lasts too long. When you see the Whatsapp connection isn't lagging, you'll sober up and your voice will freeze instead. You've never known mom to be apathetic, so that chasm of silence will feel larger than the ocean separating you two.

 










You won't perform again after that. You'll go to work, play hoops at the rec, and continue writing at night. In a year you'll move to New York City for a new job that will promote you early, fly you all over the world, and pay you enough to afford your own apartment by the time you're 24. It's the type of job immigrant parents call home about. The kind that will turn you into a living trophy to display on their mantle of expectations. That's why nobody will believe you when you tell them you're quitting after just three years. They won't understand that you'll never truly care about that company or its perks. They'll fail to see that you're no longer willing to pay the price of being the only Black person in that room. That job will only ever be a trojan horse to disguise the idea that started to flow from your pen night after night.

––––

People will use “blog”, “podcast”, and “side hustle” to describe what you're doing even though you'll never utter those words yourself. Dad will tell his friends you've transitioned to IT because he knows you're using computers. Your aunties will say you never should have quit your job. Former colleagues will use predictably boring Silicon Valley jargon to question what you're building. The reality is you're making The Players Tribune for athletes that don't go pro. You're writing about life after sports in your mid-twenties and your media company will enjoy a tiny amount of success for someone with no media experience.

 










Your campus ambassador program will launch at 12 schools across the country. You'll reach 15,000 readers a month. Former athletes working at companies like Qualcomm, Spotify, Google, and The New York Times will submit their own stories. Then one day, Sarah, the Vice President of a sports media brand will tell you she's unfortunately too busy to pen her story for you. Without hesitation, you'll shoot your shot: Sarah, can I film your story instead? When you walk into the Best Buy at Union Square the next day to buy a Canon Rebel T6, you'll hold that box as if you're five years old and never heard dad's footsteps coming down the stairs.

You'll get so high from filming Sarah, that you'll run and gun five more interviews in three weeks. The extent of your new video department is you, the T6, your iPhone, and a Tascom lavalier mic B&H oversold you because you'll clearly know nothing about film equipment. When Sarah texts you to ask when her video is coming out, you'll frantically message Meghan who you went to college with. Can you teach me how to edit videos? Lucky for you, she lives a few minutes from your Brooklyn apartment and is happy to start teaching you Premiere.

If shooting these videos unlocks a creative door, editing them will give you keys to the building. With that power you'll aim higher. I'm going to be in Miami next week. Video interview? When Shane Battier accepts your ten word hail mary, you'll be too naive to know that his 30 minute window isn't enough time to do a shoot in an NBA arena. That's all I need! That night you'll buy the cheapest flight to South Beach and ask Joyzel, who you also went to college with, if she can bring her fancy Sony cameras. You successfully booked a 2x NBA Champion and want your video department to be more professional than Best Buy's Geek Squad made you believe you were. Lucky for you, Joyzel is from Miami and will be happy to direct your shoot in her hometown.

 










I can talk about the preparation you did the night before. I could rehash the similarities between that production and the adrenaline that marked your college basketball games. I'll just tell you what happens after Miami. You'll fly back to New York, assemble a rough cut, and send it to Joyzel for feedback. Unfortunately, you'll only hear crickets from her and self-doubt from yourself. When she finally emerges after three weeks, she'll simply email you an updated version of your video. You'll keep restarting it because her color grade, sound design, and graphics will put you in a trance. You've never made images move like that. After your fifth watch, you'll start feeling something in your chest.

That sensation will be so overwhelming, you'll have no choice but to take a walk. Two hours will go by like 30 seconds because your feet won't stop moving toward whatever direction epiphanies lead. You'll be standing on the corner of 6th Ave and W Houston St when that burning in your chest will give way to a vision. After that day, all you'll want to do is feel that again and the only way you know how is to recapture the magic of Miami.

Unfortunately, COVID won't care about your epiphany.

In March of 2020, your fire to make videos will be extinguished by the pandemic's uncertainty. You'll binge watch all the Harry Potter movies on HBO Max. Quibi will come and go from your life quicker than Steph Curry's jump shot. You'll consume every Shantell Martin video on YouTube wondering if you'll ever be as bold as the lines she draws. Instead of making videos, you'll be glued to screens like babies who are given iPads by their parents to keep them quiet.

 










Your restlessness will meet its match on Sunday, April 19th when you sit down to watch the first two episodes of The Last Dance. Two hours will go by like ten seconds because those images will make sense in ways they couldn't have before Miami. You've interviewed professional athletes, used two camera setups, and incorporated graphics into an edit. So when Eric B. and Rakim's “I Ain't No Joke” scores the montage of Michael Jordan's rookie season, you'll visualize that edit on a timeline in your head. Two jump cuts for MJ's And-1. The fading crowd audio under Magic Johnson's speechless. Obama's admiration. The no look pass. MJ's gold chains at All-Star weekend. His cradle. And those rainbow lens flares following MJ through the tunnel in Paris!? It's poetry in motion. Of course the feeling in your chest will return.

Over the next few weeks, you'll listen to Jason Hehir, the director of The Last Dance, on every podcast like a fiend who needs another hit of his story. When you hear him say where he went to college, that feeling in your chest will explode. You also went to a small liberal arts school in Western Massachusetts. You too were a college athlete. The school he attended just so happens to be the rival school you beat ten out of thirteen times on the court. How the hell did he transition to making films at the highest level?

 










In the silence of your Brooklyn apartment, you'll say four words that you are certain match that feeling in your chest. I can do that. You won't have a clue how to make films at the level of The Last Dance and you won't know anyone who does. You won't even be sure if COVID will give you a real shot to figure it out. Without a shadow of a doubt, what you will know then, is that you spent your whole life climbing a mountain just to see the clarity of your own dream.

I'm going to make movies.

––––

I wish I could tell you that everything falls into place after this, but almost half a decade will go by. You'll move 13 times in that span, bouncing from cheap month-to-month sublets to make your money stretch before it houdinis. You'll even give up on New York twice. Since breaking into film is tougher than the Bad Boy Pistons, you'll surf a creative wave back to the stage for the first time in seven years. Telling stories will tide you over because it will be the first time that you'll ever reveal the pervasive feeling of otherness that accompanied your Ugandan-American upbringing. You'll watch movies and attend every filmmaking workshop during the day, but you'll chase the highs of the stage at night.

In just a few years your storytelling will be featured on NPR and you'll never lose any of The Moth's GrandSlam storytelling competitions you compete in. When you return from your first road show, you'll get a text. “Hey Dave, I think you should apply to this”. It'll come from Francesca who just earned her first Editor credit on Netflix's Stamped From the Beginning. As soon as you look at the website for Industry Standard's nine month post-production residency, you'll see that it's supported by Netflix and know you're a longshot. Since your odds will feel as slim as Kevin Durant, you'll just practice what you've been doing on stage: telling a story only you can tell.

 










On the morning of Friday August 16th, 2024 you'll finish your weekly 10-mile bike ride and come back to the apartment you have a day to move out of. It's been 89 days since you submitted your application. You just sold all your camera gear to fund tomorrow's move. You don't know where you'll be going. That's when the email will finally arrive. When you lock eyes with that notification on your phone, your heart will race faster than it does when you're cycling. Your hands will shake to the point where you'll forget to breathe because your fate will hang precariously in the balance of what that email says.

When you finally calm down enough to open it, you won't even get through the first line before dropping to your knees. On the floor of that apartment, you'll cry tears of relief. You're 31 and have no credits to your name, but Industry Standard will believe in your story enough to offer you one of their five limited spots. Even though you dreamt of making films, you never imagined that your opportunity would come with an Assistant Editor job at Library Films, mentorship from Industry Standard, and support from Netflix. When you pick yourself off the floor, you'll call your younger brother, George, and the words will spill out like air released after a pressure valve bursts.

 










I did it. I'm going to be working on a Netflix project.

––––

The weight of this accomplishment won't hit you until you see everything you own fit in the back of a rented Nissan Rogue. As you drive back to New York, you won't stop thinking about the price of your dream, how simple your life had to become to chase it, and your parents. The look in mom's eyes when she said she was uprooting her life again for the United Nations. The anger in dad's voice when he learned you mishandled The Toy and erased footage of the home he was working toward since 1977. In ways you never could have before, you'll see yourself in both of them––you left home to chase an uncertain path. Maybe mom and dad were never supposed to nurture your creativity just like their parents never drew them a blueprint on how to survive as immigrants. Like you, they had to be the first in their families to figure it out.

So yeah, as the middle child of Fred and Barbara Kalema, it will take you more than three decades to earn a real shot at a creative life. Now that you're finally here, just remember that your dreams were never really yours alone.

Nancy Meyers is the latest to pay tribute to Diane Keaton, honoring her legacy in Hollywood following Keaton's death on Saturday at age 79


	The filmmaker took to social media to share her thoughts on Keaton after processing the news.


	“These past 48 hours have not been easy. Seeing all of your tributes to Diane has been a comfort,” Meyers posted on Instagram. “As a movie lover, I'm with you all — we have lost a giant. A brilliant actress who time and again laid herself bare to tell our stories. As a woman, I lost a friend of almost 40 years — at times over those years, she felt like a sister because we shared so many truly memorable experiences.”

	











	Meyers and Keaton first worked together in 1987's Baby Boom and would collaborate again in 1991's Father of the Bride. In 1995, Meyers and Keaton reunited for Father of the Bride II and again in 2003 for Something's Gotta Give.

	“As a filmmaker, I've lost a connection with an actress that one can only dream of. We all search for that someone who really gets us, right? Well, with Diane, I believe we mutually had that,” she continued. “I always felt she really got me so writing for her made me better because I felt so secure in her hands. I knew how vulnerable she could be. And I knew how hilarious she could be, not only with dialogue (which she said word for word as written but managed to always make it sound improvised) but she could be funny sitting at a dinner table or just walking into a room.”

	Meyers went on to note Keaton's professionalism on the set, saying that “she made everything better” and saw her “give it her all” every day they worked together.


	“When I needed her to cry in scene after scene in Something's Gotta Give she went at it hard and then somehow made it funny,” Meyers said. “And I remember she would sometimes spin in a kind of goofy circle before a take to purposely get herself off balance or whatever she needed to shed so she could be in the moment. She was fearless, she was like nobody ever, she was born to be a movie star, her laugh could make your day and for me, knowing her and working with her — changed my life. Thank you Di. I'll miss you forever.”

	You already know Queen Bey, now here comes King Lou. Louis Tomlinson just dropped the music video for his new song “Lemonade” — not to be confused with Beyoncé's iconic album of the same name — and it's truly wacky.


	The visual posted Monday (Oct. 13) opens with Tomlinson leaning against a car as a pesky photographer buzzes around him. He then falls asleep and wakes up inside a fever dream, surrounded by a group of people in full-body yellow suits. The group watches as a sock puppet opens up a lemonade stand for business and frolics around a lemon farm before Tomlinson dives into a swimming pool.

	











	“She's so bitter, she's so sweet/ Lemonade, lemonade,” he sings. “A little taste is all I need/ Lemonade, lemonade.”


	“Lemonade” serves as the lead single from Tomlinson's upcoming album, How Did I Get Here? The project — which drops Jan. 23, 2026 — will mark his third solo LP, and he has plans to embark on a North American tour in support of the album. He also will reunite with former One Direction bandmate Zayn Malik for an upcoming roadtrip docuseries on Netflix.


	But while there's much to be excited about on the horizon, How Did I Get Here? will also be the first album Tomlinson has dropped since the death of Liam Payne. In a recent Rolling Stone UK cover story, Tomlinson opened up about how the loss of his former bandmate has been “impossibly difficult.”

	











	“There's still a level in my head [where it feels] unjust and frustrating that he's not with us anymore,” he told the publication. “Naively, I thought that because at this point, I'm relatively well versed in grief for my age, that it might soften the blow. [That was] super-naive. It's very different. I've never lost a friend before.”


	Watch Tomlinson's “Lemonade” music video above.

Sammy Hagar has spent the past week gearing up to celebrate his 78th birthday with a bunch of shows at his Cabo Wabo resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. He's been joined by guests galore over the course of the shows, including a surprise appearance from Belinda Carlisle, who popped by Saturday night's gig, Oct. 11, to perform two of her biggest songs.


	First, Carlisle bounded onstage to join Hagar for a lively rendition of the Go-Go's 1980 classic, “We Got the Beat.” Carlisle then delivered her 1987 solo hit, “Heaven Is a Place on Earth,” with guitarist Steve Salas and the rest of Hagar's backing band lending the shimmering power-pop gem a crunchier, hard rock edge. 


	Along with Carlisle, Hagar's ongoing birthday bash has featured appearances from guests like Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna, Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, and Bon Jovi guitarist Phil X. Jerry Cantrell has also been a recurring guest, playing guitar on various tracks, including several Alice in Chains classics like “Rooster,” “Would?”, and “Man in the Box.”

	Hagar turns 78 today, Oct. 13, and he's set to celebrate with the fourth and final show of his birthday bash. He has one more gig scheduled for 2025, a solo show Fontana Youth Music Foundation's inaugural gala in Fontana, California. But next year the Red Rocker will return to Las Vegas for his Best of All Worlds residency at Dolby Live at Park MGM, with shows scheduled in March and September.

Political Editor


	When Democratic political strategist Maria Cardona blasted the Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions for violating citizens' rights, the Trump administration responded with a quote from Billy Madison.


	After appearing on CNN on Monday morning, Cardona posted on X, “ICE is engaging in egregious, criminal behavior, violating peoples' civil rights, kidnapping, and snatching innocent men, women, and children off the streets, even detaining American citizens! While doing it, not identifying themselves, hiding their faces, not telling people why they are being taken. This is not normal! This is not American! This is not acceptable! And videotaping these agents, asking them questions, and even hollering that they should not be doing this, does not in any way constitute a ‘violent attack' against these agents! It is part of the Constitution, to peacefully protest violent behavior against innocent people, and American citizens!”

	The Department of Homeland Security responded, “What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things Americans have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent statement were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone is now dumber for having listened to it.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	That is a quote from the 1995 Adam Sandler comedy, in which the principal tells him, “Mr. Madison, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”

	











	In the DHS statement, the department argued that “far from engaging in criminal behavior, federal law enforcement actions have significantly REDUCED crime in the cities we have been deployed to. Locking up criminals works, imagine that.”


	But DHS did not address Cardona's criticisms that non-violent legal immigrants and even citizens have been caught up in ICE raids, by what amounts to a secret police force given the lack of uniforms or other information. Videos collected by bystanders have popped up every day showing some of the raids. Last week, a video surfaced of an ICE officer who shot a member of the clergy with a pepper ball who had been outside a processing facility just outside Chicago. ICE spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin later said that “these agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility — impeding operations.”


	In response to the DHS message, Cardona wrote, “Really @DHSgov? You respond with a quote from Billy Madison? That proves just how unserious, sophomoric, and incompetent you all are. Which would be funny if you all weren't so deadly dangerous to the communities you are terrorizing! You are also dead wrong! The vast majority of the ppl you are detaining ARE NOT violent criminals, 93% have no violent criminal history whatsoever! There are REAMS of videos of you slamming women, children, and elderly ppl to the ground, shooting pepper balls at priests, even kidnapping American citizens!! THAT is not acceptable, it IS criminal and it is UNAMERICAN!”

ICE are nothing but a bunch of fascist thugs. No, scratch that. The entire Trump administration is a bunch of fascist thugs. They should be arrested for treason.

CNN has a declining share of a small market. They won't be around in 10 years. And that quote is hilarious. You weirdos freaking out only makes the response that much better.

Are you aware that you are on the wrong side of history? Or do you just not care?

Idiocracy is a documentary.

I hate what they said but I love the way they said it.

CNN won't exist in 5 years.

Neither will MAGA.

And yet JD Vance will serving his first term as president.

And that would be the very END of the United States of America, as there is little unity presently, and absolutely none at that point.

EXCLUSIVE: Millie Bobby Brown (Stranger Things, Enola Holmes) will star in and executive produce the new series Prism, currently in development at Netflix, sources close to the production reveal to Deadline. Rachel Brosnahan and AGBO, in their third project with the streamer, will also executive produce.


	Etan Frankel (Shameless, Joe vs. Carole) has been tapped as showrunner.


	Netflix declined comment.


	Brown will play Cassie, a woman with the unique ability to communicate with apparitions, who must uncover the cause of a newly discovered phenomenon that causes “visitors” (ghosts) to appear all over the world before it's too late.

Prism is based on the short story of the same name that was an Assemble Original featured in the magazine Assemble Artifacts, and was developed in-house with writer Nick Shafir, who will co-produce. Assemble Media is attached to produce.

	Executive producers include Brown through her PCMA banner; Brosnahan and Russell Kahn via Scrap Paper Pictures; Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Angela Russo-Otstot, Scott Nemes and Alessandra Maman on behalf of AGBO; and Jack Heller and Caitlin de Lisser-Ellen of Assemble Media.


	We understand that if the project goes to series, starring in Prism will not prevent Brown from keeping her commitments to previously announced projects. This is her second collaboration with AGBO, following her lead role in Netflix's The Electric State, the Russo brothers' most recent film.


Prism expands Brown's long and successful collaboration with Netflix that began with her starring role as Eleven in the smash hit Stranger Things, due to conclude its run with a fifth season to be released in three parts in November and December. Also hugely popular are Brown's Enola Holmes franchise films, two of which are currently available to stream with a third expected to premiere in 2026.

	











	Brosnahan's breakout role was in Netflix's House of Cards; she appeared in an episode of Orange is the New Black and starred in the streamer's film Saturn Return alongside Charles Melton and Will Poulter. She is best known for playing the lead in Prime Video's Emmy-winning period dramedy The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. She most recently played Lois Lane in James Gunn's Superman. Up next, Brosnahan will star in and executive produce the sophomore season of Apple TV's Presumed Innocent.


	AGBO is currently producing Marvel's Avengers: Doomsday in London, to be followed up by Avengers: Secret Wars (2027), with the Russos directing. The studio recently released The Electric State for Netflix, which premiered as the platform's No. 1 film, and wrapped The Bluff for Amazon MGM and The Whisper Man for Netflix. Citadel Season 2 for Prime Video is currently in post-production. AGBO also collaborated with Netflix on The Gray Man (2022) feature starring Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.


	Frankel is currently an executive producer on Big Mistakes for Netflix, with Dan Levy writing and attached to star. Most recently, he spent four years in an overall deal at UCP. While there, he was the creator/showrunner of Joe vs. Carole for Peacock. Previously, he was an EP on Get Shorty for Epix/MGM, two seasons on Animal Kingdom and on Showtime's Shameless, where he wrote for seven seasons.

Former Disney film chief Sean Bailey's first movie to be released upon taking the job at Disney was “Tron: Legacy,” a big swing based on the long-dormant cult property “Tron” from 1982. That film, about a human who gets sucked into a computer, was a pioneer for digital effects and became a cult favorite after its initial release, and “Legacy” aimed to be just as daring in its use of CGI, motion capture, and 3D, ultimately bringing in $400 million worldwide in 2010.

Perhaps fittingly, one of Bailey's last project upon his exit last year is “Tron: Ares,” which opened this weekend. But with underwhelming reviews, a tenuous connection to the original beyond a brief Jeff Bridges appearance, and a story that takes the “Tron” light cycles into the real world rather than try and innovate further into the digital realm, are we surprised that this sequel to a niche, cult hit underwhelmed audiences?

“Tron: Ares” made $33.5 million domestic and $60.5 million globally. It was an under-performance after it was expected the Jared Leto-starring film would make between $40-45 million at home and between $80-90 million worldwide. “Tron: Legacy” managed to open to $44 million back in 2010 which, with inflation, would be closer to $65 million today.

 










Granted, a lot of things underwhelmed at the box office this weekend. Paramount and Miramax's “Roofman” opened to just $8 million domestic. “One Battle After Another” brought in $6.6 million, a modest total but not the number you want to see if it were to be a “Sinners” level hit, and Roadside Attractions' “Kiss of the Spider Woman” with Jennifer Lopez did not even crack the Top 10 and made a dismal $918K in its opening.

But the “Tron: Ares” number is especially dispiriting. “Tron: Ares” is the latest in a string of not=terrible but-not-great Disney releases in 2025, the exception being “Lilo & Stitch.” Both of the summer Marvel titles “Fantastic Four: First Steps” and “Thunderbolts*” are miles away from the high water mark of something like “Deadpool & Wolverine.” “Snow White” struck out early in the year, and “Elio” is one of the lowest-grossing Pixar movies ever. 

Again, tentpoles need to tentpole if the box office wants to see growth on 2024.

“Ares” has a production budget of $180 million, so this will surely be headed to a loss. IMAX screenings accounted for $6.6 million of its domestic haul, or 20 percent of the total, so it will take an even bigger blow long term if it loses some of those premium screens. Audiences gave it a B+ CinemaScore, which is fine, but doesn't necessarily inspire great word of mouth, especially when we're talking about what you would hope would attract a cult audience.

 










What was one of the bigger selling points for “Tron: Ares”? Not strictly its visuals, its cast, or its plot, but instead its industrial rock score from Nine Inch Nails, the first not billed to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross but instead to their band. Disney turned to NIN after the composers for the much ballyhooed “Legacy” score, Daft Punk, have long since broken up. I like “Head Like a Hole” as much as the next guy, but that alone does not a mainstream hit make.

Up next for Disney, 20th Century Studios is releasing the music biopic and awards-hopeful “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,” it has another sequel/spinoff in “Predator: Badlands,” the animated “Zootopia 2,” and “Avatar: Fire and Ash.” If any of those underperform the way “Tron: Ares” did, then we have some problems.

Taylor Swift has completed her The Life of a Showgirl first-week victory lap. Her prize? The top spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart, which marks her 15th Number One album and sets a new record for first-week sales with just over 4 million equivalent album units. Topping off that feat, songs from Swift's The Life of a Showgirl also occupy all Top 12 spots in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	On Instagram, the singer reflected on the milestone in a post that looked back on the release of her self-titled debut album released nearly two decades ago. “I'll never forget how excited I was in 2006 when my first album sold 40,000 copies in its first week,” Swift wrote. “I was 16 and couldn't even fathom that that many people would care enough about my music to invest their time and energy into it. Since then I've tried to meet and thank as many people as I could who have given me the chance to chase this insane dream.” 


	She continued: “Here we are all these years later and a hundred times that many people showed up for me this week. I have 4 million thank you's I want to send to the fans, and 4 million reasons to feel even more proud of this album than I already was.”

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)


The Life of a Showgirl arrived on Oct. 3 and had sold 3.2 million copies in traditional formats, including physical and digital purchases, within just five days. This was thanks, in part, to the CD and vinyl variants she released leading up to the albums release. Most were only available for 24 hours and contained exclusive acoustic versions, demos, and voice messages that fueled fan fervor. 

	











	There were CD variant versions titled “Sweat and Vanilla Perfume,” “It's Frightening,” “It's Rapturous,” and “It's Beautiful,” plus vinyl variant versions titled “The Shiny Bug,” “Baby, That's Show Business,” “Tiny Bubbles in Champagne,” and “The Crowd Is Your King.” Then came four more CD releases titled the “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version,” “Dressing Room Rehearsal Version,” “The Life Is a Song Acoustic Version,” and “So Glamorous Cabaret Version.” The “Dressing Room Rehearsal Version” and “Alone in My Tower Acoustic Version” came in deluxe formats, too.

	Fans celebrated the release at movie theater screenings of The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, which premiered the “The Fate of Ophelia” music video, lyric videos for the rest of the album, and exclusive commentary on each track from Swift. 


	“Thank you for going out to celebrate this project in the movie theaters, investing in vinyl, streaming, watching the video, buying CDs, reading the poems I wrote inside the packaging, and immersing yourselves in The Life of a Showgirl,” Swift said. “I'll cherish this feeling forever. Just wow. Thank you for the lovely bouquet.”

Swift monopolizes the top 10 thanks to her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. She does so for a third time — no one else ever has at all.

	Gary Trust



Taylor Swift claims the top 12 spots on the latest Billboard Hot 100, all via her new album, The Life of a Showgirl. On the chart dated Oct. 18, “The Fate of Ophelia” leads her dozen debuts at No. 1 — as the 12-song set becomes the first album ever to place all its songs uninterrupted from the top of the chart on down.


	Swift was already the only artist ever to hold the Hot 100's entire top 10 and now achieves the feat for a third time. She first filled the top 10 thanks to her album Midnights in November 2022 and outpaced herself via The Tortured Poets Department in May 2024 — when she stormed the chart's top 14 positions.


	(Whereas the entirety of The Life of a Showgirl resides in the Hot 100's top 12, Midnights, along with the top 10, yielded 10 more debuts, between Nos. 13 and 45, for a total of 20 songs from the set in its debut week; The Tortured Poets Department in its first frame added another 17 debuts below the top 14 spots, from Nos. 22 to 55, making for 31 total entries from the LP.)


	With “The Fate of Ophelia,” Swift scores her 13th career Hot 100 No. 1, tying for the fourth-most over the chart's 67-year history. She also ups her count to 69 top 10s, the most among women.


	Also notably, the song blasts in with 92.5 million official U.S. streams, according to data tracker Luminate — the most for a title in a single week since official streams became the metric's sole contributor to the Hot 100 in September 2020.


	As previously reported, The Life of a Showgirl, released Oct. 3 on Republic, launches at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with the biggest week for an album, by equivalent album units and album sales, since Luminate began collecting album data electronically in 1991. Swift earns her 15th No. 1 set, passing JAY-Z for the most among soloists in the chart's 69-year archives.


	Read on for in-depth highlights of Swift's latest historic week on the Hot 100.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Oct. 18, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Oct. 14. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	Swift swoops in from Nos. 1 through 12 on the Hot 100, as the entirety of The Life of a Showgirl blocks all competition atop the chart.


	Here's a look at Swift's songs in the top 12 on the Oct. 18-dated Hot 100:




	“The Fate of Ophelia,” which arrives as the 1,184th No. 1 in the Hot 100's history, drew 92.5 million official streams and 38.5 million radio airplay audience impressions in the United States Oct. 3-9. It, like all tracks from The Life of a Showgirl, has no sales counting toward the list, as they were not available for purchase individually during the album's first week of release.


	The single is Swift's 10th leader on the Streaming Songs chart, the most among women (and second overall only to Drake's 21). On Radio Songs, it debuts as her 22nd top 10 at No. 7; it's just the fifth song to start in the top 10 since the ranking began measuring all-format airplay in December 1998, joining Rihanna's “Lift Me Up” (No. 6, 2022); Adele's “Easy on Me” (No. 4, 2021); Lady Gaga's “Born This Way” (No. 6, 2011); and Janet Jackson's “All for You” (No. 9, 2001).


	The start of “The Fate of Ophelia” (whose official video premiered Oct. 5) with 92.5 million streams marks the top total for a song in a single week since all YouTube user-generated content (UGC) was removed from chart calculations in 2020. The sum surpasses the 76.4 million streams that Post Malone's “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, drew in its first week (May 25, 2024).


	Meanwhile, cuts from The Life of a Showgirl hold the nine biggest weekly streaming totals of 2025, excluding holiday fare, from “The Fate of Ophelia” through the title track, which drew 49.1 million streams. Prior leader “Not Like Us” by Kendrick Lamar now ranks 10th, with 49 million (Feb. 22). Combined, the 12 tracks on The Life of a Showgirl collected 679 million official streams Oct. 3-9.


	Plus, each of the 12 songs from The Life of a Showgirl totaled at least 1.1 million in airplay audience, from “The Fate of Ophelia” through “Eldest Daughter.” Cumulatively, they rang up 68.5 million in radio reach.


	Swelling her count to a signature 13 Hot 100 No. 1s, Swift ties Drake and Michael Jackson for the fourth-most leaders in the chart's history; she breaks out of a tie with Madonna and the Supremes. Among women, only Mariah Carey (19) and Rihanna (14) have more.


Most Billboard Hot 100 No. 1s:


	Here's a recap of Swift's 13 Hot 100 No. 1s (with debuts atop the chart noted with *):




	Now with eight No. 1 Hot 100 debuts, Swift passes Ariana Grande for the most among women. Overall, only Drake has more (nine).


	Plus, Swift pushes her total to eight Hot 100 No. 1s in the 2020s, one-upping Drake for the most this decade. BTS and Grande follow with six No. 1s each in the ‘20s.


	As “The Fate of Ophelia” towers over the Hot 100, Swift extends her record streak to nine consecutive albums of all-new music (excluding rerecorded projects) housing at least one Hot 100 No. 1.


	Here's a rundown:




	Adding 10 new Hot 100 top 10s, Swift boosts her career total from 59 to 69, the most among women.


Most Billboard Hot 100 Top 10s:


	Of Swift's 69 Hot 100 top 10s, 30 are from her three most recent studio albums of all-new material, with The Life of a Showgirl joining The Tortured Poets Department and Midnights in spinning off a record 10 top 10s each.


	Swift also lifts her career sums to 177 top 40 hits (trailing only Drake's 218) and 276 overall appearances (second to Drake's 361).


	Swift co-wrote and co-produced “The Fate of Ophelia” with Max Martin and Shellback. She has now co-written 13 Hot 100 No. 1s and co-produced seven.


	Martin adds his 28th Hot 100 No. 1 as a songwriter, second only to Paul McCartney's 32. Martin tallies his record-extending 26th No. 1 as a producer.


	Shellback notches his 11th Hot 100 leader as a writer and 10th as a producer.


	Amid Swift's top 10 Tay-keover, the Hot 100 histories of Sabrina Carpenter and the late George Michael add new honors.


	As featured on “The Life of a Showgirl,” Carpenter collects her sixth Hot 100 top 10. It's her third this year, following her own “Manchild” (No. 1, one week, June) and “Tears” (No. 3, September), both from her latest album, Man's Best Friend.


	Swift's “Father Figure” interpolates Michael's song of the same name, which topped the Hot 100 for two weeks in 1988, following its release on his album Faith. The new track is his 22nd top 10 as a writer, with “Father Figure” previously sampled in P.M. Dawn's top 10 hit “Looking Through Patient Eyes” (No. 6, 1993).


	Below Swift's haul on the Hot 100, HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from Netflix's record-breaking animated movie KPop Demon Hunters, is the list's highest-charting hit, falling to No. 13 after eight weeks at No. 1. “Golden” tops Digital Song Sales for a fourth week (7,000, up 19%, boosted by the trio's appearances on NBC's Saturday Night Live Oct. 4 and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Oct 7.)


	At No. 14 on the Hot 100, Alex Warren's former 10-week leader “Ordinary” drops from No. 2, while ruling Radio Songs for a 17th week, up 1% to 77.4 million in audience — a new weekly best for the track and the most for any song in more than a year, since Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (78.2 million) on the Oct. 5, 2024, chart.

Bradley Cooper is an actor's director. That was made abundantly clear at a press conference for his new movie Is This Thing On?, premiering as the closing night selection for the New York Film Festival, as his performers spoke effusively about how the closeness of Cooper's camera, the flow of the film's shoot, and indie ethos combined to create a feeling of the performers and filmmakers working together as “one big organism,” as Laura Dern put it. Is This Thing On? also marks the first time that Cooper has exercised these techniques for leads that don't include himself. Cooper's supporting part in the movie as a bearded, secondary goofball suggests that, in addition to writing and directing, he's also held the ambition to steal parts away from Jason Mantzoukas. His character is also an actor.

The film's leads, however, actually drift away from the showbiz environment of Cooper's first two big-swing features. One of the very first things we learn about Alex Novak (Will Arnett) as the movie opens is that he's heading toward divorce from his wife Tess (Laura Dern). That information crystallizes far sooner than what it is that either of them does for a living, or how old their two children are. They're both 10—not born at the same time but “Irish twins,” which is something we learn from Alex's stand-up routine. Comedy is not, however, Alex's actual profession; he has some kind of nebulous finance job that's supposed to be beside the point of his journey, but reads a little like Cooper saying, “I don't know, people have jobs with money, right?” Alex tries out stand-up on a whim, supposedly to avoid the $15 cover charge at a bar where he just wants to drown a little of his post-split misery. (He's living nearby in that reverse-NYC miracle, an apartment described as shabby but actually pretty nice, while Tess stays in the suburbs.)

Alex is believably shaky his first time up at an open mic. But he also shows enough of a glimmer of talent, and bares just enough of his soul through a couple of divorce jokes, to suggest a creative breakthrough that's been a long time coming, whether he realized it or not. He goes back for another shot of that adrenaline, and Cooper smartly depicts how intoxicating even a moderate hit of crowd approval can be under the right circumstances. Working from a screenplay he and Arnett wrote with Mark Chappell, inspired by English comedian John Bishop, Cooper doesn't throw Alex into a Star Is Born-style rags-to-riches story (not least because Alex is, by most standards, already rich). He doesn't even quit his job to pursue comedy, and it's neat to see Cooper working in a less operatic tone, his self-consciously artsy flourishes in support of a story that doesn't announce its own sober-faced importance. The casting of Arnett matches this scale-down perfectly; he's naturally funny, yet has enough human frailty to believably play a guy who's more of a promising talent than a comedic supernova.

Cooper also seems mindful of the potential limits of another story where a middle-aged guy finds his spark again, if not fully certain how to turn Is This Thing On? into his desired marriage story. Tess gets her own storyline, sort of, where she belatedly reclaims some of her lost satisfaction by coaching volleyball, the sport she once played at an Olympic level. But her coaching journey doesn't have the equivalents of crowded following shots or intimate close-ups in the bustle of the Comedy Cellar on a busy night. It's mostly an unexplained decade-plus delay in Tess realizing that, hey, sometimes former athletes turn to coaching, and then finding instant success in her new field.

As insufferable as it might have been to eavesdrop on too many real-life comics plying their trade alongside and offering insider wisdom to Arnett's enthusiastic newbie, that milieu is also where Is This Thing On? feels most electric, even unpredictable once it's clear, early on, that this won't end with Alex getting that Tonight Show gig. When it turns back to the complicated dynamic between Alex and Tess, Arnett and Dern are both excellent. (Somewhat perversely, Arnett might get more credit just for being an often-comic actor holding his own opposite an always-great Oscar winner.) What Cooper has to say about the thorniness of marriage, children, and the difficulties of basic human happiness, though, feels a little murky, and not in a rife-with-rich-ambiguities sort of way. Is This Thing On? obviously prides itself in dropping into the action without a lot of exposition, yet Cooper can't resist circling back for some arguments that fill in those missing details.

At their most clamorous, the family conflicts taste like warmed-over David O. Russell leftovers, without reaching the rococo heights of those films' wigged-out performances (including Cooper's in several of them). The lack of genuine messiness makes this one of several recent movies that guides characters through narratives like a therapy session, complete with an end-of-session mixture of neatness and ellipses, along with a sense that the supporting characters are just fodder for intense discussion rather than recognizable humans. Is This Thing On? might come to its healing from an appropriately modest place, but there's still a bit of actorly grandiosity under its skin.

The Grammy-nominated MC speaks with Billboard about his Def Jam debut and maintaining longevity in the rap game. 


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



	In 2025, a lot is going on in the world at any given moment — and Wale has prepped an apt soundtrack for that phenomenon. On Nov. 14, the Grammy-nominated D.C. rapper will release his eighth studio album, Everything Is a Lot, via Def Jam.


	The Billboard chart-topping MC's new album promises to tackle the myriad stresses, life developments and global pressures he's encountered in the four years since his last studio LP, 2021's Folarin II. That album, a sequel to his career-shifting 2012 mixtape of the same name, housed the J. Cole-assisted “Poke It Out,” Wale's most recent Billboard Hot 100 entry (No. 73).

	











	“One of the underlying things is how heavy everything is in the world around me, my personal life, and the industry,” he exclusively told Billboard. “I carried all of that with me and got it out of my system through this project.” 


	With an expansive soundscape courtesy of producers such as BNYX, Salaam Remi, Kel-P Vibes, Go Grizz, Streetrunner, Emil and Genio, EIA will include bluesy lead single “Blanco,” which Wale debuted live at Dreamville earlier this year, and “Where to Start,” which samples SWV's classic 1992 hit “I'm So Into You.” The 16-track set, recorded primarily in London and Los Angeles, will also feature genre-bending collaborations with a yet-to-be-revealed roster that includes buzzy names across R&B, hip-hop and Afrobeats.




Everything Is a Lot also serves as Wale's first full-length release under Def Jam, following six albums and over a decade with Rick Ross' Maybach Music Group, an imprint of Warner Records. During that stint, Wale followed up his 2009 Attention Deficit debut studio album with four Billboard 200 top 10 projects, including the No. 1 albums The Gifted (2013) and The Album About Nothing (2015). After a semi-public falling out with MMG, particularly with Meek Mill, Wale signed with Def Jam in 2023, marking a new chapter in his two-decade career. “The industry is a completely different place than it was four years ago,” he reflects. “They had a purge, and a lot of people lost their jobs.”


	Across Everything Is a Lot, Wale's primary goal was “to express a certain level of vulnerability.” To do so, he leaned on soulful samples and bluesy Western influences, the latter of which shine through on “Blanco,” the first song he completed for the forthcoming LP. “It's never as contrived as people think,” he says of the album's varied production and strikingly honest tracks like “Lonely.” “If I'm in the mood to write something, I just get to it. It's all about capturing that feeling in the moment.” On “Fly Away,” Wale samples Maxwell's classic, Grammy-winning “Pretty Wings” for a moving number about “abandonment and attachment issues,” underscoring his commitment to confronting discomfort on the record.


	“It's always been hard to keep people's attention,” Wale says. “That's why my first album is called Attention Deficit. It's become increasingly harder in this day and age, where fans are rewiring themselves to only like what the algorithm tells them to like. It's an uphill battle, so it's a blessing to be in the conversation still.”

	When life gives you lemons … sometimes you end up at a lemonade stand watching a sock puppet show. On Monday, Louis Tomlinson dropped the trippy video for his new single “Lemonade,” which sees him losing it a bit under the scorching sun.


	“She got me wakin' at times that I've never seen/Bright yellow spaceship might make me start to believe,” Tomlinson sings on the track. “Symptoms are stuck on repeat, no point in tryin' to leave/She got me wakin', it's doin' somethin' to me.”


	The video follows Tomlinson sweating through a photo shoot before deciding he's had enough of the heat. In a haze, he stumbles into a surreal estate and finds himself surrounded by lemon-yellow, otherworldly figures who guide him to a bizarre sock-puppet show. Eventually, he snaps out of the trance and dives fully clothed into a pool, finding clarity and escaping the craziness.


	“The most important thing was for the first single to sound ambitious sonically. It had to be big and fun,” he previously said of the single. “To me, ‘Lemonade' really has instant and natural personality. It ended up being the perfect way to begin this chapter.”

	Earlier this month, Tomlinson announced his 2026 How Did We Get Here? World Tour in celebration of his upcoming album How Did I Get Here?. The arena tour features stops at Madison Square Garden in New York, Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and the Moody Center in Austin.

	











	 “I sum up it as ‘The record I always deserved to make,'” Tomlinson said in a statement while announcing his album. “My bread and butter is my honesty. I genuinely wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope it comes through in the music.… For the first time now, I'm allowing myself to be the artist I'd always hoped to be.”

Even a Magic 8 Ball couldn't have seen this one coming. “The Sixth Sense” director M. Night Shyamalan is set to direct a series for Mattel Studios based on its Magic 8 Ball toy. 

In an Instagram post announcing the project — certainly a twist from one of the masters of them if there ever was one — Shyamalan said he's been “working on this for a couple years.” 

Brad Falchuk, known as a writer on “Glee,” “American Horror Story,” and “Pose,” is serving as the writer, co-creator, and co-showrunner of the series, and it's currently in development. The live-action series is being described by Mattel as meant to place Magic 8 Ball “as the centerpiece of a high-concept, character-driven supernatural drama that blends psychological intensity with cultural intrigue.”

That actually signals to us that this is not strictly a kids series based on a toy. In fact, there were a lot of skeptics when “Barbie” was first put into development by Mattel. So would “Magic 8 Ball” have an equal chance of surprising audiences, blending some shameless commercialism with a highly talented auteur director?

If we asked the Magic 8 Ball, we think it might say “Reply hazy, try again.” 

Since “Barbie” opened in 2023, Mattel and chief Robbie Brenner have been kicking around a number of different films and series, many of which have yet to materialize. In post-production now are “Masters of the Universe” from Laika filmmaker Travis Knight, which is a live-action film that brings the He-Man and Skeletor characters to life and is set at Amazon MGM, and also “Matchbox,” which is an action film set at Apple based on the toy cars that stars John Cena. 

But there's a number of others that are in early stages that have us asking the Magic 8 Ball for some guidance. There's an “American Girl” series that sounds an awful lot like a recent “SNL” sketch, a live-action “Barney” movie that originally had Daniel Kaluuya attached but is now being written by Ayo Edebiri, Jon M. Chu and J.J. Abrams' “Hot Wheels” movie, “Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots” with Vin Diesel, “Polly Pocket” starring Lily Collins and produced by Reese Witherspoon after Lena Dunham exited, and at one point a “Thomas & Friends” movie that was meant to be directed by Marc Forster, to name just a few.

It's hard to not point to Martin Scorsese directing the “Kool-Aid” movie on “The Studio” and just write this off, but Mattel with “Barbie” quickly proved to be the test case other companies are looking to when it comes to pairing brands with entertainment in more subtle ways. 

 










For Shyamalan, this marks his return to TV after directing and EP'ing “Servant” for Apple, and his last film was “Trap,” which grossed $84 million worldwide. Not counting something like “Glass” that is a sequel to “Unbreakable,” you'd have to go all the way back to “The Last Airbender” in 2010 to find an example where Shyamalan was a director-for-hire working on some existing IP. That movie made $320 million but would be safe to say it was not among his better films.

Gigi Hadid just proved she's boyfriend Bradley Cooper's biggest fan. The 30-year-old supermodel skipped the red carpet but still found a heartfelt way to celebrate her boyfriend at the October 10 premiere of his new film “Is This Thing On?”

“Premiere night! Congratulations to my love!” Hadid wrote on her Instagram Stories, sharing a photo of a large TV playing the film, as reported by E! Online. She also congratulated stars Laura Dern, Will Arnett, Andra Day, and “the whole crew.”

Hadid and Cooper, who have quietly been together for nearly two years, rarely share glimpses of their relationship. Her loving message was a rare and touching show of support that delighted fans.

Cooper, 50, revealed that his 8-year-old daughter, Lea, whom he shares with ex Irina Shayk, has become a big part of his creative process.

“She's part of it,” he told E! News at the 63rd New York Film Festival. “I was making A Star Is Born when she was born, and then Maestro, she's in. There's nothing weird about it. It's just part of what we do, and it's kind of a nice thing.”

Cooper added that Lea even helps him with casting decisions. “Kids, they say exactly what they think, and she has a big opinion about everything. I love it and I care what she thinks. Even with casting, we'll look at auditions together.”

Hadid recently opened up about how Cooper's creative spirit has inspired her to take more risks. The mom of one auditioned for Rapunzel in Disney's live-action Tangled, telling Vogue, “I was really proud of my scene. I knew they were going to go with a real singer.”

“I respect him so much as a creative,” Hadid added. “He gives me so much encouragement and belief. For those people you admire to encourage you, it can create so much belief in yourself. You just take the leap.”

The couple confirmed their romance in early 2024 when they were spotted holding hands in London. Weeks later, they celebrated Valentine's Day in New York City, walking arm-in-arm in matching outfits.

Cooper later supported Hadid at her Guest in Residence boutique in February, proudly standing by her side.

Now, as the two continue to balance busy careers and parenthood, they continue to show support for each other.

New Paramount chief David Ellison has “resting just checked into the White Lotus face,” but that's not even close to the most off-putting thing about him, according to John Oliver. The CEO promised to root out DEI at the company and installed a conservative ombudsman to evaluate “bias” in CBS' news coverage, but he didn't stop there. Recently, Ellison made the decision to buy controversial ex-New York Times columnist Bari Weiss' The Free Press for $150 million and instill its founder as CBS News' new editor-in-chief. It's a move Oliver wasn't thrilled about, to say the very least. It galled the Last Week Tonight host so much, in fact, that he spent almost his entire 30-plus minute monologue ragging on everything from her “self-aggrandizing” description of her resignation from The New York Times as a moment “heard 'round the world” to her egregious mis-characterization of Manhattan's Upper West Side as merely “Seinfeld territory.” (“It's the site of many other cultural touchstones!”)

Pivoting to address the gravity of the issue at hand, Oliver then spent a large chunk of his monologue pointing out a number of the ways The Free Press‘ stories—including impactful posts like an article alleging malnourished kids in Gaza were suffering from pre-existing health conditions other than starvation and another that made refuted claims about the families of trans youth—don't hold up to journalistic scrutiny in their general mission to suggest that “the left has gone too far.” (“I am not saying the left never goes too far or is immune from criticism at all,” Oliver qualified. “But it can sometimes feel like The Free Press‘ conclusions can get out ahead of its evidence.”)

“The truth is, we wouldn't even have done this story were it not for the fact that Bari Weiss has just been named editor-in-chief of CBS News. And that feels different,” Oliver continued. “Because there are many opinion-heavy outlets out there, from left to right, and with low to high editorial standards. This show is, among other things, an opinion outlet. And while our staff works incredibly hard to research stories before we write something and vigorously check our facts afterwards, we're also not the news.” Oliver wouldn't want anyone running a “pure opinion outlet”—even someone he agreed with—to suddenly have control of the editorial direction of Face The Nation, 60 Minutes, and more, “but it is especially alarming to have someone doing it who has spent years putting out work that—in my opinion—is at best, irresponsible, and at worst, deeply misleading.” 

And even that perhaps isn't the worst thing Ellison has done. “It is not just about Bari Weiss being at CBS. It is about the fact that CBS is now under the control of someone who thinks that she and her editorial sensibility make her a good fit for the job, and who, incidentally, is now preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, home of CNN and, uh-oh, HBO. Which isn't ideal,” Oliver continued of Ellison's reported attempt to absorb his home network.

“It is worth keeping an eye out for subtle changes there, because while I'm sure many of CBS News' good journalists will continue to do great work, if you start seeing people resigning or getting fired, or you start seeing stories that seem off in some way, especially if it involves the left going too far on a topic Bari Weiss cares about, it's worth asking yourself why that might be,” he concluded. “Because unfortunately, the much bigger answer might be that a billionaire has chosen to inject contrarian, right-leaning opinion journalism into an American icon.”

As Hallmark Channel premieres “Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at C” on October 12, 2025, sleuthers are likely hoping that the second movie in the franchise isn't the last. 

Good news! It appears two more “Haunted Harmony Mysteries” starring Tamera Mowry-Housley, Marco Grazzini, and Risteard Cooper are on the way — with one movie already filmed and another filming now in Ireland. That means the gap between movies shouldn't be nearly as long as the two years between the first, 2023's “Murder in G Major,” and the latest installment. 

While promoting “Buried at C” with Grazzini, Mowry-Housley let it slip during an interview with “Good Day Sacramento” on October 8 that they were in Ireland filming a fourth movie. 

When she, Grazzini, and Cooper returned to Ireland in early 2025 to film “Buried at C,” there was plenty of time on their shoot schedule to film a third installment — though it's not clear what it will be called or when it will be released. 

According to Ireland's Screen Crew and Services Database, the cast and crew were scheduled to film for more than two months, from February 4 to April 11, in Dublin and in picturesque Wicklow, located about 30 miles south of the city. Given that most Hallmark movies stick to a 15-day production schedule, the cast and crew were able to film two new movies based on Alexia Gordon's Gethsemane Brown Mysteries five-book series. 

In the first “Haunted Harmony Mysteries,” we meett main character Gethsemane, a former orchestra conductor living in Ireland to teach at a boarding school, St. Brendan's, where she's tasked with turning a motley group of students into an award-winning chorus.

However, when she keeps hearing the same four notes playing in the old Irish house where she's staying, she discovers it's the ghost of one of her music idols, a songwriter-musician, Eamon (played by Cooper), who perished years before in a mysterious murder-suicide.

Able to see his spirit, Gethsemane reluctantly starts working with him to try to solve the mystery and clear his name. She gets assistance from local Inspector O'Reilly, played by Adam Fergus, and her teaching colleague Griff (played by Hallmark fan favorite and “Virgin River” actor Grazzini.).

A post shared by tameramowryhousley (@tameramowrytwo)

In the synopsis for “Buried at C,” Hallmark says, “Beloved music teacher Gethsemane Brown returns to solve a new case that hits a little too close to home when her brother, Jackson, is implicated in the murder of local troublemaker Ray.” 

The logline continues, “Gethsemane and spirited partner Eamon join forces with Captain Mac, now a ghost after Ray killed him to cover up the theft of a violin recovered from the Titanic. As the investigation progresses, Gethsemane dives into a tangled web of secrets, stolen artifacts, and family drama to clear her brother's name, all while navigating her own romantic entanglements.” 

“Haunted Harmony Mysteries: Buried at Sea” premieres on October 12 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream via Hallmark+ the following day. 

Love Haunted Harmony Mysteries.
So happy that it is not a syrupy, smoochy movie. We all know Hallmark has the same basic
foundation. Girl attracted, then overhears conversation with his old sweetheart, but not the rest
of the story. OR girl on a stepladder, slips into his arms, their eyes meet and you know the rest.
Let's face it, that is not “Real Life”. If you've seen one, you know how it will go.
Soooo it is refreshing to see something entirely different. Love the interaction of “who done it “
And absolutely love the part of the ghost, that she can see. It stays to format of a mystery.
Thank you Hallmark  🙏🦋♥️

Whitney Cummings knew addressing the topic of the Riyadh Comedy Festival on her podcast would generate headlines—”You know what, I don't think I need to address it, you guys got it all figured out,” she said sarcastically on the latest episode of Good For You. “I guess I'm this weirdo, I don't operate under the idea that every government and their people are the same.” The comedian went on to accuse critics of the festival of ignorance and hypocrisy. “It's just racism,” she said, suggesting the backlash was only because the festival took place in the Middle East.

Separating the audience from the regime is a tact several of the other comedians on the Riyadh lineup have taken, including Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari. Bill Burr characterized the backlash against him as people saying, “How dare you go to that place and make those oppressed people laugh, you fucking piece of shit. I can't believe you went to that place. I can't find it on a map, and this bot said I was upset about it so now I am.” Yet the criticism was less about doing comedy for an audience of Saudi citizens and more about taking money directly from the Saudi Arabian government for an event that Human Rights Watch says “whitewashes” the abuses perpetrated by that government.

But Cummings had an answer for that, and an answer to the criticism of Riyadh coming from within the comedy world. “By the way, any comic that has ever worked with Live Nation—which is all of them—has taken Saudi money, but keep with your little rants,” she said. “When you get a sec, google ‘Saudi Arabia Live Nation' so you can be informed on the fact that anyone who has worked with Live Nation, every stand-up comic, has taken Saudi money. … Or bought a ticket through Live Nation, went to a Live Nation event, all the actors who are represented by William Morris Agency, which is all of them. If you want to send them notes too.” 

Cummings has become more political (and, often, more right-leaning) in her material recently. Her New Year's set on CNN touched on several conspiracy theories, including bits about the Pfizer vaccine and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. After the death of Charlie Kirk, she posted on Twitter/X that the shooter “could have done it privately but chose to do it publicly in front of kids. If you are happy about this you're also pro child trauma.” It's unclear if she was joking or sincere, but either way, the post garnered backlash. 

“I'm trying to help you sound less racist,” Cummings shot back at her critics. She described those who took issue with her participation in the Riyadh Comedy Festival as nepo babies (“People whose dads have points on huge television shows are like, ‘I have a backup plan, a huge trust fund, you're a sellout for making money'”), comics who wish they were invited to the festival, and “the same people who are like, if they found out a Fox journalist was murdered, they would truly throw a party.”

Diane Keaton and Al Pacino met while filming the 1972 classic “The Godfather.” He played Michael Corleone. She was Kay Adams-Corleone, his on-screen wife. What started as cinematic chemistry soon turned into a real romance that captivated Hollywood. They began dating in 1971 and spent more than a decade in an on-and-off relationship defined by passion, respect, and creative connection. 

But Keaton wanted something lasting. When Pacino never proposed, she made the painful choice to walk away in 1987.

In interviews over the years, Keaton often described Pacino as the great love of her life, while friends now say the feeling was mutual.

Following Keaton's passing on October 11 at age 79, a close friend of Pacino's revealed to the Daily Mail that the actor had been deeply affected by her death.

“Looking back, Al admits the love of his life was Diane, who he's always called ‘an amazing woman,'” the source said. “I know he will forever regret he didn't make his move when he had the chance.”

The insider added, “For years after he and Diane split, Al used to say, ‘If it's meant to be, it's never too late for a do-over.' But sadly, now it is.”

Though they both lived in Beverly Hills for years, Pacino and Keaton reportedly hadn't spoken in a long time before her death.

“Though he and Diane both lived only a few miles from each other for years, they never spoke,” the source explained. “I once asked him why, and he told me, ‘There's no need to talk with each other. We said everything that needed to be said at the time.”

Despite the silence between them, those close to Pacino say his affection for Keaton never truly faded.

Now 85, Pacino remains one of Hollywood's most celebrated stars. Though he has dated many women and raised three children, marriage was something he never pursued.

Keaton also followed her own path, embracing independence while raising her two adopted children, Dexter and Duke, with love and quiet strength.

Their story, filled with romance, respect, and reflection, became one of Hollywood's most timeless connections. It was a love that shaped them both, even long after it ended. “She was his equal in every way,” a close friend shared. “And he knew it.”

A life lesson…DON'T deny true love.  Embrace it, feed it, let it grow deeper than the roots of the largest tree.

Hollywood stars are mourning the loss of Diane Keaton, who passed away on October 11, 2025. Keaton's “The Godfather Part II” costar Robert De Niro released a statement following the actress' death.

A post shared by Francis Ford Coppola (@francisfordcoppola)

Following the news of Keaton's passing at age 79, De Niro shared a statement with The Hollywood Reporter.

“I am very sad to hear of Diane's passing. I was very fond of her and the news of her leaving us has taken me totally by surprise,” De Niro's statement read.

“I was not expecting her to leave us. She will be missed,” the actor added. “May she rest in peace.”

Keaton starred in “The Godfather” trilogy, costarring with De Niro in “The Godfather Part II” (1974). The two were also costars in “Marvin's Room” (1996) and “The Big Wedding” (2013).

“The Godfather” trilogy director, Francis Ford Coppola, posted a touching tribute to Keaton in an October 12 Instagram post.

“Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful. From her earliest performances in ‘Hair' and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor,” Coppola wrote.

The director continued, “I saw her in the film ‘Lovers and Other Strangers' and knew I had to have her play Kay in ‘The Godfather,' (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in ‘Annie Hall' while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend.”

Coppola added, “Everything about Diane was creativity personified.”

A post shared by Goldie Hawn (@goldiehawn)

There have been a flood of tributes for Keaton from her many co-stars, including “The First Wives Club” stars Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn.

Midler wrote in her tribute, posted on Instagram: “The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me. She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star.”

The actress added, “What you saw was who she was … oh, la, lala!”

Hawn also shared a heartfelt tribute to Keaton on Instagram. “Diane, we aren't ready to lose you. You've left us with a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination,” she wrote.

The actress continued, “How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you can't tell me to ‘shut up' honey. There was, and will be, no one like you.”

Hawn noted, “You stole the hearts of the world and shared your genius with millions, making films that made us laugh and cry in ways only you could. I was blessed to make ‘First Wives Club' with you, our days starting with coffee in the makeup trailer, laughing and joking, right through to the very last day of filming. It was a roller coaster of love.”

The actress also revealed their hope to live together in the future. “We agreed to grow old together, and one day, maybe live together with all our girlfriends,” she wrote. “Well, we never got to live together, but we did grow older together. Who knows … maybe in the next life.”

Hawn added, “Shine your fairy dust up there, girlfriend. I'm going to miss the hell out of you. My heart goes out to your beautiful children, Dex and Duke. I love you.”

Diane Keaton was last seen out in 2024, nearly a year before her family confirmed her passing in California. The Oscar winner was spotted doing some holiday shopping in Los Angeles, one of her final public outings before stepping away from the spotlight.

A post shared by El Placer de la Belleza (@placerbelleza)

That day, Keaton looked radiant and relaxed, dressed in her signature style: a black turtleneck, boxy gray trousers, a dark blazer, and her trademark bowler hat and round glasses. She smiled warmly and waved to fans as she strolled through the shops, exuding the same effortless grace and charm that had defined her for decades.

The rare sighting delighted admirers who had missed seeing the beloved actress in public.

In her later years, Keaton had chosen a quieter, more private life, focusing on her passions, family, and the simple joys that brought her peace.

Before her 2024 Los Angeles sighting, Keaton's previous public appearance was at the 2023 U.S. Open Tennis Championships in New York City. She was photographed enjoying the final match between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka while sitting alongside actress Ariana DeBose.

As always, her fashion sense stood out. She wore white trousers, a black-and-white striped blouse, a dark blazer, and her trademark hat. Keaton sipped a drink while chatting and cheering, radiating her usual effortless charm.

The sighting became a fan favorite online, with many admiring how timeless her sense of style remained after decades in Hollywood.

Even as she lived a more private life, Diane Keaton's love for fashion never waned. In a 2021 interview with Interview magazine, she explained why black remained her timeless color of choice.

“I think you almost always have to have a little bit of the color black to frame things,” she said. “It really sucks you in. I'm always going to love black because it highlights. It accentuates. It's beautiful. Whatever.”

Her signature style included crisp suits, bowler hats, and oversized glasses, which became as iconic as her performances in “Annie Hall” and “Something's Gotta Give.” 

Effortlessly blending quirk and sophistication, Keaton turned her fashion sense into an extension of her artistry, inspiring generations who admired her authenticity and confidence.

In her later years, Keaton spoke often about what truly brought her peace: nature, friendship, and quiet moments. During her Interview chat, close friend Carol Kane asked what she valued most, and Keaton's answer reflected her grounded spirit.

“I value a very strong friendship, like ours, which I've depended on for such a long time,” she said. “I love to walk with my dog. These are the things I love. And I really do love nature. I love exploring California. I like driving to Arizona. I really enjoy seeing. I guess my favorite thing in life is the fact that I can see. It's just so unbelievable.”

Even as she stepped away from the spotlight, Keaton continued to work behind the scenes. At the time of her passing, she had three projects in development: Artist in Residence with Josh Hutcherson, The Making Of with Blake Lively, and Constance, directed by Mark Pellington.

Even though the theatrical event of 2025 — if not the year's true moment of poetic cinema — has come and gone, IndieWire must continue being a website and writing about obvious things like the VistaVision print of “One Battle After Another.” But it is worth reflecting on the former, by which we, of course, mean the limited theatrical run of The Onion mockumentary, “Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile.” 

The 20-minute short is now available for any American idiot to watch YouTube, but the team at the Onion recently screened it, along with the classic Onion limited series “Sex House,” in over 25 independent theaters across the country, from Birmingham, Alabama, to Duluth, Minnesota, and beyond.

The success of the one-night-only, self-described “Historic Cinematic Night of Film at the Movies” speaks not just to the credibility of America's Finest News Source, but of the increasing ease with which projects and exhibitors can directly collaborate to get around the usual film distribution channels — and any risk-aversion that may or may not come with them.  

 










Over the summer, The Onion team observed the staying power of the Epstein files as a news story and decided to commit the whole of their Onion News Network resources to creating a mockumentary around it and trying to make that film as big, ambitious, and wildly funny as the Chicago-based satire team could. The script came together in a matter of days. “I remember walking into the writers' room and seeing [the outline of the film]. On [beat] number eight or nine, it said ‘He went to heaven' with a frowny face. That's when I knew it was gonna be truly great,” Onion CEO Ben Collins told IndieWire. 

They'd even secured release for the short mockumentary through a major distributor. But in the wake of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, the distributor decided to walk away from the project. “Their PR team [must have] refused to watch the movie because they kept asking if Donald Trump was in it. And we were like, ‘Yeah. But he's on the Knicks.' Like, it's not [real]… I think it's weird that you would see the name ‘Jeffrey Epstein' and immediately associate it with the president and all of his friends. But it is what it is,” Collins said. 

Luckily for The Onion team, they didn't have to leave one of their most ambitious video projects at “it is what it is.” CMO Leila Brillson was determined to pursue independent theatrical screenings, partnering with indie theaters across the country. “What's exciting about this process is that it was a bummer to find ourselves holding the bag on something, but we also created our own pipeline, which was really exciting. We created our own relationships with these theaters that we were able to pump this out without relying on anyone except the technology that exists to send this to each other,” Brillson told IndieWire.     

 










It was as simple as emailing jeffreyepstein@theonion.com for independent theaters to request the DCP (Digital Cinema Package, the kind of file used to play movies on digital projectors) on Friday, October 2. Both Onion CEO Ben Collins and CMO Leila Brillson told IndieWire they were blown away by the response and by what building their own distribution pipeline could unlock for The Onion in the future. 

“There is a feeling that there's not a lot to rally around right now. Providing that kind of catharsis is so important to our readers and our audience. And once we took a look at this thing and laughed our faces off, we knew we had the opportunity to bring people together and have a rallying cry, flashpoint moment that we can point to this single, particular date and give people something they can all go to as a group,” Brillson said. 

Once The Onion team put out the call, they found out they had friends (with access to independent theaters) everywhere. “Within 24 hours, we had dozens of requests all throughout the world to show this thing locally,” Collins said. “We're letting [the indie theaters] keep the gate. We're letting them donate it to charity, do whatever they want to do with it. We're doing it exclusively so people see the film and to support a difficult ride indie theaters [have had] in the last few years as well.” 

 










“Three cities in Missouri are screening this film, and I just think that's really exciting and really speaks to the pockets of interest that you kind of forget about when you're subsumed into this mass mediated space,” Brillson added. “But there are people who are ready to watch something like this that is a little out of left field.” 

The motto of The Onion is “Tu stultus es” (roughly, “You are stupid”), but both Brillson and Collins told IndieWire that screening something like “Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile” proves you don't have to over-engineer “content” to be value-neutral slop in order to garner an audience, whatever the demographic breakdown. 

“I actually say this all the time to Ben — because there is that anti-woke crowd that is so loud, we feel like there's this massive shift and we are watching theater chains and people making the economic decisions — marketers, media buyers, whoever — make this huge shift to the right. And you know, it doesn't make a tremendous amount of economic sense,” Brillson said. “Actually having some values works. And the nice thing is, all of the people going to this are supporting indie theaters. They're giving their money directly to these people who get to keep it.” 

 










“The comedy that you see that's very paid for, that's very expensive? The, you know, Riyadh Comedy Festival thing that's going on? Those people have pretended to be censored and had a really hard time, like their speech is being taken away, but they're being paid millions of dollars by the richest people in the world to protect the status quo. And most people want something like [‘Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile'],” Collins added. “Actual people will drive out of their way, will beg their theaters to air something this stupid. That's where the actual populace is. That's where real America is. It's not with this other, very contrived, anti-woke thing that's been going on for the last few years.” 

As it so often is, The Onion is right — We are stupid, and the key to making good things is in figuring out how to come together with other (stupid) people. “We feel like we had a cheat code, I think, with rebuilding the newspaper last year. We had to do the same thing. We didn't even know there were middlemen that would go and make you a newspaper and cut off, you know, half your profits. We just went to the place out by O'Hare Airport that makes newspapers and asked, ‘Would you guys print something for us?,'” Collins said. “The whole thing feels kind of charmed.”

 










“Jeffrey Epstein: Bad Pedophile” is now available to stream on YouTube.

Gracie Abrams and Ed Sheeran also make cameos in the preview.

Taylor Swift may have been the lead showgirl on her global Eras Tour, but it took a lot of supporting acts — from Travis Kelce to Sabrina Carpenter — to make the trek as memorable as it was.


	That much is evident in the new trailer for the 14-time Grammy winner's six-part Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era docuseries, which dropped Monday (Oct. 13) alongside Swift's announcement for the project on Good Morning America. In the nearly two-minute preview, fans get a glimpse at how present her now-fiancé was behind the scenes, at one point crouching underneath the stage and grinning wide as the pop star bends down and kisses him on the cheek. 

	











	In other parts of the trailer, we see how Swift and Kelce rehearsed his cameo at one of the Eras shows in London last year. In a dressing room, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end concentrates while practicing carrying his then-girlfriend during the Tortured Poets Department section of the three-hour show, with the scene cutting to the couple re-enacting it in full costume on stage.




	The teaser also gives Swifties a look at how several other celebrity drop-ins came together on the Eras Tour, which kicked off in March 2023 and wrapped last December. At one point, Gracie Abrams giggles with Swift behind the scenes, while Carpenter appears in a t-shirt and sits on a couch as the trek's headliner practices guitar. Both Abrams and Carpenter served as openers on different legs of the tour and joined Swift for surprise duets later in the tour.


	Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch also made cameos at different points on the tour, and both appear alongside Swift in revealing rehearsal footage in the trailer. There are also shots of the countless members of Swift's band, dance troupe and stage crew hard at work setting up the show night after night, along with her parents, Scott and Andrea Swift, who are frequently seen smiling and laughing with their daughter.


	“People like to talk about phenomenons,” Swift says in a voiceover. “Almost as if it were pieces falling into place — as if it just happened. The Eras Tour wasn't when all the pieces fell into place. This tour was just when every single one of us who had done so much work, pushing inch-by-inch, to where we all clicked together.”


	As announced Monday morning on GMA, the first two episodes of the Eras Tour docuseries will premiere Dec. 12 on Disney+. Two more episodes will arrive each week after that.


	The project comes two years after Swift's Eras Tour concert film, which pieced together footage from the singer's shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and shattered box-office records. The upcoming docuseries will be paired with an accompanying concert film capturing Swift's final Eras Tour show, which took place in Vancouver.

	











	News of the docuseries arrives just over a week after the release of The Life of a Showgirl, Swift's 12th studio album. The LP quickly obliterated records to achieve the biggest release week for an LP ever and is on track to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Watch the full trailer for Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era above.


Billboard's Live Music Summit will be held in Los Angeles on Nov. 3. For tickets and more information, head here.

The Formula One pic was the sleeper hit of the summer and is the first major box win for Apple Original Films .


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	The release date of filmmaker F1: The Movie on streamer Apple TV has finally been revealed after the sleeper hit took the summer box office by storm on its way to becoming the the top-grossing sports film of all time, among other records. It's also the first major theatrical win for the tech giant's movie division.


	Directed by Joseph Kosinski and starring Brad Pitt, the pic will become available on streaming service Apple TV around the globe on Dec. 12, Apple Original Films announced Monday. (Apple TV is going through a major rebranding, having previously been known as Apple TV+.)

	Legacy Hollywood studios continue to be suspicious of a streamer's commitment to a traditional theatrical window, but Apple and Amazon MGM Studios are vowing to give certain event films a proper theatrical window in hopes of boosting a movie's visibility, versus sending a title straight to streaming in hopes of luring new subscribers or stop existing subs from bolting.


	Apple Original Films certainly lived up to its word when it came to F1, which opened in theaters at the end of June and is among the top-10 grossing pics of the year with more than $629 million in worldwide ticket sales. The pic broke numerous records — including becoming the the top-grossing live-action film of Brad Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation. The earned an A CinemaScore, along with a coveted 97 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.


	“It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world embrace F1 The Movie 'in theaters,” Jerry Bruckheimer, the film's producer,” said in a statement. “Now, we're beyond excited to bring this exhilarating, cinematic ride to fans everywhere through Apple TV's unparalleled global reach. Partnering with Apple and Formula 1 has been an incredible journey, and we're proud that even more viewers, from every corner of the world, will get to experience the heart-pounding action and passion

	











	Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Kim Bodnia, and Javier Bardem also star in the big-budget tentpole, which was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competed against the titans of the sport. The film is produced by Bruckheimer, Kosinski, seven-time Formula world champion Lewis Hamilton, Pitt, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Chad Oman. Kosinski directed from a screenplay by Ehren Kruger, based on story by Kosinski and Kruger.  


	Apple Original Films partnered with Warner Bros., with the latter distributing and helping to market the film around the globe.


	Ahead of its debut on Apple TV, the film continues to be available for digital ownership on participating digital platforms, including AppleTV, Amazon Prime Video, Fandango At Home, and more. Beyond the box office, the F1 The Album soundtrack has seen 600,000 albums sold worldwide, and is nearing one billion global streams. Currently dominating Billboard's Top Movie Songs chart with seven of the top ten tracks, the album is powered by Tate McRae's two-time VMA-nominated smash hit “Just Keep Watching.” With over four billion views across short-form video platforms, the album has become a defining music moment of 2025 and a crucial part of the film's cultural impact, Apple noted in its release.

We'll find out when the Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 22.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



	With Wicked: For Good slated to open in the U.S. on Nov. 21, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande will be in the Oscar conversation for the second year in a row. Both stars were nominated earlier this year for the first Wicked – Erivo for best actress for playing Elphaba and Grande for best supporting actress for playing Galinda/Glinda.


	If they are nominated again when the nominations for the 98th annual Academy Awards are announced on Jan. 22, 2026, they will become just the seventh and eighth actors to be nominated for playing the same role in two different films.


	Moreover, they'll become the first actors to be nominated for playing the same role two years running since Bing Crosby in the mid-1940s, who received back-to-back nominations for playing genial Father Charles “Chuck” O'Malley. And they'll become only the second and third female actors to be nominated twice for the same role, following Cate Blanchett, who was nominated twice for playing Queen Elizabeth I.


	Of course, just one of the Wicked: For Good stars could be nominated, or neither. If Grande, 32, is nominated, she'll become the youngest actor to receive two nods for playing the same role in two different films in Oscar history. That record is currently held by Al Pacino, who was 34 when he was nominated for the second time for playing Michael Corleone. If Erivo, 38, is nominated, she won't set any age records, but she'll become just the second actor from England to achieve the feat, following Peter O'Toole.


	The first Wicked did well in the Oscar nominations, receiving 10 nods, including best picture. It won two awards – best costume design and best production design.


	Here's a complete list of all the actors who have received Oscar nominations for playing the same character in two different films. The years shown are the year of the film's release.


Character: Father Charles “Chuck” O'Malley


Films: Going My Way (1944) and The Bells of St. Mary's (1945)


Notes: Crosby was nominated for best actor for both films. He was nominated in that category a third and final time for 1954's The Country Girl. Going My Way won a total of seven Oscars, including best picture and best original song, for the smash hit “Swinging on a Star.” The Bells of St. Mary's was nominated for best picture. Crosby, the most popular music star of the first half of the 20th Century, died in 1977 at age 74.


Character: King Henry II


Films: Becket (1964) and The Lion in Winter (1968)


Notes: O'Toole was nominated for both actor for both films. Both films were nominated for best picture. The Englishman received eight acting nods, all in the lead actor category. In addition, he received an honorary award in 2002. He died in 2013 at age 81.


Character: Michael Corleone


Films: The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part II (1974)


Notes: Pacino was nominated for best supporting actor for The Godfather (his first nod) and best lead actor for The Godfather Part II. Both films won best picture. Pacino has received nine nominations, spanning 1972-2019. Four of those nominations are for best supporting actor, which puts him in an eight-way tie for most nods in that category with the likes of Jeff Bridges, Jack Nicholson and Mark Ruffalo. Pacino returned to the role of Michael Corleone in the trilogy's final installment, The Godfather Part III, in 1990, but he wasn't nominated.


Character: “Fast Eddie” Felson


Films: The Hustler (1961) and The Color of Money (1986)


Notes: Newman was nominated for best actor for playing pool hustler “Fast Eddie” Felson in both films, winning for The Color of Money. The Hustler was nominated for best picture. Newman received nine acting nominations, spanning 1958-2002. He was also nominated as the producer of best picture nominee Rachel, Rachel, for which his wife, Joanne Woodward, was nominated as best actress. Newman also received two honorary Oscars – an honorary award (now called a Governors Award) and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Newman died in 2008 at age 83.


Character: Queen Elizabeth I


Films: Elizabeth (1998) and Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007)


	Blanchett is the only female actor with multiple same-character nominations. The Australian was nominated for best actress for both films. Elizabeth, a best picture nominee,brought Blanchett the first of eight nominations for acting.


Character: Rocky Balboa


Films: Rocky (1976) and Creed (2015)


Notes: These are Stallone's only nominations for acting. He was nominated for best actor for Rocky and best supporting actor for Creed. He was also nominated for best original screenplay for Rocky. Stallone has the longest gap between Oscar nominations for playing the same character in two different films – 39 years. Rocky won three Oscars, including best picture. The film's theme song, Bill Conti's “Gonna Fly Now,” was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and an Oscar nominee for best original song.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Apple Original Films‘ F1, the year's highest-grossing MPA movie, is getting a global Apple TV+ streaming date of Friday, December 12.


	Not only is the movie the highest grossing original 2025 to date, but at $629 million it's the highest-grossing title for Apple Original Films and for the sports film genre.


	The Formula 1 racing movie starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski arrives in homes after a 168-day theatrical window. Warner Bros distributed the movie on behalf of Apple. F1 also marks Pitt's highest-grossing feature to date and notched an A CinemaScore and 97% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.“It's been thrilling to see audiences around the world embrace F1: The Movie in theaters,” said producer Jerry Bruckheimer. “Now, we're beyond excited to bring this exhilarating, cinematic ride to fans everywhere through Apple TV's unparalleled global reach. Partnering with Apple and Formula 1 has been an incredible journey, and we're proud that even more viewers, from every corner of the world, will get to experience the heart-pounding action and passion that defines F1.”

	











	Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, Formula 1's most promising phenom of the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, he's a nomadic racer-for-hire when he's approached by his former teammate Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of a struggling team on the verge of collapse. Ruben convinces Sonny to come back for one last shot at saving the team and being the best in the world. He'll drive alongside Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), the team's hotshot rookie intent on setting his own pace. But as the engines roar, Sonny's past catches up with him and he finds that in Formula 1, your teammate is your fiercest competition.

Paramount's initial bid for the home of HBO and Warner Bros. was dismissed, but one way or another the company will grapple with major change in the coming year.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Ever since the media mogul John Malone helped persuade David Zaslav to leave NBC and become the CEO of Discovery Communications, the executive has defined his leadership by dealmaking. He acquired Scripps Networks to try and build a reality-driven entertainment giant, and forged the deal for WarnerMedia over golf emojis with AT&T CEO John Stankey.


	But the next few months will be a critical time, as Zaslav grapples with what will be his most consequential deal yet: Does he sell? Or does he split?




Paramount CEO David Ellison has made no secret about his desire for Warner Bros. Discovery in private conversations with Hollywood power players, but his initial approach of $20 per share was dismissed by WBD, Bloomberg reported over the weekend.

	Of course Ellison, perhaps armed with a higher offer (possibly one backed by his father Larry Ellison or a third party like Apollo), will likely return, and per The Wall Street Journal he may attempt to go directly to WBD shareholders if the company doesn't engage. That said, the argument they are making about regulatory concerns (namely that Paramount is in better shape to evade tough scrutiny from the Trump administration) can only carry so much weight relative to the dollar signs.

	Still, Ellison has openly spoken about making big deals.


	“I think, ironically, it was [WBD CEO] David Zaslav who said last year that consolidation in the media business is important. The way we approach everything is, first and foremost, what's good for the talent community, what's good for our shareholders and value creation, and what's good for, basically, storytelling at large,” Ellison said at the Bloomberg Screentime conference last week. “From our standpoint, whether we approach any acquisition — and I actually do think there are a lot of options out there in terms of what might be actionable in the near future — we would approach it through the lens of wanting to make more, not less. … You need more content to yield more engagement.”

	











	Ellison wants to scoop up Warner Bros. Discovery before Zaslav can execute his other big gambit: a split of the company in two, with HBO and the Warner Bros. studios in one business that he will lead, and Gunnar Weidenfels leading the former Discovery and Warner networks in another (along with added debt and a stake in the studios business).


	The split, currently expected by April, is meant to unlock value, Zaslav and other WBD execs have argued, noting that a studios and HBO business unburdened by debt or linear TV channels would be much more appealing to potential acquirers, while the Discovery business (including CNN) would have multiple strategic options it could pursue.


	Discovery could be run for cash, serve as a rollup vehicle, sell off assets piecemeal, reinvest in its brands or sell the whole thing off to private equity, notes Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif-Ehrlich, who was among the Wall Street insiders calling for such a strategic move last year. It's a veritable Cheesecake Factory menu of options.


	The influential Wall Street analyst, meanwhile, also frames the post-split Warner Bros. business as a “crown jewel” asset, one that would shake buyers off the sidelines.


	“It is our view that as a standalone entity WBD's streaming and studio assets would generate a bidding war amongst potential buyers, and therefore, we believe a split of the company can garner the greatest potential value,” Reif-Ehrlich wrote in a Sept. 30 note, after Ellison's interest had been reported.

	











	It's a point of view that seems to be shared by WBD executives, perhaps confident that post-split Ellison and Paramount would still covet Warners, but so would Apple, Netflix, Comcast, Sony or other bidders.


	But is the interest real? Or is it a mirage — as Ellison and his team are sure to argue. Greg Peters, the co-CEO of Netflix, when asked about a potential deal for Warner Bros., mostly dismissed the idea.


	“We come from a deep heritage of being builders rather than buyers. I also think that one should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don't have an amazing track record over the history of time,” Peters said, before leaving a door open, noting that “I would say it's our responsibility to evaluate all our options.”


	Another notable Wall Street analyst, LightShed's Rich Greenfield, is similarly skeptical of a Netflix deal for WB.


	“While we are sure there's IP inside Warner Bros. that Netflix would love to remake or exploit, and while Hollywood catalog IP performs well on Netflix (Despicable Me 3 and The Mask are both in Netflix's Top 10 movies today in the US), the content driving Netflix's subscriber growth has been original IP,” Greenfield wrote Oct. 6. “Not to mention, Netflix is having no trouble licensing catalog content from Hollywood studios who are increasingly desperate to license to Netflix.”


	Whatever happens in the near term, it's clear that Warner Bros. is at a pivot point: Maybe Ellison circles back and delivers a deal that can bring the storied studio under Skydance control, or maybe Zaslav goes through with his split and sees what the market will bear.

	











	One of the most storied studios in Hollywood could be acquired by another, by a tech giant, or left to fend for itself. Ellison is waiting in the wings. Is anyone else?

	Four couples had their first dance to the sound of Lucy Dacus‘ “Best Guess” as she performed the record on Jimmy Kimmel Live. At the end of the song, the singer-songwriter made a seamless transition to the vow portion of her appearance, where she officiated weddings for her on-stage guests.


	“Hi, everyone,” Dacus said. “You ready to get married?” The couple shared promises to give themselves to each other and to care for one another in their marriage, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. And with that said, they sealed their union with a kiss.


	“Best Guess” appears on Dacus' latest album, Forever Is a Feeling. “It's a song that is basically admitting that you can't control anything, you can't predict the future, but you can make your best guess,” she told The New York Times. 


	She performed the record at the New York iteration of All Things Go in September, inviting nine couples to the stage. Ordained by the Universal Life Church, she officiated at two of the marriages and signed the remaining seven wedding certificates as a witness.

	“I wish it was rote and it wasn't calling to mind any threats to people's rights,” Dacus said about officiating marriages in the midst of our current political climate. “But I can tell it's coming up in everyone's mind, everyone who's onstage, everyone in the crowd. There's no getting around everyone wondering if this is a temporarily possible moment.”

	











	In the caption of an Instagram post shared following the festival, Dacus wrote from the same place of optimism that colors “Best Guess.” “I am often in disbelief, disoriented, and overwhelmed,” she said, “but I am deeply in love with this life.”

Marc Maron has dropped the 1,686th and final episode of his long-running WTF podcast, with former President Barack Obama returning for Maron's last interview.


	Maron managed to keep the identity of his last guest a secret until the episode dropped Monday morning, Oct. 13. In introducing Obama — who famously appeared on the show 10 years ago — Maron described him as the perfect person to help him bring WTF to a close.


	As Maron said in his intro: “I do a lot of talking about how I feel about the world, both interior and exterior; micro, macro; what's going on in me, how am I reacting to what's going on in the world. And it became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular. In that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we're living in, as frightening as it is, with what's happening. And how do we do it with some grace, and perhaps some hope and some focus, and really call what's going on what it is. And that guest is President Barack Obama.”

	











	While Obama came to Maron's house for their 2015 chat, this time Maron visited the former president at his office in Washington, D.C. During the conversation, the pair spoke at length about Trump, the state of the Democratic Party, the weaponization of the justice system, and prominent institutions like universities and law firms kowtowing to the current administration.


	“We have blown through, just in the last six months, a whole range of not simply assumptions, but rules and laws and practices that were put in place to ensure that nobody is above the law, and that we don't use the federal government to simply reward our friends and punish our enemies,” Obama said. 

	











	He added that “people are right to be concerned,” but said that just like during the McCarthy era and at other contentious points in American history, “What's required in these situations is a few folks standing up and giving courage to other folks. And then more people stand up and go like, ‘Yeah, no, that's not who we are. That's not our idea of America.'”

	Maron also took the opportunity to ask Obama for some advice — not just on how to navigate this moment politically, but also personally. He asked the former president how he contended with the weight of leaving his biggest job ever, with Obama recalling some advice he got at the time: “Don't rush into what the next thing is.”


	He continued, “Take a beat and take some satisfaction. Looking back and saying, ‘You know what, didn't get everything done that I wanted; it wasn't always exactly how I planned it, but there's a body of work there that I'm proud of.'”

	Following the interview, Maron said he hoped the interview was “helpful,” while also calling it an “honor” to interview Obama again. He then signed off for the last time, thanking fans for all their support, the numerous people who'd helped him put on the show, and, lastly, his beloved cats, especially all those who'd passed away. 


	“Cat angels everywhere,” Maron said as the show drew to a close.

The actress was asked about signing onto the new full-cast Harry Potter audiobook series.

	Keira Knightley was asked about signing onto an upcoming Harry Potter project during a recent publicity stop. 


	The actress was promoting her new Netflix thriller The Woman in Cabin 10 when she was questioned about playing a role in the lavish new audiobook productions of the Harry Potter novels, Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions. 



	The production has cast more than 200 actors to play roles in the new adaptation of J.K. Rowlings' beloved bestsellers, with Knightley playing the villainous Ministry of Magic authoritarian Dolores Umbridge.

Decider asked the British actress if she was aware that “some fans are calling for a boycott” given Rowling's trans views.


	“I was not aware of that, no,” she said. “I'm very sorry. You know, I think we're all living in a period of time right now where we're all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren't we? And we've all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect.”


The Woman in Cabin 10 filmmaker Simon Stone was in the interview with Knightley and weighed in as well.


	“I think that's right,” Stone said. “I think that we have learned over time, unfortunately, that the unbearable voice in the room is something … I think everyone needs to recognize that they're the unbearable voice for someone else, as well. The live and let live thing of like, ‘Oh God, your voice is really loud, and I can't stand you.' That's part of our lives.”

	











	He continued: “We all have hatred, deep hatred for someone in the universe—someone in the class. Let's reduce it to classroom politics. There is always the kid that we cannot stand. I think we'd all agree that we're that kid for someone else, too. Unfortunately, all sides of the political spectrum are currently trying to shut that kid's voice down, but they don't realize the irony of the fact that they're also that kid for someone else. If we can have all have a moratorium on that, and just let chaos live for a little bit, we might find our way out.” 


	While Rowling's views continue to be a topic of debate online, the Harry Potter universe has not shown any sign of being impacted by the controversy. The 2023 Hogwarts Legacy game was a massive bestseller and anticipation for HBO's upcoming Harry Potter TV series is quite high. Rowling's recent clap back on Harry Potter film star Emma Watson's apparent attempt to extend an olive branch to the author drew praise in some conservative quarters, condemnation in others, after Rowling wrote that Watson “has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is.” 


The Woman in Cabin 10 is based on a novel by Ruth Ware and follows “a journalist (Knightley) on a luxury yacht who witnesses a passenger thrown overboard late at night, only to be told that it didn't happen, as all passengers and crew are accounted for. Despite no one believing her, she continues to look for answers, putting her own life in danger.” The film is currently streaming on Netflix.

Taylor Swift has announced two projects for Disney+: a full concert film, The Eras Tour | The Final Show, as well as a six-episode docuseries on the tour, both arriving on December 12.


	“It was the End of an Era and we knew it,” Swift wrote on Instagram today. “We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed filmmakers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety.” 

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)


	The announcement follows last week's launch of Swift's album The Life of a Showgirl, a massively successful release with more than 4 million equivalent album units earned in the U.S.

	With what Disney+ calls unprecedented access, the docuseries Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, will chronicle “the development, impact and inner-workings that created the phenomenon that was The Eras Tour.”


	Per the logline, the docuseries gives an intimate look at Taylor's life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world. In addition, the series spotlights performers, family members, and friends – including Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran, and Florence Welch – offering never-before-seen insight into what it took to create a phenomenon. Two episodes will debut each week beginning December 12.

	











	Filmed in Vancouver, the concert film captures the final show of the Eras Tour and features the entire set of The Tortured Poets Department, which was added to the tour following that album's release in 2024.

Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter are probably going to be corporate media's last “pop stars”, because that institution doesn't have the clout to astroturf talent anymore.

It didn't have to be this way. But the system became more about following existing trends than creating new ones, and now bands are more capable of breaking out online than through the legacy media.

This is an interesting take – Genuinely curious what you mean by this – can you elaborate more? Are you referencing the fact that Taylor Swift is so huge that she's now calling the shots with her content distribution? Or the possibility that corporate media is not going to want to work with stars of this magnitude because they are so expensive and demanding that it's all gotten too big?

I guess Disney+ is going up again. Think I'll keep my subscription cancelled.

“looking forward to this” – my 50 year old aunt, probably

Ummm no one asked. Also if you're so annoyed, why are you reading it and commenting at 6am?

Sadly, we're still a few appearances shy of commencing the Tim Meadowsaissance, heretofore referred to as “The Meadows' Spring Awakening.” (Not every name + “renaissance” rolls off the tongue like “McConaissance.”) Yes, the beloved character actor recently reprised his iconic role as Mr. Duvall in the “Mean Girls” musical and jolted extra life into “Peacemaker” Season 2 as a federal agent with “bird blindness,” but two standout supporting turns in two years (plus recurring voice roles) does not an awakening make. (Blame Paramount for nixing Michel Gondry's musical “Golden,” which featured Meadows next to Pharrell Williams and Brian Tyree Henry — now that could've ushered in an Awakening.)

“DMV” gets the “SNL” vet closer to a winter bloom, but through two episodes, the CBS sitcom about beleaguered driving examiners, paper pushers, and desk jockeys isn't providing its star enough fertilizer. (OK, OK, I'll stop with the plant metaphors.) Really, it's under-serving each of its talented cast members, which — if we follow our crestfallen leads and look at the bright side — at least means it's a solvable problem (unlike the DMV itself).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The single-camera comedy starts by admitting what everyone already knows: Nobody likes the DMV. Every driver's worst nightmare — yes, even more than crashing their dream car the second it rolls off the lot — is being forced to visit the Department of Motor Vehicles, a place where time stops and the red tape rolls on forever. 

Colette (Harriet Dyer) knows the grind all too well. She's been working at the East Hollywood DMV for five years, despite promising herself (and anyone listening) it's just a temp job. Her closest friends aren't clinging to the same sliver of sunshine Colette needs to keep going, but Vic (Tony Cavalero) and Gregg (Meadows) still support her whenever they can. Vic savors life's simple pleasures — a meatball sub with crinkled potato chips for lunch, a shirtless afternoon on a hot day — even if they come at the expense of others. (That was Gregg's sub, and Vic's co-workers aren't exactly thrilled about their half-nude colleague.)

Gregg is identified in the press notes as a misanthrope, but the jury's still out on that predetermined character trait. Sure, when he mentions his frigid marital bed, it's more statement than complaint, but he's also positioned as Colette's most supportive, encouraging friend. He cares about what counts — so far, at least.

 










Much can change after the first hour of a network sitcom, and at least a few things need to in “DMV.” For starters, Colette feels familiar for the wrong reasons. Both episodes pivot around her crush on Noa (Alex Tarrant), a hunky New Zealander who's only been working at the DMV for a few weeks. Quickly establishing a “will they, won't they” romance is a safe bet for viewer retention, and their rapport is sound enough. It's just that creator Dana Klein (“9JKL,” “Friends with Better Lives”) seems to be positioning Dyer in a similar dynamic as her breakout role on the Aussie serial rom-com, “Colin from Accounts” — awkwardly flirting, awkwardly plotting, and generally embarrassing herself over and over.

Too much of the banter is sloppy and too many of her mistakes are avoidable. (The climax of the pilot really stretches to put Colette in an embarrassing spot.) “DMV” also recycles too many jokes within the same 20-minute arc. (I'm hesitant to identify them as “callbacks” — a new comedy should be eager to show off new jokes, and the adhesive maxi-pad bit just isn't funny enough for a running gag.) At least we know Dyer is playing in a familiar sandbox, so it's safe to assume she'll start building better castles in time.

Everyone else leaves too little impact. Cavalero worked wonders on “The Righteous Gemstones,” and his eccentric ex-bouncer has plenty of untapped potential in the stuffy confines of a government office building. Tarrant is stuck playing a boring dreamboat, making it hard to tell if he'll expand beyond Dyer's dorky straight man. The office manager, Barbara Berry (Molly Kearney), gets points for stretching her well-intentioned buffoon of a boss, while ID photographer Ceci (Gigi Zumbado) barely gets enough screen time to speak her lines.

 










That leaves the two glaring questions facing “DMV's” first season: Can the visual template lighten up enough to disassociate a fun network sitcom from its infamous real-world setting, and can it seed enough rich material for Meadows (and the rest of the cast) to open up like we know he can? Speaking to the former point, it's great that “DMV” evokes an actual DMV — having been to a few in the greater Los Angeles area, the show's soundstage could sub in for any one of them — but the bleak overhead lighting, dark walls, and black office furniture take things a step too far. A comedy stage still needs to be inviting, even if the place it's modeled after isn't.

As for Meadows, he does get the biggest laugh of the first two episodes, so there's hope. Writers need time to get to know their stars' strengths, even if those stars have been brightening our screens for decades. “DMV” just needs a little fine-tuning, and then we'll be able to tell if it's ready for what it's cast already deserves: a long road ahead.

“DMV” premieres Monday, October 13 at 8:30 p.m. ET on CBS. New episodes will be released weekly and available to stream on Paramount+.

Swift announced the new concert movie and six-episode look behind the scenes on Monday morning.



		By Nicole Fell, Jackie Strause 

	October 13, 2025 5:33am	




Taylor Swift‘s full concert film The Eras Tour | The Final Show, featuring the entire Tortured Poets Department set, and a docuseries on the tour are coming to streaming. The movie and the first two episodes of the docuseries, Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, release on Disney+ on Dec. 12.


	Swift announced the news, including the six-episode behind-the-scenes docuseries, on her socials Monday morning. 




	“It was the End of an Era and we knew it. We wanted to remember every moment leading up to the culmination of the most important and intense chapter of our lives, so we allowed filmmakers to capture this tour and all the stories woven throughout it as it wound down. And to film the final show in its entirety,” she wrote on Instagram.

	Two episodes of the docuseries will release weekly following the Dec. 12 release. The news comes on the heels of the record-breaking release of her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3.


	Boasting unprecedented access to her record-breaking tour, docuseries Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era will chronicle the development, impact and inner-workings that created the phenomenon that was The Eras Tour.


	The docuseries will give “an intimate look at Taylor's life as her tour made headlines and thrilled fans around the world,” per Disney. The series will spotlight performers, family members and Swift's friends — including Gracie Abrams, Sabrina Carpenter, Ed Sheeran and Florence Welch — to offer “never-before-seen insight into what it took to create a phenomenon.”

	











	The full concert film The Eras Tour | The Final Show was filmed in Vancouver to capture the final show of the tour.


Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The End of an Era is directed by Don Argott, co-directed by Sheena M. Joyce and produced by Object & Animal. Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour | The Final Show is directed by Glenn Weiss and produced by Taylor Swift Productions in association with Silent House Productions.      


The Life of a Showgirl, produced and written by the singer herself along with hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback, was thought to be a return to some of her most standard pop albums, like 1989, but instead leaned more towards a mix of Evermore and Midnights. Swift said the rollout of the album — lead by the single “The Fate of Ophelia” — has “absolutely” been her favorite yet, calling it the “most joyful” of her career in a recent interview.


	The album sold 2.7 million copies on release day (Oct. 3), making that day alone her largest week ever, according to Luminate via Billboard. On Oct. 8, with over a full day of tracking left, Swift officially took the record for biggest opening week so far for a record in the streaming era, according to Billboard, with data sourced from Luminate. As of Wednesday, she had sold a reported 3.2 million copies with 300,000 streaming units, taking her to a record-breaking 3.5 million combined. The album is expected to be her 15th No. 1 on Billboard 200; however, the official chart has yet to be released.

	











	The singer has been making the rounds on late night TV for Showgirl. She stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last week to talk about the album, her recent engagement to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and her pal Selena Gomez's wedding. The NBC late night show opted to air an extended version of Swift's appearance as a special episode on Oct. 10. The “Father Figure” singer also stopped by NBC's Late Night with Seth Meyers on Oct. 8. She was the night's only guest — the show dubbed it a “Tay/kover” episode.


	In addition to the album, Swift released a cinematic companion, which included a chance to see the lead single's music video early. Swift directed the video, which was filmed by frequent collaborator and Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and features choreography from famed choreographer Mandy Moore, who worked on the singer's Eras tour. The release event — not fully classified as a film or a documentary — earned $34.1 million at the opening weekend domestic box office and an additional $16 million worldwide, bringing its grand total to $50.1 million globally.


Oct. 13, 10 a.m. This story has been updated with final box office tally.

Finally, something to look forward to in the bitter days of late winter. Netflix announced early Monday morning that its smash hit series “Bridgerton,” based on the beloved romance novels from Julia Quinn, will return in early 2026. Well, with a caveat: like Season 3, Season 4 will arrive in two parts.

The streamer has announced that Part 1 of the season, including the first four episodes, will drop on January 29, 2026, with Part 2 (also four episodes) following on February 26, 2026. Netflix previously employed a similar release strategy with Season 3 in 2024, splitting that season over two releases during early summer. Talk about delaying the gratification!

During a February event held in London, current showrunner Jess Brownell teased that the forthcoming season is the “Bridgerton” season most “faithful” to the respective novel, and one that will kick off with a masquerade ball. (Still, we previously wondered just how faithful this season will be, considering some sticky elements of the novel.)

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Per this season's official logline: “The fourth season of ‘Bridgerton' turns its focus to bohemian second son Benedict (Luke Thompson). Despite his elder and younger brothers both being happily married, Benedict is loath to settle down — until he meets a captivating Lady in Silver at his mother's masquerade ball.” “The theme of the season is really about true love being somewhere in between fantasy and reality,” Brownell also noted.

In May, the streamer announced that the fifth and sixth seasons of the smash hit had been greenlit, though it's unclear which siblings they will focus on and when they will arrive.

This season stars Luke Thompson (Benedict Bridgerton), Yerin Ha (Sophie Baek), Jonathan Bailey (Anthony Bridgerton), Victor Alli (Lord John Stirling), Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury), Julie Andrews (Lady Whistledown), Lorraine Ashbourne (Mrs. Varley), Masali Baduza (Michaela Stirling), Nicola Coughlan (Penelope Bridgerton), Hannah Dodd (Francesca Stirling), Daniel Francis (Lord Marcus Anderson), Ruth Gemmell (Violet Bridgerton), Florence Hunt (Hyacinth Bridgerton), Martins Imhangbe (Will Mondrich), Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton), Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte), Will Tilston (Gregory Bridgerton), Polly Walker (Portia Featherington), Emma Naomi (Alice Mondrich), Hugh Sachs (Brimsley), plus Simone Ashley (Kate Bridgerton), Isabella Wei (Posy Li), Michelle Mao (Rosamund Li), and Katie Leung (Lady Araminta Gun).

The singer was seen hanging with her future in-laws, Donna and Ed Kelce, during Sunday's (Oct. 12) game at Arrowhead Stadium.

Taylor Swift has been a little busy lately promoting her The Life of a Showgirl album. But on Sunday (Oct. 12), the singer took some time out from her album duties to support fiancé Travis Kelce at his job. Though Swift has been a fixture at Kansas City Chiefs games over the past few years, Sunday marked the first time the singer was shown on a Chiefs broadcast this season since the couple got engaged in August.

	Ensconced in a VIP suite alongside Kelce's parents — and her future in-laws — Ed and Donna Kelce at Arrowhead Stadium, Swift watched the Chiefs get level at 3-3 for the season as they defeated the Detroit Lions and Travis had a solid day with six receptions and 78 yards, his highest total to date this season. 

	











	The singer also spent some more quality time with WNBA star Caitlin Clark, after missing the Chief's game last Monday night due to her Tonight Show taping in New York. During the first half of the game, the NBC Sunday Night Football crew tossed to the suite to show Swift excitedly hugging her future father-in-law, who was wearing a Kelce jersey, while Swift's game day outfit featured a mini Chiefs jersey dress with red striping detail in a nod to KC's colors.




	According to reports, Swift attended two other games this season — a loss to the Eagles during week two and a win against the Ravens on Sept. 28 — though she entered both of those quietly and was not shown on either broadcast. She was also not on hand on Sept. 5 when the Chiefs kicked off their season with a loss to the L.A. Chargers in São Paulo, Brazil.


	In addition to the Chiefs hard-won victory, Swift had plenty to celebrate this weekend, as Showgirl broke a modern-era record for the most albums sold in a week in the United States. The LP's first week sales consumption figure (equivalent album units, which includes pure sales, streams and track sales) and pure album sales figure running up to a historic 3.4 million in pure album sales (physical and digital purchases), making it the largest sales week for any album since Luminate began electronically tracking music data in 1991, when the modern era of weekly music tabulation began; the final sales figures from Luminate were due to be announced on Sunday (Oct. 12).

Woody Allen, who regularly collaborated with Diane Keaton throughout her career, honored the actress following her death in a tribute published on The Free Press. The disgraced filmmaker shared his memories of Keaton, who appeared in movies like Annie Hall, Sleeper, Manhattan, and Love and Death. 


	“Unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again, her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered,” Allen wrote. “I first laid eyes on her lanky beauty at an audition and thought, If Huckleberry Finn was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton.” 


	Allen described working with Keaton over the years, but also being her longtime friend. He wrote that her opinion was one of the only ones he trusted. “As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,” Allen wrote. “I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it. If she liked it, I counted the film as an artistic success. If she was less than enthusiastic, I tried to use her criticism to reedit and come away with something she felt better about.”

	











	He added, “She had huge talent for comedies and drama, but she could also dance and sing with feeling. She also wrote books and did photography, made collages, decorated homes, and directed films. Finally, she was a million laughs to be around.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Allen and Keaton were one-time romantic partners and stayed friends in the years after. He wrote numerous roles specifically for her to play, including the titular character in 1977's Annie Hall, for which she won Best Actress. Many speculated that the film was based on their prior relationship, although Keaton told The New York Times, “It's not true, but there are elements of truth in it.”

	











	He noted of her style, “Her fashion sense was a sight to behold, of course. Her sartorial concoctions rivaled the contraptions of Rube Goldberg. She put together clothing that defied logic but always worked. In later years, her look became more elegant.”

	In the tribute, Allen described his romantic relationship with Keaton, including recalling meeting her family. “This was Keaton's world, her people, her background,” he wrote. “It was amazing that this beautiful yokel went on to become an award-winning actress and sophisticated fashion icon. We had a few great personal years together and finally we both moved on, and why we parted only God and Freud might be able to figure out.”


	“She went on to date a number of exciting men, all of them more fascinating than I was,” Allen continued. “I went on to keep trying to make that great masterpiece that I am still struggling with when I last looked. I kidded Keaton that we'd wind up — she like Norma Desmond, me like Erich von Stroheim, once her director, now her chauffeur. But the world is constantly being redefined, and with Keaton's passing it is redefined once again. A few days ago the world was a place that included Diane Keaton. Now it's a world that does not. Hence, it's a drearier world. Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head.”


	Allen has dogged controversy since having an affair with his partner Mia Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. During his custody battle with Farrow, she claimed Allen had “acted inappropriately” with her daughter, Dylan Farrow. Allen denied the accusations and married Previn, who he has been with for more than 20 years. The claims resurfaced during the #MeToo movement and Keaton took to social media to defend Allen. 


	“Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him,” Keaton wrote. “It might be of interest to take a look at the 60 Minute interview from 1992 and see what you think.”

	In 2017, Allen made a rare appearance to present Keaton with the AFI Life Achievement Award. “The minute I met her, she was a great, great inspiration to me,” Allen said during the event. “Much of what I've accomplished in my life I owe, for sure, to her. Seeing life through her eyes. She really is astonishing. This is a woman who is great at everything she does.”

HBO Max is heading back to the Land of Ooo for the second season of the Adventure Time spin-off, Fionna And Cake. Missing from Adult Swim's line-ups since 2023, the show has survived the streamer's recent name change to make its long-overdue return. Fionna And Cake takes place somewhere in the Adventure Time multiverse, where Finn the Human and Jake the Dog are replaced by the gender-swapped Fionna and species-swapped Cake the Cat. The new season picks up where the last left off. Set in a world where magic only exists in her dreams, Fionna is stuck working dead-end jobs by day and saving the magical universe by night.



Here's the synopsis:

After their journey through the multiverse, Fionna and Cake tackle new adventures while Huntress Wizard embarks on a desperate quest with fatal consequences.

The new 10-episode season debuts on October 23 on HBO Max, with new episodes running through Christmas Day.

Ah, to be Keira Knightley and live blissfully unaware of the noxious cauldron of transphobic hate that author J.K. Rowling has been stirring for the last decade. It's been six years of Rowling making transphobia her entire brand by endangering and denigrating transgender people online and successfully advocating for legal restrictions against the marginalized group of people. As such, those who took her book's message of acceptance and tolerance to heart have chosen not to spend their hard-earned money on Rowling's many projects, including those related to Harry Potter. Yet, Knightley didn't know about that when she signed on to voice Professor Umbridge in Audible's Harry Potter: The Full-Cast Audio Editions audiobooks. It also sounds like it wouldn't have made a difference. Speaking to Decider, Knightley pleaded ignorance of Rowling's “ongoing campaign against trans people,” as the publication put it.

“I was not aware of that, no,” she said. “I'm very sorry. You know, I think we're all living in a period of time right now where we're all going to have to figure out how to live together, aren't we? And we've all got very different opinions. I hope that we can all find respect.”

Her Woman In Cabin 10 director, Simon Stone, piggybacked off that sentiment by equivocating the victims of Rowling's hate for the perpetrator. “I think that we have learned over time, unfortunately, that the unbearable voice in the room is something that we should try and shut down,” Stone said. “And actually, I think everyone needs to recognize that they're the unbearable voice for someone else, as well. The live and let live thing of like, ‘Oh God, your voice is really loud, and I can't stand you.' That's part of our lives.” (The billionaire's voice is much louder than that of the small and vulnerable population of trans people, but go off.)

“We all have hatred, deep hatred for someone in the universe—someone in the class. Let's reduce it to classroom politics. There is always the kid that we cannot stand. I think we'd all agree that where that kid for someone else, too,” he continued. “Unfortunately, all sides of the political spectrum are currently trying to shut that kid's voice down, but they don't realize the irony of the fact that they're also that kid for someone else. If we can all have a moratorium on that, and just let chaos live for a little bit, we might find our way out.”

In the interest of letting “chaos live for a little bit,” earlier this year, Rowling's influence and wealth helped push forward a U.K. Supreme Court judgment that ruled trans women should not be considered women, which, according to NBC, “wip[ed] out decades of civil rights advances for British transgender people.” Rowling responded by posting a picture of herself smoking a cigar and holding a cocktail with the caption, “I love it when a plan comes together.”

Conspiracy theorists are once again accusing NFL officials of aiding the Chiefs after Kansas City went unpenalized in Sunday's win over the Detroit Lions. 

The latest controversies were highlighted by a questionable third-quarter catch by Travis Kelce.

Although the ruling on the field was a reception, the ball appeared to rattle around as he fell to the field. In the end, Kelce seemed to trap the ball underneath his body, not that the on-field officials appeared to notice.

Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wisely went no huddle on the next play to deny replay officials and Lions coach Dan Campbell the chance to review the catch, which was good enough for 13 yards and helped to set up a nine-yard touchdown pass to Hollywood Brown.

Fans, including the 'Rate the Refs' X account, clearly disagreed with the ruling.

'This catch by Travis Kelce should have been ruled an incomplete catch with how it hits the ground,' Rate the Refs wrote on X. 'Chiefs hurry and snap the ball before it can be reviewed.'

'Well it's the chiefs and a prime time game, so officials dare not make the correct call,' wrote on conspiratorial critic on X.

But not everyone agreed with that assessment. Namely, NBC rules analyst Terry McAulay said it was, indeed, a catch.

'I believe it would have,' the former NFL official said on the broadcast. 'It looks like he does get control prior to the ball touching the ground. And then he never loses it.'

That wasn't the only disputed call of the game, though.

Kelce appeared to get away with a holding penalty on a fourth-quarter screen pass to Brashard Smith in the fourth quarter. 

Mahomes found Brown for another touchdown a few plays later.

Refs also took a Lions touchdown off the board in the first quarter due to an illegal motion call against Detroit quarterback Jared Goff.

Goff began the goal-line play under center before motioning left behind receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown near the pylon.

With Goff split wide, running back David Montgomery received the direct shotgun snap before throwing back to his quarterback, who managed to fight his way into the end zone with a helpful block from St. Brown. 

At first, it looked like a clear touchdown and an early 6-0 lead at Arrowhead Stadium.

Unfortunately for Goff, he committed a penalty on the play by failing to first establishing himself in the backfield before motion out wide.

'This an illegal formation,' McAulay said.

Then, exacerbating the Lions' situation, Goff was flagged for delay of game while arguing the non-reviewable call with officials on the field. As a result, Detroit would have to settle for a field goal and an early 3-0 edge. 

What officials may have missed on the play was Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones lining up in the neutral zone.

'Is this a Chiefs gimme?' asked one Lions fan. 'Just like every chief game.'

Then there was a roughing-the-passer call against the Lions' Aiden Hutchinson, which led some Chiefs haters to accuse Mahomes of flopping on the play.

'Clear flop,' one fan wrote online.

Many other, though, called it a 'clear roughing the passer' penalty.

NFL fans have long suspected the Chiefs are benefitting from friendly officiating in an attempt to boost league television ratings. Those suspicions only grew in 2023 when Kelce began dating Taylor Swift, who helped to popularize the league among her army of fans. 

Statistics don't necessarily back up these claims of poor officiating, but on Sunday in Kansas City, the Chiefs did avoid a single penalty flag as they improved to 3-3 for the season.

'No penalties called on the Chiefs tonight,' one fan remarked on X. 'Lmao ok.'

'KC with zero penalties is hilarious,' a Lions fan added. 'NFL isn't even hiding it...false starts, holding and blocks in the back all-over.'

As another fan put it: 'When they overturned the first td we all knew what was going to happen.' 

The Chiefs committed 13 penalties in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars a week earlier. And as Kelce told ESPN after the win, that remained a theme for Kansas City throughout the week.  

'Penalties and turnovers are going to ruin you in this league,' Kelce said. 'It was a bit embarrassing seeing how many flags we had last week. It was a huge focal point this week.'

Writer-director Jas Summers made his directorial debut in the new Hulu film Stay. It follows Kiara (Megalyn Echikunwoke), a PhD author, and Miles (Mo McRae), a former MMA fighter, as they face the end of their marriage. They encounter supernatural forces, shifting from fighting each other to fighting for their lives. To survive, they must conquer darkness with love.

Horror Geek Life spoke with Summers about navigating the supernatural thriller.

HGL: Where did the idea for Stay come from?

Jas Summers: The idea came from wanting to tell a really interesting love story and then putting it in a genre I never thought a love story would be in; I'd never seen one, so putting those two worlds together was kind of the start of the idea.

HGL: How did the rest of the film take shape beyond the premise? Was there a lot of planning, or did it come together as the film was unfolding?

Jas Summers: It took shape over many drafts, the first draft was that idea, and I wanted to add in the spirituality idea, the voodoo element, and building out that way. I figured it out as I was working on it in the writing; it became more of a personal story, with people that I know. My father is in there, my mother is in there, their experiences and influences on me, about struggles in life and love and misunderstandings. So it was during the script writing process, for sure. 

HGL: There are some great visual moments from start to finish. When you were mapping out the film, did you have an idea how you wanted the film to look visually, or did that evolve during the filming process?

Jas Summers: I had a strong sense from the start about putting them frame within frames, trapping them in the house, but inside the doorways, the hallways, things like that. Once we got cinematographer John Rosario on board, we started talking about the emotion of the film, the characters, that time period in their life, and how it would look. I had a strong idea of what I wanted, but it evolved as more creatives came on board. 

HGL: It goes without saying that everything you're describing is not an easy process, time and money being the big issues. What were the biggest challenges for you in making this film?

Jas Summers: Time and money (laughs). Of course, all filmmakers go through it. I wish I had more days, more time in a day, and the schedule was tough. Some of the stuff in the film was tough; characters had to switch out of being in the same scene to being in a different scene with different hair, makeup, wardrobe, all that stuff made it very challenging to get all those particular scenes done on that day. 

To me, I don't know how everyone else feels who's watching it, but it's a little bit of an action film, fight scenes, horror, we had a lot of genres, and for a first-time filmmaker to attempt that was a lot. So yeah, time and money, but more so, time was the big one. 

HGL: You have two actors, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Mo McRae, carrying the film. What was it like working with them, collaborating on this project?

Jas Summers: It was amazing. I had seen Mo's work in American Skin; he had the right humanity but also the right presence and power to play Miles. We ended up having lunch, and I didn't get a good feel. I didn't think he liked me, and I thought I ruined things right there, but he ended up laughing and chatting. We talked about the movie, and he said he wanted to star in it but also produce it, which I said would be amazing. 

He brought in his producing team, and they were very helpful, brought in a lot of ideas. He suggested Megalyn to me, and you've seen the film; she is just awe-inspiring and a force of nature. They were both collaborative; if I had an idea, they would say, “Okay, let's try this, see if we can make it better, take it to another level.” As a director, that was great. 

HGL: Looking back at the film now, what do you take away from this experience, both personally and professionally?

Jas Summers: Personally, I just take away the fact that I did it, I got it done. That I was able to achieve that meant so much to me in terms of my career, and where I was wondering if it was ever going to happen, and having the determination to figure out a way to never stop, always keep going, there's always a way. 

Then, professionally, I think I just take all the lessons I've learned from people who have already done it. More experience on set, communication, the lessons of professionalism, the lessons of being grateful, being thankful to everyone who was contributing to the project, from crafts to the AD, everyone who played a role in helping me get this film made, and appreciating that and not taking it for granted. 

Stay is now streaming on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+.

The latest UFO activity in the United Kingdom has fueled interest in extraterrestrial life, particularly after the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the third interstellar object found in our solar system. While some researchers indicate that it could be an alien probe, most state it is a comet. Utilizing information from the National UFO Reporting Centre, Enigma app, and UFO Identified Group, scientists ranked UK places in regard to their own per capita sightings.

As Donald Trump lands in Israel for his much-hyped Middle East peace mission, celebrity psychic Uri Geller has gone viral with a spine-chilling warning, claiming he's sensing “terrible signals” and a potential threat to Trump's life in Egypt. Geller urges the President to avoid Sharm el-Sheikh entirely, reminding him of past assassinations. Is Trump ignoring a real danger? Or just superstition? Watch till the end for shocking details and Trump's reaction.

Melanie Virdell wasn't known to wake up early when she lived in the Spanaway area of Pierce County, but on a cold February morning about 13 years ago, she was up with her son, 18-year-old Christopher Virdell. Christopher and Melanie Virdell had breakfast together after she made him a bowl of oatmeal on Feb. 9, 2012. She told The News Tribune earlier this month that as he got ready to leave for work at Safeway, he had been texting a friend on his phone. She watched Christopher grab his jacket and start running to the door.

Confirmed by NASA—the mysterious rocks on Mars could contain the clearest signs of extraterrestrial life yet

NASA could have found signs of life on Mars, but there's something wrong. It's true there's still no definite confirmation about this remarkable news, but Perseverance rover's findings are the most promising until now and could answer one of the most ancient questions of humanity: Was there life on the Red Planet once? So, let's see what NASA has to say about this ongoing topic this time.

The Perseverance rover, which reached Mars in 2021, is exploring an area called Jezero Crater. Billion years ago, this place was home to a huge lake with rivers.

Then, in 2024, the rover found a very special rock called ‘'Cheyava Falls'' and when scientists analyzed it they saw organic molecules (compounds that on Earth are related to life), ancient water signs, and curious mineral patterns in the shape of spots that could have been an ideal environment for microorganisms to exist.

Despite the excitement, NASA experts were very careful. The organic molecules do not always mean there has been life, sometimes they are formed due to natural chemical processes. This is why they decided to keep investigating.

After the initial finding, NASA announced that the rover had analyzed two new areas: Sapphire Canyon and Masonic Temple. In these places, the Perseverance discovered minerals called vivianite and greigite. The most shocking thing was that they were distributed inside the rocks.

The minerals showed a pattern known as the ‘'redox cycling'' which happens when electrons move between different chemical compounds. On Earth, this type of chemical reaction is used by many microorganisms to obtain energy.

Basically, the patterns found on Mars are similar to the ones that leave some types of bacteria on our planet.

Scientific Michael Tice, a geobiologist and astrobiologist at Texas A&M University, said the team was amazed when they first analyzed the rocks. “When the rover entered the Bright Angel area and started measuring the rocks, the team was immediately struck by how different they were from anything we had seen before,” Tice explained.

Tice added that while some chemical reactions can occur naturally, they usually require very high temperatures. But there's no evidence of heat in these samples — which means life could be the more likely explanation.

However, to be sure, scientists need to bring these samples back to Earth for deeper study. Only in advanced laboratories can they confirm whether the rocks' chemical signatures truly point to ancient life.

Even though the Perseverance took samples of the Martian floor, taking them back to Earth won't be easy. NASA and ESA (European Spatial Agency) were thinking about a collaborative mission to do it, called Sample Retrieval Lander, to take the samples back about the year 2033.

However, there's something that makes it difficult: U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning major cuts to NASA's budget, which could delay or even cancel the mission entirely. On Earth, scientists could:

All of this could finally answer whether the possible biosignatures (signs of life) found on Mars are biological or purely geological.

For now, NASA scientists are excited but cautious. The new data might be the strongest clue yet that Mars once hosted life — but it's not proof.

Until then, Perseverance continues to explore, sending back images and data from the Martian surface. Every rock it studies brings us one step closer to understanding whether the red planet was once alive.

The question that has fascinated humans for centuries — “Are we alone?” — might finally have an answer buried in the dust of Mars.

Voyager 1 carries the Golden Record, which contains evidence of human life. It is meant to reveal everything about Earth to another civilisation that might exist in the universe. What if they find it after we are long gone?

Voyager 1 has been drifting in space for nearly 50 years. Launched in 1977, it was meant to study the outer planets in the solar system. However, it has outlived its expected lifespan and is now floating in interstellar space, having moved beyond the heliopause in 2012. 

At 25 billion kilometres, it is the most distant man-made object in the universe. It revealed new details about Jupiter and Saturn, and also discovered new moons and rings for both planets. Voyager 1 continues to send back data from deep space and will reach one light day in November 2026 - a point light takes one day to reach from our planet.

Voyager 1 is carrying a "Golden Record", filled with messages and images from humans and of other things that exist on Earth. The idea is to let any extraterrestrial life that encounters Voyager to know about Earth and the kind of life and objects that live here. In 1977, it was added to the spacecraft with the assumption that anyone who finds it might want to contact humans.

The record comes with instructions on how to play it and how to locate Earth's position in the universe. But this would only help if Earth were still in its current state, with humans still around. But what if the contact happens after Earth is long gone, or it is still here, but life as we know it today no longer exists?

In the event Voyager 1 and the Golden Record come across alien life after we are no longer here, it becomes a time capsule. With human voices and other sounds, it will be the only surviving proof of life on Earth that once was. 

This would be a scenario similar to Mars, except in this case, another civilisation would also be sure that life once flourished on Earth. With the Red Planet, we are still trying to figure out whether that was the case or not. Several evidence have been discovered that hint that Mars had life once upon a time.

Voyager 1 and the messages in it will become a memorial, a record of Earth's past. The probe would likely remain the only “living” thing still carrying a record of humanity when everyone is gone.

Carl Sagan noted that the "spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if there are advanced spacefaring civilisations in interstellar space." However, the biggest takeaway would be that if Earthlings could launch "this bottle into the cosmic ocean", it says "something very hopeful about life on this planet."
